And sometime earlier in this new year, it's expected to land on the Moon's far side, the side we never see from Earth. It is a Chinese probe. And as NPR's Joe Palca explains, although it's essentially a scientific mission, it's also laying the groundwork for sending Chinese astronauts to the moon. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: It only makes sense to send machines to the moon before trying to send humans. JIM HEAD: Before Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon, the United States sent 21 robotic missions to the moon to prepare the way. PALCA: Jim Head is a planetary scientist at Brown University. He says he's convinced the Chinese are doing the same thing. HEAD: The robotic program is providing all the kinds of background that you would need for building space suits and things like that, like lunar rovers. So they're building towards human exploration, for sure. PALCA: That's not to say there won't be interesting science to come from the mission. Briony Horgan is a planetary scientist at Purdue University. BRIONY HORGAN: This mission is really exciting because it's the first time any space agency will have landed on the far side of the moon. PALCA: Horgan says scientists know the far and near sides are very different. HORGAN: The far side is actually much more primitive. It contains really ancient crust that dates back to the very, very early solar system. There's rocks all over the far side that are over 4 billion years old. And now we're really excited to see what those look like up close. PALCA: Now, it may seem odd that, with so much to explore on the far side, all the landing probes to date have gone to the near side. HORGAN: That's mostly because it's a lot easier to communicate with, right? I mean, we can actually see the near side. And so we get direct radio communication with the entire near side of the moon. PALCA: Horgan says the Chinese have solved that problem by adding a third component to the mission. The first component is a lander. The lander carries the second component, a mobile rover. HORGAN: And then the third component is a satellite that's going to stay in orbit above the far side of the moon and act as a relay between the Earth and the far side of the moon. PALCA: It might be handy if U. S. lunar missions could also use the relay satellite. But that's not likely. Official collaboration between NASA and the Chinese space program is essentially prohibited by law. There are also restrictions on exporting U. S. space technology to China. But Brown University's Jim Head says some amount of collaboration just makes sense. HEAD: Why would we send a spacecraft to the same location to do exactly the same thing when we can optimize the amount of scientific return for the United States and for other countries by collaborating as best we can? PALCA: And while China may not be as forthcoming as NASA about what their civilian space program is up to, Head says they're not completely opaque, either. HEAD: If you talk to the right people, they are not holding things back. There are security issues there from their point of view, as well as ours. But nonetheless, they've been very forthcoming with their civilian space program. PALCA: The United States has its own lunar ambitions. The Trump administration has asked NASA to focus on returning humans to the moon. It's just possible there will already be Chinese astronauts there when they arrive. Joe Palca, NPR News.

That is a big problem. But maybe the problem is not the kids themselves. The way that children are usually taught how to read does not line up with decades of evidence on how they actually learn to read. One school district figured out how wrong it was about reading and made some changes. Emily Hanford of APM Reports has the story. LYNN VENABLE: All right. So we're going to start doing something today that we have not done before. This is brand. . . LYNN VENABLE AND UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: . . . Spanking new. EMILY HANFORD, BYLINE: We're in Bethlehem, Pa. , where six kindergartners are meeting with their teacher at a small, U-shaped table. They're doing what kindergartners do these days - learning how to read and write. VENABLE: So let's read it together. What's it say? VENABLE AND CHILDREN: My pet report. VENABLE: Wonderful. HANFORD: The children are writing a report about a pet they want. They have to write down three things that pet can do. A little boy named Quinn spells bark B-O-C - boc (ph). He needs some help discerning all the speech sounds in that word. VENABLE: What's the first sound? QUINN: Buh (ph). VENABLE: Buh - we got that one. That's B. Now what's the next sound? HANFORD: Quinn knows the meaning of the word bark. What he needs to learn is how each sound in that word is represented by letters. VENABLE: How do you make the sound arr (ph)? Arr? QUINN: Arr. VENABLE: Arr. How do you write arr? Do you remember? Tell me. HANFORD: Scientists have figured out the key to learning how to read is understanding the relationship between the sounds in words and the letters that represent those sounds. Might sound obvious, but it's not how kids in Bethlehem were being taught a few years ago. How were they being taught? District leaders didn't actually know. So they asked Kim Harper, their new supervisor of literacy, to find out. She visited teachers at one of the district's lowest-performing elementary schools. KIM HARPER: And they were talking about how kids attack words in a story. HANFORD: When a child came to a word she didn't know, the teacher would tell her to look at the picture and guess. The most important thing was for the child to understand the meaning of the story. So if the kid came to the word horse. . . HARPER: And the kid reads it as house, it's wrong. But if the kid said pony, it'd be right because pony and horse mean the same thing. HANFORD: Wait, what? First of all, pony and horse don't mean the same thing. And what does a kid do when there aren't any pictures? This advice to a beginning reader is based on an influential theory about reading. The theory basically says people use things like context and visual clues to read words. The theory assumes that learning to read is a natural process and that, with enough exposure to text, kids will eventually figure out how words work. Scientists have debunked this theory, but it continues to drive typical instruction in many schools. Something else that's typical? A lot of struggling readers. In Bethlehem, fewer than 60 percent of third graders were scoring proficient on the state reading test. Jack Silva, the chief academic officer, wanted to do something about that. JACK SILVA: It was really, you know, looking yourself in the mirror and saying, you know, less than 60 percent of third graders. And me being the chief academic officer, was just, OK, let's go. Let's do something differently. HANFORD: Silva started reading the scientific research on reading. It's been around for decades, but it's not stuff he'd been taught in his own preparation to be a teacher. And he soon realized the teachers in Bethlehem didn't know the science either. So the district invested in education for its educators. MARY DOE DONECKER: Good morning, everyone. HANFORD: A group of mostly first- and second-grade teachers is gathered in a conference room for a class on the science of reading. It's part of a year-long series of classes led by a consultant named Mary Doe Donecker. She begins today by going over speech sounds in words. Some are tricky. DONECKER: Tell me the first sound you hear in Eunice. UNIDENTIFIED TEACHERS: Yoo (ph). DONECKER: Yuh (ph), before you get to the ooh (ph). How about Charlotte? UNIDENTIFIED TEACHERS: Shh (ph). HANFORD: Teachers need a deep understanding of how sounds work in words to be able to help kids figure out the written code. Candy Maldonado thought she was teaching kids what they needed to know. In her first-grade classroom, it pretty much went like this. CANDY MALDONADO: So like, we did, like, a letter a week. So if the letter was A, we read books about A. We ate things with A. We found things with A. And then - but we never did anything else with it. HANFORD: She didn't think getting into the details of how words are made up of sounds mattered that much. The most important thing for the teachers here was to get kids excited about reading. I asked Maldonado and her colleague Adrienne Ibarra, when they were teaching that way, what was the idea about how children learn to read? Did you have a sense of that? ADRIENNE IBARRA: No. Now that I think about it, no, not really. It was just that they do. MALDONADO: (Laughter) Almost like it's automatic. IBARRA: Yeah. HANFORD: Of course, some children do pick up reading quickly and easily. But learning to read is not automatic. Many kids will never be good readers unless they get explicit instruction. Lynn Venable, the kindergarten teacher you heard earlier, sees that now. Before teachers at her school were taught the reading science, end-of-year tests showed that 65 percent of kindergartners were heading into first grade at risk of reading failure - 65 percent. After teachers learned the science, it was zero. VENABLE: My kids are successful and happy and believe in themselves. I don't have a single child in my room that has that look on their face like, I can't do this. HANFORD: For NPR News, I'm Emily Hanford. INSKEEP: Her story is from a documentary about why kids aren't being taught to read. It's called \"Hard Words,\" and you can find a link at npr. org.

NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports scientists are now using a powerful technology to discover the kinds of cells that weren't previously recognized, and their goal is to build an atlas of every cell in the human body. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: At the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Boston, I watch a researcher named Julia Waldman consider some bits of what looks like orange Styrofoam. It's skin - frozen, human skin. She selects one of them. JULIA WALDMAN: I'll put the rest back so we can freeze them and save them for later. GREENFIELDBOYCE: I don't think I've ever seen frozen skin before. I bet you've. . . WALDMAN: (Laughter) Most people haven't. GREENFIELDBOYCE: I bet you've seen a lot of frozen things. WALDMAN: I have. I have seen many frozen tissues. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And fresh tissue samples, too, from human brains, lungs, kidneys, prostates, livers, the gut, fat. They were sent here by clinicians and other researchers because this lab is part of an international effort to look at all these tissues in a radical new way. Waldman kind of crushes the skin in a test tube filled with a chemical solution. WALDMAN: You can see it's getting cloudy, so the tissue is starting to break up. GREENFIELDBOYCE: After some more processing to strip away the cell membranes, she's left with nothing but cell nuclei, the control center of each cell. She counts them under a microscope. WALDMAN: So we have roughly 500,000 nuclei per milliliter, which is great. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She puts thousands of them into a special device. It encases each cell nucleus in a separate droplet of oil along with a tiny bead of gel that has a unique barcode. When these droplets get run through a machine, the contents of each individual cell nucleus can be analyzed separately, thousands of them all at once. AVIV REGEV: Whereas before, you know, with very hard work, one person could process a handful. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Aviv Regev runs this lab. She says, this kind of technology to probe individual cells has only been available in the last few years. She says, every cell in the body basically has the same DNA, the same set of genetic instructions. REGEV: But every cell reads only a portion of these instructions. And that's why the cells in our liver are different from the cells in our brain and are different from the cells in our skin and so on. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Now scientists can easily find out what genetic instructions each cell is following, and they can do this on a massive scale. Already, millions of individual cells have been analyzed, and new types of cells have been found in, for example, the lining of the windpipe. Regev and some of her colleagues plan to catalogue every single cell type in the human body. They call it the Human Cell Atlas. REGEV: We don't need to analyze every individual cell out of 37 trillion because the cells kind of repeat themselves. All we need to do is sample enough of them from enough region in order to get comprehensive coverage. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The effort started a couple years ago, and it will take years to complete. But the payoff could be huge with new insights into all kinds of diseases. Sarah Teichmann is head of cellular genetics at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge, England. She's one of the leaders of the Human Cell Atlas, and she and her colleagues recently took a close look at kidney cancer. They analyzed 72,000 cells from healthy and cancerous human kidneys. SARAH TEICHMANN: And so that was really exciting, both in terms of the basic understanding of the kidney cells but also for the cancer community in terms of understanding where these tumor cells come from. GREENFIELDBOYCE: A child who had kidney cancer, for example, seemed to come from aberrant fetal cells while some adult cancers came from a different, little-studied subset of cells. TEICHMANN: I mean, the methods are just so powerful. It really is mind-boggling, incredibly exciting and, you know, I need to pinch myself sometimes. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says the human body contains more than 50 different tissues. Some get a lot of attention, like the brain. Others are kind of ignored. TEICHMANN: There are some that you probably haven't even heard of, you know, funny stuff like omentum. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That's a sheet of fatty tissue that wraps around the intestines. The Human Cell Atlas wants to get everything from that to the inner ear. The whole plan staggers folks who study cells and tissues in more traditional ways, like with microscopes and stained slides. Rosy Jurjus is an associate professor of anatomy and cell biology at George Washington University. She recently attended a workshop for folks who are mapping the human body at the cellular level. ROSY JURJUS: And I remember actually being very excited all through the workshop because it's groundbreaking. It's new, and it's the future. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Meanwhile, researchers have been building complete cell atlases of creatures that are commonly studied in the lab to give insights on human biology. They've already finished one for a famous laboratory worm, C. elegans. Unlike humans, it has hundreds rather than trillions of cells. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

S. are on the rise. That's according to a new report out today. NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has more on what it could mean for the planet. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Here's the upside of an economic downturn. Greenhouse gas emissions also go down. Factories are using less electricity. There are fewer trucks and planes shipping goods and people. And that's exactly what happened after the financial crisis of 2008. Carbon dioxide emissions plummeted. They've been bouncing up and down since then, but last year, the economy was on a roll. Output was up. And now an estimate by the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm, shows that CO2 emissions were way up. TREVOR HOUSER: It appears based on preliminary data that emissions in the U. S. grew by the highest rate since 2010 when we were recovering from the Great Recession. BRUMFIEL: Trevor Houser is an author on the new estimate. He says carbon dioxide emissions are up roughly 3. 4 percent over last year. The big drivers were increases in electricity demand, which burns natural gas and coal, and big growth in trucking and aviation. HOUSER: All those Amazon packages, all those holiday vacations. . . BRUMFIEL: That come with a booming economy. Now, there were some areas where decisions by government and industry made a difference. A record number of coal-fired power plants closed in 2018, and emissions from passenger automobiles dropped slightly due to better fuel economy standards. But it was not enough, and Houser wants more aggressive policies to drive down CO2. That seems unlikely for now. Policies to limit greenhouse gas emissions started under the Obama administration are now being halted and even reversed under President Trump. HOUSER: What we've seen is backsliding in federal policy, and we're starting to feel the effects of that now. BRUMFIEL: So is Houser rooting for another recession to bring emissions down again? HOUSER: I (laughter) - I am not. I am not. Over the long term, short-term emissions decline as a result of a recession is not something anyone's cheering for.

Now a volunteer group is applying it in a different way. They are using DNA and genealogy to help identify unknown crime victims, so-called John and Jane Does. From member station WBOI in Fort Wayne, Ind. , Barb Anguiano reports. BARBARA ANGUIANO, BYLINE: In 1988, John Miller murdered 8-year-old April Tinsley in Fort Wayne, Ind. Police at the scene recovered DNA samples, but they weren't able to do much with them back then. Fast-forward to last spring when Fort Wayne investigators were finally able to process the collected DNA samples from a 30-year-old crime scene and find genetic matches to two brothers living near Fort Wayne. After an exact DNA match, they arrested and charged John Miller, who was convicted in December and is now serving an 80-year prison sentence. The technology that helped them find Miller is being used by genealogists to identify crime victims across the country. Margaret Press helped set up the group DNA Doe Project. She says her motivation came from helping adoptees find their birth parents. MARGARET PRESS: Because in both cases, the parents are not known or anything about the ancestry, and once you know the parents, you can figure out where the Doe fits in the tree. ANGUIANO: Last year, her group helped police in Ohio identify Marcia Sossoman King, whose remains were found in a ditch nearly 40 years ago. PRESS: You really need to look at all the ancestors and all the cousins in order to narrow down on the actual person. ANGUIANO: Working with law enforcement, DNA Doe was able to locate one of King's first cousins using a public database called GEDmatch. That's where people upload their DNA information in hopes of extending their family trees. Here's how it works. When you buy a DNA test kit like 23andMe or Ancestry, the companies also allow you to download your genetic code, which you can then upload to GEDmatch. GEDmatch gathers data from lots of DNA websites. Press says access to private databases like 23andMe or Ancestry would make the search process much quicker. But private databases are closed to law enforcement. Mark McKenna practices privacy law and teaches at the University of Notre Dame. He says those restrictions make sense. MARK MCKENNA: On the one hand, you get this kind of information that has a lot of potentially positive uses, right? It lets you solve crimes. But there's always - there are dark sides to all of these things. And, you know, so most people who work in the privacy area would say there are questions about, like, how do you collect the data in the first place? ANGUIANO: McKenna says right now, people are enthralled with how easy this is to do. And searching databases is increasingly common for hints into the lives of John and Jane Does. So far, the group has helped identify six people that are among the thousands that go missing each year. In Steuben County, Ind. , not far from the Tinsley and King cases, detective Chris Emerick is heading an investigation to find the identity of a Jane Doe found in 1999. CHRIS EMERICK: We get really hopeful. We're hoping, hey, maybe we finally identified her. Maybe we can finally put this case to rest and give the family closure. ANGUIANO: Emerick says his motivation comes from the thought that if she was his relative, he'd want to know what happened to her. For NPR News, I'm Barb Anguiano in Fort Wayne.

ALEX WEBER: My dad - he raised me underwater. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Alex Weber is a free diver. She just holds her breath. In 2016 near Carmel, Calif. , she and her father were diving in the Pacific just offshore from a golf course. She looks down and saw something weird. WEBER: You couldn't see the sand. It was completely white. JOYCE: Golf balls. WEBER: You look down, and you're like, what are you doing here? JOYCE: Thousands of golf balls. WEBER: It felt like a shot to the heart. JOYCE: She was offended. She decided she'd haul them up. She put them in her family's garage. WEBER: I had all of these golf balls in my garage, and they stunk. And I had no idea why. JOYCE: Then she heard about a scientist who studied plastic waste in the ocean. His name was Matt Savoca from Stanford University. She emailed him. He came to look at her collection.

JOYCE: He said he'd help. That meant diving with her - not easy. MATT SAVOCA: The oceans off California are actually quite cold, and so you suit up in a pretty thick wet suit. It's incredibly physically demanding. JOYCE: They took kayaks out to ferry the golf balls back. WEBER: We'll have the kayaks so filled with plastic that we'll end up just having to tow the kayaks back, and we'll have to swim it to shore. SAVOCA: While we were out there, we would hear plink, plink, and then we'd look up on the hill, and there would be golf balls flying in off the course right into the ocean where we were doing some collections actually. WEBER: Whenever we have good conditions, we're able to pull out between about, like, 500 to 5,000 golf balls. JOYCE: Over two years, they found more than 50,000 golf balls. The source - five golf courses. Three were up the Carmel River. The golf balls just rolled under water down to the ocean.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our goal is simple - to ensure that we can detect and destroy any missile launched against the United States anywhere, anytime, anyplace. SHAPIRO: Joining us to discuss how the president plans to meet this goal is NPR's Geoff Brumfiel. Hi, Geoff. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Hi there. SHAPIRO: So I guess the first question is, who is the U. S. defending itself against? What is the specific threat here? BRUMFIEL: Well, the names are pretty familiar. There's Iran and North Korea. North Korea is still considered an extraordinary threat according to this report despite the recent overtures towards peace by the Trump administration. But then also, notably, this report explicitly calls out Russia and China. And this is really a bit of a change. Russia and China have sort of - U. S. officials have shied away from naming them as threats in previous reports. SHAPIRO: Russia and China have lots of missiles obviously, so why weren't they already part of the strategy before now? BRUMFIEL: Well, the problem with defending against their missiles with missile defense is they have so many. They could overwhelm the system. And so basically previous administrations haven't wanted to aggravate Russia and China. They haven't wanted to sort of provoke them. So they've always said this missile defense is about places like Iran and North Korea. Russia and China - we counter with all our missiles. If they fire at us, we'll fire at them. So, you know, that's sort of been the traditional way we talk about this. And this report still does some of that, but here's the thing. Russia and China have also been developing missiles to specifically counter U. S. missile defenses. So these are things like hypersonic weapons that can travel over five times the speed of sound. And Russia has a design for a nuclear-powered cruise missile with infinite range, which is kind of a crazy thing. But they are working on it. And so now Trump said today that the U. S. would invest directly in countering these new systems. Critics worry this looks a lot like an arms race. SHAPIRO: Yeah. Those weapons sound potentially terrifying. What exactly is the U. S. calling for to counter that? BRUMFIEL: Well, initially it's all pretty modest and kind of keeping with the normal line. They call for 20 new interceptor missiles at a base in Fort Greely, Alaska. It also calls for a new system to track missiles in space or from space using satellites. Further down the line, there's more advanced stuff, things like lasers to shoot down missiles. And it sort of sounds a bit more like Ronald Reagan's Star Wars program from back in the 1980s. SHAPIRO: Missile defense has had a spotty track record in the U. S. To make all of this stuff and make all of it work, what - how many billions of dollars are we talking about here? BRUMFIEL: There's not really a good estimate for what we're talking about today. The lasers and stuff is all R&D, so it's hard to know. SHAPIRO: Well, what does Trump say about how this will be paid for? BRUMFIEL: Trump has a great sort of Trumpian response to this. He suggests our allies might pay for it. Here he was earlier today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: We protect all of these wealthy countries, which I'm very honored to do. But many of them are so wealthy. They can easily pay us the cost of this protection. BRUMFIEL: But the truth is that really it's going to be the Congress who has to pony up for this, and that may be difficult with Democrats in the House. They're longtime skeptics of missile defense. SHAPIRO: NPR's Geoff Brumfiel, thanks a lot. BRUMFIEL: Thank you so much. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  President Trump was at the Pentagon today to unveil his administration's new strategy for missile defense. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our goal is simple - to ensure that we can detect and destroy any missile launched against the United States anywhere, anytime, anyplace. SHAPIRO: Joining us to discuss how the president plans to meet this goal is NPR's Geoff Brumfiel. Hi, Geoff. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Hi there. SHAPIRO: So I guess the first question is, who is the U. S. defending itself against? What is the specific threat here? BRUMFIEL: Well, the names are pretty familiar. There's Iran and North Korea. North Korea is still considered an extraordinary threat according to this report despite the recent overtures towards peace by the Trump administration. But then also, notably, this report explicitly calls out Russia and China. And this is really a bit of a change. Russia and China have sort of - U. S. officials have shied away from naming them as threats in previous reports. SHAPIRO: Russia and China have lots of missiles obviously, so why weren't they already part of the strategy before now? BRUMFIEL: Well, the problem with defending against their missiles with missile defense is they have so many. They could overwhelm the system. And so basically previous administrations haven't wanted to aggravate Russia and China. They haven't wanted to sort of provoke them. So they've always said this missile defense is about places like Iran and North Korea. Russia and China - we counter with all our missiles. If they fire at us, we'll fire at them. So, you know, that's sort of been the traditional way we talk about this. And this report still does some of that, but here's the thing. Russia and China have also been developing missiles to specifically counter U. S. missile defenses. So these are things like hypersonic weapons that can travel over five times the speed of sound. And Russia has a design for a nuclear-powered cruise missile with infinite range, which is kind of a crazy thing. But they are working on it. And so now Trump said today that the U.

But needless to say, the weather has continued. There's a bit of extra snow on the ground here in Washington. Rain is sweeping through the West. And emergency workers in many places need information from the government to respond. NPR's Rebecca Hersher reports the weather does not care that the government is shut down. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: On Wednesday, Christopher Berry was at his office in Santa Cruz, Calif. , worrying about the rain. CHRISTOPHER BERRY: We have a storm event predicted to start, literally, in a matter of hours here, where we're going to get six plus inches of rain. HERSHER: Berry is the watershed manager for Santa Cruz. And when it rains a lot, one of his jobs is to figure out whether the river that flows through the city will flood. To do that, he relies on stream gauges that tell him how much water is flowing down the river. BERRY: We use stream-gauging data on a moment-by-moment basis. HERSHER: The most important gauges for Santa Cruz are managed by the U. S. Geological Survey. But the USGS is shut down, which means the gauges aren't being calibrated. Berry can't trust that gauge measurements are accurate. BERRY: So we know that we could have better data if the USGS staff were out in the field. HERSHER: Which is why Barry was worried on Wednesday - he was trying to help the city plan for a rainstorm. But he couldn't trust the information he was getting, which is frustrating and scary. Across the country, the National Weather Service is fielding phone calls from nervous local officials like Berry. Unlike the USGS, the National Weather Service is still open during the shutdown to make sure we all - regular citizens, emergency managers, airline pilots - have accurate weather forecasts. RAY MARTIN: Yeah, we are always here 24/7, 365. HERSHER: Ray Martin is the lead forecaster in the Sterling, Va. , office. He's also the office's union steward. And he says his workdays are pretty normal with one exception. MARTIN: I can't tell you how many times in the office I've heard the comment, you know, just going to work again like usual but not getting paid, you know (laughter). HERSHER: Working for the weather service often requires working for many hours or days on end. Ray worked 13 days straight around Christmas without pay. And storms like the back-to-back snowstorms that have hit the Midwest and East Coast only add to the workload. The phones ring off the hooks during bad weather. Alicia Miller is a hydrologist and union steward in the Pittsburgh office. ALICIA MILLER: I do have two children. And it's very hard to explain to a daycare that I'm working and they have to watch my children, but I'm not going to be able to pay them. HERSHER: For now, Miller has been cutting back on other expenses so she can afford to pay. How much longer can you go on? MILLER: Not - realistically, not much longer. A month more would be very painful for me. HERSHER: And the longer the shutdown goes on, the greater the risk for people like Chris Berry back in Santa Cruz, who are operating without important federal data. I called him back the morning after the rainstorm. BERRY: I would say we basically got lucky. HERSHER: The river didn't flood this time. But if there's another rainstorm before the government reopens, he says, the risk of unexpected flooding will be even higher. Rebecca Hersher, NPR News.

Pamela Gay, welcome to the program. PAMELA GAY: Well, thank you so much for having me. BLOCK: So a super wolf blood moon. Let's break that down into its individual parts - first, the supermoon part. GAY: The supermoon just means the moon is closer than it is on other days during the month. As it goes around the Earth, sometimes, the moon's a little bit closer. Sometimes, it's a little bit further. And when it's a supermoon, it's at its closest point. It appears 14 percent larger than when it's furthest away. And this closeness makes it 30 percent brighter when it's full like it is this month. BLOCK: OK. So this will be a supermoon, also, a wolf moon. GAY: That is less interesting. We get a wolf moon every single January. It's just what we call the full moon of January. BLOCK: OK. So supermoon, wolf moon and, also, tonight a blood moon. GAY: Yes. With an eclipse, our moon passes into the Earth's shadow, which is something it doesn't do every single orbit. Usually, it's above the shadow, below the shadow, and we see a full moon. When that full moon, instead, passes through the Earth's shadow, it doesn't go completely dark. Instead, light from the sun gets bent around the Earth. It gets refracted around by our own atmosphere. And that atmosphere tends to scatter out a lot of the blue light leaving the red light to give us this blood red moon for the same reasons that our sunset is red. BLOCK: Wow. It sounds incredible, and it will be visible if - assuming the skies are clear, visible all across the United States. GAY: All across North and South America. It is really one of those great shared experiences for everyone on our hemisphere. BLOCK: When are people going to be able to see the super wolf blood moon tonight? GAY: So the very first moments of the eclipse are going to be at 10:10 p. m. Eastern Time. Totality will start at 11:41 p. m. Eastern with the middle of totality being at 12:12 a. m. as we go into Monday. BLOCK: That's astronomer Pamela Gay of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson. She hosts the Astronomy Cast podcast. Thanks so much for talking to us. GAY: My pleasure.

Chinese state media reported today that a government investigation has found that He Jiankui seriously violated state regulations. And today, his university released a statement saying he'd been fired. Scientists around the world have condemned his work, with many saying his experiment was reckless and crossed ethical boundaries. For more, we're joined by Marilynn Marchione. She is chief medical writer for The Associated Press. She was among the first to report this story and has been following developments. Marilynn, welcome to the program. MARILYNN MARCHIONE: Hi. Thanks very much. CORNISH: So first, what do you make of today's announcement from Chinese authorities that this scientist broke the rules? MARCHIONE: Well, I think it's clear that - from the world's reaction to his work that he violated some societal norms for what he did. But what was significant to us, and a bit of a surprise, was that the report appears to give credence to the fact that these babies actually do exist. There's been a lot of doubt because the work has not been published. The couple - the supposed parents of these babies was not able to be interviewed. So we have been wondering and looking for proof that this really, indeed, occurred, and the investigation appears to have confirmed that. CORNISH: So help us understand. Is it clear what state regulations he's accused of violating? MARCHIONE: Well, it is very unclear whether it's state or federal or just exactly what rules or regulations there are. The ones that we have looked at and that others have flagged to us seem to have been adopted around the time when human cloning was more in the news and that was a big concern and risk. We're not aware of anything that directly addresses embryo gene-editing, which is what this was. CORNISH: In the meantime, he hasn't been out in public since he presented his work, right? And that was at a conference in Hong Kong two months ago. Does anyone know what's happened to him? MARCHIONE: Well, I spoke just this morning with a Stanford bioethicist who has been in almost weekly contact with Dr. He ever since the conference. And he says that the guards at the apartment and the university where Dr. He is living are there out of mutual agreement, that there have been nasty emails, and there were some efforts - many efforts to contact Dr. He. CORNISH: So it's a kind of house-arrest story. What are we talking about here? MARCHIONE: It sounds like that. It's really hard to describe because his own university has not responded to inquiries. There are others who have investigations under the way - his university in Shenzhen. Also, the Chinese Ministry of Science and Health, I believe, still got an investigation open. This is a local province - the local authorities, who have issued the first statement on this. CORNISH: When this story was first reported, there was a kind of conversation about whether or not laws in China around this kind of research were somehow more lax than in other parts of the world. What does this response that we're hearing in Chinese media tell us, if anything, about how the Chinese government views all this? MARCHIONE: Well, I spoke this morning with Alta Charo, who is a very prominent bioethicist from the University of Wisconsin. And she said this morning that the statement from the investigation actually was quite reassuring - that it suggests that there is a system of regulatory controls in China that can be brought to bear on any effort to prematurely use gene-editing technology and that that might be a better way to regulate this field than an outright ban. CORNISH: What happens to the babies now? And what happens - I believe there was a report that there was a woman who participated who is now pregnant. MARCHIONE: Well, that's something that was kind of a revelation, again, in the report that we had today from the local authorities. They say that the twins will be followed by Chinese government authorities, health authorities and that the second pregnancy, also, will be monitored and followed. So this confirms both things that Dr. He has reported. It's unknown how many embryos are left. He did make more than what had been reported to have been used, and it's unclear where they are now or what will happen to them.

GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's the host, Sahana Srinivasan. And she joins us now. Welcome. SRINIVASAN: Hi. Thanks for having me. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Hi. So you're in school. You're in university. SRINIVASAN: Yes, ma'am. So I'll be graduating in May from UT. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's really exciting. What are you studying? SRINIVASAN: I'm studying film - Radio Television Film. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Fantastic. OK. So I guess, as we know, getting young girls interested in STEM is vital to getting women working in STEM. And seeing a young woman like yourself talking science seems like it was deliberate. They wanted to sort of encourage that in young girls. SRINIVASAN: Yeah, exactly. A lot of people compare the show to, like, \"Bill Nye\" or \"Beakman's World,\" \"Adam Ruins Everything. \" And all of those include a male host. So when we see that, it could be discouraging for young girls who are very interested in going into STEM fields or STEAM, which incorporates art into engineering and science. GARCIA-NAVARRO: I've heard you get a lot of mail from young fans. What do they say? SRINIVASAN: Oh, yeah. It's so sweet when I get mail or messages. They talk to me about stuff like seeing a woman talk to you about science and stuff is very encouraging for young girls. And they message me about that. And then I also have women of color - Indian young girls who tell me that they're interested in going into acting. And this is inspirational for them. Yeah. It's really cool to hear about that. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, needless to say, I came across this because I've got a 6-year-old daughter who absolutely loves you. And she was so excited that I was going to talk to you. And she asked me to send you a message. Here it is. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: I love how you say it. And I watch \"Brainchild\" every day.

GARCIA-NAVARRO: Let's hope she sticks with it. SRINIVASAN: . . . Do it. Yeah. GARCIA-NAVARRO: (Laughter). SRINIVASAN: I think she can do it so. . . GARCIA-NAVARRO: So you've said, actually, people interested in science are diverse. What they see on television is not. SRINIVASAN: Yeah. If you're in a room and you look around, it's so colorful. It's so diverse. And if you look on a screen and you see a group of friends, and they're all the same, that's surprising. It's more surprising, you know, to see that than to see a woman of color hosting a science show. You know, at first you think, oh, that's rare, like, I haven't seen that, you know. But I think the other is actually more startling because it's totally not how it is in real life. GARCIA-NAVARRO: You're from Texas. And science nowadays has been under assault. In Texas, the state Board of Education has voted to allow textbooks to have language doubting evolution. What does this show do about showing young people how the world works? SRINIVASAN: Yeah. So I think what \"Brainchild\" does really well is explore topics that may not be discussed in school traditionally. For example, our first episode is social media. I feel like we do it in sort of an entertaining and fun way, which really is engaging for kids to see. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Sahana Srinivasan, the host of \"Brainchild\" on Netflix, thank you so much.

The public reaction helped to shape the modern environmental movement. It also led to restrictions on offshore drilling, restrictions the Trump administration is trying to roll back. Here's NPR's Jon Hamilton. JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: The disaster started here, about 6 miles from shore. DOUGLAS MCCAULEY: You can see behind us here Platform A, the sign right there on the rig. HAMILTON: I'm on a boat with Douglas McCauley, a marine biologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. We're circling the oil rig known as Platform A. McCauley says back in 1969, it was owned by Union Oil, and workers were drilling a new well. MCCAULEY: And then, 10:45 a. m. January 28, they ran into a problem. HAMILTON: The drill hit a pocket of gas and oil under enormous pressure. The result - a blowout. McCauley says crude oil and natural gas began rocketing to the surface. MCCAULEY: So they're taking these big drilling pipes and shoving them back down the hole and then these gigantic steel blocks on top of that to seal off this blowout. HAMILTON: It worked, briefly. MCCAULEY: They had capped off the blowout successfully, but they created so much pressure at the bottom of this well that it actually broke open the seabed. HAMILTON: Oil and gas began to pour through five separate fissures. Eventually, that created an oil slick on the surface that was nearly the size of Chicago. It took a few days for the oil to reach the coast. Mark McGinnis, a lawyer, came down from San Francisco to take a look. MARK MCGINNIS: I smelled it long before I saw it. It really stank around here. And when I looked at the oil on the beach, I cried. HAMILTON: McGinnis left his job at a big law firm to help mount a legal response to the spill. He soon became a leader in the environmental movement. McGinnis says a few weeks after the blowout, President Richard Nixon arrived in a helicopter. MCGINNIS: (Imitating helicopter blades slapping). HAMILTON: McGinnis says Nixon surveyed the slick from the air, then visited an oil-soaked beach to show his concern. MCGINNIS: It was a matter of walking around gingerly to make sure that one's shoes - if you were the president wearing those shoes - didn't step in this stuff. HAMILTON: By this time, hundreds of oiled birds were arriving at the Santa Barbara Zoo. Nancy McToldridge, the zoo's director, says there was nowhere else for them to go. NANCY MCTOLDRIDGE: So the zoo closed its doors and concentrated its time and energy and - to taking in these oiled birds, treating them and then rehabbing them back out into the wild. HAMILTON: Most didn't make it. But photos of oil-coated gulls and grebes and brown pelicans got the public's attention, and Peter Alagona, a historian at UCSB, says 1969 marked a turning point for environmental activism. PETER ALAGONA: The Santa Barbara oil spill really helped to take an issue that was growing and really converting it into legislative action and a whole body of environmental law at the federal level and also at the state levels that we still have with us today. HAMILTON: The first Earth Day took place just over a year later. Then the Environmental Protection Agency was formed, and Congress passed the Clean Water Act. Alagona says it probably helped that Santa Barbara was home to a lot of wealthy Republicans who had helped elect Nixon. He says Nixon himself was no environmentalist. ALAGONA: But he realized, during a time when there were many other extremely controversial, divisive issues - like the Vietnam War, for instance - that as American public concern grew about damage to the environment - that this could potentially be a winning issue for him. HAMILTON: Today, Santa Barbara is much better prepared for an oil spill. There's a 46-foot fast response vessel in the harbor ready to deploy oil containment booms. And there's a statewide group called the Oiled Wildlife Care Network ready to help sickened animals. Julie Barnes is a veterinarian at the zoo. She says animal experts learned a lot from the 1969 spill here and even more from the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska in 1989 and the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico. JULIE BARNES: Many more animals survive now than they would have back in the '60s or '70s or even in the '80s. The care that we can find for them now is phenomenal compared to the care that would have been provided in, you know, those early years of oil spills. HAMILTON: Douglas McCauley says the greatest danger from oil these days probably isn't another spill. It's the climate change caused by burning all that oil. He says a year ago, Santa Barbara got a preview of what that might mean. It came in the form of a mudslide. MCCAULEY: Boulders and trees rushing through the community traveling at, like, 22 miles an hour down the street. It destroyed a hundred houses and killed 21 people. HAMILTON: McCauley says the mudslide was caused by the sort of extreme weather that accompanies global warming. MCCAULEY: I think of that as being the most insidious, the worst thing that the oil industry has done to our community. HAMILTON: McCauley says an end to offshore drilling could slow down climate change by reducing the supply of oil. But the Trump administration seems headed in the opposite direction. It's preparing a five-year plan to encourage offshore drilling in federally controlled waters, including those off the coast of Santa Barbara. Jon Hamilton, NPR News.

She's already made it onto the 2019 Forbes 30 Under 30 list for top young scientists, but she has not even made it to high school yet. She's 13. Her most famous invention so far - a mobile device that tests for lead in drinking water. Here's Colorado Public Radio's Michael Elizabeth Sakas. MICHAEL ELIZABETH SAKAS, BYLINE: Gitanjali Rao opens her closet door and shows off her game collection. GITANJALI RAO: So I'm slightly overly obsessed with board games, as you can probably see here. SAKAS: A dozen or so are stacked roughly in her closet. She says her favorite is Clue because she wins. And her favorite character - Professor Plum. RAO: He looks like somebody who would love science, and so I like him. SAKAS: Because Rao definitely loves science. There's a pennant flag from MIT hanging on her bedroom wall. Her dream is to go there to study genetics. There's a desk not far from her bed which she calls her lab. It's complete with a 3D printer, test tubes. RAO: And here's my inventor's notebook, which I love, a graduated cylinder. I've got a little box of lead (laughter). SAKAS: And there's the lead detection device she designed and named Tethys after the Greek goddess of clean water. It's a 3D-printed box about the size of a deck of cards. So how does it work? RAO: A carbon nanotube sensor detects the lead in the water and forms resistance. SAKAS: OK. What she's saying is carbon atoms link together in kind of a beehive shape and then become a tube. Lead sticks to the carbon ions which creates resistance. RAO: So I have a processor that measures the resistance and sends the data to a mobile phone once you connect over Bluetooth, and it gives you the status of the lead in your water. SAKAS: Rao got the idea after reading about the same technology used to detect hazardous gas in the air. RAO: And my immediate reaction was, why not use carbon nanotube sensors to detect the lead in waters? And that's a problem which I'd heard about three years ago during the Flint water crisis. SAKAS: As a 12-year-old, she was named America's Top Young Scientist by Discovery Education, and she landed an interview on \"The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon\" (ph). (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON\")JIMMY FALLON: When I was 12, I don't know what I was thinking. I was lip-syncing in my mirror in my bedroom. SAKAS: Rao says the fame helped her make friends at school when her family first moved to Colorado. Kids already knew who she was. RAO: Oh, you're that lead girl, right? I'm like, yeah, I'm that lead girl. And they're like, do you want to be friends? I'm like, yeah, sure. Let's do this. SAKAS: Now she's working to create a prototype of Tethys that could eventually be on the market, and she's getting help from scientists in the water industry. Rao stands at a whiteboard with Dr. Selene Hernandez Ruiz, a lab manager at Denver Water, Colorado's largest water utility. She's brainstorming with Rao on what they'll be working on that day. RAO: Right now, I'm looking at interference with other chemicals in water apart from lead. SAKAS: This partnership started when Hernandez Ruiz invited Rao to come work in the lab after Rao took a tour of Denver Water. RAO: I hooked on, and I was like, hey, I want space in your lab. Can I come here, like, every day? SAKAS: Hernandez Ruiz says she's thrilled to be helping a young woman of color foster a passion for science. SELENE HERNANDEZ RUIZ: So hopeful to see the current and next generation like Gitanjali going for it so strong - right? - with all the right tools, with really the desire to excel and test those boundaries. SAKAS: Rao hopes to get a prototype of her device out into the world in the next two years. In the meantime, she's filling up her inventors' notebook with new ideas.

I'm like, yeah, I'm that lead girl. And they're like, do you want to be friends? I'm like, yeah, sure. Let's do this. SAKAS: Now she's working to create a prototype of Tethys that could eventually be on the market, and she's getting help from scientists in the water industry. Rao stands at a whiteboard with Dr. Selene Hernandez Ruiz, a lab manager at Denver Water, Colorado's largest water utility. She's brainstorming with Rao on what they'll be working on that day. RAO: Right now, I'm looking at interference with other chemicals in water apart from lead. SAKAS: This partnership started when Hernandez Ruiz invited Rao to come work in the lab after Rao took a tour of Denver Water. RAO: I hooked on, and I was like, hey, I want space in your lab. Can I come here, like, every day? SAKAS: Hernandez Ruiz says she's thrilled to be helping a young woman of color foster a passion for science. SELENE HERNANDEZ RUIZ: So hopeful to see the current and next generation like Gitanjali going for it so strong - right? - with all the right tools, with really the desire to excel and test those boundaries. SAKAS: Rao hopes to get a prototype of her device out into the world in the next two years. In the meantime, she's filling up her inventors' notebook with new ideas.

A new study suggests the mountain is largely made from just dust and sand. To get the data for that conclusion, the researchers MacGyvered a navigation instrument on the NASA rover called Curiosity. NPR science correspondent Joe Palca has the story. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: How do you know what a planet is made of? Well, you can learn a lot about the geology of a planet by measuring subtle changes in its gravity. High-density rocks give us stronger gravity signal than low-density rocks. But to make gravity measurements, you usually have to have an instrument called a gravimeter. KEVIN LEWIS: And it kind of frustrated me that we didn't have a surface gravimeter on Mars. PALCA: Kevin Lewis is a planetary scientist at Johns Hopkins University and a member of the Curiosity rover science team. One day, Lewis started thinking about something that popped up regularly on the rover's daily activity schedule. LEWIS: Turns out every day we don't drive with the rover, there's this little five-minute activity called the SAPP-RIMU data collection activity. PALCA: The RIMU is a navigational device, and the SAPP-RIMU data activity tells engineers the rover's precise orientation on the planet's surface. Inside the RIMU are three accelerometers, and accelerometers measure acceleration - duh. You actually have accelerometers inside your smartphone that measure your movements. Anyway, thinking about these accelerometers in the RIMU, Kevin Lewis had a kind of epiphany. LEWIS: We don't have a gravimeter on the surface of Mars. But we have accelerometers, and gravity is just an acceleration. PALCA: You may not think of gravity that way. But you can, and scientists do. So by adjusting the way the data from the RIMU were handled, Lewis now had his gravimeter. And he knew just what he wanted to do with it - try to figure out how a 15,000-foot tall mountain could form in the middle of Gale crater, the crater Curiosity landed in. It's a question many scientists have puzzled over. MACKENZIE DAY: And there sort of have been two different schools of thought. PALCA: Mackenzie Day is a planetary scientist at UCLA. DAY: Craters are fundamentally big holes in the ground, so they're a really good place to accumulate things - to accumulate sediment, accumulate dust and sand. PALCA: Day says the question is, was Gale crater once filled to the rim with sediment, and then most of that material eroded away leaving behind what's now called Mount Sharp? DAY: Or is Mount Sharp something that developed in the middle of the crater as sort of a stacking of material in the crater center from winds coming down the sides of the crater rim? PALCA: Could blowing sand and dust really pack together to build a three-mile tall mountain? Possibly, although Kevin Lewis says it runs against our expectations. LEWIS: We don't normally see mountains just growing up as a haystack on the Earth. PALCA: If the haystack model is right, the rocks at the base of Mount Sharp wouldn't be very dense. And as he and his colleagues report in the journal Science. . . LEWIS: And what we found in this study is that the rocks are surprisingly low-density. PALCA: So the haystack theory may be right. Lewis says he plans to keep collecting data from his MacGyvered instrument as Curiosity climbs up Mount Sharp to see if the initial results hold up. Joe Palca, NPR News.

Those are the first two words of \"The Collected Schizophrenias,\" Esme Weijun Wang's part-memoir-part-scientific chronicle of her journey to her own diagnosis. She first noticed that her brain worked differently than others do, she says, when she was just 5 or 6 years old. And then. . . ESME WEIJUN WANG: Severe depression started when I was about 11. Depression that was diagnosed by a doctor probably happened when I was 15 or 16. Bipolar disorder was diagnosed by a psychiatrist when I was about 17 or 18. And then the schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, was diagnosed when I was in my late 20s. GARCIA-NAVARRO: I mean, that's a really difficult journey to get a diagnosis that you felt was right. WANG: It does typically take people a really long time to get diagnosed with their, quote, unquote, \"final diagnosis. \" And it's not unusual at all. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Can you define bipolar type schizoaffective disorder for us? I mean, how do you experience it? WANG: So I like to kind of jokingly say that it's like a marriage between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. So my first hallucination that I ever had was actually when I was in the shower in college. And I heard a voice very clearly say to me, I hate you. And it was so clear to me (laughter). And this is why I say that hallucinations really effectively kidnap the senses - because it's exactly like someone is standing next to you and saying this thing to you. And I started thinking, oh, is there something going on with the pipes, where I can hear maybe something on the floor below me, or maybe the floor above me? But it didn't really make sense to me physically. So I started thinking, maybe this is a hallucination. And then it kind of went off from there. I started hearing women screaming for help outside my bedroom window - again, to the point where it was so realistic that I actually called 911 when that happened for the first time. It took a couple of times for my mom to tell me to stop calling the police because she - I think she knew that this was not real. And then later, I started having delusions in which I was believing that my loved ones were replaced by doubles or replaced by robots. So it's been an interesting journey. GARCIA-NAVARRO: You're what you call and what others would call high-functioning, which means that, you know, as you describe it, you have a job. You have relationships. You are someone who functions in the world. And that gives you a sort of - there's a hierarchy - right? - in the psychiatric world, in which some people get treated in some ways, and others get treated in other ways. WANG: Yeah. And I feel like the phrase high-functioning is extremely tricky. The reason I use it is that I'm very aware of my own sense of self-stigma. I'm aware of how people have a lot of stigma toward other people who have the same diagnosis as I do but who may not, quote, unquote, \"function\" as well as I do. So even being able to tell my own story through this book is something that I'm aware gives me a lot of privilege. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah, this book is, in many ways, the story of the way the world treats people with mental illness. You make the point that society as a whole doesn't know what to do with the mentally ill. You write in the book, (reading) for those of us living with severe mental illness, the world is full of cages where we can be locked in. WANG: That is part of an essay called, \"On The Ward,\" about involuntary hospitalization. And my essay can be seen as quite negative about the laws about involuntary hospitalization. At the same time, I want to make it quite clear that I would hospitalize myself if I felt that the need were - were there. I don't think that any of the questions that I bring up in this book have answers that are really simple or have answers that are black and white. There are really more questions that are raised than the book even begins with. GARCIA-NAVARRO: One of the things that I got from reading the book is how you were examining how you had to be in the world and how you signaled certain things at different times. Partly because you worked in fashion, appearance is important to you. WANG: Yeah, I think a lot of what I talk about is the way that I move around in the world in a way that seems to be defensive. I talk about fashion as costuming or fashion as armor. I talk about the way I use Yale as a place that I had gone to school as a kind of defense. The title of that essay is \"Yale Will Not Save You\" because I do kind of use it as a way to defend against people believing that I'm not worth talking to or interacting with. There are all kinds of ways in which I feel that I'm starting off a couple of steps behind everybody else. And in order to move a few steps ahead, I, for example, put on red lipstick before I leave the house. And that may seem like an odd way to make up for suffering from delusions and hallucinations. But that is the way I do that. GARCIA-NAVARRO: I think red lipstick does a lot, I got to tell you. WANG: (Laughter). GARCIA-NAVARRO: Esme Weijun Wang.

NPR's Rob Schmitz reports. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: (Speaking Chinese). ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE: It was the autumn of 2017, in the days before China's Communist Party would meet to consolidate Xi Jinping's leadership. State broadcaster CCTV aired a series promoting China's achievements in science and technology. One was a profile of a Chinese scientist. He claimed to have invented a gene sequencing machine more advanced than those made in the West. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HE JIANKUI: (Speaking Chinese). SCHMITZ: \"Somebody said we shocked the world with our machine,\" a young man says with a proud smile. \"Yes, they're right. I did that. He Jiankui, that's me who did that. \" It wasn't the last time He Jiankui would shock the world. In November, as he walked across the stage to a podium in a packed Hong Kong conference hall, there was tepid, hesitant applause from an audience of his peers uncomfortable with what he was about to announce - that he had successfully edited the genes of twin girls to help them resist infection with the AIDS virus. This had never been done before, and it raised a bunch of red flags. What if this harmed other genes? And what if that damaged DNA passed on to future generations? And was it ethical to do this to babies who could never be willing participants in an experiment like this? Beijing seemed unprepared for the international backlash, and a government that had once celebrated him suddenly vowed to punish him. YANGYANG CHENG: I really hope that the outcome of this case doesn't conclude with punishment on an individual. SCHMITZ: Yangyang Cheng is a particle physicist at Cornell University. She says He conducted a reckless and unethical experiment that he should face consequences for, but. . . CHENG: There are structural, systematic and institutional flaws behind this experiment - what created him, what incentivized him, what failed to stop him. SCHMITZ: Cheng says He's case is a product of modern China. He Jiankui grew up in a family of modest means in one of the country's poorest regions. He was surrounded by the fastest-growing economy in history at a time when everyone was competing for a piece of the pie. CHENG: I think part of his motivation was that he wanted to do something that is world's-first and that could give him more name recognition, in the hopes that it will bring in more investments and also more future business opportunities for his companies. SCHMITZ: China's government promoted the same goals. It wanted Chinese companies and scientists to be the world's first and best in a range of technologies. And it encouraged them to acquire foreign technology to do it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HE: (Speaking Chinese). SCHMITZ: That CCTV segment featuring He talking about his gene sequencing machine, the technology He claimed as his own and which CCTV touted as China's own was actually from a machine created by a company founded by his American adviser at Stanford. When the company went bankrupt, He's adviser allowed him to license his technologies, says Cheng. CHENG: But regardless, this is still being seen as a Chinese company, a Chinese technology. And there is a lot of state-sponsored and government-pushed propaganda efforts behind it. SCHMITZ: And while Beijing's push for global dominance in technology pushed He Jiankui, the government's lax regulatory environment may have contributed to He's reckless gene-editing experiments on live humans, so says Shanghai-based medical ethics lawyer Lu Yiguang. LU YIGUANG: (Through interpreter) There's only a few low-level laws that cover gene editing on human embryos, and none of these laws detail the consequences of violating them. This is a big flaw. SCHMITZ: Lu hopes this case will push the government to introduce more laws. Otherwise, he says, China may see even more dangerous outcomes. Dangerous, too, is the culture that shaped He Jiankui, says Tongji University professor Zhu Dake. ZHU DAKE: (Through interpreter) The Chinese way is to only think of success. We don't think of whether that path to success is legal or ethical. And you can use as many tricks as you want, as long as you succeed. Every Chinese person grows up with this notion. SCHMITZ: And there's another cultural aspect of China that scientist Yangyang Cheng says plays a big part in the case of He Jiankui the - role of gender. Cheng says Lulu and Nana, apart from being twin baby girls whose DNA was altered by a male scientist, were created this way by He for an expressed reason. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HE: Mark thought that he lost the hope for their life. SCHMITZ: At the Hong Kong conference, He Jiankui said Mark, the name he uses for the father of the twins, had lost hope for life because he was HIV-positive. But, says He, when he altered the DNA of Mark's twin daughters to make them resistant to the virus, Mark's hope in life was restored. It's this justification that bothers scientist Yangyang Cheng the most. CHENG: He Jiankui exploited the shame of the father, the desire of fatherhood, the societal expectation of how men are expected to (speaking Chinese), to carry on the family line. SCHMITZ: He Jiankui remains under house arrest awaiting punishment. China's government says it'll tighten regulations on gene editing, and Cheng's hope is that Chinese scientists and politicians look inward to reflect on how this happened and to take measures to ensure it doesn't happen again.

Beijing seemed unprepared for the international backlash, and a government that had once celebrated him suddenly vowed to punish him. YANGYANG CHENG: I really hope that the outcome of this case doesn't conclude with punishment on an individual. SCHMITZ: Yangyang Cheng is a particle physicist at Cornell University. She says He conducted a reckless and unethical experiment that he should face consequences for, but. . . CHENG: There are structural, systematic and institutional flaws behind this experiment - what created him, what incentivized him, what failed to stop him. SCHMITZ: Cheng says He's case is a product of modern China. He Jiankui grew up in a family of modest means in one of the country's poorest regions. He was surrounded by the fastest-growing economy in history at a time when everyone was competing for a piece of the pie. CHENG: I think part of his motivation was that he wanted to do something that is world's-first and that could give him more name recognition, in the hopes that it will bring in more investments and also more future business opportunities for his companies. SCHMITZ: China's government promoted the same goals. It wanted Chinese companies and scientists to be the world's first and best in a range of technologies. And it encouraged them to acquire foreign technology to do it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HE: (Speaking Chinese). SCHMITZ: That CCTV segment featuring He talking about his gene sequencing machine, the technology He claimed as his own and which CCTV touted as China's own was actually from a machine created by a company founded by his American adviser at Stanford. When the company went bankrupt, He's adviser allowed him to license his technologies, says Cheng. CHENG: But regardless, this is still being seen as a Chinese company, a Chinese technology. And there is a lot of state-sponsored and government-pushed propaganda efforts behind it. SCHMITZ: And while Beijing's push for global dominance in technology pushed He Jiankui, the government's lax regulatory environment may have contributed to He's reckless gene-editing experiments on live humans, so says Shanghai-based medical ethics lawyer Lu Yiguang. LU YIGUANG: (Through interpreter) There's only a few low-level laws that cover gene editing on human embryos, and none of these laws detail the consequences of violating them. This is a big flaw. SCHMITZ: Lu hopes this case will push the government to introduce more laws. Otherwise, he says, China may see even more dangerous outcomes. Dangerous, too, is the culture that shaped He Jiankui, says Tongji University professor Zhu Dake. ZHU DAKE: (Through interpreter) The Chinese way is to only think of success. We don't think of whether that path to success is legal or ethical. And you can use as many tricks as you want, as long as you succeed. Every Chinese person grows up with this notion. SCHMITZ: And there's another cultural aspect of China that scientist Yangyang Cheng says plays a big part in the case of He Jiankui the - role of gender. Cheng says Lulu and Nana, apart from being twin baby girls whose DNA was altered by a male scientist, were created this way by He for an expressed reason. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HE: Mark thought that he lost the hope for their life. SCHMITZ: At the Hong Kong conference, He Jiankui said Mark, the name he uses for the father of the twins, had lost hope for life because he was HIV-positive. But, says He, when he altered the DNA of Mark's twin daughters to make them resistant to the virus, Mark's hope in life was restored. It's this justification that bothers scientist Yangyang Cheng the most. CHENG: He Jiankui exploited the shame of the father, the desire of fatherhood, the societal expectation of how men are expected to (speaking Chinese), to carry on the family line. SCHMITZ: He Jiankui remains under house arrest awaiting punishment. China's government says it'll tighten regulations on gene editing, and Cheng's hope is that Chinese scientists and politicians look inward to reflect on how this happened and to take measures to ensure it doesn't happen again.

I'm Terry Gross. Our guest James Balog is an award-winning photographer, whose work explores the relationship between humans and nature. It's a subject that's taken on increased urgency, he believes, with growing evidence of the impact of climate change. He was last on our show to talk about climate change and the melting of Arctic glacial ice, which he documented through time-lapse photography. That led to his project the Extreme Ice Survey and his film \"Chasing Ice. \"Now he's featured in a new documentary called \"The Human Element,\" which follows him as he documents places and people affected by rising oceans, wildfires and air pollution associated with climate change. The film is available for streaming on iTunes and other digital platforms. James Balog is founder of the Earth Vision Institute and is the author of eight books. He spoke with FRESH AIR's Dave Davies. DAVE DAVIES, BYLINE: Well, James Balog, welcome back to FRESH AIR. You want to explain the conceptual framework for this film, what you set out to do. JAMES BALOG: Well, I'm delighted to be here. And the story the film is really based on - a very ancient conception of the world, which is that there are these elemental forces that govern our existence - earth, air, fire and water. And, really, one of the breakthrough ideas in science of the last century or two is that humanity is a really powerful force in the world as well - a fifth element, essentially. So that's - it's that that the film is based around. DAVIES: So in the film, you first address water and the impact of humanity on the water on the planet. And, of course, some may know that several years back, I guess, in 2005, you started the Extreme Ice project to document the melting of the glaciers. You want to just explain what that is and kind of what it shows us clearly. BALOG: Yeah. Basically, starting in 2005, I started the Extreme Ice Survey. And it's still live and ongoing in the fields. We just finished our 12th field season. And in simplest terms, we're making a photographic documentation of how the world's glaciers and ice sheets are retreating as a consequence of a warming climate. One of the most widely talked about aspects of the project is that we have time-lapse cameras bolted to bedrock alongside the termini or the terminuses of various glaciers from Greenland to Alaska to Iceland to Antarctica. And they're clicking away - these cameras - every half-hour around the clock, as long as it's daylight, making a record of how the world is changing. And in the course of the past 12 years, we've amassed an archive of roughly 1. 5 million pictures showing the change in the landscape. These images are the real-world, tangible evidence of climate change in action. You can see it. And if you have the headphones turned on, you can hear it, you know? So the Extreme Ice Survey is evidence. It's actual, living, visual evidence of how the world is changing. DAVIES: And, of course, sea levels have been rising. And you go to some places to look at where that's truly affecting people now, including Norfolk, Va. , which is right at sea level, and a little island called Tangier - Tangier Island in Chesapeake Bay. What's happening there? BALOG: There's a straight-line connection between melting ice and rising seas. When you take water that's in its solid form on land and you melt it, it has to go somewhere. And that somewhere is the ocean. And, of course, the ocean laps up against all of these civilized places. So we're in the midst of having a gigantic change in the boundary conditions between the seas and civilization. The seas are rising. But they're also coming laterally farther inland, especially during the big storms. So you see it most acutely on the East Coast in Norfolk and on Tangier Island, both of which are in lower Chesapeake Bay. Tangier is in the process of being completely submerged by the seas. And Norfolk already has a lot of neighborhoods - very pleasant, nice, well-established neighborhoods - that are getting overtaken by the high tide in the autumns during the autumn tides known as king tides. These front lawns and streets are getting saturated. It's way worse in all of these kinds of places when the storms come in and drive more water in off the ocean. So we're using the Chesapeake Bay story as an example of conditions that are changing all up and down the East Coast. It's most photographable in Chesapeake. But it's happening in Miami. It's happening in the Carolinas. It's happening as well, obviously, in the Mississippi Delta. We've all heard a lot about that. And, of course, parts of New York City are impacted in a similar fashion, again, especially during the big storms, like Superstorm Sandy. DAVIES: Well, so tell us about coming to Tangier Island. This is a community of just a few hundred people. And they've gotten some attention before you arrived there. What do you see? And how do you want to tell the story? BALOG: What you see is a charming community almost at sea level. The houses - a hundred or so of them - are built on these very slight, little ridges of sand that are surrounded by saltwater marshes. And so on the high tides in September, October, November, sometimes December, when the high tides come up twice a day, you watch the ocean coming in right through those marshes, into people's front yards, lapping at their doorsteps. It's pretty amazing. And you just say to yourself, my God, how long can this go on? I mean, when do you, you know, pack up your - when do you pack up your gear and move? Similar situations apply in places like Charleston, S. C. I photographed there during Hurricane Matthew a few years ago. And to watch the flooding that those people are subjected to during a storm, it just kind of makes your head spin. You - I just can't understand how people accept that year after year. DAVIES: You have a conversation with the mayor of Tangier - goes by the name of Ooker. He describes himself as a waterman - has a unique accent. It was interesting to hear that. One of the place he takes you is what used to be a graveyard. That's pretty remarkable. What do you see? BALOG: Yeah, pretty staggering - there was a graveyard that goes back hundreds of years out on the edge of the island. And that whole area that used to, actually, be a village as well has been washed away over the past hundred years or so. And so in the film, we see Ooker discovering this old, marble tombstone that lays over one of the ancestors of the people who still live on the island. So he picks up the - this marble tombstone and goes, oh, man. OK. Things are changing. Most of the graveyard has washed into Chesapeake Bay at this point - the tombstones, the coffins, everything. It's gone. And he is. . . DAVIES: And he picks up human bone fragments. BALOG: Yeah, that's right. There's human bone fragments that are washed up on the beach. DAVIES: Right. Let's just hear just a little bit of this. This is the mayor of Tangier speaking about the missing graveyard - the graveyard that's been washed away. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"THE HUMAN ELEMENT\")JAMES ESKRIDGE: When you're walking up here at the site of where the community was, it can be depressing. To this day, you'll still find bone fragments from the graveyards that eroded and went into the bay. Here's one of the headstones from the graveyard. I actually know - I know a guy down on the island. This was his grandmother. DAVIES: That's from the film \"The Human Element\" that features our guest, photographer James Balog. You know, you have kids come into the water. And you photograph them. And it struck me that there's sort of a symbolic way that they are telling the story that the danger of climate change poses. Tell us a little bit about some of these shots. BALOG: Yeah. You hit the nail on the head. They are meant to be symbols of the time that we're in. They're symbols for all of us, stand-ins for all of us. So what we see are the children in the portraits mostly inundated in the rising water. And what I mean to say with that is that the world that those children will know when they're fully mature adults and entering their old age will be a very different world than the world that we see today. So the pictures show the water way, way up on the kids as a way of kind of startling us and making us wonder what's going on in the world. DAVIES: We're speaking with photographer James Balog. His work is featured in the new documentary \"The Human Element. \" We'll talk some more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF THE ACORN'S \"LOW GRAVITY\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with photographer James Balog, whose work often focuses on the interplay between humans and nature. He's featured in a new documentary about the impact of climate change. It's called \"The Human Element. \"The rising water in Tangier Island has been reported on for a while. I think there was a New York Times Magazine story about it. I wonder if the residents were at all reluctant - or a little bit cynical about another film crew or a photographer coming in to get their pictures and then leave them to their fate. BALOG: I didn't sense cynicism or resistance, per se, but I did certainly sense a bit of a schism in the way they viewed this situation. On the one hand, you had people saying, hmm, there's no rising seas. This is all about erosion. And on the other hand, they'd be talking about rising seas - and we need a $100 million-plus handout from the federal government. And then on the other hand, there are rabid anti-government folk, you know. They don't like the federal government. They don't like taxes. But they want the handout. And then to add yet another on the other hand - one of the prominent women on the island, who we see in the film, says, you know, we're just one storm away from becoming part of history. You know, it's a shocking, you know, knife to the heart when you hear that in the film. DAVIES: Yeah. And this is something that struck me about a lot of the interviews and photographs and film that we see here - is people who are suffering terrible effects and, in the case of Tangier Island, the possible elimination of their community. And the mayor what he wants is the government to spend a $100 million to create a sea wall all the way around the island. And I'm wondering to what extent people do connect this with something global - you know, with policies that are enacted by people they vote into office and that they need to pay attention to. BALOG: There is a strange disconnect on a lot of these things. And it's frustrating and exasperating for me. You know, I tie all the dots together. I see how the pieces fit together. And that's really what this film is about. But we find over and over again that if people's ideology conflicts with their observed reality around them, they tend to stay with the ideology instead of going, hmm, I think we need to throw out the ideology and look at the evidence of our senses and our experience. It's a very strange characteristic of the human mind to do that. Why would you not use the evidence of your senses to bear witness to the world around you and change your ideas based on that evidence? DAVIES: So the folks in Tangier that you spoke to, by and large, aren't, you know, conscious of climate change and advocating policies to reverse it. BALOG: They're ideologically opposed to the concept of climate change because they perceive it to be part of some sort of cabal to make the government more powerful, to have more taxes, to - whatever - or it's an idea that comes from pointy-headed intellectuals in the cities. And, you know, it's frustrating. But they've got the living evidence of it right there. DAVIES: One of the people who was with you on Tangier Island is a - I think a marine biologist from the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, who kind of explains what's happening. And he also says what is ahead for not just Tangier Island but for other places, like Miami and Norfolk, Va. , and Charleston, S. C. What does he say? BALOG: The marine biologist's name is Dave Schulte. And he has studied this issue extensively. And he talks about how some places may have to be sacrificed. He says, look. There's only so much money to go around in our society to protect these various populations. And the big cities will always figure out how to have enough money to take care of themselves. But some of the smaller places, they may need to move because there isn't enough money to take care of everybody. DAVIES: So you talk about the air - one of the other elements the ancients thought comprised our world - and how it has been affected by climate change. And it's interesting because you're a photographer. Water's quite visible. Fire is very dramatic. The air is invisible. You conjured some ways to capture images that deliver, you know, the impact of this. What'd you do? BALOG: Yeah, air was the hardest part of this entire story. You know, air is invisible. It's all around us all the time. It actually has weight and mass and volume. We depend on it. We inhale this stuff 20,000 times a day - at least. So it's an intimate part of our lives. But you can't see it. So what to do? One of the things was I put a time-lapse camera in a weather balloon - in partnership with a friend of mine named Patrick Cullis, who's a very clever physicist and knows how to handle weather balloons. So we turn the camera on to shoot one picture every second. And we release the weather balloon, and it floated right up through the atmosphere. The motivation here was that I wanted to see the incredible view that the astronauts see - knowing that I'll never be an astronaut and look down on that that thin layer of air that surrounds the Earth - but let my camera do it for me. It's my surrogate, my little robot. So up goes the camera. And within about 35 or 40 minutes, that camera was well out of the breathable atmosphere. It was up in the blackness of space and seeing that thin, thin, thin blue membrane of air that surrounds us. So that boggled my mind. In just barely over half an hour, a balloon can float up to outer space. That's how thin the air is. And we - all down here on terra firma - we spend our lives thinking oh, you know, there's that cerulean dome over our heads, and it's pretty infinite. Well, guess what? It isn't infinite. And it's a thin, little, nothing kind of a place that very quickly goes out into the naked black void of the galaxy. DAVIES: Right. And a cool moment is you actually have a video camera on the weather balloon, and you see it burst when it reaches - what? - about 70,000 feet or 100,000 feet. And it floats to air on a parachute - cool images, yeah. BALOG: Yeah, yeah, yeah. The balloon actually burst at 99,700 feet, and then the camera came back to Earth on a little parachute and landed out in a farmer's field. My little camera came back to Earth, and gave us that story. DAVIES: It's interesting that in looking at the issue of air pollution, you're in Colorado, which I think a lot of us think of as, you know, the place of big sky and clean air, and there are some serious issues. And you have this fascinating ride in a van that's rigged up with this really expensive measuring equipment with a scientist, Jessica Gilman. What are you doing as you drive through these areas, and what is - what do you see? BALOG: Well, they had more than a million dollars' worth of very sophisticated air chemistry sampling equipment in that van. And so we're picking up the different constituents of pollution that are in the atmosphere as we're driving out in northeastern Colorado. So this becomes of course a really ironic story because, as you point out, we all think of the Rockies and the - Colorado as having this fabulously clean, wonderful air. I live in that area, and I was stunned to discover how contaminated the air has become. It's tailpipe pollution from our cars and our trucks. It's power plant emissions. It's the - what are called fugitive emissions from oil and gas wells in northeastern Colorado. There's 20-some thousand live oil and gas wells right now and many times that of old, abandoned oil and gas wells. And these things are mostly intact. And they don't leak, at least in the relatively near term of their lives. But eventually, a pretty substantial fraction of these facilities leak. You know, the gaskets wear out. The metal gets rusty or whatever, and gases come leaking up from underground. And that winds up in the air we breathe. So we made pictures of that. And then, in addition to all of that, we're watching wildfire smoke billowing across our part of the country for months at a time now. I can tell you, 20 or 30 years ago, it was a really rare thing to live along the edge of the Front Range of Colorado and see brown skies from wildfire smoke blowing in from, you know, where - wherever it was coming in from. That was rare 20, 30, 40 years ago. Now we typically spend three or four months from June through September where the sky is brown more often than it's clear. And that's all the fire smoke coming either from the Colorado Rockies, from Arizona, from California, from Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana or even all the way up, far up, in Canada, in the Northwest Territories. We have wildfires going on constantly, and we breathe it. But guess what? The rest of the country breathes it too. It may be less visible, but it's mixing in with the air that all of us breathe. GROSS: We're listening to the interview FRESH AIR's Dave Davies recorded with James Balog. The new documentary \"The Human Element\" follows him as he photographs people and places affected by rising oceans, wildfires and air pollution associated with climate change. They'll talk more after a break. And book critic Maureen Corrigan will review Emily Bernard's new collection of autobiographical essays titled \"Black Is The Body. \" I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview FRESH AIR's Dave Davies recorded with environmental photographer James Balog. His work explores the relationship between humans and nature. The new documentary \"The Human Element\" follows Balog as he photographs people and places affected by rising oceans, wildfires and air pollution associated with climate change. The film is now available for streaming on iTunes, Amazon Prime, Google Play and other digital platforms. DAVIES: You spend some time with a family in Denver. And I thought we would listen to a clip from the film here. We're hearing a woman named Yadira Sanchez, who has three or four kids, I think. And they all have asthma. She has it. They have it. And it begins when she's about - getting them up in the morning, getting ready to go to school. And she's giving them their medicine through an inhaler, which she holds while they stand as she places it over their nose and mouth. Let's listen to this. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"THE HUMAN ELEMENT\")YADIRA SANCHEZ: After we moved to this part of town, my older son, Ruben, started developing asthma. My daughter, Olivia, we had to start her on medications at the age of 1. And Leonardo was just kind of born into it. OK, good job. Now go rinse your mouth really good, please. All four of us have asthma, so we're indoor people. We're not outdoor people. The pollution here in the neighborhood is pretty extreme. And, you know, we have the refinery and all of the pollution from the semis that pass through. (SOUNDBITE OF TRUCK ENGINES REVVING)SANCHEZ: Asthma is a normal thing in this part of town. One of the questions that a lot of people have asked is, why haven't you moved? Why don't you just move - because moving takes money. DAVIES: And that is Yadira Sanchez, speaking in the new documentary \"The Human Element,\" which features the photography and the work of our guest James Balog. It's powerful to see these kids at home. And then you go to the school, and that's really affecting. What do you see there? BALOG: Many asthmatic children need medical intervention - medicine so many times each day that they often can't very effectively go to regular schools. So the Sanchez family goes to a special school within National Jewish Hospital in Denver. And at that school, they have all-day-long nursing care. A couple of different nurses take care of them, and the kids are constantly rotating in for various sorts of inhalers to suppress their asthma problems. And they're wonderful kids, regular school. And I don't know how many children go there, but it's quite a few - on the order of 100 or so. And they are so afflicted that they have to get these interventions. And we have some of the kids saying, well, you know, I've been to the ICU a couple times, and I've ridden in an ambulance four times. But the point of this whole part of this story is that in protecting the climate we're protecting the people. The two things are connected - climate protection equals people protection. And there are direct immediate impacts on our health from the contaminated air that in turn creates contaminated climate. DAVIES: You know, these are emotionally powerful scenes. And I, again, wondered here whether Mrs. Sanchez or those teachers in the school or the nurses connect what they're seeing to policies that affect, you know, the climate. BALOG: Yes, they're quite vocal about this. They think everything ties together. And they see all of this as being a unified issue, just as I do. DAVIES: You have some pretty dramatic stuff here about the growth of wildfires in the West. And I think you say in passing that you had a personal experience with wildfire early. What happened? BALOG: Oh, boy, yeah. We used to live in the foothills of the Rockies, west of Boulder, Colo. And there was quite a large wildfire one day - it was actually Labor Day - I think it was 2010, not positive about that. But in any event, 160 structures of my neighbors burned down, and the fire almost got to our property. And I can tell you it's a terrifying and humbling thing to see gigantic pillars of smoke on - you know, just to the west of your house, wondering if your house is about to go. So that is what really brought wildfire home for me and catalyzed what later became this whole section of the film. DAVIES: Yeah. For the footage in this part of the film, you went in with firefighters, and we see you in a hardhat. And I assumed you signed some pretty serious waivers because it looks like you got pretty close to the fires. How is - describe some of the challenges that you face shooting a fire and how you get what you want to get. BALOG: Well, I - yes, I was in very, very deep. I actually went to wildland firefighter training school, as did most of my crew. We learned how to be, how to do, how to think out there along with the firefighters - so that on the one hand, we knew what we were looking at and what was about to happen. But on the other hand, I wanted to know how not to get killed out there because it was very clear to me that this was a dangerous environment. So yeah, I really inhaled - if you'll excuse the pun - the experience of being a firefighter I thought the science of fires was incredibly interesting. It's some of the most intellectually interesting stuff I've ever been exposed to because the science integrates questions of weather - you know, what are the winds doing? What are the temperatures doing? It integrates biology because you need to know what the fuel types are. It integrates geology because you need to understand the terrain and how the vegetation is distributed on the terrain and how that's going to affect fire behavior. And then, of course, there's the whole issue of how people intervene against the fires to keep them from doing bad things or to help to encourage the fires to do good things. And the fire is a powerful, powerful, powerful force. And I developed an enormous admiration and respect for these wildland firefighters. It's really, really, crazy dangerous, crazy violent activity. And I've talked to structure firefighters - you know, the people who fight fires in buildings in urban and suburban areas. And they go, man, those wildland guys, they are crazy - the stuff they do. But they do it anyway. DAVIES: Yeah. What are some of the differences? What - elaborate on that a bit. What do they see that's different about this? BALOG: Number one, the clothing that the wildland firefighters wear is fairly lightweight compared to what the structure firefighters wear. You don't have any respiratory protection when you're out on a wildland fire because you're working - the physical work goes on for so long, and it's so hot that you can't wear a respirator. It would just be too insanely miserable. So they go out there, and they're inhaling all these toxic gases. And they're inhaling all these particulates - whereas the structure firefighters go inside buildings with essentially scuba tanks on and self-contained breathing in their air masks. And they're relatively well-protected in these very, very heavy suits. DAVIES: Not to say that it's easy to walk into a - go into a burning building. BALOG: No, no. It's definitely not easy going into burning buildings, but they are relatively well-protected compared to what these wildland guys have to work with. DAVIES: We're speaking with photographer James Balog. His work is featured in the new documentary \"The Human Element. \" We'll talk some more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF GILAD HEKSELMAN'S \"DO RE MI FA SOL\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with photographer James Balog. His work is featured in the new documentary about the impact of climate change called \"The Human Element. \"There's an image in the film, and I believe this is video rather than still photography, but it appears to be a camera right in the middle of a stand of trees that's going up. And the camera is, I guess, on the ground or near the ground looking up through the trees as they go - they're absorbed in this fire. How did - was that acquired, you know? BALOG: Well, Dave, I did that shot, and we spent a couple summers trying to figure out how to do that. And we picked a spot where we knew the fire was advancing, pre-positioned the camera on the ground in front of the flames and turned it on and let it rip. And we had already burned up, melted a lot of cameras at that point - maybe five or six, I think. And this camera melted, too. But we had learned that even if the camera melted, if the fire moved fast enough, the flash card inside the memory card would survive, and we would still get a picture. So we went for broke. The fire moved right over the camera, passed by. Couple minutes later, it was gone. The camera's covered up with, you know, burning sticks and embers, but we still had a shot inside there. DAVIES: So what did you hear from firefighters from their own experience about how fires have changed in recent years? BALOG: Well, what you hear over and over and over again - whether it's young firefighters or old-timey firefighters who were not on the front lines anymore, but they're back managing these things - they all say the fires are bigger, there's more of them, the fire season lasts longer and the fire behavior is far different than it used to be. The fires are more violent, more ferocious. And of course, they've always been violent and ferocious, but there is a sense of sort of awe and humility in how they talk about these things. They're quite - I wouldn't say intimidated because intimidated means you go, oh, scary. I'm running away. These guys still get out there in spite of how intimidating it - the fires seem to the rest of us. They get out there, and they do it. DAVIES: Right - and not just guys, we'll note. There's one point where you're with some firefighters that are going to try and establish a line to stop a fire from going over a ridge and entering a town. And the strategy, I guess, is to actually burn the hillside near the town so that when the main fire gets there, it won't have the fuel. And this - you want to just describe what that amounts to and what your experience - it was photographing it? BALOG: Yeah. It's an incredible thing to be part of an operation like that. It's called a burn out. And we're up on top of a pretty sharp ridge, surrounded by very thick vegetation on either side of the ridge. And the fire is coming towards us from the west and burning down into a valley. And we know it's going to burn down into the valley and up the slope towards us. And in the opposite direction, as you said, there's a village that they're trying to keep from burning down. So the notion is to use fire to fight fire, and so we started to burn out all the vegetation between our ridge line and where that fire was coming from. And they burned out the fuels using helicopter torches that were dropping napalm on the forest and by throwing flares and shooting flares way deep into the vegetation. So the idea was to literally just torch the entire mountainside so that once the advancing flames hit that section, they would just go poof - can't move anymore. There's nothing else we can do. Now, what makes it so exciting is that there's a lot of heat. There's a lot of smoke coming up at you. And you know, one of the things you learn in firefighting school is you don't want to be on the top of a ridge with a fire below you because fires like to climb uphill. They feed on their heat, the convection of the flames. And you don't want to have a fire come roaring up a mountainside and fly right over you and start burning the vegetation behind you. That's how a lot of firefighters have been killed over the decades. So you know, we're doing what we have to do for the burn out. But you're still thinking, whoa, wait a minute. Wait a minute. We're not in such a good place right here. So everybody's really on their toes, you know, watching in all directions, staying situationally aware to make sure we've got some measure of control over what's going on around us. But always, you're wondering, oh, my god. Are we about to get trapped in here? Well, as it turned out, everything went right. We didn't get trapped. They burned it out, and the fire died where it was supposed to. And the village was saved. DAVIES: There are a couple of pretty harrowing moments, it looks like. How close did you come to getting burned? BALOG: I was very, very close to some flames because I was so captivated by the incredible power and beauty, frankly, at these gigantic walls of fire that I went in pretty close. Everybody else had backed away. All the seasoned firefighters had backed away 'cause they looked at these burning trees, and they said, man, that's too hot. I'm not going anywhere near there. But I went in, oh, to maybe 15 feet away from this big wall of flame. And I - after I was shooting for 30 seconds or so, I realized, my God, I may be melting the glue inside the lens here. And then I started to realize my hands feel like they're burning off. And so I backed off and got out of there. DAVIES: And that's the moment we see you running back towards the camera, right? BALOG: Yeah, shaking, waving my hands. And my crew was back behind me going, oh, Jim, you went too far on that one. DAVIES: Right. You also talked to a lot of victims, people who just saw their - all of their possessions and homes go up in smoke. You also talked to people who are victims of floods after hurricanes. And these are, you know, powerful, often heartbreaking stories. And I wonder if the fact that you're focused on the photography, on getting the shot right gives you some - not detachment - some emotional defense - that the emotions maybe come back when you see the images later. BALOG: Yeah. You - as a photographer, you have to show up, you have to function, you have to get the shot. And there's a little trick you play inside your mind, and you go, you know, I'm inside the black box right now. I'm just trying to frame this image inside the rectangle and make an interesting picture. And time is always short. You never feel like you have quite enough time. So you get your job done, and then it's at night, or it's a month later or a year later, and you reflect on this. And it still just tears at your heart. DAVIES: Yeah. On the other hand, I would think that when you're talking to people who've endured tragedies like this, they would want somebody who - with some empathy, not somebody who's, you know, just someone who's just there for the picture. BALOG: Yeah. The - one of the secrets of this field, whether you're a war photographer, or you're photographing natural disasters or whatever, is that people really want their stories to be told. They want you to come as a witness. And over and over again, there - I've seen for decades working on hurricanes and volcanoes and floods and all kinds of things, the tsunami in Indonesia, they want a witness to be there to say, here, this is what happened. This is the truth. DAVIES: You've spent decades looking at nature and humans' relationship with nature. As you're finishing this project, I'm wondering how your thinking has evolved about humans and their place in the natural order. BALOG: One of the biggest messages of this film is that we humans are part of nature. That's what you realize when you look at the four elements in the context of humanity. We're not separate from nature. We've been taught for thousands of years that we're separate, and we're looking in on nature. But I've come to realize - and the broader science that's around me has come to realize - we are in nature, not disjointed. And so in a way, I would like to think of this film as a coming-of-age story. I think we should look at the environment not through the lens of dreamy romanticism, and I don't think we should look at the environment through the lens of selfish extraction. Both of those kinds of things, dreaminess and selfishness, are juvenile. And I think the core issue of humanity for our time, at least as regards the environment but also as regards human health and a lot of other things, is that we need to grow out of those old patterns of thinking and grow into a more sophisticated, more complex understanding of what we are and who we are in relationship to nature. DAVIES: James Balog, thanks so much for speaking with us. BALOG: My pleasure. Thank you. GROSS: James Balog's work is the subject of the new climate change documentary \"The Human Element. \" The film is now available for streaming on iTunes, Amazon Prime, Google Play and other digital platforms. He spoke with FRESH AIR's Dave Davies, who is also WHYY's senior reporter. After we take a short break, book critic Maureen Corrigan will review a new collection of autobiographical essays by Emily Bernard called \"Black Is The Body. \" This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Our guest James Balog is an award-winning photographer, whose work explores the relationship between humans and nature. It's a subject that's taken on increased urgency, he believes, with growing evidence of the impact of climate change. He was last on our show to talk about climate change and the melting of Arctic glacial ice, which he documented through time-lapse photography. That led to his project the Extreme Ice Survey and his film \"Chasing Ice. \" Now he's featured in a new documentary called \"The Human Element,\" which follows him as he documents places and people affected by rising oceans, wildfires and air pollution associated with climate change. The film is available for streaming on iTunes and other digital platforms. James Balog is founder of the Earth Vision Institute and is the author of eight books. He spoke with FRESH AIR's Dave Davies. DAVE DAVIES, BYLINE: Well, James Balog, welcome back to FRESH AIR. You want to explain the conceptual framework for this film, what you set out to do. JAMES BALOG: Well, I'm delighted to be here. And the story the film is really based on - a very ancient conception of the world, which is that there are these elemental forces that govern our existence - earth, air, fire and water. And, really, one of the breakthrough ideas in science of the last century or two is that humanity is a really powerful force in the world as well - a fifth element, essentially. So that's - it's that that the film is based around. DAVIES: So in the film, you first address water and the impact of humanity on the water on the planet. And, of course, some may know that several years back, I guess, in 2005, you started the Extreme Ice project to document the melting of the glaciers. You want to just explain what that is and kind of what it shows us clearly. BALOG: Yeah. Basically, starting in 2005, I started the Extreme Ice Survey. And it's still live and ongoing in the fields. We just finished our 12th field season. And in simplest terms, we're making a photographic documentation of how the world's glaciers and ice sheets are retreating as a consequence of a warming climate. One of the most widely talked about aspects of the project is that we have time-lapse cameras bolted to bedrock alongside the termini or the terminuses of various glaciers from Greenland to Alaska to Iceland to Antarctica. And they're clicking away - these cameras - every half-hour around the clock, as long as it's daylight, making a record of how the world is changing. And in the course of the past 12 years, we've amassed an archive of roughly 1. 5 million pictures showing the change in the landscape. These images are the real-world, tangible evidence of climate change in action. You can see it. And if you have the headphones turned on, you can hear it, you know? So the Extreme Ice Survey is evidence. It's actual, living, visual evidence of how the world is changing. DAVIES: And, of course, sea levels have been rising. And you go to some places to look at where that's truly affecting people now, including Norfolk, Va. , which is right at sea level, and a little island called Tangier - Tangier Island in Chesapeake Bay. What's happening there? BALOG: There's a straight-line connection between melting ice and rising seas. When you take water that's in its solid form on land and you melt it, it has to go somewhere. And that somewhere is the ocean. And, of course, the ocean laps up against all of these civilized places. So we're in the midst of having a gigantic change in the boundary conditions between the seas and civilization. The seas are rising. But they're also coming laterally farther inland, especially during the big storms. So you see it most acutely on the East Coast in Norfolk and on Tangier Island, both of which are in lower Chesapeake Bay. Tangier is in the process of being completely submerged by the seas. And Norfolk already has a lot of neighborhoods - very pleasant, nice, well-established neighborhoods - that are getting overtaken by the high tide in the autumns during the autumn tides known as king tides. These front lawns and streets are getting saturated. It's way worse in all of these kinds of places when the storms come in and drive more water in off the ocean. So we're using the Chesapeake Bay story as an example of conditions that are changing all up and down the East Coast. It's most photographable in Chesapeake. But it's happening in Miami. It's happening in the Carolinas. It's happening as well, obviously, in the Mississippi Delta. We've all heard a lot about that. And, of course, parts of New York City are impacted in a similar fashion, again, especially during the big storms, like Superstorm Sandy. DAVIES: Well, so tell us about coming to Tangier Island. This is a community of just a few hundred people. And they've gotten some attention before you arrived there. What do you see? And how do you want to tell the story? BALOG: What you see is a charming community almost at sea level. The houses - a hundred or so of them - are built on these very slight, little ridges of sand that are surrounded by saltwater marshes. And so on the high tides in September, October, November, sometimes December, when the high tides come up twice a day, you watch the ocean coming in right through those marshes, into people's front yards, lapping at their doorsteps. It's pretty amazing. And you just say to yourself, my God, how long can this go on? I mean, when do you, you know, pack up your - when do you pack up your gear and move? Similar situations apply in places like Charleston, S. C. I photographed there during Hurricane Matthew a few years ago. And to watch the flooding that those people are subjected to during a storm, it just kind of makes your head spin. You - I just can't understand how people accept that year after year. DAVIES: You have a conversation with the mayor of Tangier - goes by the name of Ooker. He describes himself as a waterman - has a unique accent. It was interesting to hear that. One of the place he takes you is what used to be a graveyard. That's pretty remarkable. What do you see? BALOG: Yeah, pretty staggering - there was a graveyard that goes back hundreds of years out on the edge of the island. And that whole area that used to, actually, be a village as well has been washed away over the past hundred years or so. And so in the film, we see Ooker discovering this old, marble tombstone that lays over one of the ancestors of the people who still live on the island. So he picks up the - this marble tombstone and goes, oh, man. OK. Things are changing. Most of the graveyard has washed into Chesapeake Bay at this point - the tombstones, the coffins, everything. It's gone. And he is. . . DAVIES: And he picks up human bone fragments. BALOG: Yeah, that's right. There's human bone fragments that are washed up on the beach. DAVIES: Right. Let's just hear just a little bit of this. This is the mayor of Tangier speaking about the missing graveyard - the graveyard that's been washed away. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"THE HUMAN ELEMENT\") JAMES ESKRIDGE: When you're walking up here at the site of where the community was, it can be depressing. To this day, you'll still find bone fragments from the graveyards that eroded and went into the bay. Here's one of the headstones from the graveyard. I actually know - I know a guy down on the island. This was his grandmother. DAVIES: That's from the film \"The Human Element\" that features our guest, photographer James Balog. You know, you have kids come into the water. And you photograph them. And it struck me that there's sort of a symbolic way that they are telling the story that the danger of climate change poses. Tell us a little bit about some of these shots. BALOG: Yeah. You hit the nail on the head. They are meant to be symbols of the time that we're in. They're symbols for all of us, stand-ins for all of us. So what we see are the children in the portraits mostly inundated in the rising water. And what I mean to say with that is that the world that those children will know when they're fully mature adults and entering their old age will be a very different world than the world that we see today. So the pictures show the water way, way up on the kids as a way of kind of startling us and making us wonder what's going on in the world. DAVIES: We're speaking with photographer James Balog. His work is featured in the new documentary \"The Human Element. \" We'll talk some more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF THE ACORN'S \"LOW GRAVITY\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with photographer James Balog, whose work often focuses on the interplay between humans and nature. He's featured in a new documentary about the impact of climate change. It's called \"The Human Element. \" The rising water in Tangier Island has been reported on for a while. I think there was a New York Times Magazine story about it. I wonder if the residents were at all reluctant - or a little bit cynical about another film crew or a photographer coming in to get their pictures and then leave them to their fate. BALOG: I didn't sense cynicism or resistance, per se, but I did certainly sense a bit of a schism in the way they viewed this situation. On the one hand, you had people saying, hmm, there's no rising seas. This is all about erosion. And on the other hand, they'd be talking about rising seas - and we need a $100 million-plus handout from the federal government. And then on the other hand, there are rabid anti-government folk, you know. They don't like the federal government. They don't like taxes. But they want the handout. And then to add yet another on the other hand - one of the prominent women on the island, who we see in the film, says, you know, we're just one storm away from becoming part of history. You know, it's a shocking, you know, knife to the heart when you hear that in the film. DAVIES: Yeah. And this is something that struck me about a lot of the interviews and photographs and film that we see here - is people who are suffering terrible effects and, in the case of Tangier Island, the possible elimination of their community. And the mayor what he wants is the government to spend a $100 million to create a sea wall all the way around the island. And I'm wondering to what extent people do connect this with something global - you know, with policies that are enacted by people they vote into office and that they need to pay attention to. BALOG: There is a strange disconnect on a lot of these things. And it's frustrating and exasperating for me. You know, I tie all the dots together. I see how the pieces fit together. And that's really what this film is about. But we find over and over again that if people's ideology conflicts with their observed reality around them, they tend to stay with the ideology instead of going, hmm, I think we need to throw out the ideology and look at the evidence of our senses and our experience. It's a very strange characteristic of the human mind to do that. Why would you not use the evidence of your senses to bear witness to the world around you and change your ideas based on that evidence? DAVIES: So the folks in Tangier that you spoke to, by and large, aren't, you know, conscious of climate change and advocating policies to reverse it. BALOG: They're ideologically opposed to the concept of climate change because they perceive it to be part of some sort of cabal to make the government more powerful, to have more taxes, to - whatever - or it's an idea that comes from pointy-headed intellectuals in the cities. And, you know, it's frustrating. But they've got the living evidence of it right there. DAVIES: One of the people who was with you on Tangier Island is a - I think a marine biologist from the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, who kind of explains what's happening. And he also says what is ahead for not just Tangier Island but for other places, like Miami and Norfolk, Va. , and Charleston, S. C. What does he say? BALOG: The marine biologist's name is Dave Schulte. And he has studied this issue extensively. And he talks about how some places may have to be sacrificed. He says, look. There's only so much money to go around in our society to protect these various populations. And the big cities will always figure out how to have enough money to take care of themselves. But some of the smaller places, they may need to move because there isn't enough money to take care of everybody. DAVIES: So you talk about the air - one of the other elements the ancients thought comprised our world - and how it has been affected by climate change. And it's interesting because you're a photographer. Water's quite visible. Fire is very dramatic. The air is invisible. You conjured some ways to capture images that deliver, you know, the impact of this. What'd you do? BALOG: Yeah, air was the hardest part of this entire story. You know, air is invisible. It's all around us all the time. It actually has weight and mass and volume. We depend on it. We inhale this stuff 20,000 times a day - at least. So it's an intimate part of our lives. But you can't see it. So what to do? One of the things was I put a time-lapse camera in a weather balloon - in partnership with a friend of mine named Patrick Cullis, who's a very clever physicist and knows how to handle weather balloons. So we turn the camera on to shoot one picture every second. And we release the weather balloon, and it floated right up through the atmosphere. The motivation here was that I wanted to see the incredible view that the astronauts see - knowing that I'll never be an astronaut and look down on that that thin layer of air that surrounds the Earth - but let my camera do it for me. It's my surrogate, my little robot. So up goes the camera. And within about 35 or 40 minutes, that camera was well out of the breathable atmosphere. It was up in the blackness of space and seeing that thin, thin, thin blue membrane of air that surrounds us. So that boggled my mind. In just barely over half an hour, a balloon can float up to outer space. That's how thin the air is. And we - all down here on terra firma - we spend our lives thinking oh, you know, there's that cerulean dome over our heads, and it's pretty infinite. Well, guess what? It isn't infinite. And it's a thin, little, nothing kind of a place that very quickly goes out into the naked black void of the galaxy. DAVIES: Right. And a cool moment is you actually have a video camera on the weather balloon, and you see it burst when it reaches - what? - about 70,000 feet or 100,000 feet. And it floats to air on a parachute - cool images, yeah. BALOG: Yeah, yeah, yeah. The balloon actually burst at 99,700 feet, and then the camera came back to Earth on a little parachute and landed out in a farmer's field. My little camera came back to Earth, and gave us that story. DAVIES: It's interesting that in looking at the issue of air pollution, you're in Colorado, which I think a lot of us think of as, you know, the place of big sky and clean air, and there are some serious issues. And you have this fascinating ride in a van that's rigged up with this really expensive measuring equipment with a scientist, Jessica Gilman. What are you doing as you drive through these areas, and what is - what do you see? BALOG: Well, they had more than a million dollars' worth of very sophisticated air chemistry sampling equipment in that van. And so we're picking up the different constituents of pollution that are in the atmosphere as we're driving out in northeastern Colorado. So this becomes of course a really ironic story because, as you point out, we all think of the Rockies and the - Colorado as having this fabulously clean, wonderful air. I live in that area, and I was stunned to discover how contaminated the air has become. It's tailpipe pollution from our cars and our trucks. It's power plant emissions. It's the - what are called fugitive emissions from oil and gas wells in northeastern Colorado. There's 20-some thousand live oil and gas wells right now and many times that of old, abandoned oil and gas wells. And these things are mostly intact. And they don't leak, at least in the relatively near term of their lives. But eventually, a pretty substantial fraction of these facilities leak. You know, the gaskets wear out. The metal gets rusty or whatever, and gases come leaking up from underground. And that winds up in the air we breathe. So we made pictures of that. And then, in addition to all of that, we're watching wildfire smoke billowing across our part of the country for months at a time now. I can tell you, 20 or 30 years ago, it was a really rare thing to live along the edge of the Front Range of Colorado and see brown skies from wildfire smoke blowing in from, you know, where - wherever it was coming in from. That was rare 20, 30, 40 years ago. Now we typically spend three or four months from June through September where the sky is brown more often than it's clear. And that's all the fire smoke coming either from the Colorado Rockies, from Arizona, from California, from Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana or even all the way up, far up, in Canada, in the Northwest Territories. We have wildfires going on constantly, and we breathe it. But guess what? The rest of the country breathes it too. It may be less visible, but it's mixing in with the air that all of us breathe. GROSS: We're listening to the interview FRESH AIR's Dave Davies recorded with James Balog. The new documentary \"The Human Element\" follows him as he photographs people and places affected by rising oceans, wildfires and air pollution associated with climate change. They'll talk more after a break. And book critic Maureen Corrigan will review Emily Bernard's new collection of autobiographical essays titled \"Black Is The Body. \" I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview FRESH AIR's Dave Davies recorded with environmental photographer James Balog. His work explores the relationship between humans and nature. The new documentary \"The Human Element\" follows Balog as he photographs people and places affected by rising oceans, wildfires and air pollution associated with climate change. The film is now available for streaming on iTunes, Amazon Prime, Google Play and other digital platforms. DAVIES: You spend some time with a family in Denver. And I thought we would listen to a clip from the film here. We're hearing a woman named Yadira Sanchez, who has three or four kids, I think. And they all have asthma. She has it. They have it. And it begins when she's about - getting them up in the morning, getting ready to go to school. And she's giving them their medicine through an inhaler, which she holds while they stand as she places it over their nose and mouth. Let's listen to this. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"THE HUMAN ELEMENT\") YADIRA SANCHEZ: After we moved to this part of town, my older son, Ruben, started developing asthma. My daughter, Olivia, we had to start her on medications at the age of 1. And Leonardo was just kind of born into it. OK, good job. Now go rinse your mouth really good, please. All four of us have asthma, so we're indoor people. We're not outdoor people. The pollution here in the neighborhood is pretty extreme. And, you know, we have the refinery and all of the pollution from the semis that pass through. (SOUNDBITE OF TRUCK ENGINES REVVING) SANCHEZ: Asthma is a normal thing in this part of town. One of the questions that a lot of people have asked is, why haven't you moved? Why don't you just move - because moving takes money. DAVIES: And that is Yadira Sanchez, speaking in the new documentary \"The Human Element,\" which features the photography and the work of our guest James Balog. It's powerful to see these kids at home. And then you go to the school, and that's really affecting. What do you see there? BALOG: Many asthmatic children need medical intervention - medicine so many times each day that they often can't very effectively go to regular schools. So the Sanchez family goes to a special school within National Jewish Hospital in Denver. And at that school, they have all-day-long nursing care. A couple of different nurses take care of them, and the kids are constantly rotating in for various sorts of inhalers to suppress their asthma problems. And they're wonderful kids, regular school. And I don't know how many children go there, but it's quite a few - on the order of 100 or so. And they are so afflicted that they have to get these interventions. And we have some of the kids saying, well, you know, I've been to the ICU a couple times, and I've ridden in an ambulance four times. But the point of this whole part of this story is that in protecting the climate we're protecting the people. The two things are connected - climate protection equals people protection. And there are direct immediate impacts on our health from the contaminated air that in turn creates contaminated climate. DAVIES: You know, these are emotionally powerful scenes. And I, again, wondered here whether Mrs. Sanchez or those teachers in the school or the nurses connect what they're seeing to policies that affect, you know, the climate. BALOG: Yes, they're quite vocal about this. They think everything ties together. And they see all of this as being a unified issue, just as I do. DAVIES: You have some pretty dramatic stuff here about the growth of wildfires in the West. And I think you say in passing that you had a personal experience with wildfire early. What happened? BALOG: Oh, boy, yeah. We used to live in the foothills of the Rockies, west of Boulder, Colo. And there was quite a large wildfire one day - it was actually Labor Day - I think it was 2010, not positive about that. But in any event, 160 structures of my neighbors burned down, and the fire almost got to our property. And I can tell you it's a terrifying and humbling thing to see gigantic pillars of smoke on - you know, just to the west of your house, wondering if your house is about to go. So that is what really brought wildfire home for me and catalyzed what later became this whole section of the film. DAVIES: Yeah. For the footage in this part of the film, you went in with firefighters, and we see you in a hardhat. And I assumed you signed some pretty serious waivers because it looks like you got pretty close to the fires. How is - describe some of the challenges that you face shooting a fire and how you get what you want to get. BALOG: Well, I - yes, I was in very, very deep. I actually went to wildland firefighter training school, as did most of my crew. We learned how to be, how to do, how to think out there along with the firefighters - so that on the one hand, we knew what we were looking at and what was about to happen. But on the other hand, I wanted to know how not to get killed out there because it was very clear to me that this was a dangerous environment. So yeah, I really inhaled - if you'll excuse the pun - the experience of being a firefighter I thought the science of fires was incredibly interesting. It's some of the most intellectually interesting stuff I've ever been exposed to because the science integrates questions of weather - you know, what are the winds doing? What are the temperatures doing? It integrates biology because you need to know what the fuel types are. It integrates geology because you need to understand the terrain and how the vegetation is distributed on the terrain and how that's going to affect fire behavior. And then, of course, there's the whole issue of how people intervene against the fires to keep them from doing bad things or to help to encourage the fires to do good things. And the fire is a powerful, powerful, powerful force. And I developed an enormous admiration and respect for these wildland firefighters. It's really, really, crazy dangerous, crazy violent activity. And I've talked to structure firefighters - you know, the people who fight fires in buildings in urban and suburban areas. And they go, man, those wildland guys, they are crazy - the stuff they do. But they do it anyway. DAVIES: Yeah. What are some of the differences? What - elaborate on that a bit. What do they see that's different about this? BALOG: Number one, the clothing that the wildland firefighters wear is fairly lightweight compared to what the structure firefighters wear. You don't have any respiratory protection when you're out on a wildland fire because you're working - the physical work goes on for so long, and it's so hot that you can't wear a respirator. It would just be too insanely miserable. So they go out there, and they're inhaling all these toxic gases. And they're inhaling all these particulates - whereas the structure firefighters go inside buildings with essentially scuba tanks on and self-contained breathing in their air masks. And they're relatively well-protected in these very, very heavy suits. DAVIES: Not to say that it's easy to walk into a - go into a burning building. BALOG: No, no. It's definitely not easy going into burning buildings, but they are relatively well-protected compared to what these wildland guys have to work with. DAVIES: We're speaking with photographer James Balog. His work is featured in the new documentary \"The Human Element. \" We'll talk some more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF GILAD HEKSELMAN'S \"DO RE MI FA SOL\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with photographer James Balog. His work is featured in the new documentary about the impact of climate change called \"The Human Element. \" There's an image in the film, and I believe this is video rather than still photography, but it appears to be a camera right in the middle of a stand of trees that's going up. And the camera is, I guess, on the ground or near the ground looking up through the trees as they go - they're absorbed in this fire. How did - was that acquired, you know? BALOG: Well, Dave, I did that shot, and we spent a couple summers trying to figure out how to do that. And we picked a spot where we knew the fire was advancing, pre-positioned the camera on the ground in front of the flames and turned it on and let it rip. And we had already burned up, melted a lot of cameras at that point - maybe five or six, I think. And this camera melted, too. But we had learned that even if the camera melted, if the fire moved fast enough, the flash card inside the memory card would survive, and we would still get a picture. So we went for broke. The fire moved right over the camera, passed by. Couple minutes later, it was gone. The camera's covered up with, you know, burning sticks and embers, but we still had a shot inside there. DAVIES: So what did you hear from firefighters from their own experience about how fires have changed in recent years? BALOG: Well, what you hear over and over and over again - whether it's young firefighters or old-timey firefighters who were not on the front lines anymore, but they're back managing these things - they all say the fires are bigger, there's more of them, the fire season lasts longer and the fire behavior is far different than it used to be. The fires are more violent, more ferocious. And of course, they've always been violent and ferocious, but there is a sense of sort of awe and humility in how they talk about these things. They're quite - I wouldn't say intimidated because intimidated means you go, oh, scary. I'm running away. These guys still get out there in spite of how intimidating it - the fires seem to the rest of us. They get out there, and they do it. DAVIES: Right - and not just guys, we'll note. There's one point where you're with some firefighters that are going to try and establish a line to stop a fire from going over a ridge and entering a town. And the strategy, I guess, is to actually burn the hillside near the town so that when the main fire gets there, it won't have the fuel. And this - you want to just describe what that amounts to and what your experience - it was photographing it? BALOG: Yeah. It's an incredible thing to be part of an operation like that. It's called a burn out. And we're up on top of a pretty sharp ridge, surrounded by very thick vegetation on either side of the ridge. And the fire is coming towards us from the west and burning down into a valley. And we know it's going to burn down into the valley and up the slope towards us. And in the opposite direction, as you said, there's a village that they're trying to keep from burning down. So the notion is to use fire to fight fire, and so we started to burn out all the vegetation between our ridge line and where that fire was coming from. And they burned out the fuels using helicopter torches that were dropping napalm on the forest and by throwing flares and shooting flares way deep into the vegetation. So the idea was to literally just torch the entire mountainside so that once the advancing flames hit that section, they would just go poof - can't move anymore. There's nothing else we can do. Now, what makes it so exciting is that there's a lot of heat. There's a lot of smoke coming up at you. And you know, one of the things you learn in firefighting school is you don't want to be on the top of a ridge with a fire below you because fires like to climb uphill. They feed on their heat, the convection of the flames. And you don't want to have a fire come roaring up a mountainside and fly right over you and start burning the vegetation behind you. That's how a lot of firefighters have been killed over the decades. So you know, we're doing what we have to do for the burn out. But you're still thinking, whoa, wait a minute. Wait a minute. We're not in such a good place right here. So everybody's really on their toes, you know, watching in all directions, staying situationally aware to make sure we've got some measure of control over what's going on around us. But always, you're wondering, oh, my god. Are we about to get trapped in here? Well, as it turned out, everything went right. We didn't get trapped. They burned it out, and the fire died where it was supposed to. And the village was saved. DAVIES: There are a couple of pretty harrowing moments, it looks like. How close did you come to getting burned? BALOG: I was very, very close to some flames because I was so captivated by the incredible power and beauty, frankly, at these gigantic walls of fire that I went in pretty close. Everybody else had backed away. All the seasoned firefighters had backed away 'cause they looked at these burning trees, and they said, man, that's too hot. I'm not going anywhere near there. But I went in, oh, to maybe 15 feet away from this big wall of flame. And I - after I was shooting for 30 seconds or so, I realized, my God, I may be melting the glue inside the lens here. And then I started to realize my hands feel like they're burning off. And so I backed off and got out of there. DAVIES: And that's the moment we see you running back towards the camera, right? BALOG: Yeah, shaking, waving my hands. And my crew was back behind me going, oh, Jim, you went too far on that one. DAVIES: Right. You also talked to a lot of victims, people who just saw their - all of their possessions and homes go up in smoke. You also talked to people who are victims of floods after hurricanes. And these are, you know, powerful, often heartbreaking stories. And I wonder if the fact that you're focused on the photography, on getting the shot right gives you some - not detachment - some emotional defense - that the emotions maybe come back when you see the images later. BALOG: Yeah. You - as a photographer, you have to show up, you have to function, you have to get the shot. And there's a little trick you play inside your mind, and you go, you know, I'm inside the black box right now. I'm just trying to frame this image inside the rectangle and make an interesting picture. And time is always short. You never feel like you have quite enough time. So you get your job done, and then it's at night, or it's a month later or a year later, and you reflect on this. And it still just tears at your heart. DAVIES: Yeah. On the other hand, I would think that when you're talking to people who've endured tragedies like this, they would want somebody who - with some empathy, not somebody who's, you know, just someone who's just there for the picture. BALOG: Yeah. The - one of the secrets of this field, whether you're a war photographer, or you're photographing natural disasters or whatever, is that people really want their stories to be told. They want you to come as a witness. And over and over again, there - I've seen for decades working on hurricanes and volcanoes and floods and all kinds of things, the tsunami in Indonesia, they want a witness to be there to say, here, this is what happened. This is the truth. DAVIES: You've spent decades looking at nature and humans' relationship with nature. As you're finishing this project, I'm wondering how your thinking has evolved about humans and their place in the natural order. BALOG: One of the biggest messages of this film is that we humans are part of nature. That's what you realize when you look at the four elements in the context of humanity. We're not separate from nature. We've been taught for thousands of years that we're separate, and we're looking in on nature. But I've come to realize - and the broader science that's around me has come to realize - we are in nature, not disjointed. And so in a way, I would like to think of this film as a coming-of-age story. I think we should look at the environment not through the lens of dreamy romanticism, and I don't think we should look at the environment through the lens of selfish extraction. Both of those kinds of things, dreaminess and selfishness, are juvenile. And I think the core issue of humanity for our time, at least as regards the environment but also as regards human health and a lot of other things, is that we need to grow out of those old patterns of thinking and grow into a more sophisticated, more complex understanding of what we are and who we are in relationship to nature. DAVIES: James Balog, thanks so much for speaking with us. BALOG: My pleasure. Thank you.

A tourism boom is changing the face of Japan. The number of visitors has nearly tripled in the past five years to about 30 million, and the country is scrambling to build enough hotels ahead of next year's Tokyo Olympics. NPR's Anthony Kuhn has been reporting in Kyoto about how this boom is uncovering that city's ancient riches. ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: Last summer, developers demolished the 570-year-old Jyokyo-ji Buddhist temple to make way for a hotel. Before they started construction, they gave archaeologist Koji Iesaki four months to dig up the site and salvage anything he could of historical value. We're now in the excavation pick. The workers are digging into a number of circles that have been outlined with chalk. What are these circles and what's in them? KOJI IESAKI: (Through interpreter) Those markings show the workers where to dig. I believe they should be the temple's pillars. We can tell from the color of the earth there. KUHN: Iesaki says he's dug through multiple layers of earth, taking him back in time to the Heian era, which began more than a thousand years ago. He's found images of mythical beasts carved on roof tiles, a moat that used to surround the temple in the Warring States period some 500 years ago and ritual vessels that held human organs. IESAKI: (Through interpreter) Anywhere you dig in Kyoto, you find a lot of stuff. The city has been continuously inhabited for 1,000 or 1,200 years. So it's like a treasure mountain. There are a lot of things used in people's daily lives. KUHN: Iesaki says that if the Jyokyo-ji Temple hadn't been torn down, he wouldn't get the chance to dig here. But, he adds, he doesn't have long to work before the hotel goes up and the treasure is reburied underneath it. Nearby, construction crews are renovating a hotel affiliated with Kyoto's historic Honnoji Temple, the site of a famous rebellion in 1582. The face of Kyoto is changing fast, as ancient temples and picturesque wooden townhouses come down and hotels and office buildings spring up. The city's infrastructure groans under the influx of tourists, and so do some Kyoto residents. But with Japan rapidly aging and depopulating, it needs the tourists' money. Near City Hall, Tomomitsu Umase (ph) is coordinating efforts to salvage cultural relics. He's a former archaeologist who runs a Kyoto city government department in charge of buried cultural treasures. TOMOMITSU UMASE: (Through interpreter) Post-war Japan has made great advances, not just in final written historical records, but also in digging up ancient remains. Development has allowed the excavation of relics. Then again, 99 percent of the artifacts have been destroyed because of development. KUHN: On the whole, Umase is gloomy about the building boom. The less development there is, he says, the more cultural treasures will be preserved for future generations to dig up. That got me thinking about the owner of the Jyokyo-ji Temple and his decision to tear it down. His name is Koki Mitsuyama. He's a 48-year-old priest in the Pure Land sect of Buddhism. When I meet him, he's wearing a traditional Japanese robe made of denim. He explains that the spiritual needs of the Buddhist faithful are changing. KOKI MITSUYAMA: (Through interpreter) Modern people care about getting benefits in this life, not the next. They want good things to happen to them today, tomorrow or next year, at the latest. KUHN: The Pure Land sect makes spirituality simple, Mitsuyama says. Just by chanting the Buddha's name, even sinners can make it to heaven or the Pure Land. Meanwhile, aging congregations can no longer support his temple with donations. So Mitsuyama will build a nine-story hotel with the first floor divided into a lobby on one side and a temple on the other. He'll use the hotel to fund the temple. It just so happens that Mitsuyama previously worked as an investment banker, and he's confident he's putting the temple on a firm financial footing for the future. He says he feels he was born to do this. MITSUYAMA: (Through interpreter) Changing people's ideas and coming up with new ways is part of the Pure Land sect's tradition of being original. This what I must do for the sect to help it prepare for the next century, and this is the right time to do it. KUHN: The hotel is due to open next June, just in time for the Olympics.

Scientists already knew there is a time the insects aren't interested in feeding, and one research team thought that if they could figure out why, they could potentially change the mosquitoes' behavior.

KENNEDY: Female mosquitoes are the ones that suck blood. Leslie Vosshall and her team at The Rockefeller University in New York wanted to trick them into thinking they'd just had a meal. The team thought that disinterested feeling in mosquitoes might be triggered by the same hormonal pathways that humans have.

VOSSHALL: So we just started calling different drug companies to see if they had drugs that were in the pipeline in human drug development that they could give us that we could test in mosquitoes. They all thought this was a really weird request, but several of them were on board and sent us drugs. KENNEDY: The team tested 24 different diet drugs, mixing them into a saline solution with a special ingredient that made it taste more like blood to mosquitoes. On the 18th kind, they hit the jackpot. VOSSHALL: And immediately saw that it worked, which was amazing. KENNEDY: For several days, mosquitoes that took the drug showed no interest in feeding.

UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Laughter). SQUYRES: I'm sorry. I'm just blown away by this. PALCA: Looking back, Squyres says Opportunity wasn't just a technical triumph. He says there were numerous scientific discoveries. SQUYRES: OK, I'll give you two. The first was right at the beginning at the landing site. PALCA: Squyres said Opportunity found evidence that briny water had once sloshed around on what is now a very dry planet. SQUYRES: The other thing was - then, years and years later, we got to the rim of a very ancient crater, which is where Opportunity is now. PALCA: There, Squyres says the rover found evidence of what's called hydrothermal events, where hot water percolates through rocks, changing their mineral content. But as important as Opportunity was for science, it was also important for the future of science. Squyres has given lots of talks about the mission. And he says, often, a young scientist or engineer will come up to him afterwards and say. . . SQUYRES: You know, when I was 8 years old, I saw you guys land on Mars, and it made me decide I wanted to do this. And that's happened to me not once or twice. It's happened to me a bunch of times. PALCA: Do this, meaning become a scientist. That's certainly what happened to Keri Bean. She was in high school when she saw a documentary about Opportunity called \"Roving Mars. \"KERI BEAN: I especially remember them showing the landing footage. And when they got the confirmation the spacecraft landed, they were all cheering. They were so excited. And I was really drawn to the idea of exploring and being so interested and caring about something that much. PALCA: Bean went to graduate school, where she worked on the rover as a student and ultimately landed a job at JPL, where she joined the Opportunity mission team. Last night, she helped send the last radio signals trying to wake up the rover. BEAN: Me, personally, it's been really hard because this is a project I've worked on for over a third of my life at this point. And so just to lose that all of a sudden is really tough. But at least it was Mars that killed her. It wasn't the rover failing or something else. It was Mars. And I feel like that's really the only appropriate death for her at this point.

SQUYRES: The other thing was - then, years and years later, we got to the rim of a very ancient crater, which is where Opportunity is now. PALCA: There, Squyres says the rover found evidence of what's called hydrothermal events, where hot water percolates through rocks, changing their mineral content. But as important as Opportunity was for science, it was also important for the future of science. Squyres has given lots of talks about the mission. And he says, often, a young scientist or engineer will come up to him afterwards and say. . . SQUYRES: You know, when I was 8 years old, I saw you guys land on Mars, and it made me decide I wanted to do this. And that's happened to me not once or twice. It's happened to me a bunch of times. PALCA: Do this, meaning become a scientist. That's certainly what happened to Keri Bean. She was in high school when she saw a documentary about Opportunity called \"Roving Mars. \" KERI BEAN: I especially remember them showing the landing footage. And when they got the confirmation the spacecraft landed, they were all cheering. They were so excited. And I was really drawn to the idea of exploring and being so interested and caring about something that much. PALCA: Bean went to graduate school, where she worked on the rover as a student and ultimately landed a job at JPL, where she joined the Opportunity mission team. Last night, she helped send the last radio signals trying to wake up the rover. BEAN: Me, personally, it's been really hard because this is a project I've worked on for over a third of my life at this point. And so just to lose that all of a sudden is really tough. But at least it was Mars that killed her. It wasn't the rover failing or something else. It was Mars. And I feel like that's really the only appropriate death for her at this point. PALCA: It was a good run, but it was going to end someday. And today's the day. Joe Palca, NPR News.

The overpopulation of deer has changed the way that forests look. And as NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports, the deer have also changed the way that forests sound. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Megan Gall is an ecologist at Vassar College. She's studied how birds react to human-created noise from nearby cars or overhead planes. After talking with a couple of colleagues who study how deer can consume the entire understory of a forest, she started wondering how that might change the soundscape. MEGAN GALL: So if you think about going into a gymnasium, there's lots of really hard surfaces. And sound will bounce all around. And that'll change how it hits your ear compared to going outside after a fresh snow; it'll be very quiet. And the same thing happens in forests versus other kinds of habitats. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Her colleagues already had two experimental areas set up inside a forest. One area was fenced off. The other was marked off but left open so that deer could enter and gobble up plants. Gall's team set up audio equipment in each place to test how the different environments affected the transmission of some basic sounds. GALL: All of these things are found in different kinds of animal sounds. And so we wanted to have sort of a very broad palette of sounds to look at. (SOUNDBITE OF BEEPS)GALL: One was just pure tone. So pure tones are like single notes. (SOUNDBITE OF WHITE NOISE)GALL: We're also looking at white noise, which covers a large range of frequency. And then we had trills. So trills are things you'll hear in a lot of bird songs. (SOUNDBITE OF TRILLS)GREENFIELDBOYCE: What they found is that sounds changed less when they travelled through areas grazed by deer. GALL: When deer were browsing, we actually found that the sound was clearer. And that's probably because there was less vegetation in the way. And so you don't have as many sounds bouncing off of leaves and sticks and things like that. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The results are published in a journal called PLOS One.

Bernie Lohr is a bioacoustics researcher at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. He says birds are known to change their songs in response to ambient noise near, say, airports.

But, you know, it's almost like there's something in our wiring - right? - as human beings - like we just heard Yassmin say - that make us biased. MARSHALL SHEPHERD: Oh, absolutely. I often think about marinades. We marinate our food to give it flavoring. I think that we are products of our own personal marinades in terms of our biases and how they evolve. RAZ: This is Marshall Shepherd. SHEPHERD: If you think about your personal marinade - your parents, your faith-based upbringing, your cultural or geographic marinades - all of those flavor who we become and what biases we have. RAZ: And Marshall says our beliefs and assumptions really do shape the information we seek out and share, especially scientific information. And he sees this all the time because Marshall is a climatologist, which also explains why he gets these two questions a lot. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SHEPHERD: Do you believe in climate change? Do you believe in global warming? RAZ: Here's more from Marshall Shepherd on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SHEPHERD: I have to gather myself every time I get that question because it's an ill-posed question. Science isn't a belief system. My son - he's 10. He believes in the tooth fairy. (LAUGHTER)SHEPHERD: Consider this. You never hear anyone say, do you believe if you go to the top of that building and throw a ball off, it's going to fall? You never hear that because gravity is a thing. (LAUGHTER)SHEPHERD: So why don't we hear the question, do you believe in gravity? But, of course, we hear the question, do you believe in global warming? Eighty-seven percent of scientists believe that humans are contributing to climate change but only 50 percent of the public. How do we get there? So it begs the question, what shapes perceptions about science? I think that one thing that shapes perceptions in the public about science is belief systems and biases. Belief systems and biases - go with me for a moment because I want to talk about three elements of that - confirmation bias, Dunning-Kruger effect and cognitive dissonance. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: So let's talk about confirmation bias. What - like, how does confirmation bias work? SHEPHERD: It's simply this notion that we seek out information that already confirms what we already think or believe. And you see that in the choices that people make about what radio or television station or news network they decide to listen to or what books they read or what websites they choose to visit. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SHEPHERD: I'm on Twitter. And often, when it snows, I'll get this tweet back to me. (LAUGHTER)SHEPHERD: Hey, Dr. Shepherd. I have 20 inches of global warming in my yard. What are you guys talking about climate change? It's a cute tweet. It makes me chuckle as well. But it's oh so fundamentally scientifically flawed because it illustrates that the person tweeting doesn't understand the difference between weather and climate. I often say weather is your mood. Climate is your personality. Your mood today doesn't necessarily tell me anything about your personality nor does a cold day tell me anything about climate change - or a hot day, for that matter. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SHEPHERD: You know, those are opportunities to increase science or climate literacy in those regards. They're cute, and they're funny. But it really is steeped in, you know, what we're talking about today. Someone that typically says that; one, doesn't understand the difference between weather and climate. But it also is an inherent bias that they probably have because they don't believe in climate change anyhow. RAZ: So in your talk, you also mentioned the Dunning-Kruger effect. What is that? How does that work? SHEPHERD: Dunning and Kruger were two professors at Cornell University - psychology professors, who published a paper several years ago. And they use all these fancy terms, saying the Dunning-Kruger effect is this notion of illusory superiority, blah, blah, blah, blah. In other words, the Dunning-Kruger effect is people think they know more than they do or they underestimate what they don't know about a topic. And we see this all of the time at Thanksgiving dinner or on Twitter. Twitter is a bastion of Dunning-Kruger (laughter). . . RAZ: (Laughter). SHEPHERD: . . . Because you have people giving information, establishing themselves as experts with no basis for that expertise at all. RAZ: Yeah. And I probably do this, too. I think a lot of. . . SHEPHERD: We all do it. RAZ: Yeah. Right? SHEPHERD: We all do it, yeah. RAZ: There are plenty of things that I encounter every day that I sort of weigh in on when, if I really think about it, I don't know as much about it as I think I do. SHEPHERD: Yeah. No, we all do this. I mean, I experience it quite a bit when it comes to weather forecasting and climate change. It's very pervasive. But, you know, as I step back, I say, look. You know, a couple months ago, I had a leak in my yard. And it turned out that the water line was leaking from the water box to the house. You know, I quickly surveyed the landscape and said, you know what? This is above my pay grade. I'm going to call a plumber (laughter). And so the point in that is, yeah, we all exhibit Dunning-Kruger. But let's kind of get back to this experts being experts on a topic. And that's an interesting conversation in itself because sometimes, I feel like we are in an era where people, actually, are hostile towards experts. They actually say that, oh, because you're an expert, you think you're better than me. No, that's not the case at all. I think we're equal human beings. But I think I know a little bit more about meteorology than you do. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: So, Marshall, finally, you talk about cognitive dissonance. And cognitive dissonance is like, you know, like, sort of having faith in something that is not necessarily rooted in reality, right? SHEPHERD: Oh, yeah. To me, one of the most sort of ultimate examples of cognitive dissonance is a fairly educated person that will walk up to me and say, yeah, you know, I think this climate change stuff is a hoax. I don't believe it at all. But oh, by the way, did you see the groundhog forecast today? What do you think about that? So I'd say, well, I think it's a rodent, first of all. You know, the ultimate cognitive dissonance is that you're dismissing science evidence about climate change, but then you're asking me about a rodent's forecast for the spring. I just - that - those are the types of things that are amusing, but I think that's really what we're dealing with. RAZ: You know, I wonder whether even the context of our conversation could be perceived - unfairly - but could be perceived as a liberal conversation because more liberals believe the science about climate change. SHEPHERD: Yeah. I just don't see the concept of being objective as a liberal or conservative paradigm. I wrote an article, for example, that showed that on some issues, there are those that see themselves as conservatives that may have certain views about, say, climate change. But if you look at vaccination issues and this notion that we shouldn't vaccinate our kids, you will find that some people that fall in those categories aren't conservative in other aspects of their lives at all. So I talk to conservative groups. I talk to liberal groups, policymakers of all ilk. And when you're talking to people about topics that - where you, from your perspective, aren't coming at it from a political angle, but maybe they're hearing it from a political angle - is you have to just try to connect the value system that resonates with them. So when I talk about climate change to a group of Republicans or conservatives, you know, I'm talking about economic issues, national security - whereas if I'm talking to a different group, I may talk more about the threat to polar bears or disease. So finding the value system at least tries to disarm those inherent biases or that inherent confirmation bias that your audience or listener may be coming from. RAZ: What happens - what's at stake if we don't work to at least recognize our biases? SHEPHERD: One of the things that I'm really concerned about, just as a society right now, is the tribalism that I see across the board. If we are not fighting off our biases, we're going to continue to divide. We're going to continue to make good science, information and knowledge the enemy. And that's scary because science, technology and engineering is not the enemy of the people. Virtually everyone listening to me right now is holding a smartphone. Virtually everyone that's listening to me consumed information from a weather forecast today or had some type of medical procedure that benefited from research and development or has a GPS system in their car. That's science. Those are things that make our lives better. But yet, this sort of bias that permeates the discussion about information and science is very dangerous because it is jeopardizing our ability to move society forward. RAZ: That's Marshall Shepherd. He's director of the atmospheric sciences program at the University of Georgia. You can see his full talk at ted. com.

And like many other problems, one way to get around our biases could be with technology because a lot of us assume that technology is always objective. ANDREAS EKSTROM: Well, we don't think that a machine has an opinion, and we forget that there's a programmer behind every machine that has told it how to prioritize. So that means that, you know, if you want to really run all the way with that ball, you can say that there's not a single search query that you can make that is unbiased because it's all an effect of what a real person has decided that the algorithm should do. RAZ: This is Andreas Ekstrom. EKSTROM: Yeah, I am a Swedish reporter and author turned speaker-educator. I try to understand a little bit about what's happening with society through the digital revolution. RAZ: Is it possible for anything or anyone or any search result to be totally unbiased, to be completely objective? I mean, is objectivity even possible? EKSTROM: Yes, for undisputed scientific facts. What is the capital of Sweden? It's Stockholm. There - that's undisputed. You can Google that, and I don't think you'll find a single website that will tell you differently. So yes, there are, but they're very singular, very isolated facts like that. You want to try to Google an answer to the question, why is there an armed conflict between Israel and Palestine? That's not a great thing to Google because that takes a lot of knowledge and historical context to even begin to understand. And sometimes we tend to mix these things up. What we're trying now, large scale, really, is we're trying to see, can we replace human judgment with an algorithm? We can gather the facts, sure. But can we gather knowledge the way we gather facts? Absolutely not. That's two completely different things. RAZ: Andreas Ekstrom picks up this idea from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TEDx TALK)EKSTROM: And to get to knowledge, you have to bring 10 or 20 or a hundred facts to the table and acknowledge them and say, yes, these are all true. But because of who I am - young or old, or black or white, or gay or straight - I will value them differently. And I will say, yes, this is true, but this is more important to me than that. And this is where it becomes interesting because this is where we become human. This is when we start to argue, to form society. And to really get somewhere, we need to filter all our facts here - through friends and neighbors and parents and children and coworkers and newspapers and magazines - to finally be grounded in real knowledge, which is something that a search engine is a poor help to achieve. RAZ: When we come back, Andreas Ekstrom explains how Google search results can be manipulated. On the show today, ideas about bias and perception. I'm Guy Raz, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about bias and perception. And before the break, we were hearing from the writer Andreas Ekstrom about the inherent bias in search engines and how they can't always tell the difference between what's true and what's popular. EKSTROM: A lot of the algorithm is based upon popularity. So if an answer to a question is really popular, then Google tends to think that it's also correct and relevant. And why? Well, because those people are super active and link to each other and update often, and all those things, you know, is credibility in the Google universe. RAZ: Andreas Ekstrom picks up his idea from the TED stage with a Google search. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)EKSTROM: We'll start by Michelle Obama, First Lady of the United States. And we'll click for pictures, say - perfect search result, more or less. It's just her in the picture, not even the president. How does this work? They look at two things more than anything. First, what does it say in the caption? What does it say under the picture on each website? Does it say Michelle Obama under the picture? Pretty good indication it's actually her on there. Second, Google looks at the picture file, the name of the file as such uploaded to the website. Again, is it called michelleobama. jpeg? Pretty good indication it's not Clint Eastwood in the picture. So you got those two, and you get a search result like this - almost. Now, in 2009, Michelle Obama was the victim of a racist campaign where people set out to insult her through her search results. There was a picture distributed widely over the Internet where her face was distorted to look like a monkey. And that picture was published all over, and people published it very, very purposefully to get it up here in the search result. They made sure to write Michelle Obama in the caption, and they made sure to upload the picture as michelleobama. jpeg or the like. So you get why - to manipulate the search result. And it worked too. So when you picture-Googled for Michelle Obama in 2009, that distorted monkey picture showed up among the first results. Now, the results are self-cleansing. And that's sort of the beauty of it because Google measures relevance every hour, every day. However, Google didn't settle for that this time. They just thought that's racist, and it's a bad search result. And we're going to go back and clean that up manually. We are going to write some code and fix it, which they did. And I don't think that anyone in this room thinks that that was a bad idea. Me neither. But then, couple of years go by. And the world's most Googled Anders, Anders Behring Breivik, did what he did. This is July 22nd in 2011 and a terrible day in Norwegian history. This man, a terrorist, blew up couple of government buildings, walking distance from where we are right now in Oslo, Norway. And he traveled out to the island of Utoya and shot and killed a group of kids. Almost 80 people died that day. And a lot of people would describe this act of terror as two steps, that he did two things - he blew up the buildings, and he shot those kids. It's not true. It was three steps. He blew up those buildings, he shot those kids, and he sat down and waited for the world to Google him. And if there was somebody who immediately understood this, it was a Swedish web developer, a search engine optimization expert, in Stockholm named Nikke Lindqvist. He told everybody, if there's something that this guy wants right now, it's to control the image of himself. Let's see if we can distort that. Let's see if we in the civilized world can protest against what he did through insulting him in his search results. And how? He told all of his readers the following. Go out there on the Internet, find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks, publish them in your feeds, on your websites, on your blogs. Make sure to write the terrorist's name in the caption. Make sure to name the picture file breivik. jpeg. Let's teach Google that that's the face of a terrorist. And it worked. Strangely enough, Google didn't intervene this time. They did not step in and manually clean those search results up. So the million-dollar question - is there anything different between these two happenings here? Is there anything different between what happened to Michelle Obama and what happened to Anders Behring Breivik? Of course not. It's the exact same thing, yet Google intervened in one case and not in the other. RAZ: In this example of Anders Breivik and Michelle Obama, I think most of us would say, yeah, that was a right thing to do, right? You don't want. . . EKSTROM: Sure. RAZ: . . . One, and you do want the other thing to happen. So - but I guess what you're arguing is that, yes, in this case, it is a good outcome. But what if it's a - more of a gray area, right? Like, what happens then? EKSTROM: Yeah. And this is - and I use the example just because it's so easy to just - we can agree, you know, that a mass murderer is not somebody that we need to look after a whole lot when it comes to his search results, right? We don't have to care so much about that because he - maybe he has consumed those rights, if you will. However, just make it a little more difficult. Let's just, you know, make it about two regular people who are fighting for the same political office, or let's just make it whatever we want to make it. Immediately, you get to a point where you have to say, well, Google, you did manually actually change this. That means that you have an opinion. You have a bias. And that makes you editors, you know? So let's just take an easy example. If you google for the Holocaust, you don't immediately see the worst cases of people saying that it never happened, right? So they have actually manually gone into their search results just to make sure that people who said the Holocaust was a hoax, they don't get that top-ranking space. And everybody, you know, would say that, OK, well, that was a good decision, right? Because that's a hoax, and those people are bad people, and of course we should do that. I agree with that. But then that also means that, you know, human judgment has just taken place. Where do we draw the line? Where - what else, Google? You know, there are other bad things out there. What else is it that you shouldn't be linking to? What else is there? And the moment where Google accept that they have that responsibility, oh, congratulations, you're the editors of the world. RAZ: I think I understand your point here. But, I mean, what do you expect Google or anyone in that position to do? To not intervene? EKSTROM: I'd like to - for the battle to be not necessarily to fight bias because I think maybe that's impossible. There are just some experiences that are so profound and so - they're shaping us so strongly that I think that we can probably never be completely neutral and free from them. And you know what? I'm not even sure that I would want to be that person. I'd like to - I don't mind carrying a set of values with me. I think maybe that's a part of being human. But how about making sure that we're already aware that we have them and then be able to talk about them and identify when they come into play and really mess with our judgment? Because it - you know, sometimes that happens. That would be probably a better starting point or even a better end goal. Let's just agree that this is something that we all have and carry. Let's make sure that it doesn't influence us in an unhealthy way. RAZ: That's Andreas Ekstrom. He's a journalist and author of several books in Swedish, including \"The Google Code. \" You can see his full talk at ted. com. GUY RAZ, HOST:  On the show today, ideas about the biases we carry and the ways we try to address them. And like many other problems, one way to get around our biases could be with technology because a lot of us assume that technology is always objective. ANDREAS EKSTROM: Well, we don't think that a machine has an opinion, and we forget that there's a programmer behind every machine that has told it how to prioritize. So that means that, you know, if you want to really run all the way with that ball, you can say that there's not a single search query that you can make that is unbiased because it's all an effect of what a real person has decided that the algorithm should do. RAZ: This is Andreas Ekstrom. EKSTROM: Yeah, I am a Swedish reporter and author turned speaker-educator. I try to understand a little bit about what's happening with society through the digital revolution. RAZ: Is it possible for anything or anyone or any search result to be totally unbiased, to be completely objective? I mean, is objectivity even possible? EKSTROM: Yes, for undisputed scientific facts. What is the capital of Sweden? It's Stockholm. There - that's undisputed. You can Google that, and I don't think you'll find a single website that will tell you differently. So yes, there are, but they're very singular, very isolated facts like that. You want to try to Google an answer to the question, why is there an armed conflict between Israel and Palestine? That's not a great thing to Google because that takes a lot of knowledge and historical context to even begin to understand. And sometimes we tend to mix these things up. What we're trying now, large scale, really, is we're trying to see, can we replace human judgment with an algorithm? We can gather the facts, sure. But can we gather knowledge the way we gather facts? Absolutely not. That's two completely different things. RAZ: Andreas Ekstrom picks up this idea from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TEDx TALK) EKSTROM: And to get to knowledge, you have to bring 10 or 20 or a hundred facts to the table and acknowledge them and say, yes, these are all true. But because of who I am - young or old, or black or white, or gay or straight - I will value them differently. And I will say, yes, this is true, but this is more important to me than that. And this is where it becomes interesting because this is where we become human. This is when we start to argue, to form society. And to really get somewhere, we need to filter all our facts here - through friends and neighbors and parents and children and coworkers and newspapers and magazines - to finally be grounded in real knowledge, which is something that a search engine is a poor help to achieve. RAZ: When we come back, Andreas Ekstrom explains how Google search results can be manipulated. On the show today, ideas about bias and perception. I'm Guy Raz, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about bias and perception. And before the break, we were hearing from the writer Andreas Ekstrom about the inherent bias in search engines and how they can't always tell the difference between what's true and what's popular. EKSTROM: A lot of the algorithm is based upon popularity. So if an answer to a question is really popular, then Google tends to think that it's also correct and relevant. And why? Well, because those people are super active and link to each other and update often, and all those things, you know, is credibility in the Google universe. RAZ: Andreas Ekstrom picks up his idea from the TED stage with a Google search. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) EKSTROM: We'll start by Michelle Obama, First Lady of the United States.

The Mars rover known as Opportunity was officially announced dead. The original mission was to learn more about Mars. It launched alongside its twin, Spirit, in 2003 before we knew much about the Red Planet. Opportunity was expected to last on Mars for 90 days. But the little rover that could, as it's called, ended up staying there for 14 years, covering a marathon's worth of Martian territory. DAVE LAVERY: This project has been a central part of my professional life for the last 20 years. MARTIN: That's Dave Lavery, who's been on Opportunity's team since the very beginning. LAVERY: These two robots - they became family members to us over the years. And Opportunity very quickly became known as Oppy. And both the rovers are female. They're not it. They're she. MARTIN: Oppy provided a window into Mars, making discoveries along the way. One of the biggest - at one point, Mars had liquid flowing water, suggesting it could have sustained life. She also posed new challenges to the NASA team, including keeping track of Martian time. LAVERY: We actually had special watches created that kept Mars time, and several of us who were working on both Spirit and Opportunity ended up wearing four different watches - one for Pacific Coast Time, one maybe for East Coast time, if our office was back home, one for Spirit time and one for Opportunity time. MARTIN: The rover itself had some quirks. At some point during its 14-plus years on Mars, one of its wheel motors started wearing out, and the team, including associate administrator Thomas Zurbuchen, started to worry the wheel may get stuck. THOMAS ZURBUCHEN: So what the rover actually had to do is go backwards. So most of this journey, that marathon, it did in reverse. MARTIN: In the end, the rover experienced a Martian storm so dark and cold the team at NASA thinks the internal batteries were altered beyond repair. Dave Lavery says Oppy's last communication with the team was grim. LAVERY: I'm getting cold. It's getting dark. My battery levels are getting low. And sort of here's how fast things are dropping. MARTIN: But Zurbuchen says the rover's legacy will live on, especially in helping plan future trips to Mars. ZURBUCHEN: Mars 2020 is the first leg of a round trip, the first round trip to Mars ever - a historic moment. MARTIN: On the final day of attempted communication with Opportunity, the team did what they had done every morning for 14 years. They sent the rover a wakeup song, like ground control does for human flight crews during a mission. But this time, they knew the rover wouldn't wake up. The song they chose - Billie Holiday's \"I'll Be Seeing You. \" Thanks, Oppy - mission accomplished.

This is a hard day, Opportunity's project manager, John Callas, told reporters. Even though it's a machine and we're saying goodbye, it's still very hard and very poignant. Opportunity and its cousin rover, Spirit, both landed on Mars in January of 2004. They were supposed to carry on for just three months, scratching and scouring for less than a mile over the Martian landscape. But Spirit roamed for almost five miles and lasted six years.

And I wanted to get them to dance. So I tapped into their competitive spirit. SIMON: And as a generalization, are scientists gifted dancers? BOHANNON: (Laughter) I think in general, they're exhibitionists. If you're willing to stand up and defend some crazy, obscure research topic that you've devoted your life to, then there's probably something in you that wants to dance. SIMON: Well, we don't want to delay anymore. We want to introduce the winning entry, a gentleman who authored a paper - I know you'll all go about your Saturday humming this title - \"Impact Of Nonlocal Electrodynamics And Flux Noise And Inductance Of Superconducting Wires. \" It has, however, been transformed into \"Superconductivity: The Musical! \"(SOUNDBITE OF MUSICAL, \"SUPERCONDUCTIVITY: THE MUSICAL! \")PRAMODH SENARATH YAPA: (Singing) These electrons have a predilection to shirk that sociable connection. Some non-interacting loners they can be. SIMON: Oh, come on, you just can't stay in bed any longer after listening to that, can you? This wonderous tableau of music and dancing electrons was created by Pramodh Senarath Yapa. Mr. Senarath Yapa is now working on his Ph. D. at the University of Alberta in Edmonton. He joins us from the studios of the CBC in that great city. Thanks so much for being with us, Mr. Senarath Yapa. SENARATH YAPA: Great to be here. Thank you for having me. SIMON: Describe this video for us, if you can. SENARATH YAPA: Yeah. So it is a look at the social lives of electrons in three acts. It starts off with electrons in a normal metal, just being very unsociable as they are. SIMON: You mean, like, cold to each other, distant, not receptive, that sort of thing. SENARATH YAPA: Yeah, they just completely ignore each other and don't pay attention to any of their neighbors. As the weather changes and it becomes a little chilly outside, as it is in Edmonton right now, they feel a need for companionship. And they pair up, essentially. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSICAL, \"SUPERCONDUCTIVITY: THE MUSICAL! \")SENARATH YAPA: (Singing) Super-duper Cooper pairs. (Singing in French). And they're much happier that way. And they keep dancing throughout the wire. These electrons form something called Cooper pairs. And in the final act, I bring in some final punk impurities. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSICAL, \"SUPERCONDUCTIVITY: THE MUSICAL! \")SENARATH YAPA: (Singing) The spin impurities come marching in. SENARATH YAPA: . . . Which are just some unhappy little dirt particles that are in superconductors. And they really don't like it when Cooper pairs are near them. And they get very angry and make a lot of noise. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSICAL, \"SUPERCONDUCTIVITY: THE MUSICAL! \")UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (Crosstalk, unintelligible). SENARATH YAPA: By listening to this noise, you can figure out what the Cooper pairs are exactly doing. And that's the topic of my research. SIMON: You wrote the music? SENARATH YAPA: I did write the music. So I've been playing guitar and recording music for something like 13 years now - super into jazz. So yeah, I wrote all of the music and recorded it in my bedroom over the course of six weeks last year. SIMON: Mr. Bohannon, can we work in another question to you? BOHANNON: You bet. SIMON: I know you weren't a judge. But what do you think got to the judges about this routine? BOHANNON: This year was special because we had not only a great dance. Pramodh really just had a wonderful, wonderful dance that did these two jobs that we're always trying to do at once with the contest - not only explain science but actually entertain you. SIMON: To be clear, though, Mr. Senarath Yapa, you just can't do this as a dance, right? You have to also, like, come up with papers and that sort of stuff. SENARATH YAPA: Yeah, I have actually published in an academic journal. So if you want to go read that, the paper should be out in Physical Review Applied soon. But this is also a nice way to think about what's going on at the subatomic level in these really esoteric physics concepts. SIMON: So you can download the scientific dissertation, or you can download the dance. SENARATH YAPA: Yeah, or you can do both. SIMON: John Bohannon is with Science magazine and is the founder of the contest. Thanks so much for being with us. BOHANNON: Thank you. SIMON: And Pramodh Senarath Yapa is the winner of this year's Dance Your Ph. D. contest. May your life be filled with dance and good physics. SENARATH YAPA: Thank you very much.

If we peek, when the Cooper pairs. . . SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  You know, sometimes a dissertation just isn't enough. A Ph. D. has to get up and dance. This weekend, at The American Association for the Advancement of Science Convention, they have announced this year's winner of the Dance Your Ph. D. contest, co-sponsored by Science magazine. We will introduce you to the academic with the most dazzling footwork in a moment. But first, we're going to speak with John Bohannan. He launched the contest, now in its 11th year.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GARCIA-NAVARRO: And today, we're actually going to take you out of this world and into space for an interview. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Station, this is Houston ACR. Please stand by for a voice check from NPR. GARCIA-NAVARRO: This interview is for all the grown-ups like me who once wanted to fly above the Earth and didn't make it and all the little kids today who want to try. UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT: It's all the way out in space. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: This is. . . GARCIA-NAVARRO: Station, this is Lulu Garcia-Navarro at Georgetown Day School in Washington, D. C. Can you hear me? ANNE MCCLAIN: I hear you just fine. Good day to you. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Astronaut Anne McClain has been serving on the International Space Station since December, which is where she joined us from earlier this week via satellite. And here on Earth, we spoke to her from a pre-K and kindergarten class. And we chose that location for a reason, as we explained in our interview. UNIDENTIFIED STUDENTS: Hello. GARCIA-NAVARRO: We wanted to talk to you from a classroom today because we read an interview with your mom, who said that according to family legend, you announced on your first day of preschool that you wanted to be an astronaut. Is that a true story? MCCLAIN: That is an absolutely true story. And, you know, you can't make it up. I told her that I was going to school to learn to be an astronaut. And that was my focus. And by the time I was 5 or 6 years old, I wrote a little book about flying to space on the Soyuz vehicle. So dreams and maybe even predictions do come true. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What was it like when you finally got into space after that lifelong dream? MCCLAIN: You know, it is such a profound experience in my life. I will probably spend the rest of my life trying to find the right words to describe it. And I think words almost do it injustice. It was this combination of complete awe of looking back at the planet and understanding the context in which I had lived for so long - it was suddenly gone. And I was in a completely different environment, totally reliant on so many thousands of people in the different space agencies to keep me safe. And then there was just the human side of me that was - it was the first time in my whole life that there was no doubt that I would get there because I was already there. I think up until the moment that you launch, so many of us are thinking, you know, there - maybe there's a reason. Something's going to happen. I'm not going to go. I'm going to have a medical issue. You know, they're going to delay the launch. But when you are finally in space and you're finally looking back at Earth and you realize for the first time in your life there's nothing standing between you and your dream, it's just so hard to describe the profound impact of that. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So can you tell us what you are seeing right now when you look outside the window? Where are you flying over? MCCLAIN: Well, since we started this interview, we have flown a quarter of the way around the world. We fly around the world 16 times a day. We have a sunrise and a sunset every 45 minutes. And by far, my favorite thing to see that I've been surprised at is watching the moon rises and moon sets that just move so fast. It's like it jumps off of the horizon and up and over us. And it's just my favorite thing to see. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So the class can see you on NASA TV right now. And they can see that, you know, you're floating. What's the coolest thing that you can do while you float? MCCLAIN: Well, I tell you what. There is - every day is a good day when you're floating. Your whole life you spend walking around Earth. And then all of a sudden, you get to fly like you've dreamed of. And we try to do all sorts of tricks. We try to see how far we can fly without hitting the walls. And sometimes, I just like to do some work upside down. You know, maybe I'll do the rest of the interview upside down just for the kids in the classroom. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And no surprise, the kids loved watching her talk with the darkness of space all around her. And they also had a few questions for Anne McClain. TESSA: My name's Tessa (ph). I'm 5. What do you eat? And what's your favorite food? MCCLAIN: Well, you know, if we sat down with a bowl of rice like we would on Earth - right? - all that rice would just rise off the plate. And so we eat everything out of pouches. And we have two types of pouches that we fly. One is what we call shelf-stabilized food, which is just - it's like a pouch that you open up and you can spoon out and start eating it. And so my favorite food - we have a great chicken with a peanut sauce that's really good. We have chicken fajitas that are really good. And then the other type of food that we fly up - or it's dried food. And so some of my favorites are the mushroom soup. And we have a great turkey tetrazzini. So we have a huge amount. I think we have over a hundred different kinds of food. So they try to keep it so we don't get too bored with the food up here. LULETE: My name is Lulete (ph). I'm 5. How do you sleep? Is it hard to sleep in space? MCCLAIN: That is different for everybody. So I sleep about six or seven hours a night here. I sleep a lot more than that on Earth. And I don't think it's because I'm uncomfortable. I think it's because when I kind of wake up in the morning, I'm so excited to be up and to be in space that I just want to start my day and get going. So sleeping is very - it's very interesting. You know, you kind of just float inside of your sleeping bag. And you attach your sleeping bag to the wall, otherwise you'd float around to the other side of the space station, or maybe one of my crewmates would play a joke on me and pull me out and move me somewhere else. So I attach myself to the wall. And then our arms kind of float up. So we look a little bit like zombies. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Do you have any message for your fans here back on Earth? MCCLAIN: Absolutely. I tell you what. You can do - you really can do anything that you put your mind to. And I knew I wanted to be an astronaut already when I was your age. And so the dreams that you have right now very well could be in your future. And the biggest thing is to not give up no matter what anybody tells you, no matter what circumstances are sent your way. No matter what happens, you stay focused on that goal. And if you stay focused on that goal, you can shape your life in that direction. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Class, we want to think astronaut Anne McClain joining us from the International Space Station. Everyone say thank you. UNIDENTIFIED STUDENTS: Thank you. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Anne McClain ended her interview by waving at these potential future astronauts while floating away upside down.

Take the infamous 1998 study by a British scientist that suggested a link between childhood vaccines and autism. It was retracted more than a decade later. And its author Andrew Wakefield had his medical license revoked. But the myth that vaccines cause autism persists today with serious public health consequences. It's this kind of bad science that James Heathers is constantly looking out for. He's a postdoctoral researcher in behavioral science at Northeastern University. And he's been influential in catching mistakes in publications and getting those papers retracted. Heathers says there are two ways he can tell a paper might have a problem. JAMES HEATHERS: One is your kind of spider sense as a researcher, which is very difficult to explain. It's a series of heuristics, I suppose, kind of mental shortcuts about what might be wrong with something when you read it. And a lot of the time, it tips you off into the second thing that you do. And the second thing that you do is try to mathematically determine if there's anything in the paper that you see that's inconsistent, if there's a test that doesn't work or numbers that can't exist or something similar to that at least. Between the two of those and, of course, the fact that researchers will tell you sometimes if they have papers in their areas that they don't trust - they think - have problems with - sometimes, they will tell someone like me. GARCIA-NAVARRO: But isn't there already a system in place for this? I mean, if you get published in a peer-reviewed journal, that is literally you putting your paper out into the scientific community, and then people get to comment. HEATHERS: Well, that's absolutely what it is. And that's also not the end of the story. Peer review, a lot of the time, is very necessary and very good. The problem with it, when it comes to research that's really bad, is that it's not really designed to detect problems. It's done with the assumption that everything that underlies the research is just fine. It's conducted under a kind of an umbrella of trust. There's not really a culture of strong criticism of bad science that happens through peer review. The other thing that happens, of course, is that if you - if I write a paper and the paper is deeply problematic and it's rejected from a journal and the journal writes back to the author and says, no, look. We don't believe any of this. This is wrong. This was done incorrectly. These have mistakes that we can't explain - all the authors will do is send it somewhere else. This is called journal shopping sometimes. It happens, of course, with papers that are perfectly fine and accurate as well. But eventually, there's a - there's kind of a saying in science is you can get almost anything published somewhere. GARCIA-NAVARRO: James, the Wakefield study was eventually retracted. But science is a discipline that builds on itself - right? - with new research citing old research. Have you ever found anything like that, something so egregious that could have an effect on public health? HEATHERS: There are things that are very similar to that. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's very ominous. HEATHERS: Well, if that sounds ominous, it probably should. Bad medical studies can tip larger results one way or another. So imagine we have six studies, and one of them is problematic for some reason. And when we add up the results of all the six studies and we do a meta-analysis, that one, individual, bad study changes the outcome of the meta-analysis. That can influence how governments buy drugs, how frontline hospital care is conducted and what is considered to be standard care as evidence-based or not so evidence-based. So at its absolute worst, there's very definitely problems like that that exist right now. I'm afraid I can't really speculate any further than that. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Right now. HEATHERS: Right now - watch this space. GARCIA-NAVARRO: James Heathers is a fellow at Northeastern University. And he is the host of a podcast \"Everything Hertz. \" Everyone's got a podcast. Thanks so much. HEATHERS: (Laughter) You're welcome. Thank you. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:  Now we're going to look at the staying power of bad science and a group of volunteers trying to fight it.

HEATHERS: Well, that's absolutely what it is. And that's also not the end of the story. Peer review, a lot of the time, is very necessary and very good. The problem with it, when it comes to research that's really bad, is that it's not really designed to detect problems. It's done with the assumption that everything that underlies the research is just fine. It's conducted under a kind of an umbrella of trust. There's not really a culture of strong criticism of bad science that happens through peer review. The other thing that happens, of course, is that if you - if I write a paper and the paper is deeply problematic and it's rejected from a journal and the journal writes back to the author and says, no, look. We don't believe any of this. This is wrong. This was done incorrectly. These have mistakes that we can't explain - all the authors will do is send it somewhere else. This is called journal shopping sometimes. It happens, of course, with papers that are perfectly fine and accurate as well. But eventually, there's a - there's kind of a saying in science is you can get almost anything published somewhere. GARCIA-NAVARRO: James, the Wakefield study was eventually retracted. But science is a discipline that builds on itself - right? - with new research citing old research. Have you ever found anything like that, something so egregious that could have an effect on public health? HEATHERS: There are things that are very similar to that. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's very ominous. HEATHERS: Well, if that sounds ominous, it probably should. Bad medical studies can tip larger results one way or another. So imagine we have six studies, and one of them is problematic for some reason. And when we add up the results of all the six studies and we do a meta-analysis, that one, individual, bad study changes the outcome of the meta-analysis. That can influence how governments buy drugs, how frontline hospital care is conducted and what is considered to be standard care as evidence-based or not so evidence-based. So at its absolute worst, there's very definitely problems like that that exist right now. I'm afraid I can't really speculate any further than that. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Right now. HEATHERS: Right now - watch this space. GARCIA-NAVARRO: James Heathers is a fellow at Northeastern University. And he is the host of a podcast \"Everything Hertz. \" Everyone's got a podcast. Thanks so much. HEATHERS: (Laughter) You're welcome. Thank you.", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Practice makes perfect. If you want to be good at something, you need to put in the work. Or, do you? Increasingly, people feel they can master tasks simply by watching instructional videos, like the kind you find on YouTube. But as NPR's Shankar Vedantam reports, sometimes the gap between perception and reality can be deep and wide. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: In most areas of his life, Jon Sharp is a doer, not a watcher. When he bought his first house in Homer, Alaska, some years ago, he made sure to get one with a garage so he could build a woodshop inside it. It's tiny, but he's proud of it. JON SHARP: Right now, I've got a nice 14-inch band saw, a 3-horsepower cabinet saw. I've got some Festool products, which are very high-end. VEDANTAM: He's also got another important tool. SHARP: When I get an idea or I see something that I want to build, I definitely go right to YouTube. VEDANTAM: That's right - YouTube. He likes to watch instructional videos to learn a few tips and find inspiration. SHARP: And I've got, you know, probably three or four projects that are just, you know, halfway complete or, in the queue, if you will. VEDANTAM: But Sharp also teaches sixth grade. He's usually exhausted after a full day in the classroom. And so he's been finding himself spending less time in his shop and more time on his couch just watching those how-to videos. SHARP: And what I do is, I usually use it to decompress after work. So I go home, open up YouTube. You know, like, the other night, I was watching a how-to-build-a-barn-door cause I'm also building one in my house, and I thought, I just want to get different ideas. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)BRUCE ULRICH: What's going on, everybody? I'm Bruce Ulrich. Welcome back. In today's video, I'm going to show you how. . . SHARP: And it just becomes, like, this vortex where I'm just, like, there's one cool one. . . (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: I love sliding barn doors. SHARP: Look, there's a different one. I'll watch that one. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: I built this out of an ambrosia maple slab. It's not actually one big slab. SHARP: And then, you know, it seems like 30 to 45 minutes have passed while I watch videos on, you know, people fixing car engines. . . (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: How to super-clean your engine bay. So clean that you'll be able to eat off of it. SHARP: . . . Or how to build decks. . .

(SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Hey, guys. This is my kitchen. As you can tell. . . SHARP: . . . And it's just non-stop. It's just - I mean, I could be on there hours and hours, and just - and on a weekday, I'll usually watch, on average, two hours. But on a weekend, if I don't have a lot going on, you know, I will watch four to five hours, easily, in a day. VEDANTAM: It's relaxing, but watching videos like these also offers an escape, the chance to step into another life. To live, as it were, vicariously. ED O'BRIEN: We live in a world now where you don't just have to sit around thinking about stuff. You can actually log online, and with the click of a button get some taste of that experience yourself. VEDANTAM: This is Ed O'Brien. He's a social psychologist at the University of Chicago. Along with his colleague, Michael Kardas, he studies people's intuitions about what a new experience will feel like. O'Brien and Kardas started to wonder about instructional videos and whether there was a gap between the perception of learning and actual learning. Or to put it more simply. . . O'BRIEN: Does this stuff work? VEDANTAM: The researchers had a hunch that people might overestimate their own abilities after watching how-to videos. They based this on real-life experience and a simple truism. O'BRIEN: It's a lot easier to watch somebody do something than it is to actually do it yourself. VEDANTAM: To test their hypothesis, they devised a series of experiments. In one case, they had volunteers watch a short video of a person throwing a dart. O'BRIEN: And the dart lands perfectly in the bull's-eye. VEDANTAM: Some of the volunteers watched the video just once, but others watched it 20 times in a row. O'BRIEN: So you see this bulls'-eye over, and over and over again. VEDANTAM: People who watched the video repeatedly were more confident that they would score a bulls'-eye on their first throw. They were wrong. O'BRIEN: There was absolutely no effect of video-watching on actual performance. VEDANTAM: That's a nice way of saying they were dismal at darts. O'Brien and Kardas tried other tests, like asking people to watch instructional videos with step-by-step instructions for juggling. Or like this one. . . (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: All right, guys. Here we go. Want music. Five, six. Five, six. VEDANTAM: . . . For dancing the moonwalk. Again, those who watched the video 20 times felt confident. O'BRIEN: You come away thinking, I bet I'm going to nail this. I'm going to get a really high score when I jump in and try the moonwalk. VEDANTAM: Nope. Incorrect. Volunteers realized very quickly that the moonwalk was much harder than they thought it was going to be. (SOUNDBITE OF RESEARCH STUDY)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #7: If I can keep my balance. (Laughter). VEDANTAM: Not only did they find it difficult, a panel of judges could see no difference between the skills of moonwalkers who had watched the videos repeatedly and those who hadn't. In fact, they all scored pretty much like the dart throwers. O'BRIEN: Participants, whether you watched once or 20 times, didn't do very well. VEDANTAM: Over and over, the researchers saw the same results. O'Brien says there's something about seeing someone perform a difficult task well. It seems to convince people that they have learned everything to perform the same task. O'BRIEN: We feel confident because we've memorized the steps. And what we forget to do is adjust for the fact that those steps feel like something, upon taking them, that change the experience when we jump in. VEDANTAM: They found this wasn't the case when people learned in other ways. Reading an instruction manual or thinking about a trick didn't produce the same overconfidence. The researchers also discovered a small tweak that could reduce overconfidence. All it took was a quick taste of the actual experience. So for example, the researchers added one step after volunteers watched the juggling video. O'BRIEN: So in this study, it was as simple as having participants hold a bowling pin for a few minutes. So not even actually trying to juggle, but just hold this bowling pin for a few minutes. VEDANTAM: One little reality check was enough to remind people that watching is not the same as doing. In his heart of hearts, Jon Sharp already knows this. He says that when he's watching how-to videos instead of working in a shop, he feels like he's losing something. SHARP: When I watch the video, what I think I'm losing is, I'm losing the ability to gain the skill. I think I'm tricking my mind to think that, you know, I'm getting that skill. I watched the video. I know how to do it. In reality, that's not true. VEDANTAM: Where he knows he should be is out there in his woodshop, finishing those half-done projects. Shankar Vedantam, NPR News.

NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on July 20, 1969, and moon walked for about 2 1/2 hours. Their feet left trails in the dust. You can still see them in satellite images. The astronauts also left tools, a plaque saying, we came in peace for all mankind, an American flag that's probably been bleached white by decades of harsh ultraviolet rays. The whole landing site is a dusty time capsule of a momentous event in human history. Michelle Hanlon says it deserves special recognition. MICHELLE HANLON: There has never been historic preservation off our planet. It's a really difficult subject. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Hanlon is a space lawyer at the University of Mississippi. She says any nation can nominate a place to go on the UN's list of precious world heritage sites, as long as that place is within the nation's sovereign territory. The trouble is a 1967 treaty says the moon is a no man's land. HANLON: Under the Outer Space Treaty, no nation can claim sovereignty over anything in outer space by any means whatsoever. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Oh, the U. S. still owns its property in outer space. But it has no control over the lunar landscape. HANLON: So while the U. S. can argue, don't touch our flags, anybody can go up and run right over all of those boot prints and rover tracks. And I just thought that was a travesty. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That's why Hanlon co-founded a historic preservation group called For All Moonkind. It has observer status with the U. N. Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. Last week, she spoke to one of its subcommittees about the need to preserve not just the Apollo 11 site but also Luna 2, a Soviet spacecraft that was the first human-made object to touch the moon. It landed there 60 years ago this September. Hanlon wants the committee to formally recognize the special nature of both sites in time for their anniversaries. HANLON: What we need to do is find one country that is willing to sponsor our mission, if you will. We have no power as an observer to suggest that a resolution be put together. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Her team will be pushing for this at another subcommittee meeting in April and at a meeting of the full committee in June.

He says in 1969, the Apollo 12 astronauts visited Surveyor 3, a probe that landed a couple years earlier. PHILIP METZGER: And the astronauts walked over, cut pieces off and brought those back to Earth. GREENFIELDBOYCE: This was to study the effects of long-term exposure to the lunar environment. Now, Apollo 12 had landed more than 500 feet from Surveyor so that dust and rocks kicked up by its rocket engine wouldn't hit the probe. METZGER: They thought that would be far enough. They thought 500 feet would keep the Apollo 12 from sandblasting the Surveyor. So when they got the pieces back and they saw how damaged it was, it was a shock. GREENFIELDBOYCE: So much dust had been blasted into it by the landing, the spacecraft turned from white to brown.

Y. Welcome to the program. BOB BERMAN: Well, thank you, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what prompted you to write a book full of so many cataclysms? BERMAN: Well, I keep hearing - when I'm doing lectures or when I was running this community observatory, people would always be worried about things colliding with Earth. And some of them were imaginary. Like, there's this imaginary planet Nibiru that supposedly is on a collision course. And so I realized that there's a lot of juice and interest in it. GARCIA-NAVARRO: There is - and a lot of movies about it, too. I mean, I'm a personal fan of the sort of end-of-the-world scenario movies. So let's go through a few disastrous greatest hits. There's the Big Bang, of course. But much more recently, many more stars have gone supernova, including one that was visible by humans in the 11th century. Tell us about that. BERMAN: Yeah. And that was big because not only did nobody see it coming, but it was the brightest light in the sky that's ever been seen in terms of a point source - something that looked like a star. It easily cast shadows. It was much brighter than Venus looks. Now we know it's a supernova. But they didn't even have that word back then. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What did they think it was? BERMAN: It was not good. That's for sure. GARCIA-NAVARRO: A bad omen. BERMAN: Yes. Changes in the sky were always bad things. And usually, the worst they had to put up with were comets every 15 to 20 years. But this was off the charts entirely. GARCIA-NAVARRO: But supernovas actually do - you write - some good for humans. BERMAN: Oh, yeah. They end up being good. In the short term, they completely incinerate their solar system - so part of the good news, bad news thing. But they do create every element that's heavier than iron. So the iodine, for example, in our thyroid glands in our necks right now could only have come from a supernova. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Amazing. What was the most surprising thing while you were looking into this? What was the thing that you thought, wow, I had no idea that this was something that was so devastating to humanity? BERMAN: Maybe it was the 1918 Spanish Flu because - concerning that was an H1N1 ordinary-type flu not too different from the kind that goes around in our own lifetimes - you wouldn't think that the flu could ever suddenly get so virulent that it would destroy one or two percent of the Earth's population. So that was fascinating to me. Another was something that was very reassuring. I found that in really studying the nuclear power plant accidents that make up a few of our chapters, things were not as bad as they were made out to be. For example, in the Fukushima what we call disaster, the real disaster was in the tsunami - the tidal wave that came earlier that day from the greatest earthquake that has ever hit Japan. That's what produced all the loss of lives. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So why do you think so many of us are interested in the end of days? BERMAN: My own guess is that even though we're all more likely to be done in by our own stupidity, by smoking when we know we shouldn't or not watching our cholesterol or things like that, I think people naturally want to tie their lives in with a bigger picture and that the idea of when they leave the Earth, the Earth goes as well because, you know, loss of life is a disaster. GARCIA-NAVARRO: It's our vanity. BERMAN: It's - well, I don't know if it's so much vanity as much as trying to find an epic meaning to things. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what's the most likely thing to wipe us out? BERMAN: Well, the most likely thing is the thing that we don't have to think about because it'll happen in 1. 1 billion years. And that's the fact that the sun gets 10 percent hotter every billion years. The Earth will equalize at about 710 degrees, which will boil off all the oceans. And Earth will be uninhabitable. That's just in 1. 1 billion years. And there's no getting away from that. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Bob Berman - his book is called \"Earth-Shattering: Violent Supernovas, Galactic Explosions, Biological Mayhem, Nuclear Meltdowns, And Other Hazards To Life In Our Universe. \" Thank you so much. And good luck to us all. BERMAN: Thank you, Lulu. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:  Global warming, polar ice caps melting, general doom and gloom - well, how's this for a cheery book title? \"Earth-Shattering: Violent Supernovas, Galactic Explosions, Biological Mayhem, Nuclear Meltdowns, And Other Hazards To Life In Our Universe. \" Author Bob Berman joins us now from the studios of WAMC in Albany, N. Y. Welcome to the program. BOB BERMAN: Well, thank you, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what prompted you to write a book full of so many cataclysms? BERMAN: Well, I keep hearing - when I'm doing lectures or when I was running this community observatory, people would always be worried about things colliding with Earth. And some of them were imaginary. Like, there's this imaginary planet Nibiru that supposedly is on a collision course. And so I realized that there's a lot of juice and interest in it. GARCIA-NAVARRO: There is - and a lot of movies about it, too. I mean, I'm a personal fan of the sort of end-of-the-world scenario movies. So let's go through a few disastrous greatest hits. There's the Big Bang, of course. But much more recently, many more stars have gone supernova, including one that was visible by humans in the 11th century. Tell us about that. BERMAN: Yeah. And that was big because not only did nobody see it coming, but it was the brightest light in the sky that's ever been seen in terms of a point source - something that looked like a star. It easily cast shadows. It was much brighter than Venus looks. Now we know it's a supernova. But they didn't even have that word back then. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What did they think it was? BERMAN: It was not good. That's for sure. GARCIA-NAVARRO: A bad omen. BERMAN: Yes. Changes in the sky were always bad things. And usually, the worst they had to put up with were comets every 15 to 20 years. But this was off the charts entirely. GARCIA-NAVARRO: But supernovas actually do - you write - some good for humans. BERMAN: Oh, yeah. They end up being good. In the short term, they completely incinerate their solar system - so part of the good news, bad news thing. But they do create every element that's heavier than iron. So the iodine, for example, in our thyroid glands in our necks right now could only have come from a supernova. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Amazing.

And in some places, they are at historic lows. It's so bad that, in Alabama, this year's public oyster season was canceled. Scientists involved in restoration efforts are now finding that what worked before isn't any longer. So biologists are trying something new, as Mary Scott Hodgin of member station WBHM reports. MARY SCOTT HODGIN, BYLINE: Off the coast of Dauphin Island, Ala. , a team from the state marine resources division is in a small boat headed to a nearby oyster reef. (SOUNDBITE OF MOTORBOAT ENGINE RUNNING)HODGIN: Winter is the ideal time to harvest oysters. And, normally, this bay would be crowded with fishermen. But on this day, the only boat is biologist Jason Herrmann. He leans over and throws a rusty basket into the water. JASON HERRMANN: All right - I'm ready when you guys are. HODGIN: It's a spot survey to see how many live oysters are on the reef. Herrmann pulls in the basket and count shells. He doesn't like what he's found. HERRMANN: Twenty-two half shells - nothing. HODGIN: Twenty-two empty shells - no live oysters - it's not a surprise. Alabama used to produce a million pounds of wild oysters every year. Right now, the state's public reefs are closed and have been for months. Oysterman Phelan Ray Foster says he's never seen it so bad. PHELAN RAY FOSTER: I can remember when I was, say, 20 years old. I seen more oysters come off that reef in one day than what's come off that reef in the last eight, nine years. HODGIN: The decline is happening throughout the Gulf of Mexico. It's particularly bad in Alabama. The state has invested millions of dollars in recent restoration projects, mostly with funding from the 2010 BP oil spill settlement. One of the most common techniques is to submerge old oyster shells and rocks to give baby oysters something to attach to, allowing reefs to replenish themselves. But biologist Jason Herrmann says it's not working like it used to. HERRMANN: The material that we put down is doing what it was supposed to do. And the problem is there's such high mortality. And survival is just not happening. HODGIN: He says there's no one answer as to why. There have been hurricanes and drought. There's pressure from development and overharvesting and potential long-term impacts from the BP spill. Whatever the reason, reefs in Alabama are not rebounding. So state biologists are trying something new. MAX WESTENDORF: We're walking into, right now, our fish hatchery. HODGIN: Max Westendorf works at the Claude Peteet Mariculture Center in Gulf Shores. This will soon be home to a new oyster hatchery. The facility will grow baby oysters to be planted on wild reefs. WESTENDORF: Well, everything's reaching a big scale right now. You know, we're looking at setting millions and millions of oysters, if not billions. HODGIN: Similar efforts are happening in Washington state and the Chesapeake Bay. But it's fairly new to the Gulf Coast. Back on the water, biologist Jason Herrmann is hopeful. HERRMANN: Everybody wants the - hey - what do you consider a successful restoration or something like that? And the best answer that I can give is, well, instead of five boats out here, I've got a hundred boats out here fishing for oysters.

It starts inside The Museum of English Rural Life at the University of Reading. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: It was just before Christmas in the museum's rare book archive when something moved.

He tweeted about the bat saga yesterday. More than 20,000 people have liked it so far. KELLY: OK, before we tell you all about the bat - a quick note about The Museum of English Rural Life's Twitter feed. It is a phenomenon. Koszary has amassed 109,000 followers whom he delights with sarcastic, dark, sometimes profane tweets about the museum's archives and, in the case of this thread, their rare book collection. KOSZARY: It's a treasure trove full of lovely, lovely books. But what's not a book is a bat. Bats can't even get library cards. SHAPIRO: OK, the museum's first move - call the national bat hotline. There is one. They suggested Rose-Ann Movsovic could help. She is a local bat enthusiast. ROSE-ANN MOVSOVIC: Went on a public bat walk about 12, 15 years ago with my partner and have never really looked back. SHAPIRO: And as luck would have it, she was also familiar with The Museum of English Rural Life because she volunteers there. KELLY: So when Movsovic arrived, museum staff had put the bat in a box. MOVSOVIC: We opened the box up, and my first thought was that it was quite big. It looked big enough to be a Nathusius' pipistrelle. KELLY: Now, that is a rare and elusive kind of bat that has only showed up in Britain in the last few years. Movsovic and her bat group go out searching for them. Now fate had brought one right to her. SHAPIRO: So she took it home where she is currently rehabilitating 10 other bats, and there she confirmed it was in fact this rare species. She made the confirmation by looking between its legs. MOVSOVIC: The penis of a Nathusius' pipistrelle is described as looking like a tiny albino hedgehog 'cause it has little white hairs on it. SHAPIRO: Today, I learned. And if you really must see for yourself, this is part of the museum's Twitter thread about the whole story - #NotSafeForWork. KELLY: The things you learn. Movsovic gave the bat a name, Merlin. That's a nod to the acronym of The Museum of English Rural Life. She has now coaxed him back to health. MOVSOVIC: I'm going to give him another test flight tonight. Then I am planning to release him Wednesday or Thursday night this week, and hopefully he'll find a more sensible place to spend the rest of the winter. KELLY: Well, wherever Merlin spends the rest of winter, he can always come back to the archive. Today the museum tweeted out a picture of Merlin's very own library card.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. You may have noticed that our modern world is saturated with awards. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)HASAN MINHAJ: Welcome to the 77th Annual Peabody Awards. . . BETH BEHRS: Welcome to the 2014 People's Choice Awards. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Welcome to the 2019 Golden Globe Awards. . . TINA FEY: The one millionth Academy Awards. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: The Miss Universe crown. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Annual Daytime Emmy Awards. . . NEIL PATRICK HARRIS: Sixty-fifth Annual Tony Awards. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Teacher of the year. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Annual Ig Nobel Prize. . . ROBIN WILLIAMS: AFI Life Achievement Award. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: Live from Copenhagen. . . VEDANTAM: Many of these awards have been created in the past century, but awards have been around for millennia. The Greeks and Romans had them. Kings and queens have long given them to their bravest warriors. Societies all over the world have recognized their best citizens with prizes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BARACK OBAMA: We pay tribute to those distinguished individuals with our nation's highest civilian honor - the Presidential Medal of Freedom. VEDANTAM: Awards are so ubiquitous that we rarely stop to ask, do they work? Do prizes inspire and motivate, or do they cause jealousy and resentment? The upside, the downside and the psychology of awards - this week on HIDDEN BRAIN. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Bruno Frey is an economist who has spent years studying how prizes shape human behavior. He works at the University of Basel in Switzerland. Along with Jana Gallus, he is co-author of the book \"Honours Versus Money: The Economics Of Awards. \" Getting an award makes people feel good, but Bruno says the real benefits of awards are seen long after that initial glow wears off. BRUNO FREY: When people are given an award in general, they are likely to work better, to be more engaged, to have, as we say, higher intrinsic motivation. That is, they like to work and they like to do what they do and therefore are contributing really to the social good. VEDANTAM: An important reason awards have this effect is that they are deeply social. Awards are handed out in settings where you are surrounded by your peers. An award can make you feel appreciated by people whose opinions you value. In this regard, an award is very different than a cash bonus. FREY: Normally, people are not allowed to say how large the bonus is they receive. So it is unknown to other people while awards are always given in a ceremony, sometimes in a lavish one, sometimes in a smaller one, but it's always with other people around. And the person or the organization giving the award specifies exactly why the person or the organization gets the award. And this emphasizes the extraordinary engagement of the people receiving the awards. And that tends to raise the intrinsic motivation because it's recognized because it's appreciated. VEDANTAM: One of the things that you and others have learned is that people care intensely about the prestige that awards can confer. Perhaps even more than money, prizes provide glory. I want to play you a clip from the world of golf. This is the 2017 PGA Championship winner, Justin Thomas. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JUSTIN THOMAS: In terms of this week, if I - it's definitely not about the money. It's definitely not about being better than anybody else. Like I said earlier, I just like to win, and I like trophies, so I just want to win. Just to go win not only the tour championship but anytime you can win a year-long race and be known as a champion of an entire year, that's a big deal. So that's - that to me is what I would be most excited about. VEDANTAM: Bruno, do you see other examples of people who actually prefer prestige and glory to money? FREY: Yes. There are very many instances of that. Just consider if you want to invite a famous person, let's say, coming from the U. S. to Europe or from Europe to the U. S. If that person has a high income already, a good income, then it's very difficult to get people. There is a nice example, namely Roger Federer, one of the famous Swiss. He earns about $93 million, and I don't think that you can induce him to go anywhere to get anything. But when you offer him a nice award, you have a better chance to do that. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering about another area that you discuss in the book, which is it's not just a benefit to individuals who win awards, but there are benefits to organizations as well. Especially if you're an organization that doesn't necessarily have a lot of money or you don't have the leeway to pay people a lot of money, awards are really a powerful way to increase motivation. FREY: Yes, indeed. And it also creates a bond of loyalty between the giver and the recipient. You cannot accept the order by the Queen of England and then say she's a silly woman or I don't care about awards because then people say, why did you accept it? But people do accept awards. Of course, there are cases in which awards are not accepted. But in general, people accept the awards, and then there is a new bond of loyalty, a special relationship to the one who gives the award. And that is also important in for-profit capitalist enterprises. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering if this might be one of the reasons why you have so many awards in military service especially because it's not just that you're conferring, you know, recognition on people who've done important things, but building those bonds of relationships, the connections between, you know, superiors and subordinates, that is actually essential for a successful military. FREY: Indeed, and especially the military sector, it's difficult to define what a good soldier, a good officer, a good general, must do because you cannot fix that in advance. So you must rely on the persons to do the right thing. VEDANTAM: Right. And how do you put a price on bravery or loyalty or integrity? FREY: Yes. That's not possible because is bravery $10 million or $5,000 or whatever? One doesn't know. While if you give an order and then in the ceremony you say, oh, yes, this soldier did something beyond his duty, something extraordinary, that is totally sufficient to make the recipient very happy. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: You conducted a field experiment on awards with the site Wikipedia. This was the German-language Wikipedia. And in Wikipedia, of course, it's the online encyclopedia where each article is crowdsourced by editors and readers. Tell me about the field experiment and what you found. FREY: We introduced a new award. We invented one, actually, and we gave this award to people who continued contributing work to Wikipedia because we observed - or that is a problem of Wikipedia - that a lot of people contribute one article and then stop. So we introduced an award, which is called Edelweiss. VEDANTAM: The Edelweiss was a badge that was placed on the profile pages of some Wikipedia editors. The names of winners were also included on a Wikipedia page that described the award. Bruno and his colleague Jana Gallus observed how receiving an Edelweiss affected the retention rates for these editors compared to those who had not received one. FREY: Previously, 35 percent only continued working for Wikipedia and contributed another article or helped work with an article. And this rose from 35 to 42 percent. So a much larger proportion of people engaged in Wikipedia were induced to go on with the work. VEDANTAM: Now, of course, someone can say 35 to 42 percent is not a sea change, but, of course, the intervention is relatively inexpensive and cheap. You're basically giving someone a recognition, a title. Wikipedia is not giving them money. It's actually relatively easy to do. FREY: Absolutely. That's a very important point. This Edelweiss award is absolutely - doesn't cost anything. You just put it on the Web. And - but people really appreciate that. And so this increase in retentions for the work of - especially of newcomers is quite substantial. And to me, it was surprising that it was so large. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Most awards are meant to be taken seriously, but there's a growing genre of awards that are meant to be ironic. There's the Ig Nobel Prize, which recognizes innovations in science that make you laugh. And there's the Razzie, which is given to the worst Hollywood films each year. In 2002, Halle Berry won an Oscar for her performance in the movie \"Monster's Ball. \" Three years later, she starred in \"Catwoman. \" For that role, she received not an Oscar but a Razzie. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HALLE BERRY: I've got so many people to thank because. . . (LAUGHTER)BERRY: . . . You don't win a Razzie without a lot of help from a lot of people. (LAUGHTER)BERRY: So, first of all, I want to thank Warner Brothers. (LAUGHTER)BERRY: Thank you for putting me in a piece of [expletive] godawful movie. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: So, Bruno, what do ironic awards like the Razzie or the Ig Nobel Prize, what do they do? How do they affect human behavior? FREY: When something is very important, such as a Nobel Prize or Academy Awards, Oscars, it's always attractive to do exactly the opposite. And this raspberry - Golden Raspberry Award is exactly the opposite of the normal Oscar. To be the worst actor or the worst actress is also giving attention. And if one accepts this negative award in such a fantastic way as the actress we just heard, it's very good for her because then people say she's an open person and that throws a positive light on her. VEDANTAM: Of course, in this case, you know, thanking Warner Brothers is sort of a backhanded way of saying Warner Brothers made a terrible movie. FREY: Exactly. Yes. She did it in a very charming way, and that's wonderful. VEDANTAM: Anyone who studies human behavior knows that people don't always act predictably. When we come back - how awards can sometimes backfire and what we can do to design them better. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Corporate awards can be an easy target for comedy on TV shows. One of the running jokes on the sitcom \"The Office\" was the Dundie Awards. The Dundies were an annual prize given to employees at Dunder Mifflin, the paper company where the show was set. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE OFFICE\")STEVE CARELL: (As Michael Scott) The Dundies are about the best in every one of us. VEDANTAM: Fans of the show will remember that the Dundies were a train wreck, one in which the head of \"The Office,\" Michael Scott, humiliated himself, along with everyone else. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE OFFICE\")CARELL: (As Michael Scott, rapping) The Dundies - how can I explain it? Award show I created. VEDANTAM: You don't have to be an employee of Dunder Mifflin to know that awards can backfire. Sometimes they backfire in interesting ways. For example, the researchers Carly Robinson and Jana Gallus recently tracked 15,000 middle and high school students in a California school district. The school system was giving out awards to students who had perfect attendance. Carly says, to everyone's surprise, the kids who got these awards began attending school less often. CARLY ROBINSON: When students receive these retrospective awards, it signals to them that they were attending school more than their classmates. And this award also potentially signals that the school had low expectations for their attendance, so they were actually overshooting their school's expectations for their own attendance. VEDANTAM: So, Bruno, what does this story tell us about how recipients don't always take away from an award what givers intend? FREY: One should not get an award for something which is the normal part of one's activities because then they lose their meaning. An award should really indicate or signal that one does something extraordinary which is not described or imposed from outside, that really comes from a special engagement. If one hands out an award for just everything, they lose their special character. There's the example of the Purple Heart, which is a very important American award. It was given three times in the American Revolutionary War. VEDANTAM: Contrast that with World War II where the number of Purple Hearts awarded by the United States was larger by orders of magnitude. FREY: And you see here the huge inflation. And that means, of course, that a Purple Heart does not have the importance it used to have in the past. VEDANTAM: So, in some ways, what you're saying is when awards are scarce, people actually look at them and they have value, but you can actually devalue an award by giving out too many of them. FREY: Absolutely, yes. It's with everything. If one does it too much, it doesn't have any effect anymore. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Let's look at another study. Kirk Doran and George Borjas found that winners of the Fields Medal - this was a prize for mathematicians under the age of 40 - respond in some ways like the students in California. Compared to mathematicians who nearly win but don't, the winners end up dabbling in new areas of mathematics where they end up being less successful. Here's Doran. KIRK DORAN: I think it's not what John Charles Fields expected. He expected that in giving people a prize to honor and extol their previous work, that would encourage them to do more of the same work. What we find is that, you know, the opposite takes place. VEDANTAM: What do you make of this, Bruno? In some ways, this paper was arguing that the mathematicians who nearly win, they're tipped to be winners of the Fields Medal, but since the medal is given only to people under the age of 40, there are people who pass the age of 40 without winning it. But ironically, it finds that those people end up being more productive, at least as measured by the number of papers they write. So in some ways, the award is actually not producing what the originator of the award intended. FREY: It didn't produce with the recipients of the Fields Medal but with the others. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). FREY: So in a way, the purpose was reached. (LAUGHTER)FREY: And I think the others who didn't get the prize want to get recognition in some other way and therefore work hard while the recipients are satisfied because a mathematician cannot get more than the Fields prize. VEDANTAM: That's a fascinating idea. In some ways, I think what you might be hinting at is that potentially the benefits of some awards might be seen more in the people who don't win the award because it motivates them to try harder. Even if they'd never win an award, it still helps the whole field because they're doing all this extra work. FREY: Right. Right. But that's not always the case. Very often, or in many instances, when an award is given to some person or to some persons and those not getting the award may be getting mad or they think they are not appreciated, so there is also this negative side about it. VEDANTAM: I remember reading a column by Paul Krugman. He was writing in The New York Times a few months ago. And he was talking about how people are often dissatisfied. Even in the field of economics, he said, you know, there are people, you know, who are working at various universities who are envious of their colleagues who are working at, you know, Harvard and Chicago. And the people who are working at Harvard and Chicago are envious of the people who have won the Nobel Prize and they haven't won it. So even when you're at the very top of your game, you can find sources of resentment when you see that other people around you are doing even better. FREY: I heard this story that a Nobel Prize winner, when he gets the Nobel Prize or she gets the Nobel Prize, starts thinking about the - I think there are five people who got two Nobel prizes. It's incredible. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: Yes, of course. So there's no end to it. FREY: No (laughter). VEDANTAM: In 2016, former British Prime Minister David Cameron was criticized for seeking to give high state honors to a bunch of cronies. Among the list of recipients was Mrs. David Cameron's stylist, Isabel Spearman. Here's what Tom Watson of the Labour Party had to say about David Cameron's awards list. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TOM WATSON: I think people will be shocked at the scale and size of this list. You know, there is a reasonableness test that should be applied to these lists. And I think most reasonable people would say it's unacceptable to give Mrs. Cameron's stylist an OBE and to hand out knighthoods to members of Parliament like confetti. VEDANTAM: So it surely must be the case, Bruno, that award givers sometimes misuse their position to confer honor and legitimacy on their friends. FREY: Absolutely. If that is done, that is a grave mistake. So it's a bad policy, for instance, for a king or a queen to give it to people who are very much on their side because then the award or the award given loses importance. It would be a bad policy. VEDANTAM: So there's a tension here, isn't it, which is if you have just come into power, you know - and I think you'll give the example of Hitler actually doing this with the Iron Cross, which was also a medal that was given out very - it was very scarce, initially. And then once Hitler came to power, he sort of distributed it like candy, in some ways, to large numbers of people, if I recall correctly. FREY: Exactly. VEDANTAM: But there must be a temptation to do this because you've come in and you want to solidify and strengthen your position. And the cheapest and easiest thing to do is to just simply spew these awards around. FREY: Yes, that is the problem. Before, we discussed that a positive side of awards is that they don't cost much money, but the negative side is that you can distribute heaps of them, and it doesn't cost you anything, but it destroys the award. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: If you can undermine an award by giving it out to undeserving people, Bruno says you can also undermine awards by doing exactly the opposite. If you give awards only to people who are already acknowledged superstars, this shuts the door to outsiders who may have truly revolutionary ideas. Bruno cites the example of an extraordinary researcher who didn't win the Nobel Prize. The reason - he was also known as a blunt provocateur. FREY: Gordon Tullock was a very extraordinary economist. He was a professor of economics but who was a lawyer. And that was the first thing is that he is a little bit of an outsider. He wrote with James Buchanan an important book in public choice, and then James Buchanan won the Nobel Prize, though much of the contribution of the book is due to Gordon Tullock. And it's even written in the introduction that he contributed the major idea of the book. And the reason he didn't get the prize was - I was told that by members of the Nobel Prize committee that they didn't know how he would behave when he gets the prize because the Nobel Prize winners afterwards give a talk of gratitude. And there was one example already that is Friedrich von Hayek. He got the Nobel Prize and then said the Nobel Prize is not a very good idea for economists. And, of course, Nobel Prize Foundation didn't want to have a similar talk again. So it was unclear how Gordon Tullock would behave while James Buchanan, he was a Southerly gentleman, and everybody knew that he would behave in the appropriate way. VEDANTAM: You know, as we've been talking, I'm realizing how complicated this field is because, in some ways, you are trying to manipulate people by giving them an award. At some level, you are trying to shape human behavior. You're trying to recognize people who've done great work. You're trying to inspire other people. But you're also trying to do it in a way that doesn't feel controlling, which doesn't feel like you're actually manipulating people. So a good award inspires people and communicates sort of the norms of the organization without necessarily feeling heavy-handed even though it actually may have been designed, you know, in a fairly heavy-handed manner. There's a real paradox and tension there. FREY: Yes, indeed, yeah. It's difficult to give good awards because one might also run the danger that one gives it to people who do not earn it or deserve it. And that's very bad for an award if it's given to people who didn't deserve it. And that's, of course, very bad for the giver of the award because it's no longer going to the right people. VEDANTAM: You know, you've talked at various points, Bruno, about how money is not a very good reward. In one of the early episodes of HIDDEN BRAIN, we interviewed someone who worked at a company. This person had an interesting idea. Rather than give out cash awards, the person essentially set up - this was the owner of the company - set up a little fund where any employee could give any other employee a cash award. And the benefit of doing this is the employee who was giving out the award not only could give out an award for good behavior or work well done or exceptional service but also had to write up why they thought the recipient deserved the award. So in some ways, it solidified the - both the giver as well as the receiver sense of why the award was being given. Do you think that's an effective way to use money as a motivational tool? FREY: That's very interesting, indeed. I think this goes very much in the direction of awards, namely that one expresses exactly why somebody gets this additional amount of money. One really has to think in a more social context. And I think this idea of handing out money in this way is interesting and certainly goes in the right direction. But I would argue that the same would be the case if employees could give other employees awards. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: I want to end this discussion about awards by talking about someone who dissed the world's most famous award. When the Nobel Committee awarded Bob Dylan the Nobel Prize in Literature, he simply ignored them. The comedian Tim Heidecker composed this very Dylan-esque (ph) song. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TALKIN' NOBEL PRIZE - BOB DYLAN\")TIM HEIDECKER: (Singing) Well, I don't need your prize, babe, I don't need your prize. Just look into my eyes, babe, see how I despise the prize, see how I despise the prize. VEDANTAM: So, Bruno, what happens when someone rejects an award? FREY: I think even worse is not to react as Bob Dylan did. That is the worst thing. To at least reject it is a reaction. Something happens. While to just say, oh, whether I get the Nobel Prize or not is totally irrelevant, that is the worst thing. VEDANTAM: So when someone like Bob Dylan rejects a prize like the Nobel Prize, is it fair to guess that rock singers are unlikely to get the Nobel Prize in Literature going forward? FREY: Yes, I think that's very unlikely. And, of course, the committee first talks to potential recipients and informally asks them whether they would accept the prize. And that is now the common procedure, that important prizes are not just given. One talks to people before whether they would accept it, and when they say no, it's not revealed that they were chosen as possible recipients. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Bruno Frey is a professor and economist who has spent years studying how prizes and awards shape human behavior. He works at the University of Basel in Switzerland. Along with Jana Gallus, he is co-author of the book \"Honours Versus Money: The Economics Of Awards. \" Bruno, thank you for joining me today on HIDDEN BRAIN. FREY: Shankar, I thank you very much. It was a great pleasure. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This week's show was produced by Thomas Lu and edited by Tara Boyle and Jenny Schmidt.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. You may have noticed that our modern world is saturated with awards. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) HASAN MINHAJ: Welcome to the 77th Annual Peabody Awards. . . BETH BEHRS: Welcome to the 2014 People's Choice Awards. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Welcome to the 2019 Golden Globe Awards. . . TINA FEY: The one millionth Academy Awards. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: The Miss Universe crown. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Annual Daytime Emmy Awards. . . NEIL PATRICK HARRIS: Sixty-fifth Annual Tony Awards. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Teacher of the year. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Annual Ig Nobel Prize. . . ROBIN WILLIAMS: AFI Life Achievement Award. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: Live from Copenhagen. . . VEDANTAM: Many of these awards have been created in the past century, but awards have been around for millennia. The Greeks and Romans had them. Kings and queens have long given them to their bravest warriors. Societies all over the world have recognized their best citizens with prizes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BARACK OBAMA: We pay tribute to those distinguished individuals with our nation's highest civilian honor - the Presidential Medal of Freedom. VEDANTAM: Awards are so ubiquitous that we rarely stop to ask, do they work? Do prizes inspire and motivate, or do they cause jealousy and resentment? The upside, the downside and the psychology of awards - this week on HIDDEN BRAIN. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Bruno Frey is an economist who has spent years studying how prizes shape human behavior. He works at the University of Basel in Switzerland. Along with Jana Gallus, he is co-author of the book \"Honours Versus Money: The Economics Of Awards. \" Getting an award makes people feel good, but Bruno says the real benefits of awards are seen long after that initial glow wears off. BRUNO FREY: When people are given an award in general, they are likely to work better, to be more engaged, to have, as we say, higher intrinsic motivation. That is, they like to work and they like to do what they do and therefore are contributing really to the social good. VEDANTAM: An important reason awards have this effect is that they are deeply social. Awards are handed out in settings where you are surrounded by your peers. An award can make you feel appreciated by people whose opinions you value. In this regard, an award is very different than a cash bonus. FREY: Normally, people are not allowed to say how large the bonus is they receive. So it is unknown to other people while awards are always given in a ceremony, sometimes in a lavish one, sometimes in a smaller one, but it's always with other people around. And the person or the organization giving the award specifies exactly why the person or the organization gets the award. And this emphasizes the extraordinary engagement of the people receiving the awards. And that tends to raise the intrinsic motivation because it's recognized because it's appreciated. VEDANTAM: One of the things that you and others have learned is that people care intensely about the prestige that awards can confer. Perhaps even more than money, prizes provide glory. I want to play you a clip from the world of golf. This is the 2017 PGA Championship winner, Justin Thomas. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JUSTIN THOMAS: In terms of this week, if I - it's definitely not about the money. It's definitely not about being better than anybody else. Like I said earlier, I just like to win, and I like trophies, so I just want to win. Just to go win not only the tour championship but anytime you can win a year-long race and be known as a champion of an entire year, that's a big deal. So that's - that to me is what I would be most excited about. VEDANTAM: Bruno, do you see other examples of people who actually prefer prestige and glory to money? FREY: Yes. There are very many instances of that. Just consider if you want to invite a famous person, let's say, coming from the U. S. to Europe or from Europe to the U. S. If that person has a high income already, a good income, then it's very difficult to get people. There is a nice example, namely Roger Federer, one of the famous Swiss. He earns about $93 million, and I don't think that you can induce him to go anywhere to get anything. But when you offer him a nice award, you have a better chance to do that. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering about another area that you discuss in the book, which is it's not just a benefit to individuals who win awards, but there are benefits to organizations as well. Especially if you're an organization that doesn't necessarily have a lot of money or you don't have the leeway to pay people a lot of money, awards are really a powerful way to increase motivation. FREY: Yes, indeed. And it also creates a bond of loyalty between the giver and the recipient. You cannot accept the order by the Queen of England and then say she's a silly woman or I don't care about awards because then people say, why did you accept it? But people do accept awards. Of course, there are cases in which awards are not accepted. But in general, people accept the awards, and then there is a new bond of loyalty, a special relationship to the one who gives the award. And that is also important in for-profit capitalist enterprises. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering if this might be one of the reasons why you have so many awards in military service especially because it's not just that you're conferring, you know, recognition on people who've done important things, but building those bonds of relationships, the connections between, you know, superiors and subordinates, that is actually essential for a successful military. FREY: Indeed, and especially the military sector, it's difficult to define what a good soldier, a good officer, a good general, must do because you cannot fix that in advance. So you must rely on the persons to do the right thing. VEDANTAM: Right. And how do you put a price on bravery or loyalty or integrity? FREY: Yes. That's not possible because is bravery $10 million or $5,000 or whatever? One doesn't know. While if you give an order and then in the ceremony you say, oh, yes, this soldier did something beyond his duty, something extraordinary, that is totally sufficient to make the recipient very happy. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: You conducted a field experiment on awards with the site Wikipedia. This was the German-language Wikipedia. And in Wikipedia, of course, it's the online encyclopedia where each article is crowdsourced by editors and readers. Tell me about the field experiment and what you found. FREY: We introduced a new award. We invented one, actually, and we gave this award to people who continued contributing work to Wikipedia because we observed - or that is a problem of Wikipedia - that a lot of people contribute one article and then stop. So we introduced an award, which is called Edelweiss. VEDANTAM: The Edelweiss was a badge that was placed on the profile pages of some Wikipedia editors. The names of winners were also included on a Wikipedia page that described the award. Bruno and his colleague Jana Gallus observed how receiving an Edelweiss affected the retention rates for these editors compared to those who had not received one. FREY: Previously, 35 percent only continued working for Wikipedia and contributed another article or helped work with an article. And this rose from 35 to 42 percent. So a much larger proportion of people engaged in Wikipedia were induced to go on with the work. VEDANTAM: Now, of course, someone can say 35 to 42 percent is not a sea change, but, of course, the intervention is relatively inexpensive and cheap. You're basically giving someone a recognition, a title. Wikipedia is not giving them money. It's actually relatively easy to do. FREY: Absolutely. That's a very important point. This Edelweiss award is absolutely - doesn't cost anything. You just put it on the Web. And - but people really appreciate that. And so this increase in retentions for the work of - especially of newcomers is quite substantial. And to me, it was surprising that it was so large. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Most awards are meant to be taken seriously, but there's a growing genre of awards that are meant to be ironic. There's the Ig Nobel Prize, which recognizes innovations in science that make you laugh. And there's the Razzie, which is given to the worst Hollywood films each year. In 2002, Halle Berry won an Oscar for her performance in the movie \"Monster's Ball. \" Three years later, she starred in \"Catwoman. \" For that role, she received not an Oscar but a Razzie. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HALLE BERRY: I've got so many people to thank because. . . (LAUGHTER) BERRY: . . . You don't win a Razzie without a lot of help from a lot of people. (LAUGHTER) BERRY: So, first of all, I want to thank Warner Brothers. (LAUGHTER) BERRY: Thank you for putting me in a piece of [expletive] godawful movie. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: So, Bruno, what do ironic awards like the Razzie or the Ig Nobel Prize, what do they do? How do they affect human behavior? FREY: When something is very important, such as a Nobel Prize or Academy Awards, Oscars, it's always attractive to do exactly the opposite. And this raspberry - Golden Raspberry Award is exactly the opposite of the normal Oscar. To be the worst actor or the worst actress is also giving attention. And if one accepts this negative award in such a fantastic way as the actress we just heard, it's very good for her because then people say she's an open person and that throws a positive light on her. VEDANTAM: Of course, in this case, you know, thanking Warner Brothers is sort of a backhanded way of saying Warner Brothers made a terrible movie. FREY: Exactly. Yes. She did it in a very charming way, and that's wonderful. VEDANTAM: Anyone who studies human behavior knows that people don't always act predictably. When we come back - how awards can sometimes backfire and what we can do to design them better. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Corporate awards can be an easy target for comedy on TV shows. One of the running jokes on the sitcom \"The Office\" was the Dundie Awards. The Dundies were an annual prize given to employees at Dunder Mifflin, the paper company where the show was set.

It's incredible. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: Yes, of course. So there's no end to it. FREY: No (laughter).

It's difficult to give good awards because one might also run the danger that one gives it to people who do not earn it or deserve it. And that's very bad for an award if it's given to people who didn't deserve it. And that's, of course, very bad for the giver of the award because it's no longer going to the right people. VEDANTAM: You know, you've talked at various points, Bruno, about how money is not a very good reward. In one of the early episodes of HIDDEN BRAIN, we interviewed someone who worked at a company. This person had an interesting idea. Rather than give out cash awards, the person essentially set up - this was the owner of the company - set up a little fund where any employee could give any other employee a cash award. And the benefit of doing this is the employee who was giving out the award not only could give out an award for good behavior or work well done or exceptional service but also had to write up why they thought the recipient deserved the award. So in some ways, it solidified the - both the giver as well as the receiver sense of why the award was being given. Do you think that's an effective way to use money as a motivational tool? FREY: That's very interesting, indeed. I think this goes very much in the direction of awards, namely that one expresses exactly why somebody gets this additional amount of money. One really has to think in a more social context. And I think this idea of handing out money in this way is interesting and certainly goes in the right direction. But I would argue that the same would be the case if employees could give other employees awards. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: I want to end this discussion about awards by talking about someone who dissed the world's most famous award. When the Nobel Committee awarded Bob Dylan the Nobel Prize in Literature, he simply ignored them. The comedian Tim Heidecker composed this very Dylan-esque (ph) song. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TALKIN' NOBEL PRIZE - BOB DYLAN\") TIM HEIDECKER: (Singing) Well, I don't need your prize, babe, I don't need your prize. Just look into my eyes, babe, see how I despise the prize, see how I despise the prize. VEDANTAM: So, Bruno, what happens when someone rejects an award? FREY: I think even worse is not to react as Bob Dylan did. That is the worst thing. To at least reject it is a reaction. Something happens. While to just say, oh, whether I get the Nobel Prize or not is totally irrelevant, that is the worst thing. VEDANTAM: So when someone like Bob Dylan rejects a prize like the Nobel Prize, is it fair to guess that rock singers are unlikely to get the Nobel Prize in Literature going forward? FREY: Yes, I think that's very unlikely. And, of course, the committee first talks to potential recipients and informally asks them whether they would accept the prize. And that is now the common procedure, that important prizes are not just given. One talks to people before whether they would accept it, and when they say no, it's not revealed that they were chosen as possible recipients. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Bruno Frey is a professor and economist who has spent years studying how prizes and awards shape human behavior. He works at the University of Basel in Switzerland. Along with Jana Gallus, he is co-author of the book \"Honours Versus Money: The Economics Of Awards. \" Bruno, thank you for joining me today on HIDDEN BRAIN. FREY: Shankar, I thank you very much. It was a great pleasure. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This week's show was produced by Thomas Lu and edited by Tara Boyle and Jenny Schmidt.

That partly explains why last year SpaceX launched a cherry red sports car into space. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: Five, four, three. . . GREENFIELDBOYCE: SpaceX workers cheered and really went wild when images beamed back, along with a David Bowie soundtrack, showed that the convertible was being driven away from Earth by a space suited mannequin named Starman. (CHEERING)GREENFIELDBOYCE: Starman's joyride marked the first successful flight of a big, new rocket. And now SpaceX is about to test another space vehicle. One of its rockets will launch a new capsule designed to carry people. Once again, a space suited mannequin will go along for the ride. SpaceX executive Hans Koenigsmann told reporters that this one will have all kinds of sensors to see how a real human would experience the trip. HANS KOENIGSMANN: We measure the responses on the human body obviously and measure the environment. We want to make sure that everything is perfect. GREENFIELDBOYCE: There's room for seven astronauts in the white bell-shaped capsule. It's very similar to a robotic SpaceX ship that's been ferrying NASA cargo back and forth to the space station for years. SpaceX ultimately wants to colonize Mars, so the first launch of its crew vehicle even with just a mannequin onboard is a milestone. KOENIGSMANN: Human spaceflight is basically the core mission of SpaceX, so we are really excited to do this. There's nothing more important for us than this endeavor. GREENFIELDBOYCE: This is also important for NASA. Since the agency retired its space shuttles seven years ago, it's relied on Russia to take astronauts up. John Logsdon is a space historian with George Washington University. He says this SpaceX test will be the first step towards restoring this country's ability to put people in orbit. JOHN LOGSDON: And because it is that first step, it has a transcendent significance beyond the event itself. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Assuming the capsule blasts off OK, it will travel to the station and dock there. The three astronauts living in the outpost will be able to open the hatch and go inside. That means this mission does involve people. And NASA and SpaceX have been super focused on safety. BILL GERSTENMAIER: We're doing things that are really risky, that most normal human beings don't do. GREENFIELDBOYCE: NASA's Bill Gerstenmaier says that his agency and SpaceX have different cultures, and that's been a good thing as they've collaborated on creating a kind of private taxi service to space that NASA can use. GERSTENMAIER: It's fun working with a new partner that approaches the problem in a slightly different way. They don't carry the same background that we did in NASA, and they don't approach the design exactly the same way we do. And that's cool. I mean, that's really neat. GREENFIELDBOYCE: NASA has already picked a pair of veteran space travelers to be the first to take off in this vehicle if this test and others go well. Kathy Lueders manages what NASA calls its Commercial Crew Program. She recently accompanied those two astronauts when they went out to a launch pad at Kennedy Space Center to see the SpaceX vehicle that's about to go up. KATHY LUEDERS: And it really gave us a sense of getting ready and realizing that the next vehicle that we're going to be walking up to on the pad is going to be their crewed flight test.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. We begin today in Las Vegas. The year - 2004. The scene - a high-stakes poker game. Our protagonist is a woman named Annie Duke. She's about to win $2 million. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PHIL HELLMUTH: I'm all-in. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: And with that top pair, Phil Hellmuth is going all-in with his 450,000 thousand chips. Annie Duke put the pressure on Phil when she check-raised him. VEDANTAM: This was the final hand of the World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions. ANNIE DUKE: They had these incredible hall-of-fame players like Doyle Brunson, who was a hall-of-famer, Johnny Chan, who was a hall-of-famer, and then Phil Hellmuth, who has the most championships of anyone in the history of the World Series of Poker. And then there was me. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Annie calls the all-in. HELLMUTH: (Expletive). UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: And Phil sees what he's up against. VEDANTAM: Annie and this guy, Phil, were the last two at the table. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: And Annie is overcome with emotion seeing how close she is to winning this championship. VEDANTAM: Annie's crying. Phil's standing up, pacing back-and-forth. The dealer's laying out the cards that will determine who wins. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Annie has control of this hand. Now here comes the turn. It's a seven - no help for Phil. VEDANTAM: Annie was the only woman in this competition. She had knocked out eight guys - eight of the best players in the world - to get to this point. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: Annie Duke is now one card away from $2 million. DUKE: But I didn't really feel like I deserved to be at that table. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: At that moment, Annie Duke was feeling the pressure of something that psychologists call stereotype threat. Here's how it works. Let's say you think people have a certain stereotype about you. There's a part of you that's afraid that your actions and behavior will prove the stereotype is true. DUKE: I'm sort of thinking about, well, if I fold and I'm wrong, everybody's going to be like, see, she plays like a girl. Like, look how he pushed her around. VEDANTAM: But Annie's story is also about a second idea, one that often has a positive outcome. This idea is called stereotype tax. That's when a stereotype that others have about you works to your advantage. DUKE: If somebody was at the table who was so emotionally invested in the fact that I was a woman, given that they're treating me that way, how can I come up with the best strategy to take their money because I guess, in the end, isn't that the best revenge? VEDANTAM: Annie had started playing poker in 1994. By the time she got to that championship game 10 years later, she had basically figured out how to make stereotypes about women in poker work for her. DUKE: So I can tell you that the first year that I played in the World Series of Poker Main Event, which was in 1994, 3 percent of the entrants were women. And last year, that number would've been the same. VEDANTAM: Wow. So this is an extraordinarily male-dominated sport? DUKE: Completely. I was generally the only woman at the table. I had to really love that game in order to be willing to expose myself to a lot of the behavior that I was experiencing. VEDANTAM: Tell me what you heard. What did people say? DUKE: There were people who were incredibly welcoming. There were other people - you know, there was one guy who I lost a pot to, and he said, don't cry, I'll give you your money back if we go across the street to the Northern, and the Northern was a hotel. VEDANTAM: Wow. DUKE: You know, and I got called a lot of bad things. But to think about it as, OK, given that this person is viewing me in a way that I find disrespectful, try to separate yourself from your emotional reaction to that, and think about how you can use that to your advantage. VEDANTAM: Annie had learned to make her opponents pay - literally pay - for the stereotypes they held about women. DUKE: Right. At the poker table, for example, I sort of, in my head, divided people into three categories. One was the flirting chauvinist, and that person was really viewing me in a way that was sexual. VEDANTAM: And not as blatantly as the guy who invited her back to the great Northern Hotel. These were just guys who sometimes seemed more concerned about getting Annie to like them than they were about winning. DUKE: And, like, they'd show me their whole cards when they were done with the hand to show me whether it was a good fold or not. They'd kind of tell me during the hand, if I was alone with them in the hand, you know, what they had. VEDANTAM: They were trying to make nice with you. DUKE: They were trying to make nice with me, exactly. I never did go out on a date with any of them, but, you know, it was kind of flirtatious at the table, and I could use that to my advantage. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Then there's a second kind of guy. DUKE: What I would call the disrespecting chauvinist, who mainly just thought that women weren't creative, that they could only think one level deep. So they didn't believe that you knew how to bluff, for example, because that's a level deep in your thinking. They didn't think that you really had creativity. They thought you were very straightforward in the way that you play because, you know, you're a girl. VEDANTAM: Right. So they assume that you are naive, basically. DUKE: Exactly. So there are strategies that you can use against them. Mainly, you can bluff those people a lot. VEDANTAM: And then there's a third kind of guy - perhaps the most reckless. DUKE: The angry chauvinist. VEDANTAM: This is a guy who would do anything to avoid being beaten by a woman. DUKE: You couldn't bluff them because they would call you all the time for fear that you might be bluffing them, and then they would also try to push you around a lot. So they would play extremely aggressively against you. They'd be trying to bluff you all the time because the best thing that could happen to them was that they bluffed you, and then they could show you that they had a terrible hand and, like, be like, ha-ha, little girl, look what happened to you. VEDANTAM: Right, because that would confirm that everything that they believed about you was true. DUKE: Right. So you can just sort of wait until they - and what I say is, until they would impale themselves on your chips. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: I have to ask you, though, so it's clear that thinking about this mathematically and in a very detached and unemotional way gave you an edge at the poker table. And I can clearly see how that's very smart. But you're not a robot. You're not a computer. DUKE: No. VEDANTAM: At some level, you also are processing how people actually are behaving toward you. And I'm wondering if you could talk a minute about how this felt. DUKE: Most of the time, I would sort of say, I have emotions about this. I'm going to set them aside and deal with them later. And then I would leave the table and drive home in tears. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: In her first 10 years at the poker table, Annie was able to compartmentalize her emotions, and she won a lot of money doing this, using stereotype tax to her advantage - that was, until 2004 at the Tournament of Champions. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Intimidation is such a big part of being a successful player. Is that going to come into play at this table, you think? UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #3: Oh, not really. In fact, these players know each other so well, if one of them sneezes, somebody else has already handed them a handkerchief. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: Actually, at least for Annie, that wasn't true. She had never played poker on TV before, and she was pretty sure she had been invited as the token woman, that she was way out of her league. She thought that ESPN, televising the game in this way for the first time, just thought it was good optics to have her there. DUKE: And I went in there with this incredible fear that my play, which was now in front of lipstick cameras - so my mistakes were no longer going to be private to me - that that was going to expose that everybody was right, and I was actually a terrible player and, despite the fact that I had spent the last 10 years making my living playing poker at the highest levels of the game, that I didn't really deserve to have ever won anything. I was bad, and I had just gotten lucky, and now everybody was going to know it, and what they were saying was true. VEDANTAM: You felt like an imposter. DUKE: Completely. VEDANTAM: You were facing a very difficult situation here, which is you're not just juggling with what's happening at the poker table, but you're juggling with all this other psychological crap, in a way, that just makes it hard to focus on what it is that you're actually doing. And in so many ways, that, to me, is a perfect illustration of stereotype threat. It shows that when there's a stereotype that's in the air, when there's a stereotype that multiple people believe, even if you don't believe it yourself, if you're the person who is potentially at the receiving end of that stereotype, it affects your behavior in such a way that you become more likely to make the stereotype come true. DUKE: I think that that's completely true. It was always in the back of my mind, like, that - do they really respect me? Why are they talking to me? Is it just because they are thinking about me in a different way, like they want to be friends with me because I'm a girl? Or do they actually respect my play? VEDANTAM: There was one hand, Annie says, when stereotype threat got the better of her. DUKE: So in this particular hand, where I had two 10s. . . VEDANTAM: Which is a pretty good hand. It was good enough that there wasn't a huge chance that her opponent, this guy Greg Raymer, had a better hand. But there was still a chance. As a professional poker player, this is the kind of hand that you evaluate in a matter of seconds. DUKE: So I really needed to eliminate that hand as a possibility, and I was having a lot of trouble doing that because I was so afraid of making this really bad, big decision on television and having everyone say, I told you so. VEDANTAM: This was a pivotal hand, but a lot of the significance was really just in Annie's head. If she folded but really had the best hand. . . DUKE: Everybody's going to be like, see, she plays like a girl. Like, look how he pushed her around. And if I called and I was wrong, then I could come up with a whole other thing, like look how bad she is. Could - didn't she know that he had the best hand? Like, any idiot would have known that, you know? And that was running in my head as I was trying to make this decision. VEDANTAM: So you're damned if you do, and you're damned if you don't. DUKE: Absolutely. Absolutely. And it was incredibly difficult. And it wasn't until I kind of snapped to and saw this tell that he had. VEDANTAM: And when you say a tell, you mean what? DUKE: So a tell is a physical - well, it could be something verbal that somebody says that gives a clue. But generally, when we talk about tells, we're talking about something physical that somebody does that telegraphs the quality of their hand, or at least what they think the quality of their hand is. So Greg Raymer did something, which I haven't actually said what he actually did because I think that's unfair to him. But he did something that gave away the fact that his hand was very, very strong, which allowed me to then fold. And at that moment, I was actually quite confident in it. VEDANTAM: But Annie's confidence in her decision was short-lived. Another player came up to her during a break in the game. What he said kicked the stereotype threat in Annie's head into overdrive. DUKE: Phil Hellmuth, right after that hand occurred, came up and just told me, like, what an idiot I was because, clearly, Greg Raymer had ace-king. And I thought, oh, my gosh. This is a guy who's, like, at the - now, I think he's a 12-time world champion, but at the time, he probably had, you know, seven world championships or something. And he seemed pretty confident that he had ace-king, and - oh, no. And it was just - and then I had an hour in my room having a panic attack while we were on break from the tournament. It was pretty awful. VEDANTAM: Stereotype threat had produced in Annie's head what poker players call tilt. DUKE: Tilt, when you allow kind of bad things that happened to you that - and very often are out of your control to cause you to be a poor decision-maker going forward. (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Annie has picked up a heart draw here. . . VEDANTAM: So after she nearly lost it in her hotel room, Annie comes back to the table, and she has a stroke of luck. She wins a pretty nice hand. And you can actually hear at this point in the game, Annie begins to loosen up. It was as if she'd finally gotten the stereotype threat under control. (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS)DUKE: The flop was just - wow. GREG RAYMER: Yeah, it doesn't matter what order they come in, right? DUKE: It doesn't matter. . . RAYMER: (Laughter). DUKE: . . . Well, it kind of does in that situation, you know? VEDANTAM: Annie had turned on the charm. The next time she faced Greg Raymer in a hand. . . (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Now Raymer needs to call or get out of the way. VEDANTAM: . . . He got cocky. (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS)RAYMER: I call. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Oh, the world champion is going to call. It's a three, no good for Raymer. RAYMER: Three, seven. . . VEDANTAM: On the next hand, Annie he would knock out Raymer, whose nickname was Fossilman. (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: It is an ace. It's no help to Fossilman, and he goes down. DUKE: You played really well. VEDANTAM: Just like that, Annie was back in the zone. DUKE: And that actually sort of brought me out of this very bad headspace. VEDANTAM: Soon the table dwindled to four players. (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Hellmuth knocking out Johnny Chan in fourth place. VEDANTAM: Then there were three. . . (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: It's a three. And that's the end of the line for Howard Lederer. VEDANTAM: . . . Until finally, Annie and Phil Hellmuth, the guy who nearly destroyed her confidence earlier in the game - these are the only two left. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: And Annie says to him. . . (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS)DUKE: This is all right, you know? I'm just happy to be in the final two. I mean, seriously, I donked (ph) my money off in the first two hours. . . VEDANTAM: You could argue that this little-old-me act. . . (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS)DUKE: . . . Somehow. . . VEDANTAM: . . . Really did a number on Phil Hellmuth. . . (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS)DUKE: . . . Some way. VEDANTAM: . . . Because for the next half a dozen hands, he just did not know what to make of Annie. (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Annie's got Phil second-guessing every move he makes and every move he doesn't make. VEDANTAM: At this point, it's obvious to both Annie and Phil the other person has a strong hand. The question is, how strong? That's a judgment call. It's based on probability, instinct and all the undercurrents, expectations and stereotypes that have been running through the game the entire time. But now there's only one question. If Annie thinks that Phil has misjudged her, she knows she should call his bet. (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS)DUKE: I call. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: Annie calls the all-in. HELLMUTH: [Expletive]. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: And Phil sees what he's up against. VEDANTAM: And what he's up against here, meaning the dealer's cards, that's going to determine who wins. And if there was any moment that perfectly revealed how much of an outsider Annie was in this situation, it's this next one. (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: Annie Duke is now one card away from $2 million. HELLMUTH: An eight, please. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Phil Hellmuth needs an eight to win this pot. Both players on their feet, anticipating the river card. It's a three. Annie Duke has defeated nine of the strongest poker players in the world and wins the first ever World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions. HELLMUTH: [Expletive]. (SOUNDBITE OF DOOR SLAMMING)VEDANTAM: In classic reality-television style, cameras follow Phil as he storms away from the table, out a door. . . (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS)HELLMUTH: She check-raised me six times. VEDANTAM: . . . Just pacing around talking to himself. (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS)HELLMUTH: I know she didn't have it all six times. DUKE: Oh, my God, I won. VEDANTAM: It was the reaction of a man who just got beat. (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS)HELLMUTH: She had to be [expletive] 30-to-1 to win this. VEDANTAM: By someone. . . (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS)HELLMUTH: I love Annie. . . VEDANTAM: . . . Who wasn't supposed to win. . . (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS)HELLMUTH: . . . But [expletive]. VEDANTAM: . . . And maybe even wasn't supposed to be at the table in the first place. But precisely because Annie Duke knew how stereotypes can be both threat and advantage, well. . . (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Well, you heard Phil, and he was right. Annie was definitely a longshot to win this all. But as the only female at the table, she is now the last man standing. DUKE: Oh. VEDANTAM: I have to say, Annie Duke, you're not just a good poker player, but you're clearly a very wise person. DUKE: (Laughter) Well, so are you. Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: High-stakes poker is one of many domains where women have been forced to be flexible or, in some cases, to elbow their way into a world dominated by men. For centuries, women have been locked out of different professions because of barriers built on sexism and patriarchy. But as the economy has started to boom in fields traditionally dominated by women, men have not sought jobs in those areas. If anything, they seem to actively avoid such professions. ALICE EAGLY: If women are attracted to the occupation, then it becomes something that women do, and men would perhaps hesitate to enter. VEDANTAM: This is Northwestern University psychologist Alice Eagly. She says men even avoid female-dominated professions that used to be male-dominated, like working as a bank teller. EAGLY: There used to be quite a few males. But then there got to be so many women, evidently, that men could find it a bit of a masculinity threat. Oh, you're a bank teller, people would say. They see bank tellers being women. And so they think of it - oh, it's feminine - not even knowing much about what they do. VEDANTAM: After the break, masculinity threats. . . JENNIFER BOSSON: Man up. ROBERT VAUGHAN: You must be gay. VEDANTAM: . . . How a fear of appearing feminine shapes the lives of men and affects us all. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"MEET THE PARENTS\")ROBERT DE NIRO: (As Jack Byrnes) Not many men in your profession, though, are there, Greg? BOSSON: Man up. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FRIENDS\")MATTHEW PERRY: (As Chandler Bing) Kind of girly, isn't it? (LAUGHTER)BOSSON: You're gay. . . R VAUGHAN: A woman's job. BOSSON: . . . Man up. R VAUGHAN: A woman's job. VEDANTAM: This is NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. R VAUGHAN: My name is Robert Vaughan. VEDANTAM: When he was 23, Robert Vaughn faced a dilemma - conform to norms of masculinity or pursue a promising career in a field long dominated by women. His life illustrates how such norms exert a gravitational force on the choices of millions of men. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Robert grew up in Belpre, Ohio. R VAUGHAN: Very small town on the border of West Virginia. VEDANTAM: There were clear expectations for the men in Belpre. R VAUGHAN: Military service was big in my community. VEDANTAM: For boys who were Robert's age, the extracurricular activity of choice was Scouting. R VAUGHAN: My parents were divorced when I was 2, and I didn't really have a father figure growing up. And so Scouting became a way of kind of getting a bond with other men. VEDANTAM: A few years into Scouting, Robert desperately wanted to go on a trip to New Mexico. R VAUGHAN: I grew up in a very poor home. You know, we were on welfare. We didn't have the money to afford such a trip. And one of the men in our group actually stepped forward and paid for my way to be able to go. So that was really impactful for me, to have one of the men in our troop that saw me enough as a son, or at least someone he took under his wing, to say, you know what? This is important. It's a good life experience, and I'm going to take the financial hit to make this opportunity for you. VEDANTAM: Robert loved everything about the trip. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)R VAUGHAN: You're just doing guy things - it's amazing - where you're building campfires. And you're putting iodine in water, and, you know, you're smelling the ponderosa pine trees. And you're seeing deer and bears and having to put your food in bear bags. And you're just being rowdy and wrestling. It's - you know, it's a great time. VEDANTAM: When Robert graduated from Belpre High School in 2002, his plan was to go to college. But he couldn't afford it. R VAUGHAN: I actually did not know about student loans (laughter). I thought you just had to pay out of pocket. And I was like, I don't have that kind of money. And so my opportunities were either go get some working-class job in my town, working manufacturing at a plant, or join the military. VEDANTAM: He chose the latter. He enlisted in the Navy. R VAUGHAN: One of the things they asked me was, where do you want to have your first duty station? I said, I want to be as far away from Ohio as possible (laughter). And they said, how does San Diego sound? And I said, that sounds good. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: His first job out at sea was an aviation boatswain's mates handler - long job title paired with equally long work hours. R VAUGHAN: Eighteen-hour days. We would get the aircraft from the flight deck, and we would taxi them down to the hangar bay and chalk them and chain them and do that. And so we'd have these long flight days of bringing aircraft down for maintenance. VEDANTAM: Robert liked working those long hours. Living on the ship was like an extended Scouting trip. R VAUGHAN: Out to sea, there's literally nothing else to do. You are living your life with these people, 24/7. And so the downtime for us became sitting around and talking crap to each other and wrestling. So we'd be in our break room pretty much just having full-on group wrestling sessions (laughter) to get out energy. And then they'd say, OK, you know, we got some flights that are coming in. We got to bring them down. And so you're just doing that all day. And so it's just your whole life is around doing your job. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Robert joined the military because he didn't have the money for college. But after four years of service, he qualified for the GI Bill, which would cover his tuition and living expenses. In 2007, when he was 23. . . R VAUGHAN: I got out of the military, and my wife became the primary breadwinner for us. VEDANTAM: He began thinking about schools and programs. His wife's father had a suggestion. R VAUGHAN: My father-in-law, who is a respiratory therapist, said, hey, you know, you should really look into nursing. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: A man encouraging his daughter's husband to become a nurse - if you've seen the movie \"Meet The Parents,\" you know this is the exact opposite of the relationship portrayed by Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"MEET THE PARENTS\")DE NIRO: (As Jack Byrnes) You know, Greg's in medicine, too, Larry. JAMES REBHORN: (As Dr. Larry Banks) Oh, really? What field? BEN STILLER: (As Greg Focker) Uh, nursing. (LAUGHTER)REBHORN: (As Dr. Larry Banks) That's good. No, really, what field? STILLER: (As Greg Focker) Nursing. R VAUGHAN: The first thing that went through my head was, well, that's a woman's job. That's a female job. That's not something that, really, men go into. VEDANTAM: We know how this works. Remember psychologist Alice Eagly? EAGLY: If women are attracted to the occupation, then it becomes something that women do, and men would perhaps hesitate to enter. VEDANTAM: Why is this? What explains the reluctance of many men to enter professions that are dominated by women? Psychologist Jennifer Bosson used to believe there was a straightforward answer to that question. Her mother taught her, at a very young age, about sexism and misogyny. BOSSON: I was raised by a mother who was going through her own feminist awakening in the '70s and '80s. So by the time I got to college, I kind of - feminism was familiar to me. I had read a lot about it. So for me, college wasn't about kind of realizing that the world is unfair toward women (laughter). VEDANTAM: Instead, college was when she began to realize how the world restricted the choices of men. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Freshman year, Jennifer lived in a coed dorm. She made a whole suite of new friends, both men and women. BOSSON: And so I remember one time I had a crush on this guy. And I thought he was really just the cutest thing. And I asked a friend of mine, a male friend, don't you think - I'm going to change his name; I'm going to call him Dave. Don't you think Dave is really cute? And my friend [bleep] - oh, I should've changed his name (laughter). And my friend, Mark let's call him, said, I don't know. I can't tell. And I was like, what do you mean you can't tell if Dave is cute? Look at him. Look at his face. He's super cute. And Mark insisted that because he was a man and a straight man, he was incapable of judging the attractiveness of other men. And that enraged me at the time. I thought it was ridiculous. And I thought that he was just being kind of homophobic. And. . . VEDANTAM: Did you tell your friend, I think you're being homophobic? BOSSON: I don't remember if I accused him of that. I think what I was more inclined to do was say, nobody is going to think you're gay. I really just want to know, do you think his face is attractive (laughter)? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Jennifer never got an answer from her friend Mark. BOSSON: I assumed that he knew but just didn't feel comfortable saying. VEDANTAM: Jennifer's first reaction to this was what her mother had taught her. Guys go out of their way to appear macho because of a combination of homophobia and sexism. But over time, Jennifer began to study men's behavior. She's now a psychologist at the University of South Florida. And her data prompted her to a more nuanced conclusion about why men like Mark behave the way they do. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: In one revealing experiment, her team gathered a group of about 200 men and women and sat them in front of computers. BOSSON: We just kind of let them write for, you know, a few minutes about a time when they violated their gender role in public. VEDANTAM: Some of the women talked about being called a tomboy. Others mentioned times when they worked in male-dominated fields and were made to feel uncomfortable by coworkers. But men? BOSSON: Men say things like, I wore a pink shirt to work or, I held my girlfriend's purse while she ran into the bank or, I ordered a drink at a restaurant. And when it came out to me, it had a little cocktail umbrella in it, and my - you know, my friends teased me. So it's like - it's just mundane things. Like, women don't say, oh, I wore the wrong shirt. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Why would men make such a big deal out of trivial things? The familiar explanation is misogyny. But then Jennifer began to think about the different messages that boys receive from a very young age. We've all heard the taunts. BOSSON: Are you a real man? Or they say, man up. There's a lot of things that are off-limits for men. VEDANTAM: Jennifer's research experiments gradually led her to a new understanding of why men behave the way they do. BOSSON: My collaborators and I argue that the male gender role itself is kind of conceptualized as a more precarious status. So manhood is something that's hard to earn and easy to lose relative to womanhood. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Manhood is something that is hard to earn and easy to lose. This insight changed the way Jennifer thought about the behavior of her friend Mark. BOSSON: The pressure to not reveal any kinds of non-masculine opinions may have been so profound that it kind of made him feel like he really didn't know. VEDANTAM: Seen this way, the driving force here is not misogyny but fear. Men are defending something that's fragile. In terms of why this would be the case, why would you have one sex essentially have a more limited repertoire or have more policing around its boundaries? Why do women take their femininity for granted in ways that men do not take their masculinity for granted? BOSSON: That's a really hard question to answer. But I think it has to do with how men - their social status is more hierarchically organized than women's is. So men are kind of more interested in or motivated to attain social status, and that kind of then translates into what we propose is kind of a chronic anxiety about their status, and that translates into a concern about whether one's seen as a real man or not. VEDANTAM: This chronic anxiety comes through in one of Jennifer's experiments. BOSSON: We have men do a stereotypically feminine task, like braiding a mannequin's hair versus, in another condition, they braid three strands of thick rope. So we kind of - in both conditions, they're braiding. But in one condition, it's very - what they're doing is very stereotypically feminine because there's a mannequin head. And they're kind of - she's got this long, blonde wig on, and they're asked to braid her hair. And there's little - pink little bows that they're supposed to put in her hair. VEDANTAM: When you run that test on men and you randomly assign them to either braid hair or braid rope, what - how do you test what happens next, and what do the men do? BOSSON: So after they do that - oh, and also, while they're doing the activity, we're videotaping them. So we want it to feel very public to them. And we tell them, people are going to later code your videotape. So it's not just that they're sitting alone in a room doing this. So then we shut off the camera. And we say, oh, for the next half of the experiment, we're going to have you do another activity. But this time you get to choose which one you want to do. And you can either do this brainteaser puzzle where you have to rearrange these shapes, or you can put on some boxing gloves and hit this punching pad. And so in one of our studies, we found that if men braided hair, then they were much more likely to choose, as their next task, the punching task. But if they braided rope, then most of them wanted to do the brainteaser. So this suggests that the ones who had done the hair-braiding task felt emasculated, and so they kind of wanted to restore their masculinity by punching something, by, you know, behaving aggressively. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: There's something really funny about these studies, isn't there? BOSSON: Sure (laughter). That's one of my favorite things about what I do, is the kind of - the creativity and kind of concocting these scenarios. I also want to be taken seriously. So the findings aren't funny. The methods can be funny. VEDANTAM: To be sure, it's worth pointing out that societal messages that constrain men have often been developed by men. Jennifer's point is not that sexism doesn't play a role in shaping these behaviors. Her point is that men can be trapped by the gender roles that they themselves have authored. There's a way in which you can look at your work that you're doing and sort of say, in some ways, you're drawing - perhaps compassionate is sort of the wrong word. But you're drawing a more - deeper understanding of why men behave the way they do that is not just, men behave the way they do because there is misogyny. BOSSON: Right. You know, I guess I feel like I have compassion for anybody who kind of finds themselves stuck in a world that makes no sense to them. So regardless of whose fault it is, I think that the struggle for status that men kind of are constantly feeling like they have to participate in, it sucks. VEDANTAM: Men worry what other men will think, what women will think, what they themselves might think. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: All this leads us back to Robert Vaughan's dilemma about whether to become a nurse. The precarious status of masculinity drives many men to see the profession as the equivalent of braiding hair with pink ribbons. Remember that clip from \"Meet The Parents\"? (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"MEET THE PARENTS\")DE NIRO: (As Jack Byrnes) Not many men in your profession, are there, Greg? STILLER: (As Greg Focker) No, Jack, not traditionally. VEDANTAM: This idea is deeply woven into our culture. Think about all the jokes you've heard about male nurses. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FRIENDS\")PERRY: (As Chandler Bing) So Dan. . . VEDANTAM: You've heard them on \"Friends. \"(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FRIENDS\")PERRY: (As Chandler Bing) Nurse, not a doctor, huh? Kind of girly, isn't it? (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: And even on shows about hospital life, like \"House. \"(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"HOUSE\")HUGH LAURIE: (As Gregory House) Sorry, can't remember if I mocked you yet for being a male nurse. VEDANTAM: And \"Scrubs. \"(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SCRUBS\")RICKY SCHRODER: (As Paul Flowers) She's embarrassed that she likes a nurse, and I really can't figure out why. KEN JENKINS: (As Bob Kelso) Well, that's because you're doing a woman's job, son. Have a good one. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: So if you're in Robert's shoes, is there a way to silence the voice in your head that says, this kind of work is emasculating? R VAUGHAN: A woman's job, a woman's job, a woman's job. VEDANTAM: You're listening to HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. This is NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. (SOUNDBITE OF TYPEWRITER CLACKING)VEDANTAM: London, autumn 1854, word was spreading through the city. Thousands of British soldiers had died in a conflict 1,500 miles away in Eastern Europe - the Crimean War. But these men were not killed in combat. JULIE FAIRMAN: What they were really dying of, which was of - not of their wounds, but infectious disease. VEDANTAM: Historian Julie Fairman at the University of Pennsylvania says Londoners were shocked to learn about the poor medical conditions in Crimea. One woman in particular felt called to action. She was wealthy, from high society. Her name was Florence Nightingale. FAIRMAN: She was able to convince her friends - and she had friends in high places - to let her take a contingent of nurses to the Crimea to take charge of this hospital. VEDANTAM: In November, 1854, she arrived at a war camp with a group of nearly 40 nurses. FAIRMAN: She finds hospitals that are dark. And they're dingy, and there's no air. And there's soldiers lying on the ground, crying out. It must have been horrendous. VEDANTAM: Florence Nightingale took charge, bringing cleanliness and order to the medical camps. She focused on sanitation. She made sure that injured soldiers were fed. Back home, she came to be seen as something of a trailblazer. When she returned to London, she established the world's first professional nursing school with one type of student in mind - women. This was a shift. Before the Crimean War, nursing was not seen as the exclusive preserve of women. FAIRMAN: Everybody was a nurse. Everybody took care of their family members. They took care of the children. They took care of the wounded in battle. And so the profession - in fact, you don't even talk about profession - but the idea of providing care to people was pretty heterogeneous across men, women and others. VEDANTAM: But Florence Nightingale was convinced that nursing was not for men. As her method spread to Australia, Canada and the United States, women came to dominate nursing. Men were pushed to the fringes of the field, limited to working in psychiatric wards. By the 1930s, men were only 2 percent of nurses in the United States. Even today, that number is only 10 percent. FAIRMAN: The idea of women being able to give that gentle, caring touch when they provided care was a really strong ethos throughout the nursing profession and the public. VEDANTAM: Of course, when you think about it, there's nothing inherently feminine about nursing. Florence Nightingale literally invented that idea and made it real. So if you could turn nursing from a genderless profession to one seen as exclusively female, can you make the clock turn backwards? BOSSON: To some degree, you can spin any job. . . VEDANTAM: This, again, is psychologist Jennifer Bosson. BOSSON: You could spin nursing as a very masculine occupation. It's dangerous. It's physically grueling. You don't really have to be that warm to be a nurse. It doesn't hurt, but, you know. So our stereotype of the nurse is one that almost - you know, you could modify that stereotype and turn nursing into a profession that does seem masculine or male-appropriate. VEDANTAM: As it turned out, something along the lines of what Jennifer proposed was presented to Robert Vaughan. Remember how, when Robert got out of the Navy, his father-in-law suggested he think about nursing as a profession? R VAUGHAN: It's a in-demand field, pays pretty well. And it's stable. You work 12-hour shifts, three days a week. You can make good money at it. VEDANTAM: Robert didn't take his father-in-law's advice, but he did get a job at a hospital as a security guard. And one day, he had to deal with two patients who were out of control. R VAUGHAN: We had a couple guys who came into the emergency room who were high, presumably on PCP. I don't remember what it was at the time. And they were just very belligerent, fighting. There was blood all over the place. And they were - had to be split up into different rooms. And so we're trying to attend to them, and they. . . VEDANTAM: Were you actually asked to secure them in one of the rooms? What was the role that you were playing? R VAUGHAN: Yeah, security, we're kind of there to have eyes on and potentially hands on, if we need to, to help control the situation. So I was there. And these guys both came out of their rooms that they were isolated into and just started fighting. And they actually locked themselves in one of the rooms and destroyed the room, did couple thousand dollars' worth of damage, and blood everywhere on the ceilings. And the nurses and us and the sheriffs were - and the doctors were all holding them down and sedating and restraining. And I was like, man, this is pretty cool (laughter). As much as it was, you know, potentially dangerous, the action that the nurses were seeing was pretty exciting for me. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)R VAUGHAN: You know, you think of nursing - you think of someone sitting at a bedside and being, like, let me hold your hand. And you see what it is realistically day-to-day, and for me, it was 180 degrees. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Robert took his father-in-law's advice and enrolled in nursing school. Now, it's not as if the old stereotypes about gender and nursing disappeared altogether. But Robert found ways to carve a path of his own. His wife Christine says that when he was in nursing school, he bonded with the handful of other men in the program. CHRISTINE VAUGHAN: Four of his closest friends are men who went through the nursing school program with him. And that kind of bond that they built, that brotherhood - maybe it's very kind of, like, military-esque that they were together. And so there's this common thread of, like, we're the men united together, you know, in this space. VEDANTAM: He's now been in the field for more than a decade. He works in a cardiovascular unit. When you made the decision to become a nurse, did you tell your friends or family about this? I'm wondering if - did you have hesitation about doing this? Were there an awkward conversation where you sort of said, you know, I'm going to become a nurse? Did people look at you strangely? R VAUGHAN: I thought I would. I thought I would at least some jeering from guys, you know, that I knew - be like, oh, you're going to be a nurse. You know? Oh, we always knew that you were in the closet. Or you know, there's jokes about - well, if you're a nurse, then therefore, you must be gay. But surprisingly, I did not get that. Like, a lot of the guys that I was friends with and - when I told them, you know, I'm going to go into nursing, they were like, oh, that's cool. It's a good job. It pays well. You know, it's a job of service. You know, you're helping people in their time of need. And I don't think there's any better job out there as far as - you literally get paid to help people in some of their worst moments and help them get better and heal and go home. And that, for me - I get paid to do that. It's awesome. C VAUGHAN: And I find something really interesting. If I do say my husband's a nurse, people usually want to know if there's a specialty. VEDANTAM: Christine Vaughn has seen people perform mental gymnastics when she tells them about her husband's job. C VAUGHAN: And sometimes when I said, oh, well, he works in cardiology, it's like, oh - as if that's masculine - you know, like, that's made it more masculine nursing. And it's just a very interesting dynamic. I know he'll tell me stories, just that he'll walk into a room, and a patient will assume he's the doctor. VEDANTAM: And once they realize he's not, Robert says patients sometimes get uncomfortable. R VAUGHAN: In fact, I just got that last week. And you just go, oh, it's OK. If you don't want a male, perfectly fine. We'll work with that. I can talk to the charge nurse, and we'll get assignments changed around, and we'll make a note that you prefer female staff only. VEDANTAM: And did you do that? Did you say that? R VAUGHAN: Oh, yeah. I said that. I always say it every time if they have an issue. And sometimes they go, no, no; it's fine. It's just, I've never had a nurse before that was male. And sometimes they're OK with it. And sometimes they do want to change. And it's just - it's not a factor. VEDANTAM: I just want to spend a second talking about how you feel with these interactions. I understand that, at a professional level, you are - you're happy to sort of say, you know, I'll accommodate your request and move on. But at some level, this is - you know, someone is basically saying they don't want you to be their nurse. And isn't that a little hurtful? R VAUGHAN: It's a little hurtful, especially when I find it somewhat hypocritical when you'll have a - the doctor is a male. And you're - they're present; they're doing the checks. And it's very intimate. But somehow, as a nurse, I'm male and that's a problem. It's like - it doesn't make any sense to me. You go - wait a minute. The doctor is a male, too. Somehow you have no issue with him. But as a male nurse, you have an issue. It's contradictory. VEDANTAM: Nearly everyone agrees it's a good idea to have diversity in health care. But Robert says there's a double standard when it comes to men in nursing. R VAUGHAN: You know, you see women going in to become doctors. They are - it's admired. You're like, oh, it's great. It's a wonderful thing that they're going into this, and we want that. But the flip side of you've got more men going into nursing, there isn't the accolade of - oh, my gosh. You are - it's great of you to be reaching out and overcoming these gender stereotypes and going into this profession. They just look at you, go, oh, I guess you probably weren't smart enough to be a doctor. VEDANTAM: There were some things about Robert I figured I couldn't get by just talking to him on the phone. (SOUNDBITE OF CAR DOOR CLOSING)VEDANTAM: So I went to meet him. Hi. You must be Robert. R VAUGHAN: Hey. How are you? VEDANTAM: How are you? He's 5'10\". He has a muscular frame and a shaved head with a goatee. I shadowed him as he exercised in his home gym. C VAUGHAN: I think, for him when he was in nursing school, starting cycling with a group of other males going through nursing school was a starting point for him of, like, I'm going to have my own equipment. I'm going to do this. I'm going to take care of my body, and I'm going to do so very early in the morning religiously while my wife is still sleeping - because I'm just still amazed that he wakes up at 4:30 in the morning to do these things. Did he tell you this? VEDANTAM: Today he thankfully moved the session to 4:30 p. m. Robert has set up a bunch of equipment in his garage. There's a bench, stacks of weights, dumbbells, a pull-up bar. My favorite things are the motivational messages plastered on the wall. One sticker says, discipline equals freedom. Robert says it's from Jocko Willink. R VAUGHAN: Jocko Willink - he's a Navy SEAL. He's on Twitter. He's quite popular, but he has a method. It's - you have a squat day, you have a push day, you have a lift day and you have a pull day. VEDANTAM: As I listened to Robert, I couldn't help but remember the study that Jennifer Bosson had conducted. When men are asked to braid hair, they compensate by punching bags to reclaim their lost masculinity. Could some of Robert's intense exercise regimen be connected to his job as a nurse? Could the sports truck he drives to work every day be a defense mechanism? R VAUGHAN: I think a lot of guys who might go into health care are interested in health and fitness. And I think part of it may also be showing, hey, you know, I'm not this - I'm not sure the wording I'd want to use - I'm not a - this nurse stereotype. Maybe it's pushing against the stereotype of what you might assume a male nurse would be. And so it's saying, you know what? I'm not that. I'm actually pretty manly in other aspects. VEDANTAM: While Robert rejects the idea that his own fitness regime is a form of psychological compensation, he does see himself compensating in another area. R VAUGHAN: I've had patients where I've had them a couple days, two, three days. And at first, they were hesitant about having a male as a nurse. And they would pull me aside as they're discharging home, and they say, you know what? You were the best nurse the entire time I was here. I had a lot of female nurses, and they were great. But you were actually more gentle, more caring because you are acutely aware of the fact that you're being judged in that manner. VEDANTAM: Robert was drawn to nursing because he saw the job as an extension of the identity he'd established in the military. But in his decade as a nurse, he's grown to admire the skills he once considered feminine. R VAUGHAN: My thinking on this has evolved to the point where I can say men are still just as compassionate and empathetic. We just express that sometimes in a different way. You know, being a father - I have two kids. You know, I don't love my kids any less than my wife does. But I show my love and my compassion and my empathy to my kids sometimes in a different way than my wife does. C VAUGHAN: Is that your trampoline? My daughter, who's 4 - almost 4 - goes up to my mother and says, grandma, look at my muscles. I work out. VEDANTAM: Oh, my gosh. What are these? Are these two-pound dumbbells? R VAUGHAN: My daughter wakes up, and she wants to do pushups with me in the morning. And she wants to eat my protein bar when I'm waking up in the morning. You know, the impact that I have on her, you know, is me being a role model for making her a strong, independent woman. VEDANTAM: When policymakers talk about interventions to help the jobless find work, they talk about vocational schools and retraining skills. They don't talk about how, without anyone saying it aloud, one-half of the population might be systematically excluding itself from the very parts of the economy that are booming. Robert was reluctant to pursue nursing because of all the narratives about male nurses. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FRIENDS\")PERRY: (As Chandler Bing) Kind of girly, isn't it? (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: Of course, there is another word for these emasculating jokes. They are stereotypes. When it comes to fighting stereotypes, we often imagine that the right approach is to explain why the stereotypes are wrong. But Robert's life suggests a different solution, and perhaps a more effective one. Stereotypes are powerful because the stories we tell about ourselves are powerful. They shape how we see the world and how the world sees us. But in the end, they are only stories. And stories - we can rewrite them.

SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST:   This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. We begin today in Las Vegas. The year - 2004. The scene - a high-stakes poker game. Our protagonist is a woman named Annie Duke. She's about to win $2 million. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PHIL HELLMUTH: I'm all-in. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: And with that top pair, Phil Hellmuth is going all-in with his 450,000 thousand chips. Annie Duke put the pressure on Phil when she check-raised him. VEDANTAM: This was the final hand of the World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions. ANNIE DUKE: They had these incredible hall-of-fame players like Doyle Brunson, who was a hall-of-famer, Johnny Chan, who was a hall-of-famer, and then Phil Hellmuth, who has the most championships of anyone in the history of the World Series of Poker. And then there was me. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Annie calls the all-in. HELLMUTH: (Expletive). UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: And Phil sees what he's up against. VEDANTAM: Annie and this guy, Phil, were the last two at the table. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: And Annie is overcome with emotion seeing how close she is to winning this championship. VEDANTAM: Annie's crying. Phil's standing up, pacing back-and-forth. The dealer's laying out the cards that will determine who wins. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Annie has control of this hand. Now here comes the turn. It's a seven - no help for Phil. VEDANTAM: Annie was the only woman in this competition. She had knocked out eight guys - eight of the best players in the world - to get to this point. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: Annie Duke is now one card away from $2 million. DUKE: But I didn't really feel like I deserved to be at that table. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: At that moment, Annie Duke was feeling the pressure of something that psychologists call stereotype threat. Here's how it works. Let's say you think people have a certain stereotype about you. There's a part of you that's afraid that your actions and behavior will prove the stereotype is true. DUKE: I'm sort of thinking about, well, if I fold and I'm wrong, everybody's going to be like, see, she plays like a girl. Like, look how he pushed her around. VEDANTAM: But Annie's story is also about a second idea, one that often has a positive outcome. This idea is called stereotype tax. That's when a stereotype that others have about you works to your advantage. DUKE: If somebody was at the table who was so emotionally invested in the fact that I was a woman, given that they're treating me that way, how can I come up with the best strategy to take their money because I guess, in the end, isn't that the best revenge? VEDANTAM: Annie had started playing poker in 1994. By the time she got to that championship game 10 years later, she had basically figured out how to make stereotypes about women in poker work for her. DUKE: So I can tell you that the first year that I played in the World Series of Poker Main Event, which was in 1994, 3 percent of the entrants were women. And last year, that number would've been the same. VEDANTAM: Wow. So this is an extraordinarily male-dominated sport? DUKE: Completely. I was generally the only woman at the table. I had to really love that game in order to be willing to expose myself to a lot of the behavior that I was experiencing. VEDANTAM: Tell me what you heard. What did people say? DUKE: There were people who were incredibly welcoming. There were other people - you know, there was one guy who I lost a pot to, and he said, don't cry, I'll give you your money back if we go across the street to the Northern, and the Northern was a hotel. VEDANTAM: Wow. DUKE: You know, and I got called a lot of bad things. But to think about it as, OK, given that this person is viewing me in a way that I find disrespectful, try to separate yourself from your emotional reaction to that, and think about how you can use that to your advantage. VEDANTAM: Annie had learned to make her opponents pay - literally pay - for the stereotypes they held about women. DUKE: Right. At the poker table, for example, I sort of, in my head, divided people into three categories. One was the flirting chauvinist, and that person was really viewing me in a way that was sexual. VEDANTAM: And not as blatantly as the guy who invited her back to the great Northern Hotel. These were just guys who sometimes seemed more concerned about getting Annie to like them than they were about winning. DUKE: And, like, they'd show me their whole cards when they were done with the hand to show me whether it was a good fold or not. They'd kind of tell me during the hand, if I was alone with them in the hand, you know, what they had. VEDANTAM: They were trying to make nice with you. DUKE: They were trying to make nice with me, exactly. I never did go out on a date with any of them, but, you know, it was kind of flirtatious at the table, and I could use that to my advantage. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Then there's a second kind of guy. DUKE: What I would call the disrespecting chauvinist, who mainly just thought that women weren't creative, that they could only think one level deep. So they didn't believe that you knew how to bluff, for example, because that's a level deep in your thinking. They didn't think that you really had creativity. They thought you were very straightforward in the way that you play because, you know, you're a girl. VEDANTAM: Right. So they assume that you are naive, basically. DUKE: Exactly. So there are strategies that you can use against them. Mainly, you can bluff those people a lot. VEDANTAM: And then there's a third kind of guy - perhaps the most reckless. DUKE: The angry chauvinist. VEDANTAM: This is a guy who would do anything to avoid being beaten by a woman. DUKE: You couldn't bluff them because they would call you all the time for fear that you might be bluffing them, and then they would also try to push you around a lot. So they would play extremely aggressively against you. They'd be trying to bluff you all the time because the best thing that could happen to them was that they bluffed you, and then they could show you that they had a terrible hand and, like, be like, ha-ha, little girl, look what happened to you. VEDANTAM: Right, because that would confirm that everything that they believed about you was true. DUKE: Right. So you can just sort of wait until they - and what I say is, until they would impale themselves on your chips. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: I have to ask you, though, so it's clear that thinking about this mathematically and in a very detached and unemotional way gave you an edge at the poker table. And I can clearly see how that's very smart. But you're not a robot. You're not a computer. DUKE: No. VEDANTAM: At some level, you also are processing how people actually are behaving toward you. And I'm wondering if you could talk a minute about how this felt. DUKE: Most of the time, I would sort of say, I have emotions about this. I'm going to set them aside and deal with them later. And then I would leave the table and drive home in tears. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: In her first 10 years at the poker table, Annie was able to compartmentalize her emotions, and she won a lot of money doing this, using stereotype tax to her advantage - that was, until 2004 at the Tournament of Champions. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Intimidation is such a big part of being a successful player. Is that going to come into play at this table, you think? UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #3: Oh, not really. In fact, these players know each other so well, if one of them sneezes, somebody else has already handed them a handkerchief. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: Actually, at least for Annie, that wasn't true. She had never played poker on TV before, and she was pretty sure she had been invited as the token woman, that she was way out of her league. She thought that ESPN, televising the game in this way for the first time, just thought it was good optics to have her there. DUKE: And I went in there with this incredible fear that my play, which was now in front of lipstick cameras - so my mistakes were no longer going to be private to me - that that was going to expose that everybody was right, and I was actually a terrible player and, despite the fact that I had spent the last 10 years making my living playing poker at the highest levels of the game, that I didn't really deserve to have ever won anything. I was bad, and I had just gotten lucky, and now everybody was going to know it, and what they were saying was true. VEDANTAM: You felt like an imposter. DUKE: Completely. VEDANTAM: You were facing a very difficult situation here, which is you're not just juggling with what's happening at the poker table, but you're juggling with all this other psychological crap, in a way, that just makes it hard to focus on what it is that you're actually doing. And in so many ways, that, to me, is a perfect illustration of stereotype threat. It shows that when there's a stereotype that's in the air, when there's a stereotype that multiple people believe, even if you don't believe it yourself, if you're the person who is potentially at the receiving end of that stereotype, it affects your behavior in such a way that you become more likely to make the stereotype come true. DUKE: I think that that's completely true. It was always in the back of my mind, like, that - do they really respect me? Why are they talking to me? Is it just because they are thinking about me in a different way, like they want to be friends with me because I'm a girl? Or do they actually respect my play? VEDANTAM: There was one hand, Annie says, when stereotype threat got the better of her. DUKE: So in this particular hand, where I had two 10s. . . VEDANTAM: Which is a pretty good hand. It was good enough that there wasn't a huge chance that her opponent, this guy Greg Raymer, had a better hand. But there was still a chance. As a professional poker player, this is the kind of hand that you evaluate in a matter of seconds. DUKE: So I really needed to eliminate that hand as a possibility, and I was having a lot of trouble doing that because I was so afraid of making this really bad, big decision on television and having everyone say, I told you so. VEDANTAM: This was a pivotal hand, but a lot of the significance was really just in Annie's head. If she folded but really had the best hand. . . DUKE: Everybody's going to be like, see, she plays like a girl. Like, look how he pushed her around. And if I called and I was wrong, then I could come up with a whole other thing, like look how bad she is. Could - didn't she know that he had the best hand? Like, any idiot would have known that, you know? And that was running in my head as I was trying to make this decision. VEDANTAM: So you're damned if you do, and you're damned if you don't. DUKE: Absolutely. Absolutely. And it was incredibly difficult. And it wasn't until I kind of snapped to and saw this tell that he had. VEDANTAM: And when you say a tell, you mean what? DUKE: So a tell is a physical - well, it could be something verbal that somebody says that gives a clue. But generally, when we talk about tells, we're talking about something physical that somebody does that telegraphs the quality of their hand, or at least what they think the quality of their hand is. So Greg Raymer did something, which I haven't actually said what he actually did because I think that's unfair to him. But he did something that gave away the fact that his hand was very, very strong, which allowed me to then fold. And at that moment, I was actually quite confident in it. VEDANTAM: But Annie's confidence in her decision was short-lived. Another player came up to her during a break in the game. What he said kicked the stereotype threat in Annie's head into overdrive. DUKE: Phil Hellmuth, right after that hand occurred, came up and just told me, like, what an idiot I was because, clearly, Greg Raymer had ace-king. And I thought, oh, my gosh. This is a guy who's, like, at the - now, I think he's a 12-time world champion, but at the time, he probably had, you know, seven world championships or something. And he seemed pretty confident that he had ace-king, and - oh, no. And it was just - and then I had an hour in my room having a panic attack while we were on break from the tournament. It was pretty awful. VEDANTAM: Stereotype threat had produced in Annie's head what poker players call tilt. DUKE: Tilt, when you allow kind of bad things that happened to you that - and very often are out of your control to cause you to be a poor decision-maker going forward. (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Annie has picked up a heart draw here. . . VEDANTAM: So after she nearly lost it in her hotel room, Annie comes back to the table, and she has a stroke of luck. She wins a pretty nice hand. And you can actually hear at this point in the game, Annie begins to loosen up. It was as if she'd finally gotten the stereotype threat under control. (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS) DUKE: The flop was just - wow. GREG RAYMER: Yeah, it doesn't matter what order they come in, right? DUKE: It doesn't matter. . . RAYMER: (Laughter). DUKE: . . . Well, it kind of does in that situation, you know? VEDANTAM: Annie had turned on the charm. The next time she faced Greg Raymer in a hand. . . (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Now Raymer needs to call or get out of the way. VEDANTAM: . . . He got cocky. (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS) RAYMER: I call. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Oh, the world champion is going to call. It's a three, no good for Raymer. RAYMER: Three, seven. . . VEDANTAM: On the next hand, Annie he would knock out Raymer, whose nickname was Fossilman. (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: It is an ace. It's no help to Fossilman, and he goes down. DUKE: You played really well. VEDANTAM: Just like that, Annie was back in the zone. DUKE: And that actually sort of brought me out of this very bad headspace. VEDANTAM: Soon the table dwindled to four players. (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Hellmuth knocking out Johnny Chan in fourth place. VEDANTAM: Then there were three. . . (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: It's a three. And that's the end of the line for Howard Lederer. VEDANTAM: . . . Until finally, Annie and Phil Hellmuth, the guy who nearly destroyed her confidence earlier in the game - these are the only two left. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: And Annie says to him. . . (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS) DUKE: This is all right, you know? I'm just happy to be in the final two. I mean, seriously, I donked (ph) my money off in the first two hours. . . VEDANTAM: You could argue that this little-old-me act. . . (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS) DUKE: . . . Somehow. . . VEDANTAM: . . . Really did a number on Phil Hellmuth. . . (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS) DUKE: . . . Some way. VEDANTAM: . . . Because for the next half a dozen hands, he just did not know what to make of Annie. (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Annie's got Phil second-guessing every move he makes and every move he doesn't make. VEDANTAM: At this point, it's obvious to both Annie and Phil the other person has a strong hand. The question is, how strong? That's a judgment call. It's based on probability, instinct and all the undercurrents, expectations and stereotypes that have been running through the game the entire time. But now there's only one question. If Annie thinks that Phil has misjudged her, she knows she should call his bet. (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS) DUKE: I call. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: Annie calls the all-in. HELLMUTH: [Expletive]. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: And Phil sees what he's up against. VEDANTAM: And what he's up against here, meaning the dealer's cards, that's going to determine who wins. And if there was any moment that perfectly revealed how much of an outsider Annie was in this situation, it's this next one. (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: Annie Duke is now one card away from $2 million. HELLMUTH: An eight, please. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Phil Hellmuth needs an eight to win this pot. Both players on their feet, anticipating the river card. It's a three. Annie Duke has defeated nine of the strongest poker players in the world and wins the first ever World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions. HELLMUTH: [Expletive]. (SOUNDBITE OF DOOR SLAMMING) VEDANTAM: In classic reality-television style, cameras follow Phil as he storms away from the table, out a door. . . (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS) HELLMUTH: She check-raised me six times. VEDANTAM: . . . Just pacing around talking to himself. (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS) HELLMUTH: I know she didn't have it all six times. DUKE: Oh, my God, I won. VEDANTAM: It was the reaction of a man who just got beat. (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS) HELLMUTH: She had to be [expletive] 30-to-1 to win this. VEDANTAM: By someone. . . (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS) HELLMUTH: I love Annie. . . VEDANTAM: . . . Who wasn't supposed to win. . . (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS) HELLMUTH: . . . But [expletive]. VEDANTAM: . . . And maybe even wasn't supposed to be at the table in the first place. But precisely because Annie Duke knew how stereotypes can be both threat and advantage, well. . . (SOUNDBITE OF 2004 WORLD SERIES OF POKER TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Well, you heard Phil, and he was right. Annie was definitely a longshot to win this all. But as the only female at the table, she is now the last man standing. DUKE: Oh. VEDANTAM: I have to say, Annie Duke, you're not just a good poker player, but you're clearly a very wise person. DUKE: (Laughter) Well, so are you. Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: High-stakes poker is one of many domains where women have been forced to be flexible or, in some cases, to elbow their way into a world dominated by men. For centuries, women have been locked out of different professions because of barriers built on sexism and patriarchy. But as the economy has started to boom in fields traditionally dominated by women, men have not sought jobs in those areas. If anything, they seem to actively avoid such professions. ALICE EAGLY: If women are attracted to the occupation, then it becomes something that women do, and men would perhaps hesitate to enter. VEDANTAM: This is Northwestern University psychologist Alice Eagly. She says men even avoid female-dominated professions that used to be male-dominated, like working as a bank teller. EAGLY: There used to be quite a few males. But then there got to be so many women, evidently, that men could find it a bit of a masculinity threat. Oh, you're a bank teller, people would say. They see bank tellers being women. And so they think of it - oh, it's feminine - not even knowing much about what they do. VEDANTAM: After the break, masculinity threats. . . JENNIFER BOSSON: Man up. ROBERT VAUGHAN: You must be gay. VEDANTAM: . . . How a fear of appearing feminine shapes the lives of men and affects us all. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"MEET THE PARENTS\") ROBERT DE NIRO: (As Jack Byrnes) Not many men in your profession, though, are there, Greg? BOSSON: Man up. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FRIENDS\") MATTHEW PERRY: (As Chandler Bing) Kind of girly, isn't it? (LAUGHTER) BOSSON: You're gay. . . R VAUGHAN: A woman's job. BOSSON: . . . Man up. R VAUGHAN: A woman's job. VEDANTAM: This is NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. R VAUGHAN: My name is Robert Vaughan. VEDANTAM: When he was 23, Robert Vaughn faced a dilemma - conform to norms of masculinity or pursue a promising career in a field long dominated by women. His life illustrates how such norms exert a gravitational force on the choices of millions of men. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Robert grew up in Belpre, Ohio. R VAUGHAN: Very small town on the border of West Virginia. VEDANTAM: There were clear expectations for the men in Belpre. R VAUGHAN: Military service was big in my community. VEDANTAM: For boys who were Robert's age, the extracurricular activity of choice was Scouting. R VAUGHAN: My parents were divorced when I was 2, and I didn't really have a father figure growing up. And so Scouting became a way of kind of getting a bond with other men. VEDANTAM: A few years into Scouting, Robert desperately wanted to go on a trip to New Mexico. R VAUGHAN: I grew up in a very poor home. You know, we were on welfare. We didn't have the money to afford such a trip. And one of the men in our group actually stepped forward and paid for my way to be able to go. So that was really impactful for me, to have one of the men in our troop that saw me enough as a son, or at least someone he took under his wing, to say, you know what? This is important. It's a good life experience, and I'm going to take the financial hit to make this opportunity for you. VEDANTAM: Robert loved everything about the trip. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) R VAUGHAN: You're just doing guy things - it's amazing - where you're building campfires. And you're putting iodine in water, and, you know, you're smelling the ponderosa pine trees. And you're seeing deer and bears and having to put your food in bear bags. And you're just being rowdy and wrestling. It's - you know, it's a great time. VEDANTAM: When Robert graduated from Belpre High School in 2002, his plan was to go to college. But he couldn't afford it. R VAUGHAN: I actually did not know about student loans (laughter). I thought you just had to pay out of pocket. And I was like, I don't have that kind of money. And so my opportunities were either go get some working-class job in my town, working manufacturing at a plant, or join the military. VEDANTAM: He chose the latter. He enlisted in the Navy. R VAUGHAN: One of the things they asked me was, where do you want to have your first duty station? I said, I want to be as far away from Ohio as possible (laughter). And they said, how does San Diego sound? And I said, that sounds good. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: His first job out at sea was an aviation boatswain's mates handler - long job title paired with equally long work hours. R VAUGHAN: Eighteen-hour days. We would get the aircraft from the flight deck, and we would taxi them down to the hangar bay and chalk them and chain them and do that. And so we'd have these long flight days of bringing aircraft down for maintenance. VEDANTAM: Robert liked working those long hours. Living on the ship was like an extended Scouting trip. R VAUGHAN: Out to sea, there's literally nothing else to do. You are living your life with these people, 24/7. And so the downtime for us became sitting around and talking crap to each other and wrestling. So we'd be in our break room pretty much just having full-on group wrestling sessions (laughter) to get out energy. And then they'd say, OK, you know, we got some flights that are coming in. We got to bring them down. And so you're just doing that all day. And so it's just your whole life is around doing your job. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Robert joined the military because he didn't have the money for college. But after four years of service, he qualified for the GI Bill, which would cover his tuition and living expenses. In 2007, when he was 23. . . R VAUGHAN: I got out of the military, and my wife became the primary breadwinner for us. VEDANTAM: He began thinking about schools and programs. His wife's father had a suggestion. R VAUGHAN: My father-in-law, who is a respiratory therapist, said, hey, you know, you should really look into nursing. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: A man encouraging his daughter's husband to become a nurse - if you've seen the movie \"Meet The Parents,\" you know this is the exact opposite of the relationship portrayed by Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"MEET THE PARENTS\") DE NIRO: (As Jack Byrnes) You know, Greg's in medicine, too, Larry. JAMES REBHORN: (As Dr. Larry Banks) Oh, really? What field? BEN STILLER: (As Greg Focker) Uh, nursing. (LAUGHTER) REBHORN: (As Dr. Larry Banks) That's good. No, really, what field? STILLER: (As Greg Focker) Nursing. R VAUGHAN: The first thing that went through my head was, well, that's a woman's job. That's a female job. That's not something that, really, men go into. VEDANTAM: We know how this works. Remember psychologist Alice Eagly? EAGLY: If women are attracted to the occupation, then it becomes something that women do, and men would perhaps hesitate to enter. VEDANTAM: Why is this? What explains the reluctance of many men to enter professions that are dominated by women? Psychologist Jennifer Bosson used to believe there was a straightforward answer to that question. Her mother taught her, at a very young age, about sexism and misogyny. BOSSON: I was raised by a mother who was going through her own feminist awakening in the '70s and '80s. So by the time I got to college, I kind of - feminism was familiar to me. I had read a lot about it. So for me, college wasn't about kind of realizing that the world is unfair toward women (laughter). VEDANTAM: Instead, college was when she began to realize how the world restricted the choices of men. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Freshman year, Jennifer lived in a coed dorm. She made a whole suite of new friends, both men and women. BOSSON: And so I remember one time I had a crush on this guy. And I thought he was really just the cutest thing. And I asked a friend of mine, a male friend, don't you think - I'm going to change his name; I'm going to call him Dave. Don't you think Dave is really cute? And my friend [bleep] - oh, I should've changed his name (laughter). And my friend, Mark let's call him, said, I don't know. I can't tell. And I was like, what do you mean you can't tell if Dave is cute? Look at him. Look at his face. He's super cute. And Mark insisted that because he was a man and a straight man, he was incapable of judging the attractiveness of other men. And that enraged me at the time. I thought it was ridiculous. And I thought that he was just being kind of homophobic. And. . . VEDANTAM: Did you tell your friend, I think you're being homophobic? BOSSON: I don't remember if I accused him of that. I think what I was more inclined to do was say, nobody is going to think you're gay. I really just want to know, do you think his face is attractive (laughter)? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Jennifer never got an answer from her friend Mark. BOSSON: I assumed that he knew but just didn't feel comfortable saying. VEDANTAM: Jennifer's first reaction to this was what her mother had taught her. Guys go out of their way to appear macho because of a combination of homophobia and sexism. But over time, Jennifer began to study men's behavior. She's now a psychologist at the University of South Florida. And her data prompted her to a more nuanced conclusion about why men like Mark behave the way they do. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: In one revealing experiment, her team gathered a group of about 200 men and women and sat them in front of computers. BOSSON: We just kind of let them write for, you know, a few minutes about a time when they violated their gender role in public. VEDANTAM: Some of the women talked about being called a tomboy. Others mentioned times when they worked in male-dominated fields and were made to feel uncomfortable by coworkers. But men? BOSSON: Men say things like, I wore a pink shirt to work or, I held my girlfriend's purse while she ran into the bank or, I ordered a drink at a restaurant. And when it came out to me, it had a little cocktail umbrella in it, and my - you know, my friends teased me. So it's like - it's just mundane things. Like, women don't say, oh, I wore the wrong shirt. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Why would men make such a big deal out of trivial things? The familiar explanation is misogyny. But then Jennifer began to think about the different messages that boys receive from a very young age. We've all heard the taunts. BOSSON: Are you a real man? Or they say, man up. There's a lot of things that are off-limits for men. VEDANTAM: Jennifer's research experiments gradually led her to a new understanding of why men behave the way they do. BOSSON: My collaborators and I argue that the male gender role itself is kind of conceptualized as a more precarious status. So manhood is something that's hard to earn and easy to lose relative to womanhood. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Manhood is something that is hard to earn and easy to lose. This insight changed the way Jennifer thought about the behavior of her friend Mark. BOSSON: The pressure to not reveal any kinds of non-masculine opinions may have been so profound that it kind of made him feel like he really didn't know. VEDANTAM: Seen this way, the driving force here is not misogyny but fear. Men are defending something that's fragile. In terms of why this would be the case, why would you have one sex essentially have a more limited repertoire or have more policing around its boundaries? Why do women take their femininity for granted in ways that men do not take their masculinity for granted? BOSSON: That's a really hard question to answer. But I think it has to do with how men - their social status is more hierarchically organized than women's is. So men are kind of more interested in or motivated to attain social status, and that kind of then translates into what we propose is kind of a chronic anxiety about their status, and that translates into a concern about whether one's seen as a real man or not. VEDANTAM: This chronic anxiety comes through in one of Jennifer's experiments. BOSSON: We have men do a stereotypically feminine task, like braiding a mannequin's hair versus, in another condition, they braid three strands of thick rope. So we kind of - in both conditions, they're braiding. But in one condition, it's very - what they're doing is very stereotypically feminine because there's a mannequin head. And they're kind of - she's got this long, blonde wig on, and they're asked to braid her hair. And there's little - pink little bows that they're supposed to put in her hair. VEDANTAM: When you run that test on men and you randomly assign them to either braid hair or braid rope, what - how do you test what happens next, and what do the men do? BOSSON: So after they do that - oh, and also, while they're doing the activity, we're videotaping them. So we want it to feel very public to them. And we tell them, people are going to later code your videotape. So it's not just that they're sitting alone in a room doing this. So then we shut off the camera. And we say, oh, for the next half of the experiment, we're going to have you do another activity. But this time you get to choose which one you want to do. And you can either do this brainteaser puzzle where you have to rearrange these shapes, or you can put on some boxing gloves and hit this punching pad. And so in one of our studies, we found that if men braided hair, then they were much more likely to choose, as their next task, the punching task. But if they braided rope, then most of them wanted to do the brainteaser. So this suggests that the ones who had done the hair-braiding task felt emasculated, and so they kind of wanted to restore their masculinity by punching something, by, you know, behaving aggressively. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: There's something really funny about these studies, isn't there? BOSSON: Sure (laughter). That's one of my favorite things about what I do, is the kind of - the creativity and kind of concocting these scenarios. I also want to be taken seriously. So the findings aren't funny. The methods can be funny. VEDANTAM: To be sure, it's worth pointing out that societal messages that constrain men have often been developed by men. Jennifer's point is not that sexism doesn't play a role in shaping these behaviors. Her point is that men can be trapped by the gender roles that they themselves have authored. There's a way in which you can look at your work that you're doing and sort of say, in some ways, you're drawing - perhaps compassionate is sort of the wrong word. But you're drawing a more - deeper understanding of why men behave the way they do that is not just, men behave the way they do because there is misogyny. BOSSON: Right. You know, I guess I feel like I have compassion for anybody who kind of finds themselves stuck in a world that makes no sense to them. So regardless of whose fault it is, I think that the struggle for status that men kind of are constantly feeling like they have to participate in, it sucks. VEDANTAM: Men worry what other men will think, what women will think, what they themselves might think. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: All this leads us back to Robert Vaughan's dilemma about whether to become a nurse. The precarious status of masculinity drives many men to see the profession as the equivalent of braiding hair with pink ribbons. Remember that clip from \"Meet The Parents\"? (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"MEET THE PARENTS\") DE NIRO: (As Jack Byrnes) Not many men in your profession, are there, Greg? STILLER: (As Greg Focker) No, Jack, not traditionally. VEDANTAM: This idea is deeply woven into our culture. Think about all the jokes you've heard about male nurses. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FRIENDS\") PERRY: (As Chandler Bing) So Dan. . . VEDANTAM: You've heard them on \"Friends. \" (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FRIENDS\") PERRY: (As Chandler Bing) Nurse, not a doctor, huh? Kind of girly, isn't it? (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: And even on shows about hospital life, like \"House. \" (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"HOUSE\") HUGH LAURIE: (As Gregory House) Sorry, can't remember if I mocked you yet for being a male nurse. VEDANTAM: And \"Scrubs. \" (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SCRUBS\") RICKY SCHRODER: (As Paul Flowers) She's embarrassed that she likes a nurse, and I really can't figure out why. KEN JENKINS: (As Bob Kelso) Well, that's because you're doing a woman's job, son. Have a good one. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: So if you're in Robert's shoes, is there a way to silence the voice in your head that says, this kind of work is emasculating? R VAUGHAN: A woman's job, a woman's job, a woman's job. VEDANTAM: You're listening to HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. This is NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. (SOUNDBITE OF TYPEWRITER CLACKING) VEDANTAM: London, autumn 1854, word was spreading through the city. Thousands of British soldiers had died in a conflict 1,500 miles away in Eastern Europe - the Crimean War. But these men were not killed in combat. JULIE FAIRMAN: What they were really dying of, which was of - not of their wounds, but infectious disease. VEDANTAM: Historian Julie Fairman at the University of Pennsylvania says Londoners were shocked to learn about the poor medical conditions in Crimea. One woman in particular felt called to action. She was wealthy, from high society. Her name was Florence Nightingale. FAIRMAN: She was able to convince her friends - and she had friends in high places - to let her take a contingent of nurses to the Crimea to take charge of this hospital. VEDANTAM: In November, 1854, she arrived at a war camp with a group of nearly 40 nurses. FAIRMAN: She finds hospitals that are dark. And they're dingy, and there's no air. And there's soldiers lying on the ground, crying out. It must have been horrendous. VEDANTAM: Florence Nightingale took charge, bringing cleanliness and order to the medical camps. She focused on sanitation. She made sure that injured soldiers were fed. Back home, she came to be seen as something of a trailblazer. When she returned to London, she established the world's first professional nursing school with one type of student in mind - women. This was a shift. Before the Crimean War, nursing was not seen as the exclusive preserve of women. FAIRMAN: Everybody was a nurse. Everybody took care of their family members. They took care of the children. They took care of the wounded in battle. And so the profession - in fact, you don't even talk about profession - but the idea of providing care to people was pretty heterogeneous across men, women and others. VEDANTAM: But Florence Nightingale was convinced that nursing was not for men. As her method spread to Australia, Canada and the United States, women came to dominate nursing. Men were pushed to the fringes of the field, limited to working in psychiatric wards. By the 1930s, men were only 2 percent of nurses in the United States. Even today, that number is only 10 percent. FAIRMAN: The idea of women being able to give that gentle, caring touch when they provided care was a really strong ethos throughout the nursing profession and the public. VEDANTAM: Of course, when you think about it, there's nothing inherently feminine about nursing. Florence Nightingale literally invented that idea and made it real. So if you could turn nursing from a genderless profession to one seen as exclusively female, can you make the clock turn backwards? BOSSON: To some degree, you can spin any job. . . VEDANTAM: This, again, is psychologist Jennifer Bosson. BOSSON: You could spin nursing as a very masculine occupation. It's dangerous. It's physically grueling. You don't really have to be that warm to be a nurse. It doesn't hurt, but, you know. So our stereotype of the nurse is one that almost - you know, you could modify that stereotype and turn nursing into a profession that does seem masculine or male-appropriate. VEDANTAM: As it turned out, something along the lines of what Jennifer proposed was presented to Robert Vaughan. Remember how, when Robert got out of the Navy, his father-in-law suggested he think about nursing as a profession? R VAUGHAN: It's a in-demand field, pays pretty well. And it's stable. You work 12-hour shifts, three days a week. You can make good money at it. VEDANTAM: Robert didn't take his father-in-law's advice, but he did get a job at a hospital as a security guard. And one day, he had to deal with two patients who were out of control. R VAUGHAN: We had a couple guys who came into the emergency room who were high, presumably on PCP. I don't remember what it was at the time. And they were just very belligerent, fighting. There was blood all over the place. And they were - had to be split up into different rooms. And so we're trying to attend to them, and they. . . VEDANTAM: Were you actually asked to secure them in one of the rooms? What was the role that you were playing? R VAUGHAN: Yeah, security, we're kind of there to have eyes on and potentially hands on, if we need to, to help control the situation. So I was there. And these guys both came out of their rooms that they were isolated into and just started fighting. And they actually locked themselves in one of the rooms and destroyed the room, did couple thousand dollars' worth of damage, and blood everywhere on the ceilings. And the nurses and us and the sheriffs were - and the doctors were all holding them down and sedating and restraining. And I was like, man, this is pretty cool (laughter). As much as it was, you know, potentially dangerous, the action that the nurses were seeing was pretty exciting for me. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) R VAUGHAN: You know, you think of nursing - you think of someone sitting at a bedside and being, like, let me hold your hand. And you see what it is realistically day-to-day, and for me, it was 180 degrees. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Robert took his father-in-law's advice and enrolled in nursing school. Now, it's not as if the old stereotypes about gender and nursing disappeared altogether. But Robert found ways to carve a path of his own. His wife Christine says that when he was in nursing school, he bonded with the handful of other men in the program. CHRISTINE VAUGHAN: Four of his closest friends are men who went through the nursing school program with him. And that kind of bond that they built, that brotherhood - maybe it's very kind of, like, military-esque that they were together. And so there's this common thread of, like, we're the men united together, you know, in this space. VEDANTAM: He's now been in the field for more than a decade. He works in a cardiovascular unit. When you made the decision to become a nurse, did you tell your friends or family about this? I'm wondering if - did you have hesitation about doing this? Were there an awkward conversation where you sort of said, you know, I'm going to become a nurse? Did people look at you strangely? R VAUGHAN: I thought I would. I thought I would at least some jeering from guys, you know, that I knew - be like, oh, you're going to be a nurse. You know? Oh, we always knew that you were in the closet. Or you know, there's jokes about - well, if you're a nurse, then therefore, you must be gay. But surprisingly, I did not get that. Like, a lot of the guys that I was friends with and - when I told them, you know, I'm going to go into nursing, they were like, oh, that's cool. It's a good job. It pays well. You know, it's a job of service. You know, you're helping people in their time of need. And I don't think there's any better job out there as far as - you literally get paid to help people in some of their worst moments and help them get better and heal and go home. And that, for me - I get paid to do that. It's awesome. C VAUGHAN: And I find something really interesting. If I do say my husband's a nurse, people usually want to know if there's a specialty. VEDANTAM: Christine Vaughn has seen people perform mental gymnastics when she tells them about her husband's job. C VAUGHAN: And sometimes when I said, oh, well, he works in cardiology, it's like, oh - as if that's masculine - you know, like, that's made it more masculine nursing. And it's just a very interesting dynamic. I know he'll tell me stories, just that he'll walk into a room, and a patient will assume he's the doctor. VEDANTAM: And once they realize he's not, Robert says patients sometimes get uncomfortable. R VAUGHAN: In fact, I just got that last week. And you just go, oh, it's OK. If you don't want a male, perfectly fine. We'll work with that. I can talk to the charge nurse, and we'll get assignments changed around, and we'll make a note that you prefer female staff only. VEDANTAM: And did you do that? Did you say that? R VAUGHAN: Oh, yeah. I said that. I always say it every time if they have an issue. And sometimes they go, no, no; it's fine. It's just, I've never had a nurse before that was male. And sometimes they're OK with it. And sometimes they do want to change. And it's just - it's not a factor. VEDANTAM: I just want to spend a second talking about how you feel with these interactions. I understand that, at a professional level, you are - you're happy to sort of say, you know, I'll accommodate your request and move on. But at some level, this is - you know, someone is basically saying they don't want you to be their nurse. And isn't that a little hurtful? R VAUGHAN: It's a little hurtful, especially when I find it somewhat hypocritical when you'll have a - the doctor is a male. And you're - they're present; they're doing the checks. And it's very intimate. But somehow, as a nurse, I'm male and that's a problem. It's like - it doesn't make any sense to me. You go - wait a minute. The doctor is a male, too. Somehow you have no issue with him. But as a male nurse, you have an issue. It's contradictory. VEDANTAM: Nearly everyone agrees it's a good idea to have diversity in health care. But Robert says there's a double standard when it comes to men in nursing. R VAUGHAN: You know, you see women going in to become doctors. They are - it's admired. You're like, oh, it's great. It's a wonderful thing that they're going into this, and we want that. But the flip side of you've got more men going into nursing, there isn't the accolade of - oh, my gosh. You are - it's great of you to be reaching out and overcoming these gender stereotypes and going into this profession. They just look at you, go, oh, I guess you probably weren't smart enough to be a doctor. VEDANTAM: There were some things about Robert I figured I couldn't get by just talking to him on the phone. (SOUNDBITE OF CAR DOOR CLOSING) VEDANTAM: So I went to meet him. Hi. You must be Robert. R VAUGHAN: Hey. How are you? VEDANTAM: How are you? He's 5'10\". He has a muscular frame and a shaved head with a goatee. I shadowed him as he exercised in his home gym. C VAUGHAN: I think, for him when he was in nursing school, starting cycling with a group of other males going through nursing school was a starting point for him of, like, I'm going to have my own equipment. I'm going to do this. I'm going to take care of my body, and I'm going to do so very early in the morning religiously while my wife is still sleeping - because I'm just still amazed that he wakes up at 4:30 in the morning to do these things. Did he tell you this? VEDANTAM: Today he thankfully moved the session to 4:30 p. m. Robert has set up a bunch of equipment in his garage. There's a bench, stacks of weights, dumbbells, a pull-up bar. My favorite things are the motivational messages plastered on the wall. One sticker says, discipline equals freedom. Robert says it's from Jocko Willink. R VAUGHAN: Jocko Willink - he's a Navy SEAL. He's on Twitter. He's quite popular, but he has a method. It's - you have a squat day, you have a push day, you have a lift day and you have a pull day. VEDANTAM: As I listened to Robert, I couldn't help but remember the study that Jennifer Bosson had conducted. When men are asked to braid hair, they compensate by punching bags to reclaim their lost masculinity. Could some of Robert's intense exercise regimen be connected to his job as a nurse? Could the sports truck he drives to work every day be a defense mechanism? R VAUGHAN: I think a lot of guys who might go into health care are interested in health and fitness. And I think part of it may also be showing, hey, you know, I'm not this - I'm not sure the wording I'd want to use - I'm not a - this nurse stereotype. Maybe it's pushing against the stereotype of what you might assume a male nurse would be. And so it's saying, you know what? I'm not that. I'm actually pretty manly in other aspects. VEDANTAM: While Robert rejects the idea that his own fitness regime is a form of psychological compensation, he does see himself compensating in another area. R VAUGHAN: I've had patients where I've had them a couple days, two, three days. And at first, they were hesitant about having a male as a nurse. And they would pull me aside as they're discharging home, and they say, you know what? You were the best nurse the entire time I was here. I had a lot of female nurses, and they were great. But you were actually more gentle, more caring because you are acutely aware of the fact that you're being judged in that manner. VEDANTAM: Robert was drawn to nursing because he saw the job as an extension of the identity he'd established in the military. But in his decade as a nurse, he's grown to admire the skills he once considered feminine. R VAUGHAN: My thinking on this has evolved to the point where I can say men are still just as compassionate and empathetic. We just express that sometimes in a different way. You know, being a father - I have two kids. You know, I don't love my kids any less than my wife does. But I show my love and my compassion and my empathy to my kids sometimes in a different way than my wife does. C VAUGHAN: Is that your trampoline? My daughter, who's 4 - almost 4 - goes up to my mother and says, grandma, look at my muscles. I work out. VEDANTAM: Oh, my gosh. What are these? Are these two-pound dumbbells? R VAUGHAN: My daughter wakes up, and she wants to do pushups with me in the morning. And she wants to eat my protein bar when I'm waking up in the morning. You know, the impact that I have on her, you know, is me being a role model for making her a strong, independent woman. VEDANTAM: When policymakers talk about interventions to help the jobless find work, they talk about vocational schools and retraining skills. They don't talk about how, without anyone saying it aloud, one-half of the population might be systematically excluding itself from the very parts of the economy that are booming. Robert was reluctant to pursue nursing because of all the narratives about male nurses. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FRIENDS\") PERRY: (As Chandler Bing) Kind of girly, isn't it? (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: Of course, there is another word for these emasculating jokes. They are stereotypes. When it comes to fighting stereotypes, we often imagine that the right approach is to explain why the stereotypes are wrong. But Robert's life suggests a different solution, and perhaps a more effective one. Stereotypes are powerful because the stories we tell about ourselves are powerful. They shape how we see the world and how the world sees us. But in the end, they are only stories. And stories - we can rewrite them.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today - ideas around luck, fortune and chance. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: When I say luck, what do you think luck is? TINA SEELIG: People often think of luck as something that happens to them. It's actually much more nuanced because there's quite a difference between fortune, chance and luck. RAZ: This is Tina Seelig. She teaches entrepreneurship at Stanford. And Tina has studied luck. And what makes some people luckier than others? SEELIG: Fortune is things that are out of your control. I'm fortunate to be born in this place in time. I'm fortunate to be healthy. Chance is something - you have to do something. You have to roll the dice, or you have to buy a lottery ticket, or you have to apply for a job. RAZ: And luck - well, here's Tina's answer from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SEELIG: Luck is defined as success or failure apparently caused by chance. Apparently - that's the operative word. It looks like it's chance because we rarely see all the levers that come into play to make people lucky. But I've realized by watching so long that luck is rarely a lightning strike, isolated and dramatic. It's much more like the wind blowing constantly. Sometimes it's calm, and sometimes it blows in gusts. And sometimes it comes from directions that you didn't even imagine. RAZ: So let's assume that if luck is a thing, a real thing, it does pass by most all of us at some point. And some people - it passes by them multiple times. Let's say - I don't know - you want to increase your luck. What do you do? How do you increase your luck? SEELIG: A lot of it has to do with taking tiny risks. It's getting out of your comfort zone. It's paying attention to things that other people don't pay attention to. It's talking to people who - where you're going to learn something new. It's learning something new each day. You know, reading a book, stretching yourself in different directions - clearly that process sets you up for seeing and then seizing those opportunities. And the key is you can't just see them. You have to see them and then do something about it. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SEELIG: About a dozen years ago, I was on an airplane. Normally I would just put on my headphones and go to sleep, wake up, do some work. But I decided to take a little risk, and I start a conversation with the man sitting next to me. I introduced myself, and I learned that he was a publisher. We ended up having a fascinating conversation. I learned all about the future of the publishing industry. So about three-quarters of the way through the flight, I decided to take another risk, and I opened up my laptop, and I shared with him a book proposal. He read it, and he said, you know what, Tina? This isn't right for us, but thank you so much for sharing. A couple of months later, I reached out to him, and I said, Mark, would you like to come to my class? I'm doing a project on reinventing the book - the future of publishing. He said, great, I'd love to come. So he came to my class, and we had a great experience. A few months later, I wrote him again. This time I sent him a bunch of video clips from another project my students had done. He was so intrigued; he wanted to meet those students. Now, I have to tell you I was a little bit hurt, right? I mean, he wanted to do a book with my students and not with me, but OK, it's all right. So I invited him to come down, and he and his colleagues came to Stanford, met with the students. And afterwards, we had lunch together. And one of his editors said to me, hey, have you ever consider writing a book? I said, funny you should ask. And I pulled out the exact same proposal that I had showed his boss a year earlier. Within two weeks, I had a contract, and within two years, the book had sold over a million copies around the world. (CHEERING, APPLAUSE)SEELIG: Now, you might say, oh, you're so lucky, but of course I was lucky. But that luck resulted from a series of small risks I took starting with saying hello. And anyone can do this. No matter where you are in your life, no matter where you are in the world, no matter even if you think you're the most unlucky person, you can do this by taking little risks that get you out of your comfort zone. You start building a sail to capture luck. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: So luck requires some risk-taking. Does being younger make it easier than someone, say, you know, my age in my mid-40s or older who might be more risk-averse for a variety of reasons? SEELIG: I could argue the opposite because you have in your life a foundation of lots of successes. There's really not much to lose. You probably also have a lot of situations where you've done things and they've worked out well, and so you've said, wow, I've got a track record of good things happening, so I'm willing to take a risk. A lot, again, comes back to our mindset. What are we afraid of? One of the exercises I do with my students is I do an exercise on risk taking and luck. And we talk about what happens when you fail. When you hit bottom, what is it made of? And some students describe the bottom as made of rubber. You know, they bounce - or even a trampoline. Some students say the bottom for them is made of glass shards. Some people say it's quicksand. Some people say it's a black hole they fall in and they can't ever get out. And we start talking about this, and we realize that everybody has a really different mental model of what happens when they fail. RAZ: Yeah. SEELIG: And they start realizing that's something they can shape and change. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SEELIG: . . . Because if you can turn that boiling-hot lava that you're going to fall into in to a trampoline, all of a sudden you're willing to take some risks because you know it's not going to hurt. RAZ: What happens - I mean, it's not always possible for some people to take those risks because there isn't a trampoline, right? So is it just about the mental architecture of the way you see failure, or could it be a real thing, that it's actually really dangerous? SEELIG: You're absolutely right. There are times in which you go, you know, listen; I need shelter. I need food. I need health care, and I'm going to make some decisions to make sure that I have all of those in place. That's realistic. However, I also believe that our mindset locks us in so often to making decisions that don't allow us to see all the possibilities. One of the things I often think about is if you took several people who all had nothing - one person had nothing, never had anything. One person has nothing now but used to have a lot and lost it - and maybe someone who has nothing now but knows they're going to inherit a lot of money in the future. You've these three people who all have nothing, but they're going to interact with the world really differently based on their history and their perceived future. And I think we need to be aware of the constraints that we put on ourselves based on the stories we tell about where we've been and where we're going. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SEELIG: So yes, sometimes people were born into terrible circumstances, and sometimes luck is a lightning bolt that hits us with something wonderful or something terrible. But the winds of luck are always there, and if you're willing to take some risks, if you're willing to really go out and show appreciation and you're willing to really look at ideas, even if they're crazy, through the lens of possibilities, you build a bigger and bigger sail to catch the winds of luck. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: That's Tina Seelig. She's a professor at Stanford University's Department of Management Science and Engineering. You can see her full talk at ted. com.

It looks like it's chance because we rarely see all the levers that come into play to make people lucky. But I've realized by watching so long that luck is rarely a lightning strike, isolated and dramatic. It's much more like the wind blowing constantly. Sometimes it's calm, and sometimes it blows in gusts. And sometimes it comes from directions that you didn't even imagine. RAZ: So let's assume that if luck is a thing, a real thing, it does pass by most all of us at some point. And some people - it passes by them multiple times. Let's say - I don't know - you want to increase your luck. What do you do? How do you increase your luck? SEELIG: A lot of it has to do with taking tiny risks. It's getting out of your comfort zone. It's paying attention to things that other people don't pay attention to. It's talking to people who - where you're going to learn something new. It's learning something new each day. You know, reading a book, stretching yourself in different directions - clearly that process sets you up for seeing and then seizing those opportunities. And the key is you can't just see them. You have to see them and then do something about it. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SEELIG: About a dozen years ago, I was on an airplane. Normally I would just put on my headphones and go to sleep, wake up, do some work. But I decided to take a little risk, and I start a conversation with the man sitting next to me. I introduced myself, and I learned that he was a publisher. We ended up having a fascinating conversation. I learned all about the future of the publishing industry. So about three-quarters of the way through the flight, I decided to take another risk, and I opened up my laptop, and I shared with him a book proposal. He read it, and he said, you know what, Tina? This isn't right for us, but thank you so much for sharing. A couple of months later, I reached out to him, and I said, Mark, would you like to come to my class? I'm doing a project on reinventing the book - the future of publishing. He said, great, I'd love to come. So he came to my class, and we had a great experience. A few months later, I wrote him again. This time I sent him a bunch of video clips from another project my students had done. He was so intrigued; he wanted to meet those students. Now, I have to tell you I was a little bit hurt, right? I mean, he wanted to do a book with my students and not with me, but OK, it's all right. So I invited him to come down, and he and his colleagues came to Stanford, met with the students. And afterwards, we had lunch together. And one of his editors said to me, hey, have you ever consider writing a book? I said, funny you should ask. And I pulled out the exact same proposal that I had showed his boss a year earlier. Within two weeks, I had a contract, and within two years, the book had sold over a million copies around the world. (CHEERING, APPLAUSE) SEELIG: Now, you might say, oh, you're so lucky, but of course I was lucky. But that luck resulted from a series of small risks I took starting with saying hello. And anyone can do this. No matter where you are in your life, no matter where you are in the world, no matter even if you think you're the most unlucky person, you can do this by taking little risks that get you out of your comfort zone. You start building a sail to capture luck. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: So luck requires some risk-taking. Does being younger make it easier than someone, say, you know, my age in my mid-40s or older who might be more risk-averse for a variety of reasons? SEELIG: I could argue the opposite because you have in your life a foundation of lots of successes. There's really not much to lose. You probably also have a lot of situations where you've done things and they've worked out well, and so you've said, wow, I've got a track record of good things happening, so I'm willing to take a risk. A lot, again, comes back to our mindset. What are we afraid of? One of the exercises I do with my students is I do an exercise on risk taking and luck. And we talk about what happens when you fail. When you hit bottom, what is it made of? And some students describe the bottom as made of rubber. You know, they bounce - or even a trampoline. Some students say the bottom for them is made of glass shards. Some people say it's quicksand. Some people say it's a black hole they fall in and they can't ever get out. And we start talking about this, and we realize that everybody has a really different mental model of what happens when they fail. RAZ: Yeah. SEELIG: And they start realizing that's something they can shape and change. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEELIG: . . . Because if you can turn that boiling-hot lava that you're going to fall into in to a trampoline, all of a sudden you're willing to take some risks because you know it's not going to hurt. RAZ: What happens - I mean, it's not always possible for some people to take those risks because there isn't a trampoline, right? So is it just about the mental architecture of the way you see failure, or could it be a real thing, that it's actually really dangerous? SEELIG: You're absolutely right. There are times in which you go, you know, listen; I need shelter. I need food. I need health care, and I'm going to make some decisions to make sure that I have all of those in place. That's realistic. However, I also believe that our mindset locks us in so often to making decisions that don't allow us to see all the possibilities. One of the things I often think about is if you took several people who all had nothing - one person had nothing, never had anything. One person has nothing now but used to have a lot and lost it - and maybe someone who has nothing now but knows they're going to inherit a lot of money in the future. You've these three people who all have nothing, but they're going to interact with the world really differently based on their history and their perceived future. And I think we need to be aware of the constraints that we put on ourselves based on the stories we tell about where we've been and where we're going. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SEELIG: So yes, sometimes people were born into terrible circumstances, and sometimes luck is a lightning bolt that hits us with something wonderful or something terrible. But the winds of luck are always there, and if you're willing to take some risks, if you're willing to really go out and show appreciation and you're willing to really look at ideas, even if they're crazy, through the lens of possibilities, you build a bigger and bigger sail to catch the winds of luck. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) RAZ: That's Tina Seelig. She's a professor at Stanford University's Department of Management Science and Engineering.

DAN CHARLES, BYLINE: William Happer was born in India when it was a British colony - the son of a Scottish military officer and an American missionary doctor. They later moved to North Carolina. And Happer became a physicist at Columbia University and then Princeton. STEVEN KOONIN: He is a damn good scientist. CHARLES: This is Steven Koonin, a professor at New York University. He's known Happer for 30 years. KOONIN: There are two really significant contributions associated with him. CHARLES: One made it possible to capture much better images of people's lungs. Another one allows astronomers to see the stars more clearly. So a respected scientist - also a contrarian and prone to arguments with environmental scientists. In 1993, for instance, then Vice President Al Gore was talking a lot about chemicals eating away at ozone in the stratosphere, letting in dangerous ultraviolet radiation. Happer had a top job at the Department of Energy at the time, running scientific research. He went over to the White House and said, there's no evidence the ozone hole's hurting anybody. He lost his job over it. Koonin thinks his friend, Will Happer, was just demanding better evidence. KOONIN: I think that sensitized him to the squishiness, if you like, of a lot of the environmental science. CHARLES: But other colleagues say it's more like a visceral distrust of that science. In recent years, Happer's been campaigning against the idea that rising carbon dioxide levels are a danger. Here he's giving a speech to the Heartland Institute. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)WILLIAM HAPPER: When I got into this area and started learning about it, I learned that I was - when I looked at CO2, I should assume that it caused harmful warming, extreme weather, Noah's flood. You know, I remember thinking, are they mad? CHARLES: Carbon dioxide's actually good for the planet, Happer says. It's like fertilizer. It makes our crops more productive. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HAPPER: We've got to push back vigorously on the demonization of fossil fuels. They're not demons at all. They're enormous servants to us. CHARLES: Some of Happer's colleagues back at Princeton are reluctant to talk about it. It's like discussing a relationship that got messy. Here's Michael Bender, emeritus professor of geoscience - a climate researcher. MICHAEL BENDER: I mean, I liked him. We would - we went out for coffee after our committee meetings a couple of times. CHARLES: Bender wouldn't do it now, though, partly because of the scientific dispute. Bender says Happer's misreading the evidence. But it's also Happer's style. He's called climate science a cult, accused other scientists of whipping up climate fears to boost their own careers. Most offensive for Bender, Happer said people are demonizing carbon dioxide the way Nazis demonized Jews. BENDER: You know, there came a point where he attacked my colleague's integrity. And I just felt like I couldn't have a cordial relationship with him anymore after that. CHARLES: Happer wasn't authorized to talk to us for this story. He's in the White House now - 79 years old, possibly running a new review of climate science. And Robert Socolow, another Princeton colleague, has conflicted feelings about it. ROBERT SOCOLOW: Everybody has areas of irrationality. I think the environment, in general, and climate change, in particular, is an area of Will's irrationality. But nonetheless, I think he can accomplish something. CHARLES: Socolow is hoping that Happer will now behave less like an argumentative physicist and more like the kind of person who has to prepare for every possibility. SOCOLOW: The military person doesn't underestimate the enemy. A business person doesn't underestimate the competition.

The Inuit have lived off the land there for thousands of years. To help them survive, they develop the ability to control their anger. As part of our month-long exploration of this emotion, NPR's Michaeleen Doucleff reports on the way the Inuit pass this skill from parent to child and what we can learn from it. MICHAELEEN DOUCLEFF, BYLINE: It's lunchtime in the small town of Iqaluit. I'm at the elders center, and elders in their 80s and 90s are settling into their comfy chairs with rainbow quilts. The cook is just starting to bring out the food. UNIDENTIFIED COOK: This is your meat to cut up, ringed seal. DOUCLEFF: Ringed seal. Next to the seal is beluga whale. UNIDENTIFIED COOK: Frozen char. DOUCLEFF: And a chunk of raw caribou glistening with blood. LISA IPEELIE: And he's having the cartilage. . . DOUCLEFF: OK. IPEELIE: . . . Which is still good to eat. DOUCLEFF: That's Lisa Ipeelie. She's our interpreter. She hands me a fork with a chunk of stewed seal on it. It's really good. IPEELIE: Tastes like. . . DOUCLEFF: . . . Beef with a sea flavor. IPEELIE: Beef with seaweed. DOUCLEFF: This type of food right here, this wild game, this is what sustained the Inuit civilization in one of the harshest places on earth. And to get this food wasn't easy. You had to make tools, hunt, butcher the meat and then make clothes from the skins. All of this took an enormous amount of skill and time. MARTHA TIKIVIK: (Speaking Inuktitut). DOUCLEFF: Martha Tikivik is 83 and was born in an igloo. She says Inuits didn't have time to be angry. It just got in their way. TIKIVIK: (Through interpreter) Anger's not going to solve your problem. It's just going to stop you from doing something that you need to get done. DOUCLEFF: She says that since ancient times, Inuit have seen anger as unproductive. TIKIVIK: (Through interpreter). Anger has no purpose. DOUCLEFF: In fact, anthropologists have documented consistent cool-headedness in everyday Inuit life. In one instance, a fishing line which had taken days to make breaks on the first use. Nobody changes their expression. Someone just says calmly, go sew it back together. Elders I spoke with say intense colonization over the past century is damaging their traditions, including how they raise their kids. And so the community is working hard to keep traditions intact. (SOUNDBITE OF DRUMS)UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing in Inuktitut). DOUCLEFF: There's a class at the local college that teaches traditional Inuit parenting. (SOUNDBITE OF DRUMS)UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing in Inuktitut). DOUCLEFF: This class is led by Goota Jaw. GOOTA JAW: (Speaking Inuktitut). DOUCLEFF: Right off the bat, she wants to make something clear about Inuit parenting versus the American style. JAW: I could say we do parenting totally different. DOUCLEFF: Totally different. JAW: Yep. DOUCLEFF: In particular, she says, the No. 1 rule in Inuit parenting is never yell or shout at a small child. Her husband is Caucasian. JAW: He's the one that was shouting, like, you know, think about what you just did. Go to your room. All this stuff, and I disagree with that. DOUCLEFF: This gentle approach, this no-yelling policy, is key to how the Inuits raised cool-headed kids. So then how do Inuits get kids to listen without scolding? JAW: We go by storytelling. DOUCLEFF: Oh, so discipline is done mostly through the stories. JAW: Yes. DOUCLEFF: These are oral stories handed down from one generation to the next. And they're designed to sculpt kids' behavior to get them to act a certain way right now, sometimes even save their lives. For example, in the Arctic, the ocean is a dangerous place for kids. JAW: We are afraid of children drowning, getting in the water. DOUCLEFF: So instead of yelling at kids, don't go near the water, Inuit parents take a preemptive approach and tell kids a special story about what's inside the water. JAW: Qalupalik (ph), it's the sea monster. DOUCLEFF: The sea monster. If a child walks too close to the water or goes in, the monster appears and. . . JAW: They're going to put you in their big pouch, and they're going to drag you with them down to the ocean. DOUCLEFF: So then you don't need to yell at the child. JAW: Yes because the child is already getting the message. DOUCLEFF: Another story helps kids learn to keep their hats on in the winter. Myna Ishulutak is a former teacher at the parenting class. She says for that they use the northern lights. MYNA ISHULUTAK: If you go out without no hat, the northern light going to take your head off and use it as a soccer ball. DOUCLEFF: And, boy, did this story work. ISHULUTAK: We used to be so scared. They were going to take my head off, you know (laughter). DOUCLEFF: Now, the point is not to scare the pants off kids but rather to intrigue them, make them think. The right amount of scariness will vary from kid to kid and age to age. For example, I don't feel like I have time for anger in my life either. So I brought monsters to our house. They are fun monsters with a dash of scariness. We have a sharing monster that makes sure kids are sharing. And to help our 3-year-old, Rosy, put her shoes on more quickly in the morning, we have. . . ROSY: The shoe monster. DOUCLEFF: The shoe monster, what does he do? ROSY: He watches girls who are not putting their shoes on. DOUCLEFF: He looks to see if girls are not putting their shoes on? And what if they don't put their shoes on? ROSY: He comes and takes them down in the hole right there. DOUCLEFF: He takes them and puts them in a hole? What's better, stories or me yelling and telling you what to do? ROSY: Stories. DOUCLEFF: Rosy can't get enough of these stories. Deena Weisberg at Villanova says that's not surprising. She's a psychologist who studies how kids interpret stories and says across cultures, stories have long been a potent way to communicate because we are built to learn through narrative. DEENA WEISBERG: We learn best through things that are interesting to us. And stories, by their nature, can have lots of things in them that are much more interesting or can tie things together into a narrative arc in a way that, you know, just bare statements don't. DOUCLEFF: Rosy, do you like the stories? ROSY: Yeah. DOUCLEFF: You like them? Do you love the stories? ROSY: Yeah. DOUCLEFF: You love them? ROSY: Yeah. DOUCLEFF: Stories that decrease anger, decrease shouting and make discipline fun. Michaeleen Doucleff, NPR News.

DOUCLEFF: This gentle approach, this no-yelling policy, is key to how the Inuits raised cool-headed kids. So then how do Inuits get kids to listen without scolding? JAW: We go by storytelling. DOUCLEFF: Oh, so discipline is done mostly through the stories. JAW: Yes. DOUCLEFF: These are oral stories handed down from one generation to the next. And they're designed to sculpt kids' behavior to get them to act a certain way right now, sometimes even save their lives. For example, in the Arctic, the ocean is a dangerous place for kids. JAW: We are afraid of children drowning, getting in the water. DOUCLEFF: So instead of yelling at kids, don't go near the water, Inuit parents take a preemptive approach and tell kids a special story about what's inside the water. JAW: Qalupalik (ph), it's the sea monster. DOUCLEFF: The sea monster. If a child walks too close to the water or goes in, the monster appears and. . . JAW: They're going to put you in their big pouch, and they're going to drag you with them down to the ocean. DOUCLEFF: So then you don't need to yell at the child. JAW: Yes because the child is already getting the message. DOUCLEFF: Another story helps kids learn to keep their hats on in the winter. Myna Ishulutak is a former teacher at the parenting class. She says for that they use the northern lights. MYNA ISHULUTAK: If you go out without no hat, the northern light going to take your head off and use it as a soccer ball. DOUCLEFF: And, boy, did this story work. ISHULUTAK: We used to be so scared. They were going to take my head off, you know (laughter). DOUCLEFF: Now, the point is not to scare the pants off kids but rather to intrigue them, make them think. The right amount of scariness will vary from kid to kid and age to age. For example, I don't feel like I have time for anger in my life either. So I brought monsters to our house. They are fun monsters with a dash of scariness. We have a sharing monster that makes sure kids are sharing. And to help our 3-year-old, Rosy, put her shoes on more quickly in the morning, we have. . . ROSY: The shoe monster. DOUCLEFF: The shoe monster, what does he do? ROSY: He watches girls who are not putting their shoes on. DOUCLEFF: He looks to see if girls are not putting their shoes on? And what if they don't put their shoes on? ROSY: He comes and takes them down in the hole right there. DOUCLEFF: He takes them and puts them in a hole? What's better, stories or me yelling and telling you what to do? ROSY: Stories. DOUCLEFF: Rosy can't get enough of these stories. Deena Weisberg at Villanova says that's not surprising. She's a psychologist who studies how kids interpret stories and says across cultures, stories have long been a potent way to communicate because we are built to learn through narrative. DEENA WEISBERG: We learn best through things that are interesting to us. And stories, by their nature, can have lots of things in them that are much more interesting or can tie things together into a narrative arc in a way that, you know, just bare statements don't. DOUCLEFF: Rosy, do you like the stories? ROSY: Yeah. DOUCLEFF: You like them? Do you love the stories? ROSY: Yeah. DOUCLEFF: You love them? ROSY: Yeah. DOUCLEFF: Stories that decrease anger, decrease shouting and make discipline fun. Michaeleen Doucleff, NPR News.", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.

S. government spends billions of dollars each year helping households recover after disasters such as the tornadoes this past Sunday in Alabama. Who gets that federal aid is always a big question after natural disasters. An NPR investigation out today finds federal disaster aid does not always go to those who need it most, instead favoring two groups - white Americans and people who already have safety nets. NPR's Rebecca Hersher takes us to Houston with this story of two families who lost everything. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: The two families are the Papadopouloses. JOHN PAPADOPOULOS: OK - John Papadopoulos, and I live on 10723 - well, lived - right? - yeah - 10723 Bayou Glen Road. HERSHER: John is a family guy - two kids, a wife, works at Microsoft. The second family is the Evans family. Janice Perry-Evans has three kids, works at the post office. JANICE PERRY-EVANS: I love my job. I'm one of them people that - them rare people that love their job (laughter). You know, sometimes we make people day. HERSHER: Janice and her family rent a house on the east side. John and his wife own their house on the west side. They bought it back in 2007. And within a couple years, the floods began. PAPADOPOULOS: So our house - yeah, so we flooded four times in a decade. So our house flooded in '09 and then 2015 and 2016. HERSHER: And then the big one, August 2017. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED NEWSCASTER: Good morning, everyone. Let's get straight to the breaking news - Harvey provoking an unfolding flooding disaster in America's fourth largest city, Houston, Texas. HERSHER: The morning the storm arrived, both families woke up to more than a foot of water in the house. John and his wife carried their sleepy children to a neighbor's house. They eventually went to a hotel. Janice's family waded through chest-deep water until they were rescued by a dump truck. They ended up at the convention center downtown. Both of their homes were destroyed. PAPADOPOULOS: My house was - it just looked like a washing machine inside. I mean, we lost 99 percent of everything. PERRY-EVANS: If you guys had seen what the neighborhood looked like, we lost all that in just one day. We lost everything. HERSHER: And when families lose everything in disasters, they turn to the federal government for financial help. But when the Evans and Papadopoulos families started applying for federal aid, they had radically different experiences, experiences that are emblematic of a trend - widening inequality after disasters exacerbated by federal disaster spending. We'll start with the Papadopoulos family. Right away, a lot of things went right for them. John's job was really helpful. PAPADOPOULOS: I didn't have to use any time off. Technically my manager was like, don't even worry about it, man. Just take care. We got you. HERSHER: With John's wages secure, they turned their attention to applying for federal money. First they applied online for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA. FEMA gives grants. The money doesn't have to be paid back. The Papadopoulos family got $30,000 because they owned a home that had been destroyed. The second place they applied was the SBA, the Small Business Administration. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: In the wake of a disaster, SBA provides low-interest disaster loans to homeowners, renters, businesses of all sizes and private nonprofit organizations. HERSHER: The Papadopoulos family got a $25,000 low-interest loan. A few weeks after the flood, the family moved into a temporary rental house. But there was still the question of what to do with the flood house, as their 6-year-old calls it - repair it, sell it. PAPADOPOULOS: I ain't touched the house for months. I just left it there full - the whole bit. That water sat in there for two weeks. I'm not bringing kids into it. The heavy metals alone - you're not going to Febreze or bleach them out of that wood. (Laughter) I don't care what you think. HERSHER: In the end, the money from FEMA helped them pay to knock the house down. And there is one more longer-term way that FEMA could help. The family has applied for a buyout. They want the federal government to buy their empty lot and turn it permanently into open space. So you still own the lot. PAPADOPOULOS: I do. HERSHER: The local flood control district says it's likely that properties like theirs will get offered buyouts eventually if the owners can wait until the money is available, which could take years. But the Papadopoulos family can wait. They're doing OK financially. They're looking for a new house to buy. Meanwhile, the Evans family has had a totally different experience. For the first few days after the storm, the family slept at the convention center. And as the relief at surviving wore off, Janice had one big concern. PERRY-EVANS: My main thing was, I had nowhere to lay these - put these kids to lay their head. That bothered me so much. HERSHER: So when her co-worker offered a spare room, she took it even though it was one room for the whole family, even though when she put food in the refrigerator, it disappeared somehow. Even though it was a 45-minute drive from her kids' school and from her work and her car had been destroyed in the flood, she took the room because she felt like she had nowhere else to go. And then, like the Papadopoulos family had, she started asking the government for help. PERRY-EVANS: I applied for everything, and they gave me - the first time, they gave me $2,666 to get somewhere to live. HERSHER: Two thousand six-hundred-sixty-six dollars specifically for housing. In Houston, it would have been enough to cover a deposit and first month's rent on a new place. But Janice needed that money for something else. PERRY-EVANS: I had to go to work, and I had to get the boys back and forth to school. So I took that and put it for a car. HERSHER: She used the money for a car. And then with her immediate transportation under control, she called FEMA back to see about applying for more money for housing and got reprimanded. PERRY-EVANS: When I talked to one of the representatives, that's what they told me. They - some of them was kind of rude. Some of them felt sorry for me 'cause I would be crying. I would be crying about, hey, I have nowhere to go. I don't have no money. You guys - you're not helping me like I thought I was going to get the help that I was going to get. HERSHER: FEMA gives grants for specific uses so it can keep track of who's been paid for what. That money was supposed to be for housing. The system was too rigid to handle Janice using it for something else. FEMA didn't bar her from reapplying for housing money. But after the scolding, she did not reapply. And this entire time, Janice never missed a shift at the post office. Often she worked six days a week. But her paycheck just wasn't cutting it, and her co-worker said the family needed to move out. So she applied for a low-interest SBA loan. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: SBA will conduct a credit check before scheduling an onsite inspection to determine your total verified losses. HERSHER: Janice says when they checked her credit score, it was too low. She didn't qualify. Time was running out. A FEMA representative suggested she see about getting help from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which required using her day off to go to an informational class. But she says she didn't qualify for that either because her income was too high. PERRY-EVANS: It was like every time I tried something, it was an obstacle in the way. HERSHER: Six months after the flood, Janice did the only thing she felt she could. She moved into a rental house that's more expensive than her old place and smaller. And the Evans family is not alone. KATHY PAYTON: Recovery for vulnerable families look a lot different than it does for more affluent neighborhoods. HERSHER: Kathy Payton is the executive director of the Fifth Ward Community Redevelopment Corporation in East Houston just a couple miles from where Janice lives. She says she's watched low-income families struggle to apply for federal aid because of all of the barriers that Janice ran into and more. PAYTON: They don't always have all the paperwork. They don't always have a tax return. They don't always have the last two pay stubs. They don't always have driver's license. They don't always have all of these things. HERSHER: As a result, Payton says she's watched richer, whiter parts of Houston recover more quickly. Private insurance accounts for some of that, but she thinks it's also because they were more successful at getting federal money. And national research backs that up. Junia Howell is a sociologist at the University of Pittsburgh. Howell is one of a handful of researchers who are taking a close look at who gets public money after disasters and who doesn't. And a pattern is emerging. After disasters, rich people get richer, and poor people get poorer, especially when the federal government steps in. JUNIA HOWELL: We see these same patterns of wealth inequality being exacerbated in communities that receive more FEMA aid. But that's particularly true along racial lines, along lines of education as well as home ownership versus renting. HERSHER: Richer people, white people - they're more likely to be homeowners. And those same people are more likely to get aid after a disaster in part because of programs like buyouts that specifically help homeowners who have lost their houses. Poorer people, people of color, people who are more likely to rent, people arguably who need cash the most after a major disaster are less likely to get it from the federal government. NPR analyzed more than 40,000 FEMA records from one federal disaster aid program, home buyouts, like the one the Papadopoulos family are hoping to get and the one the Evans family doesn't qualify for. We found that most of them were in neighborhoods where the population was more than 85 percent white. David Maurstad runs the buyout program for FEMA and says it's working as designed. He says every potential buyout is assessed using the same basic criteria. DAVID MAURSTAD: Buyouts have to be technically feasible. They have to be cost-effective. They need to be aligned with providing risk reduction for the community. HERSHER: Last year, Congress agreed to increase FEMA's funding for so-called risk reduction, but it's largely up to local governments how to use that money - for example, to build floodwalls, update drainage. MAURSTAD: I think a general conclusion would be there will be more buyouts, but I guess that's what - you know, we'll see how that unfolds in the future. HERSHER: Sociologist Junia Howell says that trend is a wake-up call. HOWELL: It - it's disturbing - like, deeply disturbing that we are spending billions of dollars a year, and those billions of dollars are adding to our inequality and, to me, calls for a deep reinvestigation into FEMA aid. HERSHER: If inequality is being exacerbated a little bit now, she says, it will be exacerbated a lot more in the future. Climate change is driving more extreme rain in most of the country, which means more and more flood risk, which could mean more families like John's and Janice's. Take John. Within a year after the flood, his family was fine. PAPADOPOULOS: I still got money in my pocket, you know? I'm not looking for a bunch of the handout stuff. I had some. I didn't like it, (laughter) really. HERSHER: It being specifically federal disaster aid. When he looks at all the federal help his family has gotten since the storm, he is grateful and a little uncomfortable because he knows that other families have not gotten the same leg up, families like the Evans. PERRY-EVANS: So it's a struggle now. It's really a struggle now to stay afloat. I went to a bankruptcy lawyer, and I paid him to pay - now I'm going to go ahead and file bankruptcy and get rid of some of this debt. HERSHER: If the storm hadn't happened, do you think you'd be facing bankruptcy? PERRY-EVANS: No 'cause it wasn't that bad. HERSHER: It's not just the storm itself. It's everything that's happened since - the higher rent, the new car payment, the hours and hours spent filling out applications for money, most of which, it turned out, wasn't meant for families like hers. And Janice's job as a mail carrier means she sees a lot of other neighborhoods. She's watched other areas, other families recover more quickly. PERRY-EVANS: And that's where the money went to - to out there, rich people. It's not fair, but, you know, that's just how America is. It's not right. But most of the time, white people get the advantage before we do anyway. So it's like, we already know (laughter). That's just how it work. HERSHER: If she'd gotten more money, she says, she would have moved, bought a house on higher ground. Rebecca Hersher, NPR News. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  The U.

They say it could be the largest animal unidentified by biologists until now. NPR's Christopher Joyce has the story. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: The notion that there might be some new kind of killer whale emerged in 1955. Photos from New Zealand showed a bunch of killer whales stranded on a beach. BOB PITMAN: This was a very different-looking group of killer whales. JOYCE: Bob Pitman is a marine biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The whales were smaller than other killer whales. They had rounded heads and pointier fins. PITMAN: And most importantly, they have a little, tiny eye patch. JOYCE: A white spot under each eye smaller than other killer whales. Biologists were mystified. Then in 2005, Pitman met a French biologist who showed him a photo of an odd killer whale swimming in the Indian Ocean. PITMAN: And I looked down, and there they were - the New Zealand killer whales. JOYCE: For Pitman, the hunt was on. Last year, he assembled a team to go to Cape Horn in Chile to look for what's now technically called the Type D killer whale. Local fishers had been complaining that some kind of whale was stripping fish off their lines. NOAA biologist Lisa Ballance, who's married to Pitman, was part of the team. LISA BALLANCE: From the beginning, I had referred to it as the needle in the haystack. It's a big ocean, and it's a rough ocean. JOYCE: It was a slow start.

But the mystery killer whales of the Southern Ocean have been found. Christopher Joyce, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF DAVID BOWIE SONG, \"NEW KILLER STAR\") AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  Scientists say they've located a mysterious type of killer whale living in the oceans near Antarctica. They say it could be the largest animal unidentified by biologists until now. NPR's Christopher Joyce has the story. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: The notion that there might be some new kind of killer whale emerged in 1955. Photos from New Zealand showed a bunch of killer whales stranded on a beach. BOB PITMAN: This was a very different-looking group of killer whales. JOYCE: Bob Pitman is a marine biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The whales were smaller than other killer whales. They had rounded heads and pointier fins. PITMAN: And most importantly, they have a little, tiny eye patch. JOYCE: A white spot under each eye smaller than other killer whales. Biologists were mystified. Then in 2005, Pitman met a French biologist who showed him a photo of an odd killer whale swimming in the Indian Ocean. PITMAN: And I looked down, and there they were - the New Zealand killer whales. JOYCE: For Pitman, the hunt was on. Last year, he assembled a team to go to Cape Horn in Chile to look for what's now technically called the Type D killer whale. Local fishers had been complaining that some kind of whale was stripping fish off their lines. NOAA biologist Lisa Ballance, who's married to Pitman, was part of the team. LISA BALLANCE: From the beginning, I had referred to it as the needle in the haystack. It's a big ocean, and it's a rough ocean. JOYCE: It was a slow start. Their ship in Cape Horn was trapped at anchor for eight days by howling weather, but then they got a 12-hour quiet spell. BALLANCE: We left that night, pounded into the seas so that we could get to our spot at first light the next morning. PITMAN: Sun came up in the morning at 5:50.

S. Veterans Administration is conducting one of the largest studies of blast injuries on post-9/11 veterans. Researchers are discovering that blast exposure can cause damage to the brain in some unexpected ways. Fred Thys from member station WBUR in Boston has the details. FRED THYS, BYLINE: Chris Riga realized something was not right shortly after he'd been exposed to several improvised explosive devices. CHRIS RIGA: The first time I noticed, we had been through multiple IED strikes within a week period years ago in Afghanistan. And unfortunately, I was at a memorial ceremony, and I couldn't keep my balance after standing up for about two minutes. THYS: Riga served several tours in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2014, eventually commanding all U. S. Special Forces there. During his 29 years in the Army's 82nd Airborne, Rangers, and 3rd and 7th Special Forces groups, he also served in Africa and Iraq. RIGA: We were always either preparing for combat or deployed in combat. Blasts and exposures were a daily incident. THYS: Improved battlefield medical care in Iraq and Afghanistan means more troops have survived with Traumatic Brain Injury, or TBI. Researchers are trying to understand the long-term effects of TBI. They're looking at vets with a variety of symptoms such as PTSD, alcohol abuse and sleep problems, which tend to co-occur with TBI. Bill Milberg and Regina McGlinchey are the co-directors of the Boston VA study. REGINA MCGLINCHEY: So we don't only look at the military service period. We look at what happened to these people when they were younger, before they were in the military, so, you know, we capture things like rock wars and sledding incidents when they're growing up. And then also, you know. . . BILL MILBERG: Sports injuries and bar fights and the whole gamut. MCGLINCHEY: Yeah, whole nine yards (laughter). THYS: And they're trying to understand the possible impact on a person's emotional well-being. MCGLINCHEY: We're not trying to understand PTSD or just TBI. It's like, what does war do to an entire person? THYS: Researchers found that exposure to blasts resulted in changes to brain function and brain structure. They also learned that veterans could have suffered a brain injury from blasts even if they never had a concussion. One of the researchers, Laura Grande, found the effects of blast exposure are the same even if a person had no symptoms of concussion. LAURA GRANDE: It's not the PTSD that's driving this memory deficit. It's not the sleep deprivation. It's not the substance abuse. I think what this study demonstrates is that it's - that's not all that there is, that there is something about blast exposure that is also associated with memory impairment. THYS: Chris Riga lives in western Massachusetts, where he works as a patient advocate at the local VA. There, a co-worker who works with a lot of recent special operations veterans told him of the Boston study. At 54, he's had many concussions and problems with short-term memory. So Riga volunteered. By participating in the VA research, he's been taught how to cope with his memory loss. RIGA: I go through a lot of stickies (laughter). My wall is full of them. It's a tool. Rather than not only forgetting something and adding the stress of worrying about forgetting something, you can just simply write it down. THYS: By working with Riga and 800 other veterans, McGlinchey hopes the VA team can identify combinations of conditions that seem to predict poor outcome. MCGLINCHEY: So that we can target who it is that are going to need a lot of care, intervene early enough where we can have an effect and have an impact on the rest of their lives rather than letting the horse keep running out of the barn. But first, we have to know who to find, how to target. You can't just bring three million people who've been deployed in for help. THYS: McGlinchey and her colleagues are trying to identify those at greatest risk for later disability so as to target therapy and other interventions as early as possible.

Being able to do that efficiently would make breeding new varieties of crops faster and easier. NPR's Joe Palca has more. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: To modify the genetics of plants, you need to get DNA into plant cells. But it's hard. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, have invented a way to do it using something called carbon nanotubes - long, stiff tubes of carbon that are really teeny-tiny. Markita Landry is the scientist who came up with the idea. But the curious thing is she's neither a nanotechnology engineer nor a plant biologist. MARKITA LANDRY: I'm a physicist. And when I started (laughter) my lab at Berkeley two years ago, my lab was focused exclusively on imaging between cells. PALCA: Landry was planning to use carbon nanotubes as a kind of external scaffolding around the cells to make it easier to study what was between them. That idea was a total flop. LANDRY: Because instead of staying outside of the plant cells as we had presumed, these nanotubes were going straight into the cells. PALCA: So, in the spirit of corporate management gurus, Landry turned a problem into an opportunity. LANDRY: We flipped it around and made it a DNA delivery platform instead. PALCA: Getting DNA into cells would allow scientists to manipulate the way plant cells work. And there are some exotic ways of doing that. But plant cells present a unique challenge. LANDRY: Plants have not just a cell membrane but also a cell wall. PALCA: A strand of DNA is small enough to slip through the plant cell wall. But it's not rigid enough. LANDRY: You can kind of think of it like a floppy string. If you try to push a floppy string through a sponge, it's not really going to work. But if you take a solid needle and try to push it through a sponge, that will work much better. PALCA: Attaching the DNA to the carbon nanotube gives you that nanoneedle. In addition to DNA, Landry says it's also possible to attach a gene editing tool known as CRISPR. Once inside a cell from, let's say, an apple tree, CRISPR could, for example, inactivate a gene that causes browning in apples. LANDRY: We would end up with a apple tree whose apples don't go brown when you cut into them. PALCA: Now, Landry's approach is brand new. Laura Bartley is a plant biologist at the University of Oklahoma in Norman. LAURA BARTLEY: I think they've got a little ways to go to make it really interesting. PALCA: She says it's important to show that it works in different varieties of plants. But she's impressed that the new approach appears to be able to get DNA into grass plants like wheat. BARTLEY: That's the technology that I'm, like, oh, that's pretty cool. If it works the way they think it does, I can imagine a lot of people wanting to use that.

Chances are the kids are misbehaving - if they're mine. And maybe you're starting to get angry and yell a little. These past few weeks, NPR has been exploring anger. And today in the last story in this series, we're going to talk about a way to get kids to behave that's the complete opposite to the punishment approach. NPR's Michaeleen Doucleff tells us more about the strategy. MICHAELEEN DOUCLEFF, BYLINE: Back in the 1970s, the late anthropologist Jean Briggs was living in the Canadian Arctic, studying Inuit culture. One day, she took a walk and saw. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEAN BRIGGS: A young mother sitting on the gravel beach with her 2-year-old son. DOUCLEFF: Young woman picked up a pebble, gave it to the little boy and said. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BRIGGS: Hit me. Go on, hit me - harder. DOUCLEFF: With the rock - the kid did, and the mom replied. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BRIGGS: Ow, that hurts. DOUCLEFF: Jean was stunned. It seemed like the mother was teaching the child the opposite of what parents want - right? - to hit, to throw rocks, to act in anger. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BRIGGS: I thought, what is going on here? DOUCLEFF: That's Jean talking to the CBC back in 2011. The mom's actions also seemed to contradict everything she knew about Inuit culture, a culture that greatly values gentleness and even-temperedness. In fact, Inuit are incredibly good at controlling anger, even when it comes to disciplining kids. MYNA ISHULUTAK: When you're shouting at them all the time, they tend to kind of block you, I guess. So that's saying never shout at them. DOUCLEFF: That's Myna Ishulutak. She's a language teacher and filmmaker in Iqaluit, Canada. She knew Jean well. Myna met her when she was just about 3 years old. At the time, Myna's family was living a lifestyle similar to the way her ancestors did thousands of years ago, in a hunting camp, eating. . . ISHULUTAK: Just from the animals like seal, fish, caribou. DOUCLEFF: Myna's family welcomed Jean into their home. ISHULUTAK: Jean was living out on the land with us. DOUCLEFF: Jean wanted to live with them because she was interested in studying how Inuit raise young children - in particular, how they taught young children to control their emotions, especially anger. What she documented is one of the most intriguing parenting strategies I've come across. When a child acted in anger, like hit someone or had a tantrum, there was no scolding, no punishment, no time outs. Instead, the parents waited for a calm, peaceful moment and did something that Shakespeare. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DOUCLEFF: . . . Would be envious of. (SOUNDBITE OF PLAY, \"AS YOU LIKE IT\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Jaques) All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players. DOUCLEFF: They put on a play - a little drama. The parent would reenact what happened when the child hit or had a tantrum, including the consequences of that behavior. Now, this is critical. During the drama, the parent always had a playful, fun tone. And the drama typically started by trying to provoke the child, like the young mom did that Jean saw on the beach. She said. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BRIGGS: Hit me. Go on, hit me - harder. DOUCLEFF: Then in this play, the child has to think, what should I do? Should I hit mama? If the child chooses to take the bait and hits the mom, the mom doesn't yell or scold but acts out the consequences. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BRIGGS: Ow, that hurts. DOUCLEFF: It doesn't stop there. The parent then asks a question to keep the child thinking about the consequences, like, don't you like me? - the implication being that hitting hurts people's feelings. The parents keep putting on these little plays from time to time until the child learns not to hit. Myna grew up learning from these types of dramas. She says these plays also teach kids to keep their cool. ISHULUTAK: Teaching you to be, I guess, strong mentally and emotionally. DOUCLEFF: To not react and be. . . ISHULUTAK: Yeah. DOUCLEFF: . . . Provoked easily. ISHULUTAK: Yeah. DOUCLEFF: In other words, these dramas give kids a chance to practice controlling their anger. And this practice may be key because here's the thing about controlling anger. Once the anger has already erupted, stopping it is not easy for anyone. LISA FELDMAN BARRETT: When you try to control your emotions in the moment and you want to change the feeling, that's a really hard thing to do. DOUCLEFF: That's Lisa Feldman Barrett, a psychologist at Northeastern University who studies how emotions work. She says there's a big misconception that you can easily stop yourself when you're already mad. But, she says, if you practice cultivating a different emotion or a different response when you're calm and peaceful, you have a better chance of managing your anger in those hot-button moments. FELDMAN BARRETT: That practice is, essentially, helping to rewire your brain to be able to make those emotions much more easily. DOUCLEFF: This practice may be even more important for little children. Laura Markam is a psychologist in New York City. She says kids' brains are still developing the circuitry needed for self-control. LAURA MARKAM: Children have all kinds of big emotions. They don't have much prefrontal cortex yet. And so what we do in responding to our child's emotions actually shapes their brain. DOUCLEFF: She specializes in peaceful approaches to disciplining and recommends a strategy similar to the Inuits. When the kid misbehaves, wait until everyone is calm and then go back over with the child what happened. MARKAM: That develops cognitive capacity. And it develops self-control, self-regulation. DOUCLEFF: You can do it with a drama, a story or grab two stuffed animals and act it out. She says just make sure you keep the tone fun and playful. She says many parents forget how powerful play is in disciplining and sculpting kids' behavior. MARKAM: And, of course, for children, play is their work. That's how they learn about the world and about experience. DOUCLEFF: Now, at this point, I need to come clean. I have a personal stake in this story. You see; I have a little girl named Rosie. ROSIE: I'm 3 years old. DOUCLEFF: If she's angry and I pick her up, sometimes, she slaps me. So I thought I'd give this playful approach a try. Each time she hit me, no matter how hard it was and how infuriated I was, I didn't get angry. I just said. . . Ow, that hurts. Goodness, that hurts. I immediately saw a difference. The tension between us melted away. So I started putting on a lot of little dramas. The first few were really rough. She would wallop me. But I stuck to the script. And every time, I asked her this one question. Don't you like me? After about a month, this happened. Why don't you hit me? ROSIE: No. DOUCLEFF: No. Why not? ROSIE: Because I love you. DOUCLEFF: Because what, Rosie, love? ROSIE: Because I love you. DOUCLEFF: Because you love me. Oh, that's very nice. Nice and also a testimony to the power of not being angry but instead teaching kids through play and practice. Michaeleen Doucleff, NPR News.

The parents keep putting on these little plays from time to time until the child learns not to hit. Myna grew up learning from these types of dramas. She says these plays also teach kids to keep their cool. ISHULUTAK: Teaching you to be, I guess, strong mentally and emotionally. DOUCLEFF: To not react and be. . . ISHULUTAK: Yeah. DOUCLEFF: . . . Provoked easily. ISHULUTAK: Yeah. DOUCLEFF: In other words, these dramas give kids a chance to practice controlling their anger. And this practice may be key because here's the thing about controlling anger. Once the anger has already erupted, stopping it is not easy for anyone. LISA FELDMAN BARRETT: When you try to control your emotions in the moment and you want to change the feeling, that's a really hard thing to do. DOUCLEFF: That's Lisa Feldman Barrett, a psychologist at Northeastern University who studies how emotions work. She says there's a big misconception that you can easily stop yourself when you're already mad. But, she says, if you practice cultivating a different emotion or a different response when you're calm and peaceful, you have a better chance of managing your anger in those hot-button moments. FELDMAN BARRETT: That practice is, essentially, helping to rewire your brain to be able to make those emotions much more easily. DOUCLEFF: This practice may be even more important for little children. Laura Markam is a psychologist in New York City. She says kids' brains are still developing the circuitry needed for self-control. LAURA MARKAM: Children have all kinds of big emotions. They don't have much prefrontal cortex yet. And so what we do in responding to our child's emotions actually shapes their brain. DOUCLEFF: She specializes in peaceful approaches to disciplining and recommends a strategy similar to the Inuits. When the kid misbehaves, wait until everyone is calm and then go back over with the child what happened. MARKAM: That develops cognitive capacity. And it develops self-control, self-regulation. DOUCLEFF: You can do it with a drama, a story or grab two stuffed animals and act it out. She says just make sure you keep the tone fun and playful. She says many parents forget how powerful play is in disciplining and sculpting kids' behavior. MARKAM: And, of course, for children, play is their work. That's how they learn about the world and about experience. DOUCLEFF: Now, at this point, I need to come clean. I have a personal stake in this story. You see; I have a little girl named Rosie. ROSIE: I'm 3 years old. DOUCLEFF: If she's angry and I pick her up, sometimes, she slaps me. So I thought I'd give this playful approach a try. Each time she hit me, no matter how hard it was and how infuriated I was, I didn't get angry. I just said. . . Ow, that hurts. Goodness, that hurts. I immediately saw a difference. The tension between us melted away. So I started putting on a lot of little dramas. The first few were really rough. She would wallop me. But I stuck to the script. And every time, I asked her this one question. Don't you like me? After about a month, this happened. Why don't you hit me? ROSIE: No. DOUCLEFF: No. Why not? ROSIE: Because I love you. DOUCLEFF: Because what, Rosie, love? ROSIE: Because I love you. DOUCLEFF: Because you love me. Oh, that's very nice. Nice and also a testimony to the power of not being angry but instead teaching kids through play and practice.

In fact, I was one of those kids who kind of just - I survived mathematics. GUY RAZ, HOST: This is Eddie Woo. WOO: But I certainly didn't ever experience it as a really positive. Like, oh, wow, this is subject to be enjoyed and appreciated. It was really far away from my mind all the way through high school. RAZ: But, Eddie, he actually ended up becoming the one thing he'd never thought he'd be, a math teacher. WOO: It's really a testament to how my own teachers changed my own life. I turned up at university with the full intent to become an English and history teacher. I went so far as to have written that on my enrollment form. But it was at university, through some of the educators whom I met there, that I discovered that we don't have enough mathematics teachers and educators in our schools, really, in any level. And when I heard about this, suddenly all these pieces kind of fell into place for me because I realized maybe this is not just about me and my own experience of a subject. This is about something which is shaping our society. We've got - if we went out on the street today, Guy, and we asked 10 people, do you like mathematics, I think nine of them would tell us no. And that would probably be on a good day. I think on a bad day, 10 would tell us no. We'd have to get further than that to get to the first person who actually likes it. And this is the effect that this shortage of skilled, and passionate and engaged mathematics educators, that's the consequence of that shortage in our culture and society. And I thought, I want to be an educator to make a difference in people's lives. If this is where the need is, I'm going to go down the rabbit hole. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WOO: You know, there's a universal reality and truth to this subject that humanity has been fascinated with for centuries, for millennia. And so I got to sort of stumble upon that, you know, really by accident and realize, wow, there's a reason why mathematicians describe mathematics in these incredible terms. They describe it as elegant, and it has this austere beauty. It was as though, Guy, you and I, we've kind of been born into this world where no one likes music. (SOUNDBITE OF PIANO KEY PLAYING)WOO: They actually loathe it because it's something they are forced to do when they're young. Everyone really hates this particular style of music, but you have to go through learning how to write the notes and how to memorize the notes in sequence so you can recite them in a time-pressured assessment task. And then, thank goodness, after 13 years of all, compulsory music, we all just escape it, and we're very glad that we survived, having never actually listened to music ourselves. (SOUNDBITE OF DRUM BEATING)WOO: That's a terrible way to describe a world. But that's the world we live in because that's how people think of mathematics. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Here's more from Eddie Woo on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TEDx TALK)WOO: I used to believe that math was about rote-learning inscrutable formulas to solve abstract problems that didn't mean anything to me. But at university, I began to see that mathematics is immensely practical and even beautiful. That it's not just about finding answers, but also about learning to ask the right questions. It gradually dawned on me that mathematics is a sense. Mathematics is a sense, just like sight and touch. It's a sense that allows us to perceive realities which would be otherwise intangible to us. Now, I want to show you a mathematical reality that I guarantee you've seen before but perhaps never really perceived. It's been hidden in plain sight your entire life. This is a river delta. It's a beautiful piece of geometry. And when we hear the word geometry, most of us think of triangles and circles. But geometry is the mathematics of all shapes. And this meeting of land and sea has created shapes with an undeniable pattern. It has a mathematically recursive structure. Every part of the river delta, with its twists and turns, is a micro-version of the greater whole. So I want you to see the mathematics in this. But that's not all. There's a mathematical reality woven into the fabric of the universe that you share with winding rivers, towering trees and raging storms. These shapes are examples of what we call fractals, as mathematicians. Fractals get their name from the same place as fractions and fractures. It's a reference to the broken and shattered shapes we find around us in nature. And once you have a sense for fractals, you really do start to see them everywhere - a head of broccoli. The leaves of a fern. Even clouds in the sky. Like the other senses, our mathematical sense can be refined with practice. It's just like developing perfect pitch or a taste for wines. You can learn to perceive the mathematics around you with time and the right guidance. RAZ: When people ask you a version of, you know, what am I going to do with this - like, when am I ever going to use math, what do you say? WOO: Yeah. It's - there's such a deep and profound connection between all the mathematics that I learned and that I teach to my students and literally their everyday lives. I think we need to understand that mathematics is so much more than numbers. In fact, you know, if we go back to the - because I'm such an English nerd, I love etymology and where words come from. And if you dig into where the word mathematics comes from, literally, it just means understanding, and that is as broad as the universe that we live in, the cosmos. You know, biology is the study of living things. Chemistry is the study of substances and materials. Physics is the study of matter and movement. But mathematics is the study of patterns, which are literally everywhere. Now, what does this mean in our everyday lives? Well, we are doing that. . . RAZ: Yeah. WOO: . . . Every hour of every day. We are looking out at the world, and we are - I'm just thinking about, OK, when I get in my car and I drive home, you know, I'm sitting in this traffic and thinking about how to get home. I'm thinking about all the paths that I can take. Which one is going to be the fastest and most efficient so I can see my kids sooner? All of that, you're calculating, you're thinking logically in your mind. It goes to my perception of the world. When I look out at a tree or at a rainbow, I don't just want to, you know, let these pieces of beauty pass me by. What it means to be human is actually to marvel at this universe around us and to say, wow, there's a reason why rainbows are round, why they're - you know when you see a rainbow after rain, it looks like a semicircle, you know, you can see it, you know, hitting the horizon? RAZ: Yeah, sure. WOO: But if you're lucky enough and in the right place at the right time, if you're in the sky or on a mountain, you'll actually see that rainbow is not a semicircle, it's a complete full circle. It goes all the way around. That's not a coincidence. That's geometry. That's beautiful. What it means to be human is to appreciate that and say, wow, there's something to wonder at here. And so for me, you know, when do I use mathematics? When do I not use mathematics? The real question is, do I know that I'm doing it when I am? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Eddie, I asked a version of this question to Dan Finkel, but what's the danger of a society where people don't engage with math or don't have math competency or literacy? I mean, do you think there are consequences? WOO: There are really severe consequences, and we've actually seen this in our society today. In so many ways, I could illustrate this. Firstly, can I play a really, really quick game with you guys? Can I play a game with you? RAZ: Of course. Yeah, I'd love to. WOO: OK. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WOO: We're going to go back and forth. RAZ: OK. WOO: And we're going to say numbers. RAZ: OK. WOO: The goal is, either you or me is going to say the number 23, OK? RAZ: OK. WOO: And whoever says the number 23, they're the winner, OK? That's the goal. RAZ: OK. WOO: Now, Guy, I'll let you go first. I want you to choose a number between one and four. RAZ: Three. WOO: Three. I'm going to add a number to that, and it's always going to be between one and four, OK? RAZ: OK. WOO: So I'm going to say - I'm going to add one to that. So you said three, that means I say four. It's your turn now. RAZ: OK. So I'm going to add a four. WOO: Ah, I said four. So it's eight now. RAZ: Yep. WOO: Yep. I'm going to say two, so 10. RAZ: And I'm going to say four. WOO: Fourteen. OK, no worries. I'm going to say four now, so that means we're up to 18. RAZ: Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WOO: What would you like to say now, Guy? RAZ: (Laughter) One? WOO: (Laughter). RAZ: I've lost the game. WOO: Now, I'm going to make a bet. I'm going to bet you laughed because you realized - took you about seven seconds, which is not bad, Guy. Now, I won't give you the full explanation here, but how did I win that? I knew something about patterns underneath that game which you didn't know. RAZ: Yeah. WOO: And so I could take advantage of that fact. And, you know, in this case, what's the harm? Aw, I win. No big deal, right? But when you don't know what's going on mathematically underneath something, and increasingly today, Guy, our world is built on and is run by algorithms that have been mathematically designed by people and are hidden from view, you know. When you're scrolling through your social media feed, you're not thinking that there's mathematics happening underneath there. When you order something online and there's recommended stuff on the side for what - people like you, Guy, have purchased these as well. You're not thinking about there's a formula doing that, but mathematics is underneath all of those things, guiding all of those people's decision-making. And as I've just demonstrated, if you're not aware of that, someone can use that in a really malicious way, and people have used that in really malicious ways. And so, you know, from a negative point of view, what are the consequences of us having a mathematically-illiterate general population? They're huge. There's people who are having the wool pulled over their eyes, and they don't even know it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WOO: But at the same time, I think we're missing a part of who we are as human beings. This is what I was sort of getting at in the talk. Can you imagine if we walked around all day with our eyes closed? Can you imagine if we went into the world ignoring our senses? We have our senses because they're a wonderful way to understand and appreciate the world. So not only are there really negative consequences, but there are really positive things that we miss out and that I want people to be able to feel and experience. That, for me, is a really fundamental reason I think mathematics should be something everyone embraces and learns. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: That's Eddie Woo. He's a high school math teacher in Sydney, Australia. He also has his own channel on YouTube, which, of course, is all about math. You can see Eddie's full talk at ted. com.

And for eight years, at 3:20 in the morning, Adam Spencer would roll out of bed and go to work. ADAM SPENCER: Three hours every day - 6 o'clock till 9 o'clock - news, traffic, weather, the very best music and a healthy serve of mathematics to get you on your way. RAZ: Adam hosted the most-listened-to morning radio talk show in Australia. And every chance he'd get, he'd talk about math. SPENCER: Darwin, sunny and 32 degrees. That's two to the power of five. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: In 1996, Adam was actually working toward a doctorate in pure mathematics when he won a stand-up comedy contest for a national radio station. He thought working in radio was a better idea at the time, so he dropped out. SPENCER: I'd like to say in a room of randomly selected people, I'm the maths genius. In a room of maths PhDs, I'm as dumb as a box full of hammers. RAZ: These days, Adam makes his living writing and talking about math because Adam Spencer is one of those people who's always loved numbers. Here's more from Adam on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SPENCER: I cast my mind back when I was in second grade. As we came up towards lunchtime, our teacher Ms. Russell said to the class, what do you want to do after lunch? I've got no plans. It was an exercise in democratic schooling, but we were only 7. And after a while, someone made a particularly silly suggestion, and Ms. Russell patted them down with that gentle aphorism - that wouldn't work. That would be like trying to put a square peg through a round hole. Now, I wasn't trying to be smart. I wasn't trying to be funny. I just politely raised my hand. And when Ms. Russell acknowledged me, I said, but miss, surely if the diagonal of the square is less than the diameter of the circle, well, the square peg will pass quite easily through the round hole. (LAUGHTER)SPENCER: It'd be like putting a piece of toast through a basketball hoop, wouldn't it? RAZ: Do you think that you just had that switch in your brain that was like, yes, math. I love it. It's awesome. SPENCER: It's a really difficult question 'cause with me, it goes back so far that I don't even remember if I had to try all that hard. But I do remember that having loved it, I did more and more. Like practically anything, it is a practice thing. And because it's a subject with that finite correct, incorrect sort of line, it is the thing where, to an extent, you can teach yourself. You know if you're getting it right. You're not teaching yourself bad habits. And I just loved it more than anyone else I knew. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SPENCER: I fell in love with mathematics from the earliest of ages. I explained it to all my friends. Maths is beautiful. It's natural. It's everywhere. Numbers are the musical notes with which the symphony of the universe is written. Today I want to show you one of those musical notes, a number so beautiful, so massive I think it will blow your mind. Today we're going to talk about prime numbers. RAZ: Prime numbers - let's just remind everybody what a prime number is. SPENCER: OK. So six is not prime. . . RAZ: Right. SPENCER: . . . Because we can break it down into six equals two times three. Seven is prime because seven is one times seven, but you can't break it into any smaller multiplying building blocks. So the primes are the sort of building blocks that all the other numbers come out from. If I throw you a number - if I say 26 - well, turns out that's not prime. RAZ: Nope. SPENCER: It's two times 13. OK. What about 29? RAZ: Yep. SPENCER: That is prime. You can't break it down. Every number has to be prime or composite. Primes go on forever. There is no final, biggest prime number. A beautiful mathematician called Euclid proved that thousands of years ago. So it makes sense. In any given time, there must be a largest prime number that we know about. And my TED talk back in 2013 was the history of the largest prime numbers we've detected. Initially, it was all just humans doing phenomenal things with their brains. And I was going to say pen and paper - not even pen, you know? Quill. . . RAZ: Quill, yeah. SPENCER: . . . And ink and chalk and things like that with equations pulling down that are just unbelievable to think a human mind could come up with free of any device. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SPENCER: This is the great Swiss mathematician Leonard Euler. In the 1700s, other mathematicians said he is simply the master of us all. Euler discovered, at the time, the world's biggest prime - two to the 31 minus one. It's over 2 billion. You think that's big. We know that two to the power of 127 minus one is a prime number. It's an absolute brute. Look at it here - 39 digits long, proven to be prime in 1876 by a mathematician called Lucas. Word up, L dog. The massive prime numbers all follow a cute little formula. I'll give you a really easy example. RAZ: Sure. SPENCER: Let's take two, and let's multiply two by itself three twos. Two times two is four, times two gets us to eight. Let's take away one from that. So we had two times two times two, take away one is seven, which just happens to be a prime number. RAZ: Yeah. SPENCER: All the massive prime numbers we've ever detected are of the form two multiplied together heaps of times, take away one. And the latest one that we uncovered in December of last year - take the number two. Write down not one two, not three twos, like I had earlier. Write down 82,589,993 twos. You end up with a 24-million-digit-long number. RAZ: Wow. SPENCER: And we know that single number is prime as confidently as we know the number seven is prime. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SPENCER: I just think that's just mind-numbingly beautiful. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SPENCER: My laptop at home was looking through four potential candidate primes myself as part of a networked computer hunt around the world for these large numbers. The discovery of that prime was similar to the work people are doing in unraveling RNA sequences, in searching through data from SETI and other astronomical projects. We live in an age where some of the great breakthroughs are not going to happen in the labs or the halls of academia but on laptops, desktops, in the palms of people's hands who are simply helping out for the search. But for me, it's amazing because it's a metaphor for the time in which we live, when human minds and machines can conquer together. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: So right now, as we're sitting here talking on the radio, you've got a computer in your house that's just, like, you know, looking for prime numbers. SPENCER: Yeah. There's a project called GIMPS. The more technical, mathematical name is Mersenne - M-E-R-S-E-N-N-E - from a guy who researched a monk back in the 1600s of all things. And so GIMPS is the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search. Anyone can do this. You take your laptop and download the GIMPS software. It will give you a candidate prime. And in the background, while your computer's doing nothing else, it will just search. Now, it would take four to six weeks before it comes back and says yes or no. And you're almost always going to be disappointed and told no. But if you think about the amount of super computing power that is just sitting on people's desks, in their man caves, in the office at work over the weekend, on their phones, just unused - there are problems out there we want solved. And the GIMPS prime search is just a great, little, nerdy example of that. RAZ: All right. So there are people looking for these monster prime numbers. And the latest one was discovered by this guy Patrick Laroche, right? SPENCER: Yeah. Laroche is the latest one, yes. RAZ: What's the point? Like, what's the practical application of a prime number? SPENCER: Big-sized prime numbers - 20 digits long, those sort of things - underpin all Internet security. And the reason that you can use your credit cards online, et cetera, is to do with algorithms based on very large prime numbers. And the best sort of practical application for large numbers like this is they're a great way to test the speed and accuracy of potential new computer chips. If my laptop is working on a Pentium 15BZ and I think that's the greatest chip in the world, and you say, well, I've come up with the double Pentium 13X - OK. Well, let's ask them the same simple question with the same eight lines of code. And let's let the computers go and decide for us. Now, if your one comes back in only three weeks and it solves something that took my computer five weeks, you've got yourself a really fast, impressive, new computer chip. So speed and accuracy testing of computer chips these days - well worth it. And it's also just another small piece in the deeper puzzle. One of the reasons we're so attracted to prime numbers is they're so basic. They're so fundamental. We know nothing about them. Some of the most famous problems - unsolved problems in the history of mathematics are to do with the distribution of prime numbers, the amount of prime numbers you have after a certain point and things like that. So any small step towards understanding them more, I think, is a good thing. RAZ: That's Adam Spencer. He's the first-ever ambassador of science and mathematics for the University of Sydney in Australia. You can find his full talk at ted. com. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"SCHOOL OF ROCK\")JACK BLACK: (As Dewey, singing) Math is a wonderful thing. Math is a really cool thing. So get off your ath (ph). Let's do some math, math, math, math, math, math. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Hey. Thanks so much for listening to our show on math this week. If you want to find out more about who was on it, go to ted. npr. org. And to see hundreds more TED Talks, check out ted. com or the TED app. Our production staff at NPR includes Jeff Rogers, Sanaz Meshkinpour, Jinae West, Neva Grant, Casey Herman, Rachel Faulkner, Diba Mohtasham, James Delahoussaye, Melissa Gray and J. C. Howard with help from Daniel Shukin. Our intern is Katie Monteleone. Our partners at TED are Chris Anderson, Colin Helms, Anna Phelan and Janet Lee. I'm Guy Raz. And you've been listening to ideas worth spreading right here on the TED Radio Hour from NPR. GUY RAZ, HOST:  Today on the show, ideas about the beauty of math and the people who love it. And for eight years, at 3:20 in the morning, Adam Spencer would roll out of bed and go to work. ADAM SPENCER: Three hours every day - 6 o'clock till 9 o'clock - news, traffic, weather, the very best music and a healthy serve of mathematics to get you on your way. RAZ: Adam hosted the most-listened-to morning radio talk show in Australia. And every chance he'd get, he'd talk about math. SPENCER: Darwin, sunny and 32 degrees. That's two to the power of five. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: In 1996, Adam was actually working toward a doctorate in pure mathematics when he won a stand-up comedy contest for a national radio station. He thought working in radio was a better idea at the time, so he dropped out. SPENCER: I'd like to say in a room of randomly selected people, I'm the maths genius. In a room of maths PhDs, I'm as dumb as a box full of hammers. RAZ: These days, Adam makes his living writing and talking about math because Adam Spencer is one of those people who's always loved numbers. Here's more from Adam on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SPENCER: I cast my mind back when I was in second grade. As we came up towards lunchtime, our teacher Ms. Russell said to the class, what do you want to do after lunch? I've got no plans. It was an exercise in democratic schooling, but we were only 7. And after a while, someone made a particularly silly suggestion, and Ms. Russell patted them down with that gentle aphorism - that wouldn't work. That would be like trying to put a square peg through a round hole. Now, I wasn't trying to be smart. I wasn't trying to be funny. I just politely raised my hand. And when Ms. Russell acknowledged me, I said, but miss, surely if the diagonal of the square is less than the diameter of the circle, well, the square peg will pass quite easily through the round hole. (LAUGHTER) SPENCER: It'd be like putting a piece of toast through a basketball hoop, wouldn't it? RAZ: Do you think that you just had that switch in your brain that was like, yes, math. I love it. It's awesome. SPENCER: It's a really difficult question 'cause with me, it goes back so far that I don't even remember if I had to try all that hard. But I do remember that having loved it, I did more and more. Like practically anything, it is a practice thing. And because it's a subject with that finite correct, incorrect sort of line, it is the thing where, to an extent, you can teach yourself. You know if you're getting it right. You're not teaching yourself bad habits. And I just loved it more than anyone else I knew. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SPENCER: I fell in love with mathematics from the earliest of ages. I explained it to all my friends. Maths is beautiful. It's natural. It's everywhere. Numbers are the musical notes with which the symphony of the universe is written. Today I want to show you one of those musical notes, a number so beautiful, so massive I think it will blow your mind. Today we're going to talk about prime numbers. RAZ: Prime numbers - let's just remind everybody what a prime number is. SPENCER: OK. So six is not prime. . . RAZ: Right. SPENCER: . . . Because we can break it down into six equals two times three.

A century later, physicists proved him right when they detected the ripples created by the collision of two black holes. The massive detectors used to make that discovery have now gotten an upgrade, and they are just about to start back up. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Gabby Gonzalez is a physicist at Louisiana State University who has spent years, decades, working with a team that was trying to detect something that had never been detected before. GABRIELA GONZALEZ: I have lots of friends that, now, they tell me, I felt so worried about your career because you were working on such a difficult thing that I thought it was never going to happen. And now, I'm so jealous (laughter). GREENFIELDBOYCE: They're jealous because in 2015, it did happen - the first-ever detection of gravitational waves. You can't see them. You can't feel them. But Albert Einstein had it right. Space and time is a kind of jiggly matrix. And when two big things out in the universe collide, they can send shockwaves through spacetime that are like the ripples you make when you toss a pebble into a pond. Being able to sense these waves is brand new for astronomy, which has spent centuries studying light. GONZALEZ: Galileo invented the telescope or used the telescope for the first time to do astronomy 400 years ago. And today, we're still building better telescopes. I think this decade has been the beginning of gravitational wave astronomy. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And she thinks it should just keep getting better and better. The United States has two facilities for detecting gravitational waves - one in Washington state and one in Louisiana. Together, they're called LIGO for the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. I drove about an hour and a half north of New Orleans to see the one in rural Louisiana. The head of the observatory, Joe Giaime, took me over to a display case to see a gold medal. JOSEPH GIAIME: People who win Nobel prizes can pay a little extra money, and check a box and get a duplicate. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Each site has one of these since the first detection of gravitational waves was such a big deal that the Nobel Committee, pretty much instantly, honored three American physicists for their work on this project. We walk out onto a bridge that goes over a big concrete pipe. From here, we see the pipe going off into the distance, and we can also see another pipe as well. Giaime says each is more than two miles long. They come together in a shape that, from above, looks like a capital L. GIAIME: I've spoken with pilots who fly over this. And they wonder why there's a pipeline that starts nowhere, travels, you know, a couple miles, turns right and then goes also nowhere. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Inside each stretch of pipe is a powerful laser beam that bounces back and forth between mirrors. Scientists use this laser to precisely measure the length of each arm of the L. When a gravitational wave passes through and distorts space, the lengths change by a tiny, tiny bit like a fraction of the width of a subatomic particle. GIAIME: We're in the control room now, and this is where all of the activities of both the site and the detector are monitored and controlled. GREENFIELDBOYCE: It's a windowless room with people sitting at dozens of computer monitors. Since the first historic detection 3 1/2 years ago, this place has registered 10 more gravitational wave events. Nine were black hole collisions, and one was a pair of neutron stars smashing together. But the science has been shut down for more than a year. That was to let researchers install new hardware and other upgrades. The workers in here, now, are testing them out. On April 1, everything officially comes back online. Giaime says the U. S. detectors plus another one in Italy will all be more sensitive. GIAIME: So, so far, we've seen 11 things. Maybe we'll see twice that many this year. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And they'll be better able to locate the source of the waves in the sky. The team will send out public alerts so that anyone can point their telescopes at the right spot. In case, like the neutron star collision, the event sends out cosmic fireworks. Thousands of astronomers and physicists around the world are now involved in studying gravitational waves because these offer the only way to explore some of the most powerful, exotic events in the universe. And that's the fun of it. Nergis Mavalvala is a physicist at MIT. NERGIS MAVALVALA: We've only seen this handful of black holes of all the possible ones that are out there. There are many, many questions we still don't know how to answer. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Plus, maybe something completely unexpected will go boom. MAVALVALA: That's how discovery happens. As you turn on a new instrument, you point it out at the sky and you see something that you had no idea existed. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says that's happened time and time again in astronomy, and she bets it'll happen for gravitational waves as well. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

We're not talking about those pear-shaped bulbs. They've already changed over. This new proposal involves just about every other kind of lightbulb. Here's NPR's Jeff Brady to explain. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: In the past decade, the push for lightbulbs that use less energy has made a lot of progress, and that can make the lightbulb aisle at a big-box store a little confusing. JOHN PENNICK: I'm looking for a bulb to go inside of my refrigerator. BRADY: John Pennick is holding a burned-out, 40-watt incandescent bulb in one hand and a package of LED bulbs in the other. He likes that the LEDs use one-fifth the energy. But on the package, it says they're dimmable. PENNICK: I'm not going to be dimming inside the refrigerator (laughter) so. . . BRADY: He opts for the old incandescent. Though, it turns out, the dimmable LED would have worked just fine. This learning curve is part of a big change under way in the lighting business. Noah Horowitz with the Natural Resources Defense Council says the country has been using incandescent bulbs for more than a century. NOAH HOROWITZ: Today, we have LEDs, and they do everything the old incandescent could do, except waste energy. BRADY: You see the pear-shaped LEDs everywhere now. At issue here is a wide range of other bulbs - decorative globes used in bathrooms, reflectors in recessed lighting, candle-shaped lights and three-way bulbs. At the very end of the Obama administration, the Department of Energy decided these also would have to become more efficient. The lighting industry sued. The Trump administration sided with the industry and now wants to reverse the regulation. Horowitz says that will translate to higher energy bills and more pollution. HOROWITZ: Now we're going to have to generate about 25 large, coal-burning power plants' worth of extra electricity if this rollback goes through. This is really unnecessary and a really bad idea. And on top of that, it's illegal. BRADY: That last point is a question a judge likely will decide. The National Electrical Manufacturers Association argues the Obama administration exceeded its authority by including all these specialty bulbs. General counsel Clark Silcox says it's wrong to call the Trump administration's proposed reversal a rollback. CLARK SILCOX: The Department of Energy cannot illegally roll back from a place that it could not legally stand upon in the first place. BRADY: That is important to the industry because rolling back energy efficiency requirements is not allowed under federal law. And Silcox rejects claims the industry just wants to continue selling existing styles of bulbs. SILCOX: I don't think anybody's focused on we want to sell energy-hogging lightbulbs at all. What they are focused on is, what does their consumer want and making sure that there is a high level of consumer satisfaction. BRADY: The industry learned a hard lesson after the first generation of those curly, compact fluorescent lightbulbs were released. JENNIFER DOLIN: Consumers basically did not like them. They didn't buy them. They complained about them. We heard that loud and clear. BRADY: Jennifer Dolin is with the company LEDVANCE, which manufacturers Sylvania lightbulbs. She says the industry wants to make sure it gets the LED versions of all these other kinds of bulbs perfected before releasing them onto the market. She says more efficient bulbs are coming, just not as fast as most advocates want. DOLIN: The future of lighting is LED. There's no doubt about that. And we see that in the marketplace. We see that consumers are shifting to LEDs at a much more rapid rate than we ever anticipated. BRADY: But given climate change, environmental groups argue this regulation is needed now. When the Trump administration finalizes its reversal, those groups plan to take the issue to court. Jeff Brady, NPR News.

They are considering recommendations that could lead to looser regulations on soot. Here's NPR's Rebecca Hersher. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: The pollution in question is microscopic soot called particulate matter. It gets into the air from car exhaust and smoke, and it's small enough to lodge itself in the nooks and crannies of people's lungs. Francesca Dominici is a biostatistician at Harvard. FRANCESCA DOMINICI: We know a lot. This issue has been studied now for over 30 years. HERSHER: Those decades of research have shown that breathing soot makes people sick. It makes it more likely that you'll get respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, that you'll end up in the hospital, that you'll die prematurely. And the way the EPA has determined that is by asking a panel of experts, mostly scientists, to analyze all the research that's out there. DOMINICI: The EPA has a very well-vetted process that has been going on over the years called the weight of evidence. This is a process that has been endorsed not only by the EPA, but the National Academy of Science. HERSHER: The system is deceivingly complex because the relationship between air pollution and health is actually hard to study. You can't just run a science experiment on people all over the world. DOMINICI: You can't randomize millions of subjects around the world to breathe higher pollution and lower pollution. So we have to rely on observational data. HERSHER: And observational data is messy. It doesn't just have information about pollution. It has all the other things that affect our health - age and weather and income and even our genes. It's hard to figure out what's causing what here, which has led a small minority of statisticians and other researchers to question the consensus that air pollution shortens our lives. And some of those researchers are on the EPA's Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee. One of them is Tony Cox, the committee chair, who was appointed by the Trump administration. He led a public hearing on Thursday about new recommendations the committee is considering. TONY COX: I look at all this literature. I'm really struck and actually appalled. HERSHER: In Cox's opinion, there is little or no evidence linking particulate pollution to premature death. He knows it's not a popular one with the public and a lot of other scientists. COX: This is waving a red flag front of the bull, so I acknowledge that. HERSHER: Nonetheless, the panel has drafted new science recommendations that would dramatically shrink the number of scientific studies the EPA considers when it's deciding how much air pollution is safe to breathe. Christopher Frey used to have Cox's position as the committee chair. CHRISTOPHER FREY: You know, if you were doing a story where you would give sort of equal weight to the viewpoints, you would interview him and then you would interview 60 people who don't share his view. And that would represent kind of what the reality is. HERSHER: Frey was also a longtime member of a larger, 20-person group of experts specific to particulate matter pollution. The Trump administration dissolved that group out of the blue last fall. Frey says their expertise is missing from the smaller committee that's left. FREY: There are other experts who are much stronger, much better informed, much more aware of the leading edge. HERSHER: And in a bit of a twist, Cox and the other committee members appeared to agree. At Thursday's meeting, they decided to call on the EPA to reinstate a bigger, more-diverse group of experts who can help review the science as the EPA considers updating rules over the next year.

There are giant tortoises and swimming iguanas and numerous creatures found nowhere else. It's one of the world's most protected places. But scientists have discovered that dozens of exotic species have invaded the Galapagos - underwater. NPR's Christopher Joyce reports on this unexpected finding. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Marine biologist James Carlton remembers when he first got to thinking that the Galapagos Islands may not be as pristine as people thought. JAMES CARLTON: On my first visit to the Galapagos, I collected some samples from a boat bottom. JOYCE: Barnacles, sponges and other hitchhikers. That was 1987. Carlton didn't know if those creatures he found were native or not, so four years ago, he and a team of scientists decided to return and take a closer look. CARLTON: We didn't know quite what to expect. JOYCE: What they did know was that on land there were lots of invasive species, species that are not native to the islands. But in the surrounding ocean, scientists only knew of five invaders; everything else presumably was native. When Carlton's team looked underwater, however, they found a horde of invaders. GREGORY RUIZ: And now we have 53, which is a rather stunning increase. JOYCE: Marine biologist Gregory Ruiz says they found exotic species on pilings, docks and mangrove roots. They hung plastic plates underwater, and all sorts of alien invertebrates latched onto them. At the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in Maryland, where he works, Ruiz shows me the invasions lab. Researchers here track invasive species around the world. RUIZ: This is a organism that we found in the Galapagos. JOYCE: Tunicate. RUIZ: It's a tunicate. JOYCE: Also known as a sea squirt, a tiny tube-like animal. He has more invaders in glass bowls filled with alcohol - barnacles, algae, sea anemones. They're described in the journal Aquatic Invasions. Ruiz says rising tourism in the Galapagos means more boats, docks and pilings - transportation and homes for invasives. These organisms aren't just footnotes in a biology text. Zebra mussels invaded the Great Lakes and caused havoc. The tiny parasite called MSX has killed millions of oysters in the Chesapeake Bay on the East Coast. James Carlton, now professor emeritus at Williams College, says tracking invaders helps authorities stem their spread. He expects other tropical areas are heavily invaded as well.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  With a story about deep brain stimulation, or DBS, which sounds like a kind of massage, actually. But it means that patients get an implant that delivers small pulses of electricity to their brains. MARTIN: It's often used to treat Parkinson's disease. But for years, researchers have been trying to figure out how to use it to treat psychiatric disorders. INSKEEP: Results and experiments so far have been mixed. Many patients see no benefit. But some with obsessive-compulsive disorder have seen big changes. MARTIN: Like the next woman you're going to meet. For privacy, we are withholding her last name. Alix Spiegel from NPR's INVISIBILIA has her story. ALIX SPIEGEL, BYLINE: During the appointment, Megan didn't have to do that much, just sit in a chair while one of the doctors from the experiment used what looked like an oversized remote control to reprogram her electricity levels. Even after five years of having the implant, getting her electricity adjusted was unpredictable. Sometimes it went fine. But having electrodes in your brain is really complicated. And occasionally, the adjustments didn't go well. UNIDENTIFIED DOCTOR: While you were talking, I slowly ramped it up again. Anything different now? MEGAN: Slightly more aware. UNIDENTIFIED DOCTOR: OK. MEGAN: It's not like in the past, where it was like, oh, I feel good. But it's, like, a different feeling. SPIEGEL: After the doctor turned her up higher, Megan said she felt better. But then he decided to dial it back just a notch. He was worried that too much electricity might make her manic. UNIDENTIFIED DOCTOR: Now, if you notice me turning it down, then maybe I'll change my mind on that. MEGAN: (Crying) I'm sorry; don't do it. UNIDENTIFIED DOCTOR: Did you just feel it? MEGAN: (Crying) I don't feel very good at all right now. UNIDENTIFIED DOCTOR: Oh, so something just changed? That's why - because in the process of reconfiguring it, it just temporarily went off. So you really noticed that. Give me one second. MEGAN: Yeah. SPIEGEL: Deep brain stimulation - for Megan, getting the device in her brain to work right was a struggle. But on the other hand, so was having obsessive-compulsive disorder. She'd tried all kinds of treatments to feel better, but nothing worked. And so after she dropped out of college, she spent several years basically in her bedroom obsessing not only about things like folding her clothes, but also all the things that might happen if she ever left her house. MEGAN: If I went for a drive, I could hit somebody, whereas, if I stay in my room, I still have to do some compulsions. But at least I'm not going to hurt anybody. So. . . SPIEGEL: Megan felt like she'd run out of options, which is why, after hearing about the DBS experiment, she signed up and why, in 2013, she found herself sitting nervously at Massachusetts General Hospital while a nurse ran clippers over her scalp and her hair fell like dead leaves around her. MEGAN: I remember kind of wanting to cry a little bit. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SPIEGEL: Megan had to be awake during the operation so they could test whether they'd found the exact right spot in her brain. But she was pumped full of so many drugs, the doctors around her felt far away. MEGAN: Most of the time they sounded like \"Peanuts\" adult - the teacher. (SOUNDBITE OF MUFFLED CROSSTALK)SPIEGEL: A few months later, the doctors began the difficult process of finding the right dose of electricity for her. The first day they turned her on, they started really low. But once the doctor got to 3 volts, Megan began to really respond. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MEGAN: It was a feeling of euphoria, like - not just an emotional sensation of, I feel so unburdened, but just a physical sensation, like, after a really great massage and maybe a shot of bourbon. You know, like. . . SPIEGEL: So 3 volts is where the doctors left her - 3 out of a possible 10. 5. The doctors needed to know how the setting would affect her over time. So they asked her to stay at a hotel near the hospital and check in after a couple of days. Megan remembers walking out of the hospital feeling like a completely new person. MEGAN: I found myself feeling more comfortable talking to strangers. Like, if I went to the store, you know, checking out with the cashier - you know, like, making little conversations wasn't hard for me anymore, which was an amazing thing because normally I was so caught up in my own obsessions, I just didn't have the ability to do that. But I just felt so much freer. It was like someone spring-cleaned out my brain and took out all the unnecessary thoughts. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SPIEGEL: And the first day was great. But then the next day she didn't sleep. And the following morning, her mind started racing. And for some reason, she felt the need to physically push at the world around her. MEGAN: Pushing my hands and legs against the floor and the wall, like, this need to get some tension out. SPIEGEL: When she got to the hospital the next day, her doctors told her that she'd had a submanic episode. So they had to turn her off - like, completely and totally off. MEGAN: So I actually left with nothing. And I remember feeling very deflated. And I thought this was just a fluke; I'm never going to feel that good again. SPIEGEL: The good news is that Megan was wrong. It took about five years of struggle - of wires getting broken and batteries not working. But in the summer of 2018, her DBS implant finally began to function consistently. Today, Megan has a job, a husband, a home with a dog and a treatment that works every day. MEGAN: I like to say I'm cured just because of where I was. It was awful. Like, and even though I still have OCD, it's nothing to complain about. SPIEGEL: But then there's the less good news, which is that this happiness that Megan has built for herself, it might not last. This has to do with her levels. The highest amount of electricity that you can feed from the device to the brain before it begins to damage tissue is 10. 5 volts. And she's now at about 6. And since she's only in her 30s, that's something she worries about. Every six months or so, she acclimates to whatever new setting she's been given. And the benefits begin to wear off, which is why Megan tries to make each setting last as long as she possibly can. MEGAN: Because it only goes so high. And you don't want to acclimate to a level when you don't have to. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SPIEGEL: Since the technology is still experimental, there's no way to know how this will work out. What is certain is that Megan's doctors want to keep on improving it. And several scientists told us they believe DBS will one day be used not just to treat people like Megan, but to enhance people who have no disorders. So the device in Megan's head, it might one day have implications for us all. Alix Spiegel, NPR. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:   We are about to go deep - deep into your brain. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   With a story about deep brain stimulation, or DBS, which sounds like a kind of massage, actually. But it means that patients get an implant that delivers small pulses of electricity to their brains. MARTIN: It's often used to treat Parkinson's disease. But for years, researchers have been trying to figure out how to use it to treat psychiatric disorders. INSKEEP: Results and experiments so far have been mixed. Many patients see no benefit. But some with obsessive-compulsive disorder have seen big changes. MARTIN: Like the next woman you're going to meet. For privacy, we are withholding her last name. Alix Spiegel from NPR's INVISIBILIA has her story. ALIX SPIEGEL, BYLINE: During the appointment, Megan didn't have to do that much, just sit in a chair while one of the doctors from the experiment used what looked like an oversized remote control to reprogram her electricity levels. Even after five years of having the implant, getting her electricity adjusted was unpredictable. Sometimes it went fine. But having electrodes in your brain is really complicated. And occasionally, the adjustments didn't go well. UNIDENTIFIED DOCTOR: While you were talking, I slowly ramped it up again. Anything different now? MEGAN: Slightly more aware. UNIDENTIFIED DOCTOR: OK. MEGAN: It's not like in the past, where it was like, oh, I feel good. But it's, like, a different feeling. SPIEGEL: After the doctor turned her up higher, Megan said she felt better. But then he decided to dial it back just a notch. He was worried that too much electricity might make her manic. UNIDENTIFIED DOCTOR: Now, if you notice me turning it down, then maybe I'll change my mind on that. MEGAN: (Crying) I'm sorry; don't do it. UNIDENTIFIED DOCTOR: Did you just feel it? MEGAN: (Crying) I don't feel very good at all right now. UNIDENTIFIED DOCTOR: Oh, so something just changed? That's why - because in the process of reconfiguring it, it just temporarily went off. So you really noticed that. Give me one second. MEGAN: Yeah. SPIEGEL: Deep brain stimulation - for Megan, getting the device in her brain to work right was a struggle. But on the other hand, so was having obsessive-compulsive disorder. She'd tried all kinds of treatments to feel better, but nothing worked. And so after she dropped out of college, she spent several years basically in her bedroom obsessing not only about things like folding her clothes, but also all the things that might happen if she ever left her house. MEGAN: If I went for a drive, I could hit somebody, whereas, if I stay in my room, I still have to do some compulsions. But at least I'm not going to hurt anybody. So. . . SPIEGEL: Megan felt like she'd run out of options, which is why, after hearing about the DBS experiment, she signed up and why, in 2013, she found herself sitting nervously at Massachusetts General Hospital while a nurse ran clippers over her scalp and her hair fell like dead leaves around her. MEGAN: I remember kind of wanting to cry a little bit. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SPIEGEL: Megan had to be awake during the operation so they could test whether they'd found the exact right spot in her brain. But she was pumped full of so many drugs, the doctors around her felt far away. MEGAN: Most of the time they sounded like \"Peanuts\" adult - the teacher. (SOUNDBITE OF MUFFLED CROSSTALK) SPIEGEL: A few months later, the doctors began the difficult process of finding the right dose of electricity for her. The first day they turned her on, they started really low. But once the doctor got to 3 volts, Megan began to really respond. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MEGAN: It was a feeling of euphoria, like - not just an emotional sensation of, I feel so unburdened, but just a physical sensation, like, after a really great massage and maybe a shot of bourbon. You know, like. . . SPIEGEL: So 3 volts is where the doctors left her - 3 out of a possible 10. 5. The doctors needed to know how the setting would affect her over time. So they asked her to stay at a hotel near the hospital and check in after a couple of days. Megan remembers walking out of the hospital feeling like a completely new person. MEGAN: I found myself feeling more comfortable talking to strangers. Like, if I went to the store, you know, checking out with the cashier - you know, like, making little conversations wasn't hard for me anymore, which was an amazing thing because normally I was so caught up in my own obsessions, I just didn't have the ability to do that. But I just felt so much freer. It was like someone spring-cleaned out my brain and took out all the unnecessary thoughts. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SPIEGEL: And the first day was great. But then the next day she didn't sleep. And the following morning, her mind started racing. And for some reason, she felt the need to physically push at the world around her. MEGAN: Pushing my hands and legs against the floor and the wall, like, this need to get some tension out. SPIEGEL: When she got to the hospital the next day, her doctors told her that she'd had a submanic episode. So they had to turn her off - like, completely and totally off. MEGAN: So I actually left with nothing. And I remember feeling very deflated. And I thought this was just a fluke; I'm never going to feel that good again.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS\")VEDANTAM: In 1950, before he directed the film \"On The Waterfront,\" Elia Kazan made another dramatic thriller, a movie called \"Panic In The Streets. \" There's a reason you probably haven't heard of it - it isn't a great movie. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character) Herewith recorded is the story of a silent, savage menace, the events, incidents and emotions of the people who were a part of it, who found time running out as they looked into the face of mortal peril. VEDANTAM: The film tells the fictional story of a murder in New Orleans. When the police investigate, they find the victim suffered from a deadly, infectious disease, a version of the plague. Public health officials believe the killers may have contracted the disease as they carried the victim's body away. What follows is a race to track down the criminals and halt an epidemic - a collision of law enforcement and public health. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS\")RICHARD WIDMARK: (As Lt. Cmdr. Clinton Clint Reed M. D. ) If the killer is incubating pneumonic plague, he can start spreading it within 48 hours. PAUL DOUGLAS: (As Capt. Tom Warren) Forty-eight hours? WIDMARK: (As Lt. Cmdr. Clinton Clint Reed M. D. ) Yes. We have 48 hours. Shortly after that, you'll have the makings of an epidemic. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Today on the show, we'll bring you two of our favorite stories from 2016. They're both about chaos and our efforts to contain it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Our first story is about disease and panic, but it's also a story about psychology. To control an epidemic takes more than medical skill. It requires an understanding of human behavior and the forces that drive people to act in certain ways. We start in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia. A deadly crisis was sparking fear. News reports were filled with dramatic language and catastrophic warnings. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: The Ebola virus is back. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: An Ebola breakout in West Africa is, quote, \"totally out of control. \"UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: A catastrophe is unfolding - the world's deadliest outbreak of Ebola. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: Highly infectious, quick to kill, with no vaccine and no cure. VEDANTAM: The Ebola outbreak reached its peak in the fall of 2014. By the end of the year, it was subsiding. But then, in early 2015 in a poor part of Monrovia, there was a new outbreak, or cluster. And it led to the complex case we're focusing on today. ATHALIA CHRISTIE: I got a call from someone who said if your passport isn't in my office in the next two hours, you won't make your flight to Liberia. VEDANTAM: Athalia Christie is an epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC. She flew to Monrovia to help track and stop the outbreak. Lots of CDC officials joined her, like Frank Mahoney. FRANK MAHONEY: People were scared. It was a crisis. You could drive through the city and see people that were being left out on the street, you know, for people to come pick them up. VEDANTAM: Frank and Athalia told me how the case we're following today started. Police in Monrovia discovered a body in a warehouse - a young man dead with multiple stab wounds. CHRISTIE: Police were called in. A swab was taken as mandated by the official policy that any dead body be swabbed. So even though the police who arrived there initially thought they were investigating a murder, they did follow the procedures and have the body swabbed, at which point we were alerted because the test came back positive. VEDANTAM: Positive for Ebola. Once police identified the youth, they quickly realized they had a major problem on their hands. It turned out the young man was actually part of a large street gang. MAHONEY: Yeah, it was like a gang. One of them, for whatever reason, he got stabbed by the other members of the group. CHRISTIE: As we understand it, there was a knife fight. And we're not quite sure how it happened, but the friends turned on him. VEDANTAM: Just to review - a young man contracts Ebola, he gets in a fight and is stabbed repeatedly by fellow members of his gang. Ebola, remember, is highly contagious. Come into contact with an infected person's sweat or blood and you could fall sick, too. The gang had as many as 35 members. Each had connections far and wide across the city. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: And just like in that movie, \"Panic In The Streets,\" public health officials needed to quickly stop the outbreak from spreading. They needed to try and find every person who could have come into contact with the young man. It's a process called contact tracing. CHRISTIE: It's exceedingly difficult to do. If you tried to imagine constructing the last three weeks of your life and determining every single person that you came into contact with, whether it was casual contact or a family member who you saw every day, it's extraordinarily difficult to do. So we interview people multiple times. And we also talk to their family members and their friends to try to determine everyone who might have had any contact with this person during the time that they could've been infectious. VEDANTAM: Athalia and Frank knew the young man who died had sought medical treatment for his stab wounds. Had a health care worker sutured the young man's wounds and come into contact with his blood? Athalia visited a lot of clinics trying to track down facilities the young man may have visited. She paged through logbooks of patient names with no luck. Then she got to one clinic. CHRISTIE: And I took this big, dusty logbook and I opened it up and literally the page I opened it to - there's maybe 30 names to a page and I read down them, and there he was at the bottom of the first page. VEDANTAM: A health care worker at this clinic had sutured the young man's knife wounds. Athalia knew what she had to do. CHRISTIE: The most difficult part of these investigations come when you need to tell the clinicians and all of the staff who work in these health care facilities that someone with Ebola entered the facility. And I remember how nervous the individual was when I told him that the person he sutured had been positive for Ebola at the time. It's hard to imagine what he was going through. VEDANTAM: Can you recall what you told him and what he said? CHRISTIE: We were standing in the hallway, and I told him that - there's no easy way to tell anybody this. And so we just told him very matter-of-factly and that we needed to maintain daily contact and monitoring with him, coming in for treatment the moment that you have symptoms. And the reason I remember this so clearly is that he didn't do that. He was very reluctant to go to an Ebola treatment unit. VEDANTAM: The health care worker refused to be quarantined. He insisted he'd followed all safety procedures as he bandaged the young man's wounds. He told Athalia he'd get in touch if he started to have any symptoms. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Athalia knew there was a reason the health care worker had refused to come into an Ebola treatment unit. It had to do with a lack of trust in the system. In fact, the more Athalia and Frank saw, the more they realized that Ebola wasn't the only enemy they were fighting in Monrovia. They were dealing with an epidemic of mistrust. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: After a long history of civil war and corruption, a lot of people in Liberia simply didn't trust the government or international organizations. When Ebola broke out, the government's first response was to try and control it using coercion, cordoning off sections of towns. It created panic. MAHONEY: The government had attempted involuntary quarantine, and they had a really bad experience in the slums of Monrovia. And so we talked about, you know, is this a viable strategy? And we all agreed, no. We can't use involuntary quarantine. This is not something that's going to build trust in the community. It's not a way to manage the outbreak. VEDANTAM: People also worried that if they did go into quarantine, they would never come out. Athalia pointed to the construction of one of the largest Ebola treatment units in Liberia. CHRISTIE: And it was chaotic and difficult, and they built it all and they forgot to put an exit in. They didn't build an exit because we weren't thinking about survivors at that time. And although this was many months later, many people, understandably so, thought that going to an Ebola treatment unit meant that you would not come home. VEDANTAM: Dealing with mistrust, the public health officials knew, was central as they began to trace all the leads of this complex case. As Athalia had been tracking down the health care worker, Frank had been pursuing a different strand of the investigation - tracking down the members of the young man's gang. MAHONEY: This was a community that was not on the best terms with the government. You know, they were very suspicious of the government. CHRISTIE: So it really is a trust-building exercise to go into this community to piece together all these pieces of the story. VEDANTAM: Very quickly, Frank and Athalia realized they were in over their heads. They needed help. MAHONEY: So when we did the investigation, I went with this Liberian. . . CHRISTIE: Fantastic Liberian epidemiologist. . . MAHONEY: . . . A person named Mosoka Fallah. CHRISTIE: . . . Mosoka Fallah. MOSOKA FALLAH: I am Mosoka P. Fallah. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)FALLAH: As a Liberian, Mosoka Fallah understood things far better than the Americans. He also understood the horrors of Ebola firsthand. The disease had killed his sister. Mosoka's first order of business was to help track down the young men in the gang. Surprisingly, they weren't hard to find. But they were scared, scared that the police, who were still investigating the case as a homicide, would arrest them for their role in the knife fight. FALLAH: The police wanted to go in. However, if we allow the police to go in, the gangster will all escape. And we'll have pretty close to 35 young men who are all high-risk contact on the loose. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS\")VEDANTAM: This is similar to what happened in \"Panic In The Streets. \"(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character) Wait a minute. Now wait a minute. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #3: (As character) Wait for what? Somebody else to die? FALLAH: Frank suggested that there should be no arrest. VEDANTAM: Mosoka says Frank sat down with the police. He told them that any investigation of the murder would send gang members into hiding and potentially spread Ebola further. FALLAH: If you allow the Ebola team to go in and negotiate so that we can have the contact and the police agreed and the police withdrew their arrest, and that's how we went in to negotiate. VEDANTAM: And this, everyone told us, is what allowed public health officials to start talking to the young men in the gang. So to recap - public health officials had tracked down the health care worker who treated the young man and identified all the people they could tell the young man had come into contact with. The epidemiologists quickly found themselves staring at a growing web. There were three important strands. First, the young men in the gang would have to be persuaded to enter an Ebola quarantine facility for 21 days. Second, there was a woman running a drug house who was connected to the gang. Gang members were in and out of her home all the time. Most worrisome, the public health officials heard the woman was sick, and they thought that she might have Ebola. FALLAH: She had had diarrhea for two days, and she was getting sick. VEDANTAM: Finally, there was one member of the gang they could not track down. During the fight, this man had held down the stabbing victim as the blades came out and the blood splattered. And now, Frank and others found he'd run away. What was his name? MAHONEY: His name, ironically, was Time Bomb. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Coming up, how to stop the outbreak and find Time Bomb. You're listening to HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. This is NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. This week, we're talking about chaos, how we struggle to control it and why it might sometimes be best to embrace it. The first story we're telling is about a dangerous kind of chaos in a poor slum in Liberia in 2015. There had been a murder connected to a gang. The victim's body tested positive for Ebola. And now epidemiologists were in a race against time to stop another outbreak. There were three fires to put out. An accomplice to the murder, ironically named Time Bomb, had gone missing. The rest of the gang had been identified, but they were reluctant to be quarantined. And then, there was the woman known as Drug Mama (ph). She was the godmother of a drug den frequented by members of the gang. She was in her 30s and appeared to have symptoms that suggested Ebola. If Ebola took hold in her drug den, it would spread very quickly through the community. Frank and Mosoka realized they had to quickly run a test to get Drug Mama diagnosed, but they anticipated problems. FALLAH: Our dilemma was, how do we approach her such that she accepts us to do an Ebola test? VEDANTAM: The mere mention of Ebola was sending people into a panic. If they told her they were worried she had Ebola, would she vanish and go underground? They didn't want to take the chance. So rather than take her into confidence, they decided to trick Drug Mama. It wasn't ideal, but they were dealing with a crisis. They had to improvise. FALLAH: So Frank being the smart guy he is, we stop at a pharmacy and we brought her malaria medicine. And we went there that night and Frank said, I heard you are not so well, so we brought you some medicine. This is around 9 p. m. She said, yes. So Frank said, take this medicine. I will come back tomorrow and check on you. And so the goal was the next morning, we would ask for her blood to go check if she had malaria and then we would run the Ebola test. VEDANTAM: The trick worked, up to a point. The problem was the next morning when they took Drug Mama to the hospital to get her blood drawn, they had to tell health care workers at the hospital what was going on so everyone would take proper precautions. A nurse got scared when they told her they wanted to test for Ebola. Drug Mama noticed the nurse acting oddly. FALLAH: And then she suspected something else, the Drug Mama left and went back home and became angry with us. VEDANTAM: Mosoka and Frank realized the trickery was backfiring. So they tried bribery. FALLAH: We sat down with her, we negotiated. And we told her we'd give her $100 U. S. if she allowed us to do a blood draw at her house. So we took the blood and at 7 p. m. that night, we got a response that she was negative and we all went to bed breathing a sigh of relief. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Frank and Mosoka turned their focus to the second strand in the web - the young men in the gang. Patiently, they explained to the young men that they would be safe from police harassment in the Ebola treatment unit. MAHONEY: We worked it out with them. We made a - we worked out an arrangement where they - if they agreed to come in to the isolation facility. You know, the CDC, I think we ended up paying their families some support costs because they were no longer able to earn money for their families. And the government provided the families with food and stuff. So it worked out really well. VEDANTAM: But even this was not enough. It turned out some of the young men were drug addicts. Frank realized he had to keep asking the government to bend the rules in the Ebola treatment unit, or ETU. MAHONEY: I told the government that we had to anticipate that some of these young men may be drug users, and they may go into withdrawal if we put them in the ETU. And in fact, that was the case. About two to three days later, there were some of them getting agitated. And somehow, they found a way to support their needs for drugs. VEDANTAM: Did you have to do some of that to help them get what they needed to keep them in this facility where they could be quarantined? MAHONEY: No. I didn't - the CDC didn't pay for that or do that. But the government found a way for the community to support them. So they were doing that. VEDANTAM: But in some ways, it's sort of an awkward situation for the government because in some ways you're asking the government to sort of look the other way while someone's doing something illegal here. MAHONEY: Yeah. I think that they - at the same time, it'd be like any withdrawal. They needed treatment. It wasn't a conventional treatment, that's for sure. VEDANTAM: It was odd for public health officials to be sanctioning illegal drug use. But again, when you're in the middle of an unfolding catastrophe, you sometimes have to bend the rules. Even though CDC wasn't actually supplying anyone drugs, the arrangement produced lots of double takes. One day, a Liberian government minister turned to Frank during a discussion and joked about the backdoor drug channel. MAHONEY: And he says, and I understand that CDC is providing them with the marijuana. And I said, excuse me, sir. I said, I'd like to correct that. I said, CDC is not providing the marijuana, but we're providing the cocaine. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Incredibly, the epidemiologists actually managed to quarantine the gang members. These were young men who no one thought would listen to the authorities. But by reposing trust in them and treating the young men as partners, the public health officials had found a solution that seemed to work better than coercion or trickery. Still, this wasn't the end. There was a third strand of the web they had to track down - Time Bomb. FALLAH: Time Bomb became very elusive. We could not find Time Bomb. VEDANTAM: At first, gang members did not want to tell Mosoka or Frank where Time Bomb was. FALLAH: But as we built friendship and rapport with the other criminals, one of them took us to his house. VEDANTAM: There, they found a young man, a young woman and a baby. The epidemiologists asked the young man if he was Time Bomb. FALLAH: He said, I'm not Time Bomb. Time Bomb is gone out. I'm his younger brother. But if he comes back, I will let you know. And I said, OK. Thank you very much. VEDANTAM: It was at this point that Mosoka and Frank did something very kind and very wise that led to a breakthrough in the case. FALLAH: The wife had a young baby. And I remember giving the wife a hundred dollars and said, go and buy milk for the baby. Feed the baby, and we'll take of you. VEDANTAM: Something changed in the young man's demeanor. FALLAH: After I did that, he turned to me and said to me, I am Time Bomb. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Frank and Mosoka told Time Bomb and his wife that they would be back that night. They promised they would return with more food. FALLAH: Frank came to me with the food and said, Mosoka, we need to go to meet this guy. This was in the ghetto. MAHONEY: I went with Mosoka. And it was, like, 10 o'clock at night. FALLAH: There was no electricity. This place was pitch black. We had to go and drive through the grass. This was, like, a slum community. It is known to have gangsters. And that's why Frank was emphasizing that we had to keep our word. They had to trust us. VEDANTAM: This was the key. MAHONEY: So we brought food to him and his family - I think a couple sacks of rice and things. FALLAH: As we walked towards them and they saw us coming with rice on our shoulder, for some reason they trusted us. And they came to the car and helped us take the rice. VEDANTAM: Frank and Mosoka gently asked Time Bomb whether he was willing to come to the Ebola treatment facility to be quarantined. Time Bomb said he wasn't ready to do that. Frank and Mosoka said they understood, that they were willing to trust him to do the right thing. FALLAH: If you get sick, you call us. And he said, I will do that. I trust you guys. MAHONEY: And so I think it was a matter of building up a trust and comfort level for him to talk to us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: In the end, none of the young gang members contracted Ebola, not even Time Bomb. The cluster did not spread in the ghetto. Drug Mama recovered from her illness. Only one person connected with the cluster was affected. The medical worker who'd sutured up the young man's wounds - the one that went into hiding after Athalia talked to him - he came down with Ebola-related symptoms. Eventually, he did seek treatment, but it was too late. CHRISTIE: He died, unfortunately, in the Ebola treatment unit. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. Today on the show, we're talking about chaos and all of the different strategies we use to cope with it. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS\")VEDANTAM: We started today's episode with a 1950 movie, \"Panic In The Streets. \" At the end of that movie, the hero, a public health worker, ends up in a warehouse with the criminals who are carrying the deadly plague. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS\")WIDMARK: (As Lt. Cmdr. Clinton Clint Reed M. D. ) I'm a doctor, and I can cure you. VEDANTAM: He pleads for them to hand over their guns. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS\")WIDMARK: (As Lt. Cmdr. Clinton Clint Reed M. D. ) Come out now and surrender, and I promise nothing will happen to you. VEDANTAM: But. . . (SOUNDBITE OF GUNFIRE)VEDANTAM: . . . They get into a climactic shootout and the criminals are killed. (SOUNDBITE OF GUNFIRE)VEDANTAM: The public health workers in Liberia never solved things with guns. And really, when it came down to it, Athalia says, they achieved some of their best results without coercion or trickery. Building those invisible but very real bonds of trust took time, but it was essential to stopping an outbreak. CHRISTIE: When it comes down to it, what we were asking people to do, either to trust the health care system or to trust the government enough to agree to this voluntary, precautionary isolation, that's an extraordinarily difficult thing to do. You're asking people to leave their friends and family for 21 days, or we were asking people to change their burial customs. And it's difficult. It can sound simple, and I know that I spoke to people here who would say, I don't understand. Why can't they just change the way they bury the dead or change the way they care for their family members if they're sick? But as a mother, I can't imagine not touching my child if he was sick and not trying to provide comfort. So it's really understanding what it is that's driving people. You have to understand their context, their concerns and their needs. I think it's about interpersonal relationships. You have to be honest and straightforward about what you need and why. And most importantly, I think you need to be human. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: So much of being human is chaos. The doctors in Liberia found an innovative way to try and fight it. In fact, that's what we usually do when it comes to chaos. We try to control it, to manage it. If you're a parent, you've told your kids a thousand times, your room is a mess. Clean it up. Managers tell their employees to get organized. In the United States, we elect presidents to go clean up Washington. In the next half of our show, we explore a very different idea - what happens if we treat chaos as our friend instead of our enemy? Tim Harford believes we should do just that. He's the author of \"Messy: The Power Of Disorder To Transform Our Lives. \" He joined us in 2016 for a live taping. We were just blocks from the White House at NPR's Weekend in Washington, an event that brings together public radio fans and supporters. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)VEDANTAM: Tim Harford, welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. TIM HARFORD: Thank you very much, Shankar. VEDANTAM: I want to begin by playing you a piece of music, Tim. (SOUNDBITE OF KEITH JARRETT COMPOSITION)VEDANTAM: How did that piece of music come about? What's the story? HARFORD: It's beautiful, isn't it? Two of my children were born to that. It was played by Keith Jarrett, who was a great jazz pianist, in 1975 in Cologne. And if you had been there two or three hours before the concert, you would not have expected things to go well. Keith Jarrett had just refused to play. And the reason he had refused to play is because he had arrived on stage, met the piano. He was supposed to be - it's completely improvised, by the way. The whole thing was going to be improvised - met this piano and realized that there'd been a mistake. And the thing was literally unplayable. It was out of tune. Black keys were sticking. The pedals didn't work. The upper register of the keyboard was harsh and tinny because all the felt had worn away. And most importantly, it was too small, so it didn't have enough volume to actually reach the back of the Cologne auditorium. And so, of course, he refused to play. And the organizer of the concert, who was this young German girl - she's just 17 years old - desperately tried to fix the piano, to replace the piano. She managed to get it somewhat in tune, but basically she couldn't really improve on it. And she couldn't get it replaced. And so the only option she had was to beg Keith Jarrett to play. And of course, he saw this teenager, thought of the 1,400 people who were about to show up and listen to the concert and said to her, never forget, only for you. And he went on stage. And he and his producer recorded the concert because they wanted documentary evidence of what a musical catastrophe sounds like so they could play it to future promoters to tell them to do a good job and get a proper piano. But in fact, it's a masterpiece. It's Keith Jarrett's most popular work. In fact, it's the best-selling jazz album in history, solo jazz album in history, and the best-selling piano album in history is \"The Koln Concert. \" And the surprising thing is that all the adjustments that Jarrett had to make to cope with this bad piano made the music better. So he avoided the harsh upper registers. He stuck to the middle of the keyboard. That makes it sound very soothing. But he also had to compensate for the fact that the piano was so quiet. So he had these rolling, repetitive riffs in the bass to try to get some resonance. He also just stood up and pounded down on the keys. So you can hear him moaning in frustration during the concert. He's hating it. But it is amazing. (SOUNDBITE OF KEITH JARRETT COMPOSITION)HARFORD: And that combination of the peacefulness and the dynamism makes this electrifying piece of music. So he did not expect that a bad piano would produce a great concert, but in fact it did. And the argument in my book is very often we're faced with the unplayable piano and actually we produce something great out of it. VEDANTAM: You have a number of examples besides Keith Jarrett about how disruptions and inconveniences and surprises can sometimes have paradoxically good effects on us, even though we all try to avoid those disruptions. You talk about commuters, for example, who suddenly have to find a new way to work or scientists who are working on so many projects that they are discombobulated because they don't know what they're working on. In many of these cases, you find that disorder and confusion could actually be helpful. HARFORD: Yeah. So with - in the case of commuters, there was a transport strike in London a couple years ago - shut down not all but most of the London Underground stations for 48 hours. So not a long strike, but most commuters in London use public transport. It's not really set up for the car. But you could travel on the bus. There are over-ground trains, or you could use some of the tube lines that were not shut down - there are various other options. And the economists who studied this got hold of the data as to the trips that people were making. They identified people who took the same route to work every single day. Well, there's a technical term for this. It's called commuters. (LAUGHTER)HARFORD: And you would think that these are the people who have absolutely perfected their route to work. Surely commuters, they know every step. They know where to stand on the platform, which track - and yet the economists found, looking at the people who took the same route to work every day who then changed their route during the strike, thousands of them - about 5 percent - thousands upon thousands stayed with the new route. So these are people - this is the optimum population for having honed their route to perfection. And yet 1 in 20 of them discovered that, when they were forced to find a new way, they found a better way. And I think that that's quite a common situation. We get into particular habits, whether it's creative or whether it's just trying to get to work - we get into a particular habit. We are knocked off course. And very often, of course, our original habit was the right way to do things and we go back. But often enough to be useful, we find that the new way of doing things is actually better all along. And if only we'd been forced into it, we would have discovered that years ago. VEDANTAM: One of the things I want to do in this conversation is try and tease apart when messiness can be our friend and when it can be our enemy. There's a reason many of us try and avoid messiness. It's because messiness causes delays. It causes disruptions. You're ending up - you end up being late for some things. And I'm wondering as I read some of the examples in your book whether it was the case that messiness helps people who actually have a base of preparation. So in other words, Keith Jarrett - he's a professional musician. He's very gifted. He's practiced and he's learned the rules of how to play a proper piano for years and years and years. You place me before that piano and what you're going to hear is not genius. What you're going to hear is just a mess. And the reason Keith Jarrett could adapt was because he had the base of knowing the rules to now say, I can throw out the rulebook and create something brilliant. HARFORD: Yeah. I think that's absolutely right, Shankar. And is it OK? Can I open a big bag of complexity science on you? Is that all right? VEDANTAM: Absolutely. HARFORD: OK. So basically, if you are trying to solve a very complex problem, we have various algorithms that try to solve this. And I'll come to the question of skill in a second. The algorithms - computer algorithms searching for solutions in a very, very complex problem space - one possible approach is to look for step-by-step improvements. So that's the equivalent of skill. You are looking for step-by-step improvements to get from a bad solution to a better solution and a better one and a better one and a better one, and eventually you find the perfect solution. It turns out that way of looking at complex problems doesn't usually work. And the reason is the algorithm, as it looks for these small improvements, gets stuck. So these algorithms that search for solutions - they work much better if you add random shocks - lots of different ways to do that. But basically, for most that this kind of problem I'm discussing, a computer scientist would approach it by saying, we're going to have the step-by-step quest for improvements, but we're also going to have lots of randomness, lots of shocks, just keep knocking the algorithm off course because then it won't get stuck. So now we come back to Keith Jarrett. He's like an algorithm that searching for step-by-step improvements. He's a great musician. He's always looking for the perfect concert. Clearly, he's a very creative person because he's improvising every night, but he always starts with a good piano - always. And then this one night where they say, you know what, Keith? Twelve of these notes don't work. And you should probably avoid most of that part. And that thing with the pedals, don't do that either. And - but then he sits down at the piano and then his skill kicks in. And he's looking for the incremental improvements, he's looking for a path to find great music. And he finds it. So yes, you need skill, but the random shocks help. VEDANTAM: So for all the children who are listening to this podcast, I want to make clear that you're not saying that every time your parent tells you to clean up the room, you should just say Tim Harford says I shouldn't. (LAUGHTER)HARFORD: Well, I have to say since writing the book, I have stopped asking my children to clear up their room. (LAUGHTER)HARFORD: And the reason is I read an amazing study that had been conducted by two British psychologists, Alex Haslam and Craig Knight. What they did was - wasn't anything to do with children, but it was to do with clean desk policies. They got people to sit down and work in artificial office environments. You know, we've created an office for you. Here are some tasks. Sort this paper work, do these puzzles, handle these emails - regular sort of knowledge work and tasks, standard stuff. And they measured how well people did. And there were four different arms to this experiment. People were randomized into different arms. So in one case, the office was very, very minimalist - just a chair, you know, pencil, paper, no distractions. People did fine in that. They didn't really like it. On average, suits some people. The second approach - there were more decorations in the office, there were pot plants, there were posters - you know, some distractions, but it felt friendlier. People liked that more. But here's the real kicker to this research. The other two treatments - the other two parts of the research - first, the researcher said you can organize this office how you like. Bring in the posters, send away the posters, put the pot plants where you like or if you want, we'll take the pot plants away for you, however you want. People loved that. They got so much more done. They felt happier. They were more productive - significantly more productive. In the fourth part of the trial, they did that. They said arrange it however you like. And then the experimenter came in and said I'm sorry, this isn't appropriate for the experiment and rearranged everything, put it back the way it was in the second part of the trial where people had been perfectly happy to work in these decorated offices. What they weren't happy with was having someone come in, override their decisions, take away their control, take away their autonomy. They felt physically sick. And they hated everything about it. They hated the work. (LAUGHTER)HARFORD: They hated the space, they hated the company that was hosting the space. And they absolutely hated the experimenter. And after that, I made two vows to myself; No. 1, if I'm ever a boss - nobody should make me a boss, by the way - if I'm ever a boss, I will never impose a clean desk policy. And No. 2, me and my wife, we kind of are the boss in our house. And I no longer ask my children to tidy their rooms. And do you know what? We don't argue about it as much and the rooms are kind of as messy as they ever were. It hasn't made any difference to the physical state of the rooms. There's just a little bit more peace. VEDANTAM: All right. So that's a perfect segue to what I want to talk about next because I actually want to talk about office space and how we organize office spaces. And in fact, I have a clip from the cult-classic movie \"Office Space,\" which I'm going to play for you. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"OFFICE SPACE\")GREY COLE: (As Bill) Hi, Milton. What's happening? I'm going to have to ask you to go ahead and move your desk again. STEPHEN ROOT: (As Milton) No. COLE: (As Bill) So if you could go ahead and get it as far back against that wall as possible, that would be great. . . ROOT: (As Milton) No, no because I was told that. . . COLE: (As Bill) . . . That way we'll have some room for some of these boxes and things we need to put in here. ROOT: (As Milton) There's no room. COLE: (As Bill) And, oh, there it is. ROOT: (As Milton) What? COLE: (As Bill) Here. Let me just go ahead and get that from you - great. So if you could just get to that as soon as possible that would be terrific, OK? Thanks a bunch, Milton. Bye. ROOT: (As Milton) OK. But I could set the building on fire. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: So I take it, Tim, that you are not a fan of fascist office managers. But you do also tell the story in the book about Steve Jobs at Pixar and some of the ideas he had about how to organize office space to make people more collaborative and some of the ways that might have backfired. HARFORD: Yeah, the Pixar story I think is fascinating. So Steve Jobs, majority shareholder at Pixar, had a big hand in designing the Pixar building. And one of his big ideas is we are going to make all the bathrooms in this building in the middle of the building. We're just going to have two big restrooms - a pair of restrooms in the heart of the building. And what that will do is everyone would come together brought together by a shared human need to urinate. (LAUGHTER)HARFORD: And there will be serendipitous interactions and that's going to be great. And, you know, I'm all in favor of serendipitous interaction. We silo ourselves off. That's a major theme in the book. But maybe Steve had taken this idea too far. What's interesting, though, is Steve Jobs had this reputation as being brilliant but, you know, a real control freak's control freak and just ordering people what to do. But there was a rebellion in Pixar led by pregnant women who said, I know this sounds like a great idea on paper, Mr. Jobs. But I need to go to the restroom three times an hour and you've just made the restroom 10 minutes away from my desk. Do the math. And yeah. . . (LAUGHTER)HARFORD: It's not going to work. And Steve Jobs did an amazing thing - he backed down, said, OK, I'm wrong. I will find another way to create serendipitous interactions and you can have your restrooms all over the Pixar offices, which is where they are. And reading a recent book about Pixar by Ed Catmull, who is one of the bosses there, it is apparently absolute chaos in there in a beautiful, beautiful way. So the building is just what you would expect from Steve Jobs. It looks gorgeous. It's sort of exposed steel girders and brickwork and wood and all of that. But the desk space - the Pixar designers build Disney castles and underground and - you know, it looks like a set of \"Finding Nemo\" and \"Toy Story\" and \"WALL-E\" all put into one. It's a great collaborative space that people feel they have control over. It looks like a total mess. VEDANTAM: In other words, it looks like your children's rooms. HARFORD: Yeah, maybe slightly more creative than my children's rooms, but my children aspire towards the whole Disney castle thing. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: Tim Harford comes from Britain. We're having this chat in the United States. In both countries, there have been enormous political upheavals recently. When we come back, I'm going to ask Tim about messiness in public life and in democracy. Stay with us. (APPLAUSE)VEDANTAM: You're listening to HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. This is NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. With Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, Tim, we've had populist revolutions on both sides of the Atlantic that reject the advice of scientists and economists, experts in general. Democracy, of course, is famously messy. Could you remind people why it's such a good thing? HARFORD: I think in both cases I try to remind myself of Keith Jarrett's unplayable piano, actually. To me, the Brexit vote felt like an unplayable piano. The expert consensus in the U. K. was that this was not a very good idea. The British people disagreed with the experts, and so they voted to leave. And so I thought to myself, OK, well, this is going to pose all kinds of obstacles and all kinds of difficulties. In what ways might they actually turn to our advantage? So not to try to be foolishly optimistic in the face of disappointment - well, what was disappointment for a lot of people - but to say, well, there's an opportunity in everything. What are the solutions that we look for going forward? And I think that's an important thing to bear in mind whenever we're faced with an obstacle. It's easy to get frustrated, but we should then say, OK, how is this going to make me stronger? How is this going to make my society stronger? What are the solutions that are going to come out of disappointment? There is a section in the book about Donald Trump's campaigning style. And I said he is a master of using chaos to his advantage. One of the interesting parallels between Trump's campaign and the Brexit vote in the U. K. is that the Brexit vote in the U. K. - there were two different leave campaigns, and they hated each other. They were taking legal action against each other. They actively contradicted each other. This may sound familiar. I don't know. You would think that that's a disadvantage. Turns out to be an advantage because they were able to coalesce two different groups of supporters who wanted different things and they just tuned into the things they liked to hear. Meanwhile, the opposition, the remain vote in the U. K. , the Democrats in the United States, they weren't sure what to criticize because there was no coherence on the other side. So there was no target to aim at. Trump, by the way, is not the only person to use this. The use of chaos as a weapon works perfectly well in war time. I talk about Erwin Rommel, the great German tank commander. It works in business. Jeff Bezos at Amazon explicitly targeted we're going to move fast, we're going to make a mess. We don't understand what's going on, but at least Barnes & Noble are more confused than we are. (LAUGHTER)HARFORD: And as long as Barnes and Noble are more confused than we are, we're doing OK. He was very, very clear about this. And it has proved very effective. VEDANTAM: I want to talk about another example of messiness in public life. And I want you to watch this video, which describes a very famous speech, and I want to ask the question right after it. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)MARTIN LUTHER KING JR: We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating For Whites Only. (APPLAUSE)KING: We cannot be satisfied as long as a negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. VEDANTAM: So as you can see from that speech, Tim, Martin Luther King is reading from a script. And he has a nice line there, but it's a writerly line. But at a certain point in this speech, he decides to leave the script behind and turn his eyes to the audience. And here's what we see after that. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)KING: I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up, live out the true meaning of its creed. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal. (APPLAUSE)VEDANTAM: Talk about this for a second because you talk about this speech in the book and you talk about this moment when King left his notes behind and essentially stepped off the ledge of what he knew and what he was certain about and just rode the wave of what the crowd was telling him and what he was feeling. HARFORD: He had prepared that speech meticulously the night before. He stayed up very late. He was operating on a number of constraints. It was quite a tight time schedule. The eyes of the world were on him. He knew that. There were also various political constraints about what was his response going to be to the civil rights legislation? Would he embrace it? Would he criticize it as not going far enough? Other civil rights leaders were making different claims. He had to balance all of those. So he took great care. The result was a speech that was well-crafted but a little bit lifeless. And so six or seven minutes into the speech, he looks down at the script and there's a line there that's terrible. And it must've been terrible when he wrote it, but he looked and he realized it's not working. It's now let us go back to our communities as members for the society for creative dissatisfaction. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Oh, my God. HARFORD: He doesn't say it. (LAUGHTER)HARFORD: He says instead go back to Alabama. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)KING: Go back to Alabama. Go back to South Carolina. Go back to Georgia. Go back to Louisiana. Go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities. HARFORD: And there's another pause, and the people behind him on the stage know he's not on the script anymore. And Mahalia Jackson, great gospel singer, yells out to him because she's heard him talking in church about this dream. She yells out tell them about the dream, Martin. And then he starts to improvise. And that is when he touches the crowd. VEDANTAM: I want to wrap by asking you a few personal questions. I understand that after writing this book, every time you find yourself in a mess and you turn to your wife for comfort, she now reminds you that being in a mess is a good thing. (LAUGHTER)HARFORD: Yeah. Actually just two days ago, Shankar, I was trying to check into a hotel at Dublin Airport at midnight knowing that I was going to have to get up very early in the morning and fly and then come over to Washington to speak to you and I - just desperate to get that little bit of sleep that I would be able to get. And when I showed up at the airport hotel, they didn't have my reservation and they were full - so nowhere to sleep. And as I toured Dublin in a taxi looking for hotels that were open, my - I could just hear my wife's voice in my head saying this is making you smarter, Tim. This is what do you say. (LAUGHTER)HARFORD: This is making you more creative. So, you know, I've really sort of created a rod to beat myself with. But I think it is - it's important. Look; sometimes bad news is just bad news. Sometimes an obstacle is just an obstacle. And there is no good side to be found. But very often when things go wrong, we need to stop and say, well, what could come out of this? Brian Eno, a musician who I interviewed for the book - he worked with David Bowie, worked with U2, Coldplay, an amazing producer. He described his creative strategy as it is a little bit similar to being in an accident. When you're in an accident, you get that sudden feeling of you paying attention to everything because there's this tremendous sense of threat. Well - but that attention - the threat is bad. The accident is bad, but the attention is good. And so he puts the musicians he works with in stressful situations so they feel almost like they've been in an accident. And suddenly, he has their attention. I think it's worth bearing in mind even if the accident is a problem, even if the obstacle is a problem, the sudden attention, the sudden feeling of being present may lead us to some kind of solution. And that's worth hanging onto. When everything is perfect, when everything is tidy, we're on autopilot, and we're not necessarily living in the moment. We're not necessarily paying attention. And that's a problem for us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Tim Harford, thank you for joining me today. HARFORD: Thanks, Shankar.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST:  This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS\") VEDANTAM: In 1950, before he directed the film \"On The Waterfront,\" Elia Kazan made another dramatic thriller, a movie called \"Panic In The Streets. \" There's a reason you probably haven't heard of it - it isn't a great movie. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character) Herewith recorded is the story of a silent, savage menace, the events, incidents and emotions of the people who were a part of it, who found time running out as they looked into the face of mortal peril. VEDANTAM: The film tells the fictional story of a murder in New Orleans. When the police investigate, they find the victim suffered from a deadly, infectious disease, a version of the plague. Public health officials believe the killers may have contracted the disease as they carried the victim's body away. What follows is a race to track down the criminals and halt an epidemic - a collision of law enforcement and public health. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS\") RICHARD WIDMARK: (As Lt. Cmdr. Clinton Clint Reed M. D. ) If the killer is incubating pneumonic plague, he can start spreading it within 48 hours. PAUL DOUGLAS: (As Capt. Tom Warren) Forty-eight hours? WIDMARK: (As Lt. Cmdr. Clinton Clint Reed M. D. ) Yes. We have 48 hours. Shortly after that, you'll have the makings of an epidemic. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Today on the show, we'll bring you two of our favorite stories from 2016. They're both about chaos and our efforts to contain it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Our first story is about disease and panic, but it's also a story about psychology. To control an epidemic takes more than medical skill. It requires an understanding of human behavior and the forces that drive people to act in certain ways. We start in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia. A deadly crisis was sparking fear. News reports were filled with dramatic language and catastrophic warnings. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: The Ebola virus is back. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: An Ebola breakout in West Africa is, quote, \"totally out of control. \" UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: A catastrophe is unfolding - the world's deadliest outbreak of Ebola. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: Highly infectious, quick to kill, with no vaccine and no cure. VEDANTAM: The Ebola outbreak reached its peak in the fall of 2014. By the end of the year, it was subsiding. But then, in early 2015 in a poor part of Monrovia, there was a new outbreak, or cluster. And it led to the complex case we're focusing on today. ATHALIA CHRISTIE: I got a call from someone who said if your passport isn't in my office in the next two hours, you won't make your flight to Liberia. VEDANTAM: Athalia Christie is an epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC. She flew to Monrovia to help track and stop the outbreak. Lots of CDC officials joined her, like Frank Mahoney. FRANK MAHONEY: People were scared. It was a crisis. You could drive through the city and see people that were being left out on the street, you know, for people to come pick them up. VEDANTAM: Frank and Athalia told me how the case we're following today started. Police in Monrovia discovered a body in a warehouse - a young man dead with multiple stab wounds. CHRISTIE: Police were called in. A swab was taken as mandated by the official policy that any dead body be swabbed. So even though the police who arrived there initially thought they were investigating a murder, they did follow the procedures and have the body swabbed, at which point we were alerted because the test came back positive. VEDANTAM: Positive for Ebola. Once police identified the youth, they quickly realized they had a major problem on their hands. It turned out the young man was actually part of a large street gang. MAHONEY: Yeah, it was like a gang. One of them, for whatever reason, he got stabbed by the other members of the group. CHRISTIE: As we understand it, there was a knife fight. And we're not quite sure how it happened, but the friends turned on him. VEDANTAM: Just to review - a young man contracts Ebola, he gets in a fight and is stabbed repeatedly by fellow members of his gang. Ebola, remember, is highly contagious. Come into contact with an infected person's sweat or blood and you could fall sick, too. The gang had as many as 35 members. Each had connections far and wide across the city. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: And just like in that movie, \"Panic In The Streets,\" public health officials needed to quickly stop the outbreak from spreading. They needed to try and find every person who could have come into contact with the young man. It's a process called contact tracing. CHRISTIE: It's exceedingly difficult to do. If you tried to imagine constructing the last three weeks of your life and determining every single person that you came into contact with, whether it was casual contact or a family member who you saw every day, it's extraordinarily difficult to do. So we interview people multiple times. And we also talk to their family members and their friends to try to determine everyone who might have had any contact with this person during the time that they could've been infectious. VEDANTAM: Athalia and Frank knew the young man who died had sought medical treatment for his stab wounds. Had a health care worker sutured the young man's wounds and come into contact with his blood? Athalia visited a lot of clinics trying to track down facilities the young man may have visited. She paged through logbooks of patient names with no luck. Then she got to one clinic. CHRISTIE: And I took this big, dusty logbook and I opened it up and literally the page I opened it to - there's maybe 30 names to a page and I read down them, and there he was at the bottom of the first page. VEDANTAM: A health care worker at this clinic had sutured the young man's knife wounds. Athalia knew what she had to do. CHRISTIE: The most difficult part of these investigations come when you need to tell the clinicians and all of the staff who work in these health care facilities that someone with Ebola entered the facility. And I remember how nervous the individual was when I told him that the person he sutured had been positive for Ebola at the time. It's hard to imagine what he was going through. VEDANTAM: Can you recall what you told him and what he said? CHRISTIE: We were standing in the hallway, and I told him that - there's no easy way to tell anybody this. And so we just told him very matter-of-factly and that we needed to maintain daily contact and monitoring with him, coming in for treatment the moment that you have symptoms. And the reason I remember this so clearly is that he didn't do that. He was very reluctant to go to an Ebola treatment unit. VEDANTAM: The health care worker refused to be quarantined. He insisted he'd followed all safety procedures as he bandaged the young man's wounds. He told Athalia he'd get in touch if he started to have any symptoms. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Athalia knew there was a reason the health care worker had refused to come into an Ebola treatment unit. It had to do with a lack of trust in the system. In fact, the more Athalia and Frank saw, the more they realized that Ebola wasn't the only enemy they were fighting in Monrovia. They were dealing with an epidemic of mistrust. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: After a long history of civil war and corruption, a lot of people in Liberia simply didn't trust the government or international organizations. When Ebola broke out, the government's first response was to try and control it using coercion, cordoning off sections of towns. It created panic. MAHONEY: The government had attempted involuntary quarantine, and they had a really bad experience in the slums of Monrovia. And so we talked about, you know, is this a viable strategy? And we all agreed, no. We can't use involuntary quarantine. This is not something that's going to build trust in the community. It's not a way to manage the outbreak. VEDANTAM: People also worried that if they did go into quarantine, they would never come out. Athalia pointed to the construction of one of the largest Ebola treatment units in Liberia. CHRISTIE: And it was chaotic and difficult, and they built it all and they forgot to put an exit in. They didn't build an exit because we weren't thinking about survivors at that time. And although this was many months later, many people, understandably so, thought that going to an Ebola treatment unit meant that you would not come home. VEDANTAM: Dealing with mistrust, the public health officials knew, was central as they began to trace all the leads of this complex case. As Athalia had been tracking down the health care worker, Frank had been pursuing a different strand of the investigation - tracking down the members of the young man's gang. MAHONEY: This was a community that was not on the best terms with the government. You know, they were very suspicious of the government. CHRISTIE: So it really is a trust-building exercise to go into this community to piece together all these pieces of the story. VEDANTAM: Very quickly, Frank and Athalia realized they were in over their heads. They needed help. MAHONEY: So when we did the investigation, I went with this Liberian. . . CHRISTIE: Fantastic Liberian epidemiologist. . . MAHONEY: . . . A person named Mosoka Fallah. CHRISTIE: . . . Mosoka Fallah. MOSOKA FALLAH: I am Mosoka P. Fallah. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FALLAH: As a Liberian, Mosoka Fallah understood things far better than the Americans. He also understood the horrors of Ebola firsthand. The disease had killed his sister. Mosoka's first order of business was to help track down the young men in the gang. Surprisingly, they weren't hard to find. But they were scared, scared that the police, who were still investigating the case as a homicide, would arrest them for their role in the knife fight. FALLAH: The police wanted to go in. However, if we allow the police to go in, the gangster will all escape. And we'll have pretty close to 35 young men who are all high-risk contact on the loose. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS\") VEDANTAM: This is similar to what happened in \"Panic In The Streets. \" (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character) Wait a minute. Now wait a minute. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #3: (As character) Wait for what? Somebody else to die? FALLAH: Frank suggested that there should be no arrest. VEDANTAM: Mosoka says Frank sat down with the police. He told them that any investigation of the murder would send gang members into hiding and potentially spread Ebola further. FALLAH: If you allow the Ebola team to go in and negotiate so that we can have the contact and the police agreed and the police withdrew their arrest, and that's how we went in to negotiate. VEDANTAM: And this, everyone told us, is what allowed public health officials to start talking to the young men in the gang. So to recap - public health officials had tracked down the health care worker who treated the young man and identified all the people they could tell the young man had come into contact with. The epidemiologists quickly found themselves staring at a growing web. There were three important strands. First, the young men in the gang would have to be persuaded to enter an Ebola quarantine facility for 21 days. Second, there was a woman running a drug house who was connected to the gang. Gang members were in and out of her home all the time. Most worrisome, the public health officials heard the woman was sick, and they thought that she might have Ebola. FALLAH: She had had diarrhea for two days, and she was getting sick. VEDANTAM: Finally, there was one member of the gang they could not track down. During the fight, this man had held down the stabbing victim as the blades came out and the blood splattered. And now, Frank and others found he'd run away. What was his name? MAHONEY: His name, ironically, was Time Bomb. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Coming up, how to stop the outbreak and find Time Bomb. You're listening to HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. This is NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. This week, we're talking about chaos, how we struggle to control it and why it might sometimes be best to embrace it. The first story we're telling is about a dangerous kind of chaos in a poor slum in Liberia in 2015. There had been a murder connected to a gang. The victim's body tested positive for Ebola. And now epidemiologists were in a race against time to stop another outbreak. There were three fires to put out. An accomplice to the murder, ironically named Time Bomb, had gone missing. The rest of the gang had been identified, but they were reluctant to be quarantined. And then, there was the woman known as Drug Mama (ph). She was the godmother of a drug den frequented by members of the gang. She was in her 30s and appeared to have symptoms that suggested Ebola. If Ebola took hold in her drug den, it would spread very quickly through the community. Frank and Mosoka realized they had to quickly run a test to get Drug Mama diagnosed, but they anticipated problems. FALLAH: Our dilemma was, how do we approach her such that she accepts us to do an Ebola test? VEDANTAM: The mere mention of Ebola was sending people into a panic. If they told her they were worried she had Ebola, would she vanish and go underground? They didn't want to take the chance. So rather than take her into confidence, they decided to trick Drug Mama. It wasn't ideal, but they were dealing with a crisis. They had to improvise. FALLAH: So Frank being the smart guy he is, we stop at a pharmacy and we brought her malaria medicine. And we went there that night and Frank said, I heard you are not so well, so we brought you some medicine. This is around 9 p. m. She said, yes. So Frank said, take this medicine. I will come back tomorrow and check on you. And so the goal was the next morning, we would ask for her blood to go check if she had malaria and then we would run the Ebola test. VEDANTAM: The trick worked, up to a point. The problem was the next morning when they took Drug Mama to the hospital to get her blood drawn, they had to tell health care workers at the hospital what was going on so everyone would take proper precautions. A nurse got scared when they told her they wanted to test for Ebola. Drug Mama noticed the nurse acting oddly. FALLAH: And then she suspected something else, the Drug Mama left and went back home and became angry with us. VEDANTAM: Mosoka and Frank realized the trickery was backfiring. So they tried bribery. FALLAH: We sat down with her, we negotiated. And we told her we'd give her $100 U. S. if she allowed us to do a blood draw at her house. So we took the blood and at 7 p. m. that night, we got a response that she was negative and we all went to bed breathing a sigh of relief. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Frank and Mosoka turned their focus to the second strand in the web - the young men in the gang. Patiently, they explained to the young men that they would be safe from police harassment in the Ebola treatment unit. MAHONEY: We worked it out with them. We made a - we worked out an arrangement where they - if they agreed to come in to the isolation facility. You know, the CDC, I think we ended up paying their families some support costs because they were no longer able to earn money for their families. And the government provided the families with food and stuff. So it worked out really well. VEDANTAM: But even this was not enough. It turned out some of the young men were drug addicts. Frank realized he had to keep asking the government to bend the rules in the Ebola treatment unit, or ETU. MAHONEY: I told the government that we had to anticipate that some of these young men may be drug users, and they may go into withdrawal if we put them in the ETU. And in fact, that was the case. About two to three days later, there were some of them getting agitated. And somehow, they found a way to support their needs for drugs. VEDANTAM: Did you have to do some of that to help them get what they needed to keep them in this facility where they could be quarantined? MAHONEY: No. I didn't - the CDC didn't pay for that or do that. But the government found a way for the community to support them. So they were doing that. VEDANTAM: But in some ways, it's sort of an awkward situation for the government because in some ways you're asking the government to sort of look the other way while someone's doing something illegal here. MAHONEY: Yeah. I think that they - at the same time, it'd be like any withdrawal. They needed treatment. It wasn't a conventional treatment, that's for sure. VEDANTAM: It was odd for public health officials to be sanctioning illegal drug use. But again, when you're in the middle of an unfolding catastrophe, you sometimes have to bend the rules. Even though CDC wasn't actually supplying anyone drugs, the arrangement produced lots of double takes. One day, a Liberian government minister turned to Frank during a discussion and joked about the backdoor drug channel. MAHONEY: And he says, and I understand that CDC is providing them with the marijuana. And I said, excuse me, sir. I said, I'd like to correct that. I said, CDC is not providing the marijuana, but we're providing the cocaine. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Incredibly, the epidemiologists actually managed to quarantine the gang members. These were young men who no one thought would listen to the authorities. But by reposing trust in them and treating the young men as partners, the public health officials had found a solution that seemed to work better than coercion or trickery. Still, this wasn't the end. There was a third strand of the web they had to track down - Time Bomb. FALLAH: Time Bomb became very elusive. We could not find Time Bomb. VEDANTAM: At first, gang members did not want to tell Mosoka or Frank where Time Bomb was. FALLAH: But as we built friendship and rapport with the other criminals, one of them took us to his house. VEDANTAM: There, they found a young man, a young woman and a baby. The epidemiologists asked the young man if he was Time Bomb. FALLAH: He said, I'm not Time Bomb. Time Bomb is gone out. I'm his younger brother. But if he comes back, I will let you know. And I said, OK. Thank you very much. VEDANTAM: It was at this point that Mosoka and Frank did something very kind and very wise that led to a breakthrough in the case. FALLAH: The wife had a young baby. And I remember giving the wife a hundred dollars and said, go and buy milk for the baby. Feed the baby, and we'll take of you. VEDANTAM: Something changed in the young man's demeanor. FALLAH: After I did that, he turned to me and said to me, I am Time Bomb. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Frank and Mosoka told Time Bomb and his wife that they would be back that night. They promised they would return with more food. FALLAH: Frank came to me with the food and said, Mosoka, we need to go to meet this guy. This was in the ghetto. MAHONEY: I went with Mosoka. And it was, like, 10 o'clock at night. FALLAH: There was no electricity. This place was pitch black. We had to go and drive through the grass. This was, like, a slum community. It is known to have gangsters. And that's why Frank was emphasizing that we had to keep our word. They had to trust us. VEDANTAM: This was the key. MAHONEY: So we brought food to him and his family - I think a couple sacks of rice and things. FALLAH: As we walked towards them and they saw us coming with rice on our shoulder, for some reason they trusted us. And they came to the car and helped us take the rice. VEDANTAM: Frank and Mosoka gently asked Time Bomb whether he was willing to come to the Ebola treatment facility to be quarantined. Time Bomb said he wasn't ready to do that. Frank and Mosoka said they understood, that they were willing to trust him to do the right thing. FALLAH: If you get sick, you call us. And he said, I will do that. I trust you guys. MAHONEY: And so I think it was a matter of building up a trust and comfort level for him to talk to us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: In the end, none of the young gang members contracted Ebola, not even Time Bomb. The cluster did not spread in the ghetto. Drug Mama recovered from her illness. Only one person connected with the cluster was affected. The medical worker who'd sutured up the young man's wounds - the one that went into hiding after Athalia talked to him - he came down with Ebola-related symptoms. Eventually, he did seek treatment, but it was too late. CHRISTIE: He died, unfortunately, in the Ebola treatment unit. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. Today on the show, we're talking about chaos and all of the different strategies we use to cope with it. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS\") VEDANTAM: We started today's episode with a 1950 movie, \"Panic In The Streets. \" At the end of that movie, the hero, a public health worker, ends up in a warehouse with the criminals who are carrying the deadly plague. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS\") WIDMARK: (As Lt. Cmdr. Clinton Clint Reed M. D. ) I'm a doctor, and I can cure you. VEDANTAM: He pleads for them to hand over their guns. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS\") WIDMARK: (As Lt. Cmdr. Clinton Clint Reed M. D. ) Come out now and surrender, and I promise nothing will happen to you. VEDANTAM: But. . . (SOUNDBITE OF GUNFIRE) VEDANTAM: . . . They get into a climactic shootout and the criminals are killed. (SOUNDBITE OF GUNFIRE) VEDANTAM: The public health workers in Liberia never solved things with guns. And really, when it came down to it, Athalia says, they achieved some of their best results without coercion or trickery. Building those invisible but very real bonds of trust took time, but it was essential to stopping an outbreak. CHRISTIE: When it comes down to it, what we were asking people to do, either to trust the health care system or to trust the government enough to agree to this voluntary, precautionary isolation, that's an extraordinarily difficult thing to do. You're asking people to leave their friends and family for 21 days, or we were asking people to change their burial customs. And it's difficult. It can sound simple, and I know that I spoke to people here who would say, I don't understand. Why can't they just change the way they bury the dead or change the way they care for their family members if they're sick? But as a mother, I can't imagine not touching my child if he was sick and not trying to provide comfort. So it's really understanding what it is that's driving people. You have to understand their context, their concerns and their needs. I think it's about interpersonal relationships. You have to be honest and straightforward about what you need and why. And most importantly, I think you need to be human. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: So much of being human is chaos. The doctors in Liberia found an innovative way to try and fight it. In fact, that's what we usually do when it comes to chaos. We try to control it, to manage it. If you're a parent, you've told your kids a thousand times, your room is a mess. Clean it up. Managers tell their employees to get organized. In the United States, we elect presidents to go clean up Washington. In the next half of our show, we explore a very different idea - what happens if we treat chaos as our friend instead of our enemy? Tim Harford believes we should do just that. He's the author of \"Messy: The Power Of Disorder To Transform Our Lives. \" He joined us in 2016 for a live taping. We were just blocks from the White House at NPR's Weekend in Washington, an event that brings together public radio fans and supporters. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) VEDANTAM: Tim Harford, welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. TIM HARFORD: Thank you very much, Shankar. VEDANTAM: I want to begin by playing you a piece of music, Tim. (SOUNDBITE OF KEITH JARRETT COMPOSITION) VEDANTAM: How did that piece of music come about? What's the story? HARFORD: It's beautiful, isn't it? Two of my children were born to that. It was played by Keith Jarrett, who was a great jazz pianist, in 1975 in Cologne. And if you had been there two or three hours before the concert, you would not have expected things to go well. Keith Jarrett had just refused to play. And the reason he had refused to play is because he had arrived on stage, met the piano. He was supposed to be - it's completely improvised, by the way. The whole thing was going to be improvised - met this piano and realized that there'd been a mistake. And the thing was literally unplayable. It was out of tune. Black keys were sticking. The pedals didn't work. The upper register of the keyboard was harsh and tinny because all the felt had worn away. And most importantly, it was too small, so it didn't have enough volume to actually reach the back of the Cologne auditorium. And so, of course, he refused to play. And the organizer of the concert, who was this young German girl - she's just 17 years old - desperately tried to fix the piano, to replace the piano. She managed to get it somewhat in tune, but basically she couldn't really improve on it. And she couldn't get it replaced. And so the only option she had was to beg Keith Jarrett to play. And of course, he saw this teenager, thought of the 1,400 people who were about to show up and listen to the concert and said to her, never forget, only for you. And he went on stage. And he and his producer recorded the concert because they wanted documentary evidence of what a musical catastrophe sounds like so they could play it to future promoters to tell them to do a good job and get a proper piano. But in fact, it's a masterpiece. It's Keith Jarrett's most popular work. In fact, it's the best-selling jazz album in history, solo jazz album in history, and the best-selling piano album in history is \"The Koln Concert. \" And the surprising thing is that all the adjustments that Jarrett had to make to cope with this bad piano made the music better. So he avoided the harsh upper registers. He stuck to the middle of the keyboard. That makes it sound very soothing. But he also had to compensate for the fact that the piano was so quiet. So he had these rolling, repetitive riffs in the bass to try to get some resonance. He also just stood up and pounded down on the keys. So you can hear him moaning in frustration during the concert. He's hating it. But it is amazing. (SOUNDBITE OF KEITH JARRETT COMPOSITION) HARFORD: And that combination of the peacefulness and the dynamism makes this electrifying piece of music. So he did not expect that a bad piano would produce a great concert, but in fact it did. And the argument in my book is very often we're faced with the unplayable piano and actually we produce something great out of it. VEDANTAM: You have a number of examples besides Keith Jarrett about how disruptions and inconveniences and surprises can sometimes have paradoxically good effects on us, even though we all try to avoid those disruptions. You talk about commuters, for example, who suddenly have to find a new way to work or scientists who are working on so many projects that they are discombobulated because they don't know what they're working on. In many of these cases, you find that disorder and confusion could actually be helpful. HARFORD: Yeah. So with - in the case of commuters, there was a transport strike in London a couple years ago - shut down not all but most of the London Underground stations for 48 hours. So not a long strike, but most commuters in London use public transport. It's not really set up for the car. But you could travel on the bus. There are over-ground trains, or you could use some of the tube lines that were not shut down - there are various other options. And the economists who studied this got hold of the data as to the trips that people were making. They identified people who took the same route to work every single day. Well, there's a technical term for this. It's called commuters. (LAUGHTER) HARFORD: And you would think that these are the people who have absolutely perfected their route to work. Surely commuters, they know every step. They know where to stand on the platform, which track - and yet the economists found, looking at the people who took the same route to work every day who then changed their route during the strike, thousands of them - about 5 percent - thousands upon thousands stayed with the new route. So these are people - this is the optimum population for having honed their route to perfection. And yet 1 in 20 of them discovered that, when they were forced to find a new way, they found a better way. And I think that that's quite a common situation. We get into particular habits, whether it's creative or whether it's just trying to get to work - we get into a particular habit. We are knocked off course. And very often, of course, our original habit was the right way to do things and we go back. But often enough to be useful, we find that the new way of doing things is actually better all along. And if only we'd been forced into it, we would have discovered that years ago. VEDANTAM: One of the things I want to do in this conversation is try and tease apart when messiness can be our friend and when it can be our enemy. There's a reason many of us try and avoid messiness. It's because messiness causes delays. It causes disruptions. You're ending up - you end up being late for some things. And I'm wondering as I read some of the examples in your book whether it was the case that messiness helps people who actually have a base of preparation. So in other words, Keith Jarrett - he's a professional musician. He's very gifted. He's practiced and he's learned the rules of how to play a proper piano for years and years and years. You place me before that piano and what you're going to hear is not genius. What you're going to hear is just a mess. And the reason Keith Jarrett could adapt was because he had the base of knowing the rules to now say, I can throw out the rulebook and create something brilliant. HARFORD: Yeah. I think that's absolutely right, Shankar. And is it OK? Can I open a big bag of complexity science on you? Is that all right? VEDANTAM: Absolutely. HARFORD: OK. So basically, if you are trying to solve a very complex problem, we have various algorithms that try to solve this. And I'll come to the question of skill in a second. The algorithms - computer algorithms searching for solutions in a very, very complex problem space - one possible approach is to look for step-by-step improvements. So that's the equivalent of skill. You are looking for step-by-step improvements to get from a bad solution to a better solution and a better one and a better one and a better one, and eventually you find the perfect solution. It turns out that way of looking at complex problems doesn't usually work. And the reason is the algorithm, as it looks for these small improvements, gets stuck. So these algorithms that search for solutions - they work much better if you add random shocks - lots of different ways to do that. But basically, for most that this kind of problem I'm discussing, a computer scientist would approach it by saying, we're going to have the step-by-step quest for improvements, but we're also going to have lots of randomness, lots of shocks, just keep knocking the algorithm off course because then it won't get stuck. So now we come back to Keith Jarrett. He's like an algorithm that searching for step-by-step improvements. He's a great musician. He's always looking for the perfect concert. Clearly, he's a very creative person because he's improvising every night, but he always starts with a good piano - always. And then this one night where they say, you know what, Keith? Twelve of these notes don't work. And you should probably avoid most of that part. And that thing with the pedals, don't do that either. And - but then he sits down at the piano and then his skill kicks in. And he's looking for the incremental improvements, he's looking for a path to find great music. And he finds it. So yes, you need skill, but the random shocks help. VEDANTAM: So for all the children who are listening to this podcast, I want to make clear that you're not saying that every time your parent tells you to clean up the room, you should just say Tim Harford says I shouldn't. (LAUGHTER) HARFORD: Well, I have to say since writing the book, I have stopped asking my children to clear up their room. (LAUGHTER) HARFORD: And the reason is I read an amazing study that had been conducted by two British psychologists, Alex Haslam and Craig Knight. What they did was - wasn't anything to do with children, but it was to do with clean desk policies. They got people to sit down and work in artificial office environments. You know, we've created an office for you. Here are some tasks. Sort this paper work, do these puzzles, handle these emails - regular sort of knowledge work and tasks, standard stuff. And they measured how well people did. And there were four different arms to this experiment. People were randomized into different arms. So in one case, the office was very, very minimalist - just a chair, you know, pencil, paper, no distractions. People did fine in that. They didn't really like it. On average, suits some people. The second approach - there were more decorations in the office, there were pot plants, there were posters - you know, some distractions, but it felt friendlier. People liked that more. But here's the real kicker to this research. The other two treatments - the other two parts of the research - first, the researcher said you can organize this office how you like. Bring in the posters, send away the posters, put the pot plants where you like or if you want, we'll take the pot plants away for you, however you want. People loved that. They got so much more done. They felt happier. They were more productive - significantly more productive. In the fourth part of the trial, they did that. They said arrange it however you like. And then the experimenter came in and said I'm sorry, this isn't appropriate for the experiment and rearranged everything, put it back the way it was in the second part of the trial where people had been perfectly happy to work in these decorated offices. What they weren't happy with was having someone come in, override their decisions, take away their control, take away their autonomy. They felt physically sick. And they hated everything about it. They hated the work. (LAUGHTER) HARFORD: They hated the space, they hated the company that was hosting the space. And they absolutely hated the experimenter. And after that, I made two vows to myself; No. 1, if I'm ever a boss - nobody should make me a boss, by the way - if I'm ever a boss, I will never impose a clean desk policy. And No. 2, me and my wife, we kind of are the boss in our house. And I no longer ask my children to tidy their rooms. And do you know what? We don't argue about it as much and the rooms are kind of as messy as they ever were. It hasn't made any difference to the physical state of the rooms. There's just a little bit more peace. VEDANTAM: All right. So that's a perfect segue to what I want to talk about next because I actually want to talk about office space and how we organize office spaces. And in fact, I have a clip from the cult-classic movie \"Office Space,\" which I'm going to play for you. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"OFFICE SPACE\") GREY COLE: (As Bill) Hi, Milton. What's happening? I'm going to have to ask you to go ahead and move your desk again. STEPHEN ROOT: (As Milton) No. COLE: (As Bill) So if you could go ahead and get it as far back against that wall as possible, that would be great. . . ROOT: (As Milton) No, no because I was told that. . . COLE: (As Bill) . . . That way we'll have some room for some of these boxes and things we need to put in here. ROOT: (As Milton) There's no room. COLE: (As Bill) And, oh, there it is. ROOT: (As Milton) What? COLE: (As Bill) Here. Let me just go ahead and get that from you - great. So if you could just get to that as soon as possible that would be terrific, OK? Thanks a bunch, Milton. Bye. ROOT: (As Milton) OK. But I could set the building on fire. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: So I take it, Tim, that you are not a fan of fascist office managers. But you do also tell the story in the book about Steve Jobs at Pixar and some of the ideas he had about how to organize office space to make people more collaborative and some of the ways that might have backfired. HARFORD: Yeah, the Pixar story I think is fascinating. So Steve Jobs, majority shareholder at Pixar, had a big hand in designing the Pixar building. And one of his big ideas is we are going to make all the bathrooms in this building in the middle of the building. We're just going to have two big restrooms - a pair of restrooms in the heart of the building. And what that will do is everyone would come together brought together by a shared human need to urinate. (LAUGHTER) HARFORD: And there will be serendipitous interactions and that's going to be great. And, you know, I'm all in favor of serendipitous interaction. We silo ourselves off. That's a major theme in the book. But maybe Steve had taken this idea too far. What's interesting, though, is Steve Jobs had this reputation as being brilliant but, you know, a real control freak's control freak and just ordering people what to do. But there was a rebellion in Pixar led by pregnant women who said, I know this sounds like a great idea on paper, Mr. Jobs. But I need to go to the restroom three times an hour and you've just made the restroom 10 minutes away from my desk. Do the math. And yeah. . . (LAUGHTER) HARFORD: It's not going to work. And Steve Jobs did an amazing thing - he backed down, said, OK, I'm wrong. I will find another way to create serendipitous interactions and you can have your restrooms all over the Pixar offices, which is where they are. And reading a recent book about Pixar by Ed Catmull, who is one of the bosses there, it is apparently absolute chaos in there in a beautiful, beautiful way. So the building is just what you would expect from Steve Jobs. It looks gorgeous. It's sort of exposed steel girders and brickwork and wood and all of that. But the desk space - the Pixar designers build Disney castles and underground and - you know, it looks like a set of \"Finding Nemo\" and \"Toy Story\" and \"WALL-E\" all put into one. It's a great collaborative space that people feel they have control over. It looks like a total mess. VEDANTAM: In other words, it looks like your children's rooms. HARFORD: Yeah, maybe slightly more creative than my children's rooms, but my children aspire towards the whole Disney castle thing. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: Tim Harford comes from Britain. We're having this chat in the United States. In both countries, there have been enormous political upheavals recently. When we come back, I'm going to ask Tim about messiness in public life and in democracy. Stay with us. (APPLAUSE) VEDANTAM: You're listening to HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. This is NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. With Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, Tim, we've had populist revolutions on both sides of the Atlantic that reject the advice of scientists and economists, experts in general. Democracy, of course, is famously messy. Could you remind people why it's such a good thing? HARFORD: I think in both cases I try to remind myself of Keith Jarrett's unplayable piano, actually. To me, the Brexit vote felt like an unplayable piano. The expert consensus in the U. K. was that this was not a very good idea. The British people disagreed with the experts, and so they voted to leave. And so I thought to myself, OK, well, this is going to pose all kinds of obstacles and all kinds of difficulties. In what ways might they actually turn to our advantage? So not to try to be foolishly optimistic in the face of disappointment - well, what was disappointment for a lot of people - but to say, well, there's an opportunity in everything. What are the solutions that we look for going forward? And I think that's an important thing to bear in mind whenever we're faced with an obstacle. It's easy to get frustrated, but we should then say, OK, how is this going to make me stronger? How is this going to make my society stronger? What are the solutions that are going to come out of disappointment? There is a section in the book about Donald Trump's campaigning style. And I said he is a master of using chaos to his advantage. One of the interesting parallels between Trump's campaign and the Brexit vote in the U. K. is that the Brexit vote in the U. K. - there were two different leave campaigns, and they hated each other. They were taking legal action against each other. They actively contradicted each other. This may sound familiar. I don't know. You would think that that's a disadvantage. Turns out to be an advantage because they were able to coalesce two different groups of supporters who wanted different things and they just tuned into the things they liked to hear. Meanwhile, the opposition, the remain vote in the U. K. , the Democrats in the United States, they weren't sure what to criticize because there was no coherence on the other side. So there was no target to aim at. Trump, by the way, is not the only person to use this. The use of chaos as a weapon works perfectly well in war time. I talk about Erwin Rommel, the great German tank commander. It works in business. Jeff Bezos at Amazon explicitly targeted we're going to move fast, we're going to make a mess. We don't understand what's going on, but at least Barnes & Noble are more confused than we are. (LAUGHTER) HARFORD: And as long as Barnes and Noble are more confused than we are, we're doing OK. He was very, very clear about this. And it has proved very effective. VEDANTAM: I want to talk about another example of messiness in public life. And I want you to watch this video, which describes a very famous speech, and I want to ask the question right after it. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) MARTIN LUTHER KING JR: We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating For Whites Only. (APPLAUSE) KING: We cannot be satisfied as long as a negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. VEDANTAM: So as you can see from that speech, Tim, Martin Luther King is reading from a script. And he has a nice line there, but it's a writerly line. But at a certain point in this speech, he decides to leave the script behind and turn his eyes to the audience. And here's what we see after that. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) KING: I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up, live out the true meaning of its creed. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal. (APPLAUSE) VEDANTAM: Talk about this for a second because you talk about this speech in the book and you talk about this moment when King left his notes behind and essentially stepped off the ledge of what he knew and what he was certain about and just rode the wave of what the crowd was telling him and what he was feeling. HARFORD: He had prepared that speech meticulously the night before. He stayed up very late. He was operating on a number of constraints. It was quite a tight time schedule. The eyes of the world were on him. He knew that. There were also various political constraints about what was his response going to be to the civil rights legislation? Would he embrace it? Would he criticize it as not going far enough? Other civil rights leaders were making different claims. He had to balance all of those. So he took great care. The result was a speech that was well-crafted but a little bit lifeless. And so six or seven minutes into the speech, he looks down at the script and there's a line there that's terrible. And it must've been terrible when he wrote it, but he looked and he realized it's not working. It's now let us go back to our communities as members for the society for creative dissatisfaction. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Oh, my God. HARFORD: He doesn't say it. (LAUGHTER) HARFORD: He says instead go back to Alabama. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) KING: Go back to Alabama. Go back to South Carolina. Go back to Georgia. Go back to Louisiana. Go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities. HARFORD: And there's another pause, and the people behind him on the stage know he's not on the script anymore. And Mahalia Jackson, great gospel singer, yells out to him because she's heard him talking in church about this dream. She yells out tell them about the dream, Martin. And then he starts to improvise. And that is when he touches the crowd. VEDANTAM: I want to wrap by asking you a few personal questions. I understand that after writing this book, every time you find yourself in a mess and you turn to your wife for comfort, she now reminds you that being in a mess is a good thing. (LAUGHTER) HARFORD: Yeah. Actually just two days ago, Shankar, I was trying to check into a hotel at Dublin Airport at midnight knowing that I was going to have to get up very early in the morning and fly and then come over to Washington to speak to you and I - just desperate to get that little bit of sleep that I would be able to get. And when I showed up at the airport hotel, they didn't have my reservation and they were full - so nowhere to sleep. And as I toured Dublin in a taxi looking for hotels that were open, my - I could just hear my wife's voice in my head saying this is making you smarter, Tim. This is what do you say. (LAUGHTER) HARFORD: This is making you more creative. So, you know, I've really sort of created a rod to beat myself with. But I think it is - it's important. Look; sometimes bad news is just bad news. Sometimes an obstacle is just an obstacle. And there is no good side to be found. But very often when things go wrong, we need to stop and say, well, what could come out of this? Brian Eno, a musician who I interviewed for the book - he worked with David Bowie, worked with U2, Coldplay, an amazing producer. He described his creative strategy as it is a little bit similar to being in an accident. When you're in an accident, you get that sudden feeling of you paying attention to everything because there's this tremendous sense of threat. Well - but that attention - the threat is bad. The accident is bad, but the attention is good. And so he puts the musicians he works with in stressful situations so they feel almost like they've been in an accident. And suddenly, he has their attention. I think it's worth bearing in mind even if the accident is a problem, even if the obstacle is a problem, the sudden attention, the sudden feeling of being present may lead us to some kind of solution. And that's worth hanging onto. When everything is perfect, when everything is tidy, we're on autopilot, and we're not necessarily living in the moment. We're not necessarily paying attention. And that's a problem for us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Tim Harford, thank you for joining me today. HARFORD: Thanks, Shankar.

Now they know of two more, thanks to an undergraduate college student using artificial intelligence. Here's NPR's Joe Palca. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Anne Dattilo is a senior at The University of Texas at Austin. Last year, an astronomer talked to her class about his research using a NASA satellite called Kepler to hunt for planets orbiting distant stars. ANNE DATTILO: And at the very end, he was like, I'm taking undergrads, if any of you want to do research on the subject, finding planets, and I decided that's what I wanted to do. So I emailed him, and a year and a half later, here I am. PALCA: She led a team that discovered two Earth-sized planets orbiting stars more than 1,200 light-years from Earth. To find the planets, Dattilo used an artificial intelligence approach called machine learning to comb through a Kepler data set called K2; K2 contains measurements of the light coming from tens of thousands of stars. Dattilo says when a star is what she calls boring, the light coming from it is constant. DATTILO: But if you can imagine something passing in front of that star, the light we receive would dim. And so if you see that periodically, that would be a signal that a planet is in front of that. PALCA: The artificial intelligence program looks for these fluctuations in a star's light that might be associated with a planet passing in front. Now, you don't have to be a NASA scientist to use data from a NASA satellite. JESSIE CHRISTIANSEN: NASA makes all of the data publicly available. You just have to think of a new idea to do with the data that no one's done before. PALCA: Jessie Christiansen is a research scientist at the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute at Caltech in Pasadena. CHRISTIANSEN: This is the first time someone's gone through and done a machine learning process on the K2 data to come up with a uniform list of planet candidates. PALCA: And that will be valuable beyond just getting a good grade on an undergraduate class? CHRISTIANSEN: Absolutely. PALCA: In fact, Michelle Ntampaka at the Harvard-Smithsonian Institute for Astrophysics in Cambridge says she's seen something remarkable happen in the last five years or so. MICHELLE NTAMPAKA: And that is that there has been a dramatic increase in the amount of machine learning research that's happening for astronomy applications. PALCA: That's because newer telescopes don't so much collect images of stars and galaxies as digital data about these celestial objects. NTAMPAKA: We're just going to see unprecedented data volumes, and we're going to have to come up with new ways to deal with that. PALCA: Ntampaka says the next generation of astronomers will have to be comfortable working with artificial intelligence to make sense of all this data. So writing a machine learning program as an undergrad is good preparation for Anne Dattilo as she heads off to get her graduate degree in astronomy. Joe Palca, NPR News.

They're not a threatened species. But Granholm is tracking their numbers closely, on the lookout for signs of trouble. Albatross are large, white birds with longish beaks and grey feathers on their wings. They remind me of a seagull on steroids. There are two albatrosses sitting inches apart in Granholm's yard. GRANHOLM: The one on the right is Roger. PALCA: Roger, it turns out, is a female albatross. Roger on the right and who is. . . GRANHOLM: Mr. Clackypants on the left. PALCA: Sorry.

Not so says astrophysicist Adam Frank. It's all part of the good news the universe holds. ADAM FRANK: I get it. I spent years battling my son's messes. But guess what. When it comes to life and the universe, sometimes a mess is exactly what we need. Take a good look at your kids again. Inside them and you are remarkable molecular machines - you know, proteins. Proteins are the workhorses of cells, and they come in thousands of different varieties. Some act is the scaffolding that gives a cell its shape. Others act as transport vans, moving important molecules like sugars around the cell. Others still act as border guards, allowing only certain kinds of molecules into and out of the cell membrane. But when you look at them, what you see is each protein is just a long chain of atoms like a nanoscale piece of Silly String. Proteins work because of this amazing trick they can pull. To accomplish its particular task, each string of protein folds up into a very specific shape. Some parts of the protein fold into slinky-like twists called an alpha helix while other parts fold into overlapping zigzags called a beta sheet. And to look at them - well, they look like a mess. But out of the apparent mess of these folded proteins comes life itself. What's truly remarkable is that nature is really specific about the complex, messy shapes individual proteins must take. If the shape is even a little wrong, then the protein won't work. So what looks to most of us like a tangled ball of string looks like a perfect molecular engine to a cell. Life, through billions of years of evolution, is so much smarter than we are. It can build order in the most remarkable way. So the next time you're about to pull your hair out over your kid's messy room, stop for a moment, and remember those proteins. They can remind you that life and mess - they just go together. And sometimes they're both really glorious. CORNISH: That's astrophysicist Adam Frank. He's a professor at the University of Rochester and author of \"Light Of The Stars: Alien Worlds And The Fate Of The Earth. \" AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  It's spring, which for some means spring cleaning - Marie Kondo because mess is bad, right? Not so says astrophysicist Adam Frank. It's all part of the good news the universe holds. ADAM FRANK: I get it. I spent years battling my son's messes. But guess what. When it comes to life and the universe, sometimes a mess is exactly what we need. Take a good look at your kids again. Inside them and you are remarkable molecular machines - you know, proteins. Proteins are the workhorses of cells, and they come in thousands of different varieties. Some act is the scaffolding that gives a cell its shape. Others act as transport vans, moving important molecules like sugars around the cell. Others still act as border guards, allowing only certain kinds of molecules into and out of the cell membrane. But when you look at them, what you see is each protein is just a long chain of atoms like a nanoscale piece of Silly String. Proteins work because of this amazing trick they can pull. To accomplish its particular task, each string of protein folds up into a very specific shape. Some parts of the protein fold into slinky-like twists called an alpha helix while other parts fold into overlapping zigzags called a beta sheet. And to look at them - well, they look like a mess. But out of the apparent mess of these folded proteins comes life itself. What's truly remarkable is that nature is really specific about the complex, messy shapes individual proteins must take. If the shape is even a little wrong, then the protein won't work. So what looks to most of us like a tangled ball of string looks like a perfect molecular engine to a cell. Life, through billions of years of evolution, is so much smarter than we are. It can build order in the most remarkable way. So the next time you're about to pull your hair out over your kid's messy room, stop for a moment, and remember those proteins. They can remind you that life and mess - they just go together. And sometimes they're both really glorious. CORNISH: That's astrophysicist Adam Frank. He's a professor at the University of Rochester and author of \"Light Of The Stars: Alien Worlds And The Fate Of The Earth. \"", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.

A lot of homes burned to the ground. But some buildings were more resilient than others. NPR's Rebecca Hersher recently visited a lab where the insurance industry studies what sets those homes apart by setting full-scale houses on fire. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: The lab is huge - a concrete cavern the size of an airplane hangar in a sparsely inhabited part of South Carolina. At one end is a wall of 105 fans. ROY WRIGHT: Why don't I just take you up inside one of these fans? HERSHER: Oh, sweet. Roy Wright is the president of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety, which runs this lab. The fans are inside tunnels, each big enough for a semitruck to drive into. WRIGHT: This then channels all of the wind down so we can create winds well in excess of 140 miles an hour. HERSHER: They play out all kinds of disasters here - hurricanes, tornadoes, hail storms. On the day that NPR photographer Ryan Kellman and I visited, researchers at the lab we're doing a full-scale fire test. WRIGHT: So this is full of woodchips. HERSHER: They're planning to shoot burning woodchips at an actual house to study different construction materials. The goal is to simulate what happens in real wildfires. WRIGHT: Ninety percent of ignitions come not from a wall of flame coming but through those embers that pick up and fly. HERSHER: Daniel Gorham is a fire engineer here. He's the guy responsible for burning down the test house. DANIEL GORHAM: What we have here is a duplex structure. So it's a single building, but we essentially put a wall down the middle. HERSHER: The two sides of the duplex are really different. GORHAM: Which is what we're calling the wildfire-resistant side. HERSHER: Tar shingle roof, metal gutters, gray siding that looks vaguely like wood. GORHAM: You see the texture and the appearance looks like it's wood siding, but in reality, we can show you a sample. It's just fiber cement board. HERSHER: The siding is made of cement, and landscaping around the house is also really important. On this side, it's off-white gravel around the edge of the house and some small bushes around five feet away. The other half of the house has mulch instead of gravel, bushes planted right up next to the house, vinyl gutters, actual cedar siding. It looks like a mountain cabin. Time to set it all on fire. We retreat inside behind a big window to watch as the fans start to turn and flaming woodchips fly out of metal tubes lofted on artificial wind and start battering the house. It only takes a couple minutes to see some action. GORHAM: And we have some flame now. We have some flame now on the non-wildfire-resistant side in the mulch. HERSHER: The flames go from the mulch to the plants to the siding, and in a few minutes, it's a flaming cabin. The windows break. The gutters melt. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Fire is in the front wall of the building. HERSHER: There's so much smoke, it's hard to tell what's happening on the other side of the house. It's not until the local fire department helps put out the flames, as planned, that it becomes clear. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: End of test. WRIGHT: The side by side couldn't be more surreal. The duplex - one side fully engulfed and the other side - the other side's getting just as much embers, just as much pummeling it, and it is just going, I can take it. HERSHER: The goal of tests like this is twofold. The researchers hope that knowing exactly how resilient different materials are to hazards like wildfires will help local governments update their building codes to withstand disasters better. And it's also about money. This lab is funded by the insurance industry. It was originally built after Hurricane Katrina; at the time, the most expensive storm ever recorded. But recent disasters have led insurers to invest even more in research, millions of dollars every year, to study ways to lessen the damage from increasingly frequent and severe storms and fires. WRIGHT: If Harvey, Irma, Marie and the wildfires of 2017 made the case for resilience, Florence, Michael, the Woolsey and Camp Fires was an exclamation point. HERSHER: Wright says the facility's budget has been growing steadily in recent years. Local insurance agents visit to learn about the resilience of roofing, siding, garage doors, carports and all manner of building materials. Wright says there is interest from across the country. WRIGHT: We've hit an inflection point where we're seeing more events impact more Americans. HERSHER: That's in part because climate change is affecting the whole U. S. and homeowners and insurers alike are looking for ways to adapt. Rebecca Hersher, NPR News, Richburg, S. C. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  Last year's wildfires caused billions of dollars in damage.

This is the story of a man who made it his life's work to be that mentor. His efforts changed the lives of thousands of people, including, as NPR's Joe Palca learned, some of the top scientists and mathematicians in this country. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: One of those top scientists is a computational biologist at Harvard Medical School named Vamsi Mootha. In the late 1980s when young Vamsi was in high school in Beaumont, Texas, he won a science fair. A few days later, a letter arrived in the mail. VAMSI MOOTHA: It said, dear Vamsi, congratulations on winning the Houston Science Fair. This is quite the accomplishment. PALCA: But then the letter went on to say that the math problem Vamsi solved to win the fair had been solved hundreds of years earlier. MOOTHA: Of course, you can't be expected to know this because you're only a sophomore in high school and perhaps you haven't had the appropriate mentorship. PALCA: And the letter went on. MOOTHA: If you're interested in solving original problems, why don't you write back to me. PALCA: The letter was signed George Berzsenyi. Berzsenyi was a math professor at Lamar University in Beaumont. The letter upset Vamsi. He thought he'd discovered something new. He was annoyed. But then he became intrigued. MOOTHA: And I said, you know what? I'm going to take this guy up on his offer and write back to him. PALCA: They got together, and the pair hit it off. Berzsenyi would give Vamsi those original problems to solve. MOOTHA: I would share with him my interval progress. And he'd sort of guide me in terms of possible directions. PALCA: Eventually, Vamsi headed off to Stanford University and then Harvard Medical School. Vamsi Mootha says Berzsenyi's mentoring was incredibly helpful as he pursued his academic career. And a half dozen or so years ago, Mootha learned that he was hardly the only one to benefit from Berzsenyi's attention. MOOTHA: I share an office with somebody named Joel Hirschhorn. PALCA: Hirschhorn is a star geneticist at Harvard and the Broad Institute. One day, Mootha and Hirschhorn were trying to solve a math problem related to their work. MOOTHA: Joel is up at the board. He's drawing out some equations. PALCA: And then. . . MOOTHA: After we worked on the problem, we're just reminiscing about our high school days in mathematics. I had known that Joel was quite the mathematician. PALCA: Young Joel was co-captain of his New York City high school math team. So Mootha starts to tell Hirschhorn about how he got this letter after winning a science fair. MOOTHA: And before I could actually finish that sentence, he actually asked me, wait, did that letter come from somebody named George Berzsenyi? And I said yes. How do you know? And he said, oh, because I used to communicate with George Berzsenyi also. PALCA: Hirschhorn would send in solutions to problems in a math newsletter Berzsenyi edited. And it gets funkier. Two weeks later, Mootha's telling Sebastian Seung this story. Seung is a hotshot neuroscientist at MIT. And before he can finish the story. . . MOOTHA: Sebastian interrupts me and says, wait, was that George Berzsenyi? And I said yes. How do you know? PALCA: Berzsenyi was also a mentor to Sebastian Seung. Mootha found out that Berzsenyi had affected the lives of many top scientists and mathematicians. He rounded up 10 of them to nominate Berzsenyi for a lifetime achievement award from the Mathematics Association of America. So who is George Berzsenyi? What's up with him? And how did he come to influence the lives of so many people? Is that George? GEORGE BERZSENYI: Does it look like (unintelligible). PALCA: To find out, I went to Milwaukee. That's where George lives with his wife, Kay. Hi. KAY: Hi. PALCA: I'm Joe. KAY: Hi, I'm Kay. PALCA: Hi, Kay. How are you? KAY: Just fine. Come on right on in. PALCA: Berzsenyi takes me into the spare bedroom he's transformed into an office. He's 80 now. He was born in Hungary. In high school, he fell in love with mathematics. Hungary punches above its weight in math. The country has produced many famous mathematicians. Berzsenyi left high school to join a student protest movement against the Soviet-backed government. Then Moscow sent in tanks to crush the revolt. BERZSENYI: I left Hungary in 1956. PALCA: Berzsenyi fled to America. He had family in St. Louis, so he went there for a few years, then on to Texas. He went back to school, earning a Ph. D. in mathematics. When he joined the math faculty at Lamar in Beaumont, he was underwhelmed by the quality of the math students. So he decided he'd look for talented high school students. But he didn't just want to find them. BERZSENYI: My idea was that following the example I learned and I remembered from Hungary. I should try to develop their talents rather than just discover them. PALCA: With local kids, he'd meet them one on one. For others, the interactions were by mail. He would send out a math magazine with tricky problems in it. And when students send in solutions, he would send back comments. BERZSENYI: To me, the biggest miracle is that they would trust an unknown character at an unknown university, Lamar University, and send me solutions regularly - some of the very, very best of this country - tells me two things. On the one hand, these kids very, very trustful and very willing to do anything that helps them. And the second thing is that there really isn't anything for them. PALCA: Berzsenyi says most high schools just don't have the expertise to help these bright math students. And professional mathematicians by and large can't be bothered. Berzsenyi, on the other hand, loved watching young people's math talents grow. BERZSENYI: One of the things I believe that made these students look up to me is that every time I would meet any of them, I would handle them as equals in spite of their youth. I consider them mathematically superbly mature and treat them in such fashion. I really admired them. PALCA: Over the years, Berzsenyi worked with lots of kids. BERZSENYI: I would say probably thousands, yes - definitely. PALCA: Berzsenyi didn't expect all of them to become mathematicians. BERZSENYI: That sort of training is fantastic for any fieldPALCA: Berzsenyi's proteges have gone on in biology, business, even the law. But some did go on in math. YVONNE LAI: I first met Dr. Berzsenyi through the Young Scholars Program in 1995. PALCA: Yvonne Lai is a math professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Berzsenyi created the Young Scholars Program as a kind of summer math camp for high school students. Lai recalls, as the camp was coming to an end. . . LAI: He assigned us a group of 10 math competition-style problems that we could hand in as a final assignment in 10 years. PALCA: In 10 years? LAI: In 10 years. PALCA: The group stayed in touch using a mailing list. And about a decade later. . . LAI: Somebody wrote the mailing list and said, you know what? It's been 10 years. We have a problem set due. BERZSENYI: An assignment due 10 years later is just the kind of clever idea George Berzsenyi used to keep students engaged in math. Berzsenyi is proud of what his math proteges have accomplished. Ferrell Wheeler does cryptography work for the National Security Agency. Kiran Kedlaya works on number theory at the University of California San Diego. Noam Elkies became a tenured math faculty member at Harvard when he was just 26 years old. But of all the students Berzsenyi told me about in the hours we spoke, one stood out - Jimmy Wilson. BERZSENYI: In long run, I would say Jimmy was probably my major discovery. PALCA: Berzsenyi says Jimmy almost fell through the cracks. When he was a high school freshman, Jimmy took part in a math competition. Berzsenyi happened to look over the shoulder of the judge scoring Jimmy's solution to one of the tough problems in the competition. BERZSENYI: The solution he gave to the problem was a perfect solution. And somehow, the person who was grading the solution didn't recognize that it actually solved the problem very elegantly. PALCA: So Berzsenyi overruled the first judge and gave him a top score. If Jimmy was this good as a freshman, Berzsenyi thought. . . BERZSENYI: Let's try to challenge him and see what more he can do. PALCA: Berzsenyi says Jimmy could do plenty. Later in high school, Berzsenyi took Jimmy and a bunch of other students to a competition on the East Coast. The concluding event at the competition was a game called Buzz. BERZSENYI: They had never heard of this before. I never heard of it before. PALCA: It was a counting game. Students stand in a circle and take turns counting. But there are complex rules where you replace numbers with words, like buzz, bang or whack. Say the wrong word, and you're out. It's fiendishly hard to keep all the rules straight, especially as the count reaches into the hundreds. Eventually, there were just two students left - the previous year's champion and Jimmy. BERZSENYI: It was just unbelievable to watch. Very methodically, Jimmy just succeeded where the other kid didn't. PALCA: But for all his natural aptitude for math, at first, Jimmy didn't do well in college. He dropped out of Texas A&M. Berzsenyi says it was because as smart as he was, he hadn't really learned how to study. BERZSENYI: At that time, I didn't recognize some of the things I should have been doing. And I still feel bad about it. PALCA: But there's one person who disagrees with him about that. JIM WILSON: I don't think he needs to feel that way at all. PALCA: That's Jimmy Wilson, although today he goes by Jim Wilson. He did finish college. He still lives in Beaumont, Texas. He's worked as an educator in the local school system for most of his adult life. He's proud of what he did at that East Coast math competition, proud of his math skills, especially proud of the day George Berzsenyi gave him a Rubik's Cube. WILSON: If you can solve it, you can keep it. PALCA: Challenge accepted. It took him a couple days, but solve it he did. Wilson recalls Berzsenyi telling him how impressed he was. And then he added something surprising. WILSON: He said, oh, by the way, I think you're the first person in the country to solve it. PALCA: The cube Berzsenyi gave Wilson was one he brought back from Hungary, where the Rubik's Cube was invented. The U. S. version hadn't gone on the market yet. It's true, Wilson didn't achieve the kind of academic fame or financial success some of Berzsenyi's other students did. WILSON: I could look back with some regrets. PALCA: But he's also found great fulfillment in helping the students he's taught over the years to find the joy in math. WILSON: And to this day, as I reach out to help students to improve their skills, it's because of that relationship that started when I was in high school with Dr. Berzsenyi. PALCA: And so Jim Wilson has become just the kind of math mentor that George Berzsenyi says this country needs more of. Joe Palca, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF PHILHARMONIE'S \"QUICKSILVER\") LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:  A mentor who appears at a critical moment in someone's life can have an enormous impact. This is the story of a man who made it his life's work to be that mentor. His efforts changed the lives of thousands of people, including, as NPR's Joe Palca learned, some of the top scientists and mathematicians in this country. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: One of those top scientists is a computational biologist at Harvard Medical School named Vamsi Mootha. In the late 1980s when young Vamsi was in high school in Beaumont, Texas, he won a science fair. A few days later, a letter arrived in the mail. VAMSI MOOTHA: It said, dear Vamsi, congratulations on winning the Houston Science Fair. This is quite the accomplishment. PALCA: But then the letter went on to say that the math problem Vamsi solved to win the fair had been solved hundreds of years earlier. MOOTHA: Of course, you can't be expected to know this because you're only a sophomore in high school and perhaps you haven't had the appropriate mentorship. PALCA: And the letter went on. MOOTHA: If you're interested in solving original problems, why don't you write back to me. PALCA: The letter was signed George Berzsenyi. Berzsenyi was a math professor at Lamar University in Beaumont. The letter upset Vamsi. He thought he'd discovered something new. He was annoyed. But then he became intrigued. MOOTHA: And I said, you know what? I'm going to take this guy up on his offer and write back to him. PALCA: They got together, and the pair hit it off. Berzsenyi would give Vamsi those original problems to solve. MOOTHA: I would share with him my interval progress. And he'd sort of guide me in terms of possible directions. PALCA: Eventually, Vamsi headed off to Stanford University and then Harvard Medical School. Vamsi Mootha says Berzsenyi's mentoring was incredibly helpful as he pursued his academic career. And a half dozen or so years ago, Mootha learned that he was hardly the only one to benefit from Berzsenyi's attention. MOOTHA: I share an office with somebody named Joel Hirschhorn. PALCA: Hirschhorn is a star geneticist at Harvard and the Broad Institute. One day, Mootha and Hirschhorn were trying to solve a math problem related to their work. MOOTHA: Joel is up at the board. He's drawing out some equations. PALCA: And then. . . MOOTHA: After we worked on the problem, we're just reminiscing about our high school days in mathematics. I had known that Joel was quite the mathematician. PALCA: Young Joel was co-captain of his New York City high school math team. So Mootha starts to tell Hirschhorn about how he got this letter after winning a science fair. MOOTHA: And before I could actually finish that sentence, he actually asked me, wait, did that letter come from somebody named George Berzsenyi? And I said yes. How do you know? And he said, oh, because I used to communicate with George Berzsenyi also. PALCA: Hirschhorn would send in solutions to problems in a math newsletter Berzsenyi edited. And it gets funkier. Two weeks later, Mootha's telling Sebastian Seung this story. Seung is a hotshot neuroscientist at MIT. And before he can finish the story. . . MOOTHA: Sebastian interrupts me and says, wait, was that George Berzsenyi? And I said yes. How do you know? PALCA: Berzsenyi was also a mentor to Sebastian Seung. Mootha found out that Berzsenyi had affected the lives of many top scientists and mathematicians. He rounded up 10 of them to nominate Berzsenyi for a lifetime achievement award from the Mathematics Association of America. So who is George Berzsenyi? What's up with him? And how did he come to influence the lives of so many people? Is that George? GEORGE BERZSENYI: Does it look like (unintelligible). PALCA: To find out, I went to Milwaukee. That's where George lives with his wife, Kay. Hi. KAY: Hi. PALCA: I'm Joe. KAY: Hi, I'm Kay. PALCA: Hi, Kay. How are you? KAY: Just fine. Come on right on in. PALCA: Berzsenyi takes me into the spare bedroom he's transformed into an office. He's 80 now. He was born in Hungary. In high school, he fell in love with mathematics. Hungary punches above its weight in math. The country has produced many famous mathematicians. Berzsenyi left high school to join a student protest movement against the Soviet-backed government. Then Moscow sent in tanks to crush the revolt. BERZSENYI: I left Hungary in 1956. PALCA: Berzsenyi fled to America. He had family in St. Louis, so he went there for a few years, then on to Texas. He went back to school, earning a Ph. D. in mathematics. When he joined the math faculty at Lamar in Beaumont, he was underwhelmed by the quality of the math students. So he decided he'd look for talented high school students. But he didn't just want to find them. BERZSENYI: My idea was that following the example I learned and I remembered from Hungary. I should try to develop their talents rather than just discover them. PALCA: With local kids, he'd meet them one on one. For others, the interactions were by mail. He would send out a math magazine with tricky problems in it. And when students send in solutions, he would send back comments. BERZSENYI: To me, the biggest miracle is that they would trust an unknown character at an unknown university, Lamar University, and send me solutions regularly - some of the very, very best of this country - tells me two things. On the one hand, these kids very, very trustful and very willing to do anything that helps them. And the second thing is that there really isn't anything for them. PALCA: Berzsenyi says most high schools just don't have the expertise to help these bright math students. And professional mathematicians by and large can't be bothered. Berzsenyi, on the other hand, loved watching young people's math talents grow. BERZSENYI: One of the things I believe that made these students look up to me is that every time I would meet any of them, I would handle them as equals in spite of their youth. I consider them mathematically superbly mature and treat them in such fashion. I really admired them. PALCA: Over the years, Berzsenyi worked with lots of kids. BERZSENYI: I would say probably thousands, yes - definitely. PALCA: Berzsenyi didn't expect all of them to become mathematicians. BERZSENYI: That sort of training is fantastic for any field PALCA: Berzsenyi's proteges have gone on in biology, business, even the law. But some did go on in math.

I'm Terry Gross. As we deal with more extreme weather around the world and hear more dire reports about the future impact of climate change, you have to wonder, why didn't we succeed in taking preventive measures sooner, before things had progressed? That's one of the key questions my guest Nathaniel Rich tries to answer in his new book, \"Losing Earth: A Recent History. \" It's an expanded version of his report that the New York Times magazine devoted an entire issue to last August. He focuses on the period from 1979 to '89, a period he describes as a time before the fossil fuel industry funded scientists to create doubt about the science of climate change and before the Republican Party adopted climate denialism as a central tenet. He focuses on the scientists, activists and political leaders who pushed for measures to limit carbon emissions and the political and corporate leaders who blocked them. We're also going to talk about where we are now with a president who doubts the science and a growing movement of young people insisting on action reversing the path we're on. Nathaniel Rich, welcome to FRESH AIR. How much worse has the climate change problem gotten since your book ends in 1989? NATHANIEL RICH: More carbon dioxide has been emitted into the atmosphere since the final page of the book basically, since the end of 1989, than in the history of civilization preceding it. So it's gotten a lot worse. Obviously, the political situation's gotten a lot worse as well. It's become a starkly partisan issue. I don't have to tell anyone that. And it seems like we are much further from a solution than we were 30 years ago. GROSS: You write that, now, a long-term disaster is the best-case scenario. Would you explain that? RICH: Yeah. Well, a certain amount of warming is baked in. And that's, you know, referring to some of the projections about 1 1/2 or 2 degrees Celsius warming above historical means, and there's all kinds of horrific scenarios that come with that. Of course, that's not nearly as bad as, you know, 3 degrees or 4 degrees or 5 degrees warming. But even when we talk about it in those terms, in sort of half degrees or full degrees warming, it's almost euphemistic because there's there's such dramatic differences even between, you know, 2 degrees and 2. 1 degrees, 2. 1 degrees and 2. 2 degrees. And I think one of the lies, sort of convenient dishonesties we have about the issue, one of the more benign ones, I guess, is that we think of it almost, like, in Hollywood terms, like, either we're going to win this thing, or we're going to suffer a crushing defeat. But of course, there's a huge range of outcomes in between. And at this point - yeah - where we're at, ranging from the not very good to the apocalyptic, but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't try to better our situation as much as possible. GROSS: Is there a moment when you think we came really close to seriously cutting back on the carbon emissions that are responsible for climate change during the period that you write about, '79 to '89? RICH: Absolutely. From from '79 to '89, there are a series of efforts, escalating efforts, to first bring the issue to the attention of the powers that be, people at the highest levels of the federal government, and then to bring it to the public to generate public concern. And finally, in the middle of the decade, a solution materializes, which is a global treaty to reduce emissions that would be binding. And it's modeled after the ozone treaty that's then in process. And by the end of the decade, we've reached the point of high-level diplomatic meetings to negotiate this binding global treaty. And we get to the precipice of an agreement on the framework of this treaty. And at the very last second, the U. S. pulls out, the story I tell in the book. And so I think that, at least on paper, that's the closest we've come. I think you could have a reasonable, you know, debate about whether or not, if the U. S. did sign the treaty, they would have lived up - we would've lived up to the terms of it, whether other countries would have lived up to the terms of it even if it was binding. And that's a more, you know, complicated conversation to have. I think, at the very least, we'd be a lot further ahead than we are now. That seems indisputable. GROSS: So what year did the U. S. pull out of this treaty? Who is the president, and why did we pull out? RICH: So it's 1989. President is George H. W. Bush. And the previous summer, James Hansen, a NASA scientist who had become essentially the face of climate science, gave testimony before Congress in which he said, global warming is here. It's no longer a theory. We're seeing evidence of warming in global temperatures. It was the hottest summer in American history at the time. And the story became a - it became a major public national story and to the point that even George Bush on the campaign stump gave speeches about it, was making promises that, as president, he would solve the problem then called the greenhouse effect as well. And he said, you know, those who think we can't solve the greenhouse effect haven't heard about the White House effect. And when I'm in the White House, you know, we'll solve it. And he gets to the White House. James Baker, who's the new secretary of state, in his first major speech at the State Department, he invites the IPCC, the international organization under the auspices of the United Nations that's drafting - begins drafting a treaty. They have one of their first meetings at the State Department. And he endorses this program. And over the course of the year, you get to a meeting in Noordwijk in the Netherlands, a kind of coastal town on the North Sea. That's the first high-level diplomatic meeting of - it's of environmental ministers from all over the world. Sixty-five countries or so come there. And there's a general sense that everyone's going to sign essentially a letter of intent that they will pursue a binding treaty to reduce global emissions. And at that meeting, the U. S. pulls out. And the reason, at least the narrow political reason for that, is that over the course of that year, there had been a huge fight within the administration between William Riley, the head of Bush's EPA, and John Sununu, his chief of staff. And Sununu was highly skeptical of the science and suspicious of the motives of this treaty. And he was ultimately more powerful and won the argument, essentially, and was able to force the U. S. delegation to not accept anything that was binding. And at that point, the treaty became watered down. GROSS: Do you think that some of these treaties are almost like masquerades where countries show up, and they look really great - like, we're going to do it - we're going to sign it - and then, at the last minute, you pull out? Like, it's almost like a game of chicken. Like, nobody really wants to do it, but everybody's waiting for somebody else to pull out - that no one really has the political will to make the sacrifices that need to be made. RICH: Yeah. That's John Sununu's argument, basically. I spoke to him at length for the book. And he said, listen - I mean, he's totally unapologetic about his role in this. And I said, you know, do you claim responsibility for thwarting (laughter) any chance of a solution on this? And he said, I - essentially, he said, I wish I could. But in fact, I felt that we were the only honest brokers at the table and that the other countries weren't serious - that even though it was, you know, a quote, \"binding agreement,\" essentially, what - you know, what's the country going to do if someone doesn't hit their targets? Are they going to bomb them? You know, are they going to have economic sanctions? I mean, of course not. And in fact, the leader of the delegation, Allan Bromley, who was Bush's science adviser and was kind of Sununu's man in Noordwijk - he wrote a memoir in which he essentially said the same thing, that he said that - in conversations with other delegates, other environmental ministers - at Noordwijk, he asked them, you know, how are you going to hit these targets? Do you have plans, you know, to reduce emissions by 20 percent or whatever by a certain year? And they would say - a couple of them told him, well, no, but it's just a piece of paper. And, you know, no one's going to send us to jail. And so I think, yes, it's - I think you have to take seriously that kind of cynical view. And I think you can't really take seriously Sununu's scientific opinions on this matter. But I think you can take seriously his skepticism about the power of these treaties. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Nathaniel Rich. He's the author of the new book, \"Losing Earth: A Recent History. \" We're going to take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more about climate change and why we haven't made more progress than we have. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF STEFANO BOLLANI, ET AL'S \"ALOBAR E KUDRA\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Nathaniel Rich, author of the new book \"Losing Earth: A Recent History. \" It's about climate change and why we failed to solve the problem when we had the chance. The book focuses on 1979 to '89, looking at the scientists, politicians and the oil industry, the people who were leading the efforts to change and the people who were blocking them. You said in an interview that you spent an enormous amount of time researching the oil industry and their efforts in blocking the efforts to curb carbon emissions. And you also said that it actually plays a very little part in your book. (Laughter) You didn't use much of your research. So why is that? RICH: The industry has been following this issue for a long time. You know, there are studies from Exxon or even Humble Oil - the predecessor to Exxon - going back into the mid-1950s. And even then, those studies were not about whether or not this was happening. It was really - the question was, how much of the added CO2 in the atmosphere was because of Exxon, basically, because of the fossil fuel industry? And they continued to monitor this over the decades. There were, you know, occasional sort of CO2 working groups, study groups. This was going on, also, at the American Petroleum Institute - the big trade group for the oil and gas industry - and at some of the other companies. And those efforts continued through the '80s. But it was never - during that decade - obviously, things have changed quite dramatically - but during that decade, it was never a high priority. And I spoke with a lot of people who worked in the industry during that time and people at the highest levels of API. And they really weren't concerned about it, in part because there was no serious efforts in D. C. to pass, you know, laws or policies to reduce emissions. And it wasn't really until Hansen - James Hansen, the NASA scientist - spoke before Congress in '88 and generated a huge - sort of huge national headlines that they started to worry. And the story of how they began to mobilize this multidecadal effort to sow propaganda, disinformation, to buy off politicians and scientists and, ultimately, to convert an entire political party to denialism is - the seeds of that you see emerging in the weeks and months after the Hansen hearing. But before that, it was really on the back burner. GROSS: So let's talk about how the oil industry's lobbying efforts changed at the end of the '80s, where your book ends. You write about how the American Petroleum Institute started funding a lobbying group. They formed the lobbying organization the Global Climate Coalition. And what did this lobbying group do to mobilize public opinion to be skeptical of climate science? RICH: Yeah, it's sort of a remarkable turn of events in that after Hansen's hearing, there are these high-level conversations at the American Petroleum Institute and at Exxon about, essentially, what do we do about this? It seems clear that regulation is coming. You know, George Bush is talking about it, and so on. And they essentially reached the same conclusions. They - Exxon and API - they say, we need to be an active participant in any kind of policy discussion. We need to burnish our credentials as, you know, scientific experts on the subject, so we have credibility in it. We need to make sure that the science - that the policy doesn't extend beyond what the science says. Emphasize uncertainty where it exists. That would become, you know, crucial later on. And then, perhaps most important, don't accept any policy that will hurt the bottom line. That's the beginning of it. And then, as almost an afterthought at the time, API, through its press office, which is coordinating the press for this industry group Global Climate Coalition, starts to reach out to a couple of scientists who are friendly with the industry who have expressed some doubt about either the ozone or CO2. And they start encouraging them to speak to the press. Sometimes that encouragement takes the form of payouts. The head of the API program told me they gave $2,000 to a scientist whenever he wrote an op-ed for a national publication. And that is almost an afterthought at the time. It's pretty low on the totem pole of what they're doing. They're also meeting with congressmen and so on. But it pays enormous dividends because all of a sudden, national news publications start quoting these scientists - and it's really a handful of people, four or five people - over and over again. And an issue that to this point has been a story about, you know, fear of what's going to happen, all of a sudden has two sides. And of course, that's like catnip, (laughter), for journalists. And all of a sudden, you have a number of pieces that start to appear that say maybe there's not scientific consensus about this problem. GROSS: Right. But generating controversy around climate change, where, it sounds like before, it wasn't - there weren't people denying it. There were people saying - based on your research, there were people saying, well, we don't really know for sure how bad things are going to be. Do we really want to risk the economy over science that's not kind of nailed down yet? We don't know what the consequences will be or when they'll be, exactly, so let's kind of keep the status quo as long as we can. So it goes from that to, like, the whole notion of climate change is controversial. There's two sides. So is that, like, one of the innovations of the late '80s, making it, like, controversial with two sides and one of the sides saying this science really might not be true at all? RICH: Yeah. Exactly. And it starts almost tentatively. It starts with saying, well, it's not as certain as we think, as people say, as James Hansen says it is. There's problems with the climate models, the computer models that, you know, Hansen uses. And then it goes into, we really don't know what, you know, the regional effects will be. And it grows and grows. It's almost like they're encouraged by their success, and they become more and more brazen. And then ultimately, you get, after a number of years, into the '90s, you get into this bizarro universe where, all of a sudden, they're questioning the basic fundamental science itself. And of course, that science goes back not to just 1979 but to the late 19th century about, you know, what's the effect of pumping a bunch of CO2 into the atmosphere and what warming will that cause? And so it's - we've entered this weird funhouse realm where now, if you jump ahead to the present day, you have a political party, the only major political party in the world, that endorses a position that's essentially to the right, even, of what the industry now says in their public statements. You know, Exxon publicly today doesn't deny climate change, but you have a party that does. And so it's - I think it's something that future historians will spend a lot of time piecing out, is how this sort of little lie grew into a big lie and overwhelmed our politics. GROSS: Do you think it's fair to say that the fossil fuel industry invented the idea of climate denial? RICH: Yeah. I think that's fair to say. GROSS: OK. This is interesting. You say that the industry, the fossil fuel industry, saw an upside to the warming trends of climate change. What was the upside for them? RICH: Well, there are a few. I mean, drilling in the Arctic is one of them, which you see starting to happen now. GROSS: Drilling in the Arctic because of the permafrost melting? RICH: Yeah because - yeah, the ice melting (laughter). And so that opens up shipping passages, and you can get to more oil. And of course, they were studying that back in the '80s, as well, you know, licking their chops (laughter). And but also, one of the early findings from API was that in a warmer world, you'd need more energy. Essentially, more air conditioning. And that would, you know, further industry profits. GROSS: My guest is Nathaniel Rich, author of the new book \"Losing Earth: A Recent History. \" We'll talk more about climate change, and what stood in the way of taking action to stop or slow it and how young activists today are redefining the issue after we take a short break. We'll also hear Ken Tucker's review of Billie Eilish's debut album. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Nathaniel Rich, author of the new book \"Losing Earth: A Recent History. \" It's about climate change and why we didn't take action sooner to stop or at least slow it. Rich examines the period from 1979 to 1989, a period he describes as a time before the fossil fuel industry funded scientists to create doubt about the science of climate change and before the Republican Party adopted climate denialism as a central tenet. He focuses on the scientists, activists and political leaders who pushed for measures to limit carbon emissions and the political and corporate leaders who blocked them. So we were just talking about the oil industry's role in obstructing movement forward on stopping climate change. Politicians played a strong role in this, too. One of the centerpieces of your book is the NASA scientist James Hansen testifying before Congress about carbon emissions, climate change and what we're in store for if we don't move forward. And his testimony - you can say it was suppressed. You could say it was censored. I don't know what word you want to use. But the H. W. Bush administration tried to stop him from saying what he planned on saying. Tell us who tried to do it and how. RICH: Yeah, this is something that had not been known. And one of the things I most wanted to figure out was that after Hansen testifies in 1988 - of course, and he's been testifying all decade - but in '88 he gets this huge amount of attention - and in 1989, he's due to go back. And this is right as negotiations are really getting started on a global treaty. And John Sununu is fighting this. And his testimony comes back not only with deletions but also with absurd, new language, essentially to the effect that no regulatory policy should be introduced if it at all forces the U. S. to suffer economically - of course, nothing a scientist would say in any context. And he's outraged, understandably. And he takes this testimony to Al Gore, who's then a senator and leading the hearing. And Gore calls The New York Times. And they run a huge story about it. And it becomes a major scandal. And in fact, it generates more support for climate policy than Hansen could have done by himself. And it had been unknown, you know, who was responsible for that? At the time, the White House claimed it was some bureaucrat five levels down from the top. I asked John Sununu if he knew anything about it. And he said, yeah, I did (laughter). I was responsible for it - that he told Richard Darman, the head of the OMB at the time, to censor it. He didn't think that Hansen's claims had merit. And he tried to stop it. GROSS: How much of a scientist was John Sununu? RICH: He considered himself a scientist. He considered himself. . . GROSS: On what grounds? (Laughter). RICH: . . . An old engineer. I mean, on fairly legitimate grounds. He got a Ph. D. in - I believe in fluid engineering. And he had taught. And he even taught a - he taught at MIT. He even taught a class about science and public policy. And so he still - he fashioned himself, you know, an expert and smarter than any of the scientists whose work he was reviewing. And he - because he had done some computer modeling, although of a very different sort, as a Ph. D. student, he felt that that gave him the authority to say that Hansen's computer modeling about climate - extremely sophisticated computer programs that he was running - were inaccurate and bad. And that was sort of the foundation of his argument of why, you know, this climate science stuff was made up. GROSS: So let's jump to where we are today. Let's start with President Trump and his administration. Do you consider President Trump a climate skeptic or a climate denier? (LAUGHTER)RICH: It almost seems to sort of confer too much dignity to give him either of those terms. I mean, a denier. He's certainly a denier. But you know, that's almost like - we're engaging now in a kind of fantasy realm that it is - to say, even, that he's a denier suggests that he's actually - sort of thinks about it and has weighed the science. And I don't think that's what we're really talking about when it comes to the president. GROSS: But there are people in his administration, I think, who are pretty hardcore skeptics or deniers. Who are some of those people? RICH: Oh, gee. Yeah. Well, I mean, Scott Pruitt, now deposed; Ryan Zinke, now deposed, basically - Andrew Wheeler. So the - you know, Pruitt, head of EPA, replaced by Wheeler; Zinke, the interior. Myron Ebell's sort of an old denier who's within the administration. Just about every person, I think - Rick Perry, head of energy. It's the whole party. I mean, you - I don't think - it's hard today, at least at the national level, to be a viable candidate on the right and accept scientific consensus on climate change. It's endemic. And it's - at this point, I think it's constitutional. It's a central tenet of Republicanism. GROSS: So one of President Trump's first actions was to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement on climate change. What are some of his other - what are some of the other things he's done to block any momentum forward on stopping - on limiting carbon emissions? RICH: Oh, trying to roll back just about every, you know, policy that President Obama introduced, trying to roll back clean air standards, emissions from coal factories, mileage standards - CAFE standards, they're called - you name it, all-out assault. And not just on climate but on any kind of environmental protection, I should say. And you know, I guess the only silver lining is that something like the Paris accord, it's - you know, he can withdraw, but the formal withdrawal doesn't happen for a couple of years, and even then the treaty is voluntary to begin with, so it's more of a political statement than anything else. But rolling back emission standards is probably at the top of the list of the bad things that are going on. But I think more destructive is just this peddling of this kind of - this fantasy, and essentially - I mean, it's connected to a lot of other stuff you see in the administration, a basic affront on objective reality, and you see that extends beyond the climate conversation and into, you know, the conversation we're having about news and reporting and historical fact and all the rest. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you. If you're just joining us, my guest is Nathaniel Rich, and his new book is called \"Losing Earth: A Recent History. \" We'll talk more about climate change after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF GERALD CLAYTON'S \"ENVISIONINGS\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Nathaniel Rich, author of the new book, \"Losing Earth: A Recent History. \" It's about climate change and why we failed to solve the problem when we maybe had the chance. The book focuses on 1979 to '89, looking at the scientists, the politicians and the fossil fuel industry, looking at the people leading the efforts to change and the people blocking those efforts. One of the things I know you've thought about a lot is what is the best way to motivate change at the political level and also just at the behavioral level, but - what we do in our daily lives? Is it through terrifying people with apocalyptic scenarios? Like, what is the best way to motivate change? What are some of your thoughts about that? RICH: Yeah, this has been a big debate, particularly within the activist community, for a while now about - you know, it's essentially a marketing question; how do we get people to care about this problem and prioritize it? And is fear the best approach? Is hope and, you know, inspiring people? I think that the trend has been towards the latter more. I feel like. . . GROSS: Toward hope? RICH: Towards hope, you know, that people need positive stories. . . GROSS: But one of books on the bestseller list now is a book by David Wallace-Wells who spells out really terrifying scenarios about what will happen if we don't, you know, seriously limit carbon emissions. And I think people are very interested in that book, judging by its place on the bestseller list. RICH: Yeah, I think David's made a really valuable contribution there, and it's an honest book. But I think this whole conversation between, you know, hope or despair is itself a kind of - sort of an entry-level engagement with the issue, and I think it's a particularly an American phenomenon. I don't think, you know, the Germans are maybe particularly optimistic or Scandinavians. You know, some of these countries that are way ahead of us in terms of climate policy, I don't think they force-feed hope to their citizens to get them to care about the issue. And I feel like we're adults here (laughter), and we should be able to talk about both the worst-case scenarios and some, you know, optimistic, hopeful things that are going on and talk about the complexity of the issue and, you know, talk about not only our hopes for the future but our failures to this point and our democracy's failures to this point. And there's no - to reduce it down to hope versus fear itself seems to me kind of a form of dishonesty, and I think - you know, I'm all for activists figuring out the best way to motivate people to vote, but I think there's more to the story than that, and that's what I've tried to write about. GROSS: Do you think the hope versus despair motivational debate has to do with the fact that forward momentum has been blocked from so many directions - from the industry, from climate deniers, from, you know, politicians - and so the obstacles to moving forward are so great that something very motivational has to be done to counteract that through hope or despair? RICH: Yeah, I think there's a huge amount of bitterness and frustration among people who care about this issue, you know. GROSS: Because - I just want to say, to elaborate on what I was saying, that the countries that - other countries you mentioned, they don't have climate deniers. . . RICH: Right. GROSS: . . . Who are saying, hey, this isn't even a thing; this is just, like, fake science. RICH: Yeah, and that's true. And I think what's interesting now about the way the conversation has turned in recent months - I mean, really since the midterms - is you have this major youth movement emerging. You see it in talk of a Green New Deal; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's, you know, speeches about it; you see it coming from the students in the Sunrise Movement when they sat in in Nancy Pelosi's office after the election to demand climate action; you see it in these student walkouts; Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old Swedish girl who's been leading and has become a global phenomenon. Those students, those people, those young people and the young leaders are no longer, you know, worried about, you know, engaging into this denialist thing; they're making a different kind of argument. They're saying that failure to act is harming us, is killing us, that you, you know, elders who are failing to act are stealing our future away from us. And that inaction at this point is not only stupid, which is what sort of activists have been saying forever, but is wrong, is morally wrong, and it undermines the very basis of our society. And I think that's a more powerful argument, and I frankly think politically that's a more powerful argument as well. I think it's also a more honest argument. They are appealing to a moral high ground. And I think that's enormously powerful. GROSS: And making it a life-and-death issue. Would you describe what you think the major takeaways are from the Green New Deal that was proposed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ed Markey? RICH: Yeah. Well, you know, it's a statement of principles primarily. It's not a law. It's not a bill. In some ways, it's - in some of the particulars, it's less ambitious than bills that were proposed and introduced into Congress at the end of the '80s by both Republicans and Democrats. But I think what distinguishes it and what makes it a truly transformational document is that it identifies the climate crisis as connected to every form, essentially, of social injustice that we have. And I think that's the only honest way of looking at it. You know, climate change victimizes the victimized. You know, it oppresses the oppressed. So the worse off you are - the more marginalized you are, the worse you're going to suffer from what's coming. And so it's extremely valuable in that it says that, you know, climate change is not just one item on this sort of menu of political items, but it's the one that encompasses them all and that there's no such thing as - you know, you can't have social justice if there's not climate justice. You can't have a civil society if - a stable society if you don't have a stable climate. And I think that's a profound argument and an honest one. It puts it into moral terms in a way that is new in Washington. And I think that is enormously valuable. You know, you can get into the debate about how best to achieve certain goals, and those are important policy debates to have. But it's reframed the issue dramatically and, I think, critically. GROSS: OK. So you're 39. What are the things you're most concerned about seeing in terms of climate change in your lifetime and in your children's lifetime? RICH: I think the most immediate way that we will feel this, as members of one of the wealthiest countries in the world, is the effect on geopolitical instability. When you have huge stresses on people, particularly in the developing world, who can no longer live the place they've been living, they have to leave. And I think you'd see. . . GROSS: Because of drought or floods. RICH: So drought - yeah, drought or flood. So I think the projections have it that there'll be enormous spikes in, you know, migration all over the world. It's already started, of course. But it will only become more intense. And when you have huge masses of people moving from, you know, like, one country to another, one region to another, it introduces enormous amounts of stress. And essentially, what we're talking about is - war is the ultimate outcome there. And so the fear then becomes of some kind of major global war that's sparked by stresses from climate change. GROSS: Nathaniel Rich, thank you so much for talking with us. RICH: Thanks for having me. GROSS: Nathaniel Rich is the author of the new book \"Losing Earth: A Recent History. \"After we take a short break, rock critic Ken Tucker will review the new album by the 17-year-old singer Billie Eilish. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF JAMES HUNTER'S \"I'LL WALK AWAY\") TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. As we deal with more extreme weather around the world and hear more dire reports about the future impact of climate change, you have to wonder, why didn't we succeed in taking preventive measures sooner, before things had progressed? That's one of the key questions my guest Nathaniel Rich tries to answer in his new book, \"Losing Earth: A Recent History. \" It's an expanded version of his report that the New York Times magazine devoted an entire issue to last August. He focuses on the period from 1979 to '89, a period he describes as a time before the fossil fuel industry funded scientists to create doubt about the science of climate change and before the Republican Party adopted climate denialism as a central tenet. He focuses on the scientists, activists and political leaders who pushed for measures to limit carbon emissions and the political and corporate leaders who blocked them. We're also going to talk about where we are now with a president who doubts the science and a growing movement of young people insisting on action reversing the path we're on. Nathaniel Rich, welcome to FRESH AIR. How much worse has the climate change problem gotten since your book ends in 1989? NATHANIEL RICH: More carbon dioxide has been emitted into the atmosphere since the final page of the book basically, since the end of 1989, than in the history of civilization preceding it. So it's gotten a lot worse. Obviously, the political situation's gotten a lot worse as well. It's become a starkly partisan issue. I don't have to tell anyone that. And it seems like we are much further from a solution than we were 30 years ago. GROSS: You write that, now, a long-term disaster is the best-case scenario. Would you explain that? RICH: Yeah. Well, a certain amount of warming is baked in. And that's, you know, referring to some of the projections about 1 1/2 or 2 degrees Celsius warming above historical means, and there's all kinds of horrific scenarios that come with that. Of course, that's not nearly as bad as, you know, 3 degrees or 4 degrees or 5 degrees warming. But even when we talk about it in those terms, in sort of half degrees or full degrees warming, it's almost euphemistic because there's there's such dramatic differences even between, you know, 2 degrees and 2. 1 degrees, 2. 1 degrees and 2. 2 degrees. And I think one of the lies, sort of convenient dishonesties we have about the issue, one of the more benign ones, I guess, is that we think of it almost, like, in Hollywood terms, like, either we're going to win this thing, or we're going to suffer a crushing defeat. But of course, there's a huge range of outcomes in between. And at this point - yeah - where we're at, ranging from the not very good to the apocalyptic, but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't try to better our situation as much as possible. GROSS: Is there a moment when you think we came really close to seriously cutting back on the carbon emissions that are responsible for climate change during the period that you write about, '79 to '89? RICH: Absolutely. From from '79 to '89, there are a series of efforts, escalating efforts, to first bring the issue to the attention of the powers that be, people at the highest levels of the federal government, and then to bring it to the public to generate public concern. And finally, in the middle of the decade, a solution materializes, which is a global treaty to reduce emissions that would be binding. And it's modeled after the ozone treaty that's then in process. And by the end of the decade, we've reached the point of high-level diplomatic meetings to negotiate this binding global treaty. And we get to the precipice of an agreement on the framework of this treaty. And at the very last second, the U. S. pulls out, the story I tell in the book. And so I think that, at least on paper, that's the closest we've come. I think you could have a reasonable, you know, debate about whether or not, if the U. S. did sign the treaty, they would have lived up - we would've lived up to the terms of it, whether other countries would have lived up to the terms of it even if it was binding. And that's a more, you know, complicated conversation to have. I think, at the very least, we'd be a lot further ahead than we are now. That seems indisputable. GROSS: So what year did the U. S. pull out of this treaty? Who is the president, and why did we pull out? RICH: So it's 1989. President is George H. W. Bush. And the previous summer, James Hansen, a NASA scientist who had become essentially the face of climate science, gave testimony before Congress in which he said, global warming is here. It's no longer a theory. We're seeing evidence of warming in global temperatures. It was the hottest summer in American history at the time. And the story became a - it became a major public national story and to the point that even George Bush on the campaign stump gave speeches about it, was making promises that, as president, he would solve the problem then called the greenhouse effect as well. And he said, you know, those who think we can't solve the greenhouse effect haven't heard about the White House effect. And when I'm in the White House, you know, we'll solve it. And he gets to the White House. James Baker, who's the new secretary of state, in his first major speech at the State Department, he invites the IPCC, the international organization under the auspices of the United Nations that's drafting - begins drafting a treaty. They have one of their first meetings at the State Department. And he endorses this program. And over the course of the year, you get to a meeting in Noordwijk in the Netherlands, a kind of coastal town on the North Sea. That's the first high-level diplomatic meeting of - it's of environmental ministers from all over the world. Sixty-five countries or so come there. And there's a general sense that everyone's going to sign essentially a letter of intent that they will pursue a binding treaty to reduce global emissions. And at that meeting, the U. S. pulls out. And the reason, at least the narrow political reason for that, is that over the course of that year, there had been a huge fight within the administration between William Riley, the head of Bush's EPA, and John Sununu, his chief of staff. And Sununu was highly skeptical of the science and suspicious of the motives of this treaty. And he was ultimately more powerful and won the argument, essentially, and was able to force the U. S. delegation to not accept anything that was binding. And at that point, the treaty became watered down. GROSS: Do you think that some of these treaties are almost like masquerades where countries show up, and they look really great - like, we're going to do it - we're going to sign it - and then, at the last minute, you pull out? Like, it's almost like a game of chicken. Like, nobody really wants to do it, but everybody's waiting for somebody else to pull out - that no one really has the political will to make the sacrifices that need to be made. RICH: Yeah. That's John Sununu's argument, basically. I spoke to him at length for the book. And he said, listen - I mean, he's totally unapologetic about his role in this. And I said, you know, do you claim responsibility for thwarting (laughter) any chance of a solution on this? And he said, I - essentially, he said, I wish I could. But in fact, I felt that we were the only honest brokers at the table and that the other countries weren't serious - that even though it was, you know, a quote, \"binding agreement,\" essentially, what - you know, what's the country going to do if someone doesn't hit their targets? Are they going to bomb them? You know, are they going to have economic sanctions? I mean, of course not. And in fact, the leader of the delegation, Allan Bromley, who was Bush's science adviser and was kind of Sununu's man in Noordwijk - he wrote a memoir in which he essentially said the same thing, that he said that - in conversations with other delegates, other environmental ministers - at Noordwijk, he asked them, you know, how are you going to hit these targets? Do you have plans, you know, to reduce emissions by 20 percent or whatever by a certain year? And they would say - a couple of them told him, well, no, but it's just a piece of paper. And, you know, no one's going to send us to jail. And so I think, yes, it's - I think you have to take seriously that kind of cynical view. And I think you can't really take seriously Sununu's scientific opinions on this matter. But I think you can take seriously his skepticism about the power of these treaties. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Nathaniel Rich. He's the author of the new book, \"Losing Earth: A Recent History. \" We're going to take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more about climate change and why we haven't made more progress than we have. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF STEFANO BOLLANI, ET AL'S \"ALOBAR E KUDRA\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Nathaniel Rich, author of the new book \"Losing Earth: A Recent History. \" It's about climate change and why we failed to solve the problem when we had the chance. The book focuses on 1979 to '89, looking at the scientists, politicians and the oil industry, the people who were leading the efforts to change and the people who were blocking them. You said in an interview that you spent an enormous amount of time researching the oil industry and their efforts in blocking the efforts to curb carbon emissions. And you also said that it actually plays a very little part in your book. (Laughter) You didn't use much of your research. So why is that? RICH: The industry has been following this issue for a long time. You know, there are studies from Exxon or even Humble Oil - the predecessor to Exxon - going back into the mid-1950s. And even then, those studies were not about whether or not this was happening. It was really - the question was, how much of the added CO2 in the atmosphere was because of Exxon, basically, because of the fossil fuel industry? And they continued to monitor this over the decades. There were, you know, occasional sort of CO2 working groups, study groups. This was going on, also, at the American Petroleum Institute - the big trade group for the oil and gas industry - and at some of the other companies. And those efforts continued through the '80s. But it was never - during that decade - obviously, things have changed quite dramatically - but during that decade, it was never a high priority. And I spoke with a lot of people who worked in the industry during that time and people at the highest levels of API. And they really weren't concerned about it, in part because there was no serious efforts in D. C. to pass, you know, laws or policies to reduce emissions. And it wasn't really until Hansen - James Hansen, the NASA scientist - spoke before Congress in '88 and generated a huge - sort of huge national headlines that they started to worry. And the story of how they began to mobilize this multidecadal effort to sow propaganda, disinformation, to buy off politicians and scientists and, ultimately, to convert an entire political party to denialism is - the seeds of that you see emerging in the weeks and months after the Hansen hearing. But before that, it was really on the back burner. GROSS: So let's talk about how the oil industry's lobbying efforts changed at the end of the '80s, where your book ends. You write about how the American Petroleum Institute started funding a lobbying group. They formed the lobbying organization the Global Climate Coalition. And what did this lobbying group do to mobilize public opinion to be skeptical of climate science? RICH: Yeah, it's sort of a remarkable turn of events in that after Hansen's hearing, there are these high-level conversations at the American Petroleum Institute and at Exxon about, essentially, what do we do about this? It seems clear that regulation is coming. You know, George Bush is talking about it, and so on. And they essentially reached the same conclusions. They - Exxon and API - they say, we need to be an active participant in any kind of policy discussion. We need to burnish our credentials as, you know, scientific experts on the subject, so we have credibility in it. We need to make sure that the science - that the policy doesn't extend beyond what the science says. Emphasize uncertainty where it exists. That would become, you know, crucial later on. And then, perhaps most important, don't accept any policy that will hurt the bottom line. That's the beginning of it. And then, as almost an afterthought at the time, API, through its press office, which is coordinating the press for this industry group Global Climate Coalition, starts to reach out to a couple of scientists who are friendly with the industry who have expressed some doubt about either the ozone or CO2. And they start encouraging them to speak to the press. Sometimes that encouragement takes the form of payouts. The head of the API program told me they gave $2,000 to a scientist whenever he wrote an op-ed for a national publication. And that is almost an afterthought at the time. It's pretty low on the totem pole of what they're doing. They're also meeting with congressmen and so on. But it pays enormous dividends because all of a sudden, national news publications start quoting these scientists - and it's really a handful of people, four or five people - over and over again. And an issue that to this point has been a story about, you know, fear of what's going to happen, all of a sudden has two sides. And of course, that's like catnip, (laughter), for journalists. And all of a sudden, you have a number of pieces that start to appear that say maybe there's not scientific consensus about this problem. GROSS: Right. But generating controversy around climate change, where, it sounds like before, it wasn't - there weren't people denying it. There were people saying - based on your research, there were people saying, well, we don't really know for sure how bad things are going to be. Do we really want to risk the economy over science that's not kind of nailed down yet? We don't know what the consequences will be or when they'll be, exactly, so let's kind of keep the status quo as long as we can. So it goes from that to, like, the whole notion of climate change is controversial. There's two sides. So is that, like, one of the innovations of the late '80s, making it, like, controversial with two sides and one of the sides saying this science really might not be true at all? RICH: Yeah. Exactly. And it starts almost tentatively. It starts with saying, well, it's not as certain as we think, as people say, as James Hansen says it is. There's problems with the climate models, the computer models that, you know, Hansen uses. And then it goes into, we really don't know what, you know, the regional effects will be. And it grows and grows. It's almost like they're encouraged by their success, and they become more and more brazen. And then ultimately, you get, after a number of years, into the '90s, you get into this bizarro universe where, all of a sudden, they're questioning the basic fundamental science itself. And of course, that science goes back not to just 1979 but to the late 19th century about, you know, what's the effect of pumping a bunch of CO2 into the atmosphere and what warming will that cause? And so it's - we've entered this weird funhouse realm where now, if you jump ahead to the present day, you have a political party, the only major political party in the world, that endorses a position that's essentially to the right, even, of what the industry now says in their public statements. You know, Exxon publicly today doesn't deny climate change, but you have a party that does. And so it's - I think it's something that future historians will spend a lot of time piecing out, is how this sort of little lie grew into a big lie and overwhelmed our politics. GROSS: Do you think it's fair to say that the fossil fuel industry invented the idea of climate denial? RICH: Yeah. I think that's fair to say. GROSS: OK. This is interesting. You say that the industry, the fossil fuel industry, saw an upside to the warming trends of climate change. What was the upside for them? RICH: Well, there are a few. I mean, drilling in the Arctic is one of them, which you see starting to happen now. GROSS: Drilling in the Arctic because of the permafrost melting? RICH: Yeah because - yeah, the ice melting (laughter). And so that opens up shipping passages, and you can get to more oil. And of course, they were studying that back in the '80s, as well, you know, licking their chops (laughter). And but also, one of the early findings from API was that in a warmer world, you'd need more energy. Essentially, more air conditioning. And that would, you know, further industry profits. GROSS: My guest is Nathaniel Rich, author of the new book \"Losing Earth: A Recent History. \" We'll talk more about climate change, and what stood in the way of taking action to stop or slow it and how young activists today are redefining the issue after we take a short break. We'll also hear Ken Tucker's review of Billie Eilish's debut album. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Nathaniel Rich, author of the new book \"Losing Earth: A Recent History. \" It's about climate change and why we didn't take action sooner to stop or at least slow it. Rich examines the period from 1979 to 1989, a period he describes as a time before the fossil fuel industry funded scientists to create doubt about the science of climate change and before the Republican Party adopted climate denialism as a central tenet. He focuses on the scientists, activists and political leaders who pushed for measures to limit carbon emissions and the political and corporate leaders who blocked them. So we were just talking about the oil industry's role in obstructing movement forward on stopping climate change. Politicians played a strong role in this, too. One of the centerpieces of your book is the NASA scientist James Hansen testifying before Congress about carbon emissions, climate change and what we're in store for if we don't move forward. And his testimony - you can say it was suppressed. You could say it was censored. I don't know what word you want to use. But the H. W. Bush administration tried to stop him from saying what he planned on saying. Tell us who tried to do it and how. RICH: Yeah, this is something that had not been known. And one of the things I most wanted to figure out was that after Hansen testifies in 1988 - of course, and he's been testifying all decade - but in '88 he gets this huge amount of attention - and in 1989, he's due to go back. And this is right as negotiations are really getting started on a global treaty. And John Sununu is fighting this. And his testimony comes back not only with deletions but also with absurd, new language, essentially to the effect that no regulatory policy should be introduced if it at all forces the U. S. to suffer economically - of course, nothing a scientist would say in any context. And he's outraged, understandably. And he takes this testimony to Al Gore, who's then a senator and leading the hearing. And Gore calls The New York Times. And they run a huge story about it. And it becomes a major scandal. And in fact, it generates more support for climate policy than Hansen could have done by himself. And it had been unknown, you know, who was responsible for that? At the time, the White House claimed it was some bureaucrat five levels down from the top. I asked John Sununu if he knew anything about it. And he said, yeah, I did (laughter). I was responsible for it - that he told Richard Darman, the head of the OMB at the time, to censor it. He didn't think that Hansen's claims had merit. And he tried to stop it. GROSS: How much of a scientist was John Sununu? RICH: He considered himself a scientist. He considered himself. . . GROSS: On what grounds? (Laughter). RICH: . . . An old engineer. I mean, on fairly legitimate grounds. He got a Ph. D. in - I believe in fluid engineering. And he had taught. And he even taught a - he taught at MIT. He even taught a class about science and public policy. And so he still - he fashioned himself, you know, an expert and smarter than any of the scientists whose work he was reviewing. And he - because he had done some computer modeling, although of a very different sort, as a Ph. D. student, he felt that that gave him the authority to say that Hansen's computer modeling about climate - extremely sophisticated computer programs that he was running - were inaccurate and bad. And that was sort of the foundation of his argument of why, you know, this climate science stuff was made up. GROSS: So let's jump to where we are today. Let's start with President Trump and his administration. Do you consider President Trump a climate skeptic or a climate denier? (LAUGHTER) RICH: It almost seems to sort of confer too much dignity to give him either of those terms. I mean, a denier. He's certainly a denier. But you know, that's almost like - we're engaging now in a kind of fantasy realm that it is - to say, even, that he's a denier suggests that he's actually - sort of thinks about it and has weighed the science. And I don't think that's what we're really talking about when it comes to the president. GROSS: But there are people in his administration, I think, who are pretty hardcore skeptics or deniers. Who are some of those people? RICH: Oh, gee. Yeah. Well, I mean, Scott Pruitt, now deposed; Ryan Zinke, now deposed, basically - Andrew Wheeler. So the - you know, Pruitt, head of EPA, replaced by Wheeler; Zinke, the interior. Myron Ebell's sort of an old denier who's within the administration. Just about every person, I think - Rick Perry, head of energy. It's the whole party. I mean, you - I don't think - it's hard today, at least at the national level, to be a viable candidate on the right and accept scientific consensus on climate change. It's endemic. And it's - at this point, I think it's constitutional. It's a central tenet of Republicanism. GROSS: So one of President Trump's first actions was to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement on climate change. What are some of his other - what are some of the other things he's done to block any momentum forward on stopping - on limiting carbon emissions? RICH: Oh, trying to roll back just about every, you know, policy that President Obama introduced, trying to roll back clean air standards, emissions from coal factories, mileage standards - CAFE standards, they're called - you name it, all-out assault. And not just on climate but on any kind of environmental protection, I should say. And you know, I guess the only silver lining is that something like the Paris accord, it's - you know, he can withdraw, but the formal withdrawal doesn't happen for a couple of years, and even then the treaty is voluntary to begin with, so it's more of a political statement than anything else. But rolling back emission standards is probably at the top of the list of the bad things that are going on. But I think more destructive is just this peddling of this kind of - this fantasy, and essentially - I mean, it's connected to a lot of other stuff you see in the administration, a basic affront on objective reality, and you see that extends beyond the climate conversation and into, you know, the conversation we're having about news and reporting and historical fact and all the rest. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you. If you're just joining us, my guest is Nathaniel Rich, and his new book is called \"Losing Earth: A Recent History. \" We'll talk more about climate change after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF GERALD CLAYTON'S \"ENVISIONINGS\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Nathaniel Rich, author of the new book, \"Losing Earth: A Recent History. \" It's about climate change and why we failed to solve the problem when we maybe had the chance. The book focuses on 1979 to '89, looking at the scientists, the politicians and the fossil fuel industry, looking at the people leading the efforts to change and the people blocking those efforts. One of the things I know you've thought about a lot is what is the best way to motivate change at the political level and also just at the behavioral level, but - what we do in our daily lives? Is it through terrifying people with apocalyptic scenarios? Like, what is the best way to motivate change? What are some of your thoughts about that? RICH: Yeah, this has been a big debate, particularly within the activist community, for a while now about - you know, it's essentially a marketing question; how do we get people to care about this problem and prioritize it? And is fear the best approach? Is hope and, you know, inspiring people? I think that the trend has been towards the latter more. I feel like. . . GROSS: Toward hope? RICH: Towards hope, you know, that people need positive stories. . . GROSS: But one of books on the bestseller list now is a book by David Wallace-Wells who spells out really terrifying scenarios about what will happen if we don't, you know, seriously limit carbon emissions. And I think people are very interested in that book, judging by its place on the bestseller list. RICH: Yeah, I think David's made a really valuable contribution there, and it's an honest book. But I think this whole conversation between, you know, hope or despair is itself a kind of - sort of an entry-level engagement with the issue, and I think it's a particularly an American phenomenon. I don't think, you know, the Germans are maybe particularly optimistic or Scandinavians. You know, some of these countries that are way ahead of us in terms of climate policy, I don't think they force-feed hope to their citizens to get them to care about the issue. And I feel like we're adults here (laughter), and we should be able to talk about both the worst-case scenarios and some, you know, optimistic, hopeful things that are going on and talk about the complexity of the issue and, you know, talk about not only our hopes for the future but our failures to this point and our democracy's failures to this point. And there's no - to reduce it down to hope versus fear itself seems to me kind of a form of dishonesty, and I think - you know, I'm all for activists figuring out the best way to motivate people to vote, but I think there's more to the story than that, and that's what I've tried to write about. GROSS: Do you think the hope versus despair motivational debate has to do with the fact that forward momentum has been blocked from so many directions - from the industry, from climate deniers, from, you know, politicians - and so the obstacles to moving forward are so great that something very motivational has to be done to counteract that through hope or despair? RICH: Yeah, I think there's a huge amount of bitterness and frustration among people who care about this issue, you know. GROSS: Because - I just want to say, to elaborate on what I was saying, that the countries that - other countries you mentioned, they don't have climate deniers. . . RICH: Right. GROSS: . . . Who are saying, hey, this isn't even a thing; this is just, like, fake science. RICH: Yeah, and that's true. And I think what's interesting now about the way the conversation has turned in recent months - I mean, really since the midterms - is you have this major youth movement emerging. You see it in talk of a Green New Deal; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's, you know, speeches about it; you see it coming from the students in the Sunrise Movement when they sat in in Nancy Pelosi's office after the election to demand climate action; you see it in these student walkouts; Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old Swedish girl who's been leading and has become a global phenomenon. Those students, those people, those young people and the young leaders are no longer, you know, worried about, you know, engaging into this denialist thing; they're making a different kind of argument. They're saying that failure to act is harming us, is killing us, that you, you know, elders who are failing to act are stealing our future away from us. And that inaction at this point is not only stupid, which is what sort of activists have been saying forever, but is wrong, is morally wrong, and it undermines the very basis of our society. And I think that's a more powerful argument, and I frankly think politically that's a more powerful argument as well. I think it's also a more honest argument. They are appealing to a moral high ground. And I think that's enormously powerful. GROSS: And making it a life-and-death issue. Would you describe what you think the major takeaways are from the Green New Deal that was proposed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ed Markey? RICH: Yeah. Well, you know, it's a statement of principles primarily. It's not a law. It's not a bill. In some ways, it's - in some of the particulars, it's less ambitious than bills that were proposed and introduced into Congress at the end of the '80s by both Republicans and Democrats. But I think what distinguishes it and what makes it a truly transformational document is that it identifies the climate crisis as connected to every form, essentially, of social injustice that we have. And I think that's the only honest way of looking at it. You know, climate change victimizes the victimized. You know, it oppresses the oppressed. So the worse off you are - the more marginalized you are, the worse you're going to suffer from what's coming. And so it's extremely valuable in that it says that, you know, climate change is not just one item on this sort of menu of political items, but it's the one that encompasses them all and that there's no such thing as - you know, you can't have social justice if there's not climate justice. You can't have a civil society if - a stable society if you don't have a stable climate. And I think that's a profound argument and an honest one. It puts it into moral terms in a way that is new in Washington. And I think that is enormously valuable. You know, you can get into the debate about how best to achieve certain goals, and those are important policy debates to have. But it's reframed the issue dramatically and, I think, critically. GROSS: OK. So you're 39. What are the things you're most concerned about seeing in terms of climate change in your lifetime and in your children's lifetime? RICH: I think the most immediate way that we will feel this, as members of one of the wealthiest countries in the world, is the effect on geopolitical instability. When you have huge stresses on people, particularly in the developing world, who can no longer live the place they've been living, they have to leave. And I think you'd see. . . GROSS: Because of drought or floods. RICH: So drought - yeah, drought or flood. So I think the projections have it that there'll be enormous spikes in, you know, migration all over the world. It's already started, of course. But it will only become more intense. And when you have huge masses of people moving from, you know, like, one country to another, one region to another, it introduces enormous amounts of stress. And essentially, what we're talking about is - war is the ultimate outcome there. And so the fear then becomes of some kind of major global war that's sparked by stresses from climate change. GROSS: Nathaniel Rich, thank you so much for talking with us. RICH: Thanks for having me.

It breaks into tiny pieces. It ends up in the dust in our homes and in rivers and lakes and oceans. Steve Allen at the University of Strathclyde in Scotland wondered if it also goes up into the sky. STEVE ALLEN: I don't know if you've ever seen a plastic bag on a fence flapping away until it disappears. We thought that maybe it didn't just disappear, and we started to look for it a bit higher up. JOYCE: Four and a half thousand feet up a mountain in a remote part of the French Pyrenees, in fact. Allen's team set up collectors there for five months to trap plastic particles as they fell to earth. S ALLEN: We expected to find some. We didn't expect to find quite as much as we did. JOYCE: Three hundred and sixty five plastic particles fell on a square meter collector every day. Allen was surprised by that. S ALLEN: We kind of expected it to be in a city getting blown around, but way out there just was - the numbers was astounding. JOYCE: Writing in the journal Nature Geoscience, the researchers found several types of microplastic floating on the wind, fibers from clothing and bits from plastic bags, plastic film and packaging material. But they don't know where the particles come from geographically. DEONIE ALLEN: We know basically nothing about how they move.

Only a few small villages lie within the nearest 60 miles of the collection site. Yet the density of the microplastics collected in the mountains is comparable to that found over the megacities of Paris and Dongguan in China, where similar studies have been done. Deonie Allen says if this much microplastic manages to get halfway up the Pyrenees mountains, it could theoretically be everywhere. D ALLEN: We also don't know what they do to humans.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:  But among the high-definition scenes of tropical reefs and lions on the hunt, there are some images you don't often see in these kinds of shows - those tropical reefs bleached into white bonescapes. Glaciers crumble into arctic seas. CORNISH: While other nature programs might make passing reference to the impact of humans, that message is at the center of \"Our Planet. \" Here's how the narrator, David Attenborough, puts it in the opening sequence. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"OUR PLANET\")DAVID ATTENBOROUGH: This series will celebrate the natural wonders that remain and reveal what we must preserve to ensure people and nature thrive. CHANG: Our co-host Ari Shapiro spoke with the series producer of \"Our Planet,\" Alastair Fothergill. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: You've been responsible for some of the most high-profile nature documentaries of the last decade - \"Planet Earth,\" \"Blue Planet,\" \"Frozen Planet. \" Tell us what made the mission of this one different. ALASTAIR FOTHERGILL: We decided way back, actually, in 2012 the time had come to try and do a series which would be as entertaining and as accessible as series like \"Planet Earth\" but for the first time deal in-depth with the challenges that our planet faces. There's no doubt that, you know, it is seriously under threat. And we felt that it was a story that urgently needed telling now. SHAPIRO: I imagine those threats are inescapable when you're filming any kind of nature documentary. Had you tried to include that narrative in some of the other shows you'd produced and been unable to? FOTHERGILL: To be honest, yes, it was difficult in the past to get broadcasters to include environmental messaging. And even with \"Our Planet,\" we've been very careful not just to film destruction. We've filmed the beauties, the amazing stuff that's still there because, you know, the planet is still, in many places, very healthy. And the important thing is that nature has an amazing ability to bounce back. SHAPIRO: Can you give us an example of a time that you thought, oh, maybe that goes a little too far; we need to pull it back a little bit and not make people feel quite so bleak, necessarily? FOTHERGILL: Well, there is an absolutely extraordinary sequence of walrus in the Arctic Ocean. SHAPIRO: I was going to ask about the walruses, yeah. FOTHERGILL: We went to film what's called a haul-out, where these animals - walrus - prefer to live out on the sea ice. They don't like coming to land. But in recent years, as the sea ice in the summer has declined, they've been hauling-out. And we saw a haul-out of over 110,000 walrus. And so desperate were they for space that some of them climbed up cliffs 100 meters up. These animals have very bad eyesight. And once they got to the top, they could hear their compatriots at sea, going back to sea. And in desperation, they leap off the cliff to their death. SHAPIRO: It's an incredibly disturbing sequence in the second episode. I mean, to be frank, I know more than one person who watched that sequence and said, I can't continue to watch the program. Were you afraid it would have that impact? FOTHERGILL: Of course we were. In editing it, we were very, very careful. There was a lot more of walrus falling off those cliffs than we showed, and we tried to balance it. But, you know, climate change is happening. And there are people that deny it. And I think it's very, very important that you really make people realize that it's not something that's going to happen in 10 and 20 years. It's happening now in the natural world. SHAPIRO: Many of the events you capture in this program occur once a year, maybe once a decade. What was it like to calendar this out as you started to make plans for what you wanted to include? FOTHERGILL: We spent a whole year planning, talking to scientists, talking to conservationists, deciding on our stories. And then we filmed over three years. And we spend a record 3,500 days in the field. To give you an idea, that means for every final minute of the show you watch, we spent 10 days in the field. SHAPIRO: It makes me feel bad for the moments that I reached for popcorn, given all the work that went into it. (LAUGHTER)FOTHERGILL: You know, but we were very specific. You know, although the animals don't read the script, we have a very, very organized and planned script. And we knew exactly the narrative that we wanted to tell. SHAPIRO: Wait; so you're saying that when you decide you're going to profile this particular animal, you know you want a hunt scene, but for that animal, you want a procreation scene? FOTHERGILL: Yes. What is very important to us is that each individual episode tell a bigger story about each individual habitat because what's very interesting is the challenges to their habitats, the threats to the habitats. And the solutions to those habitats differ depending on whether it's the open ocean, the tropical forest or the coniferous forest. SHAPIRO: There's a lot of footage that's never been seen before in this program, from a sequence with a Siberian tiger to an Australian lake that only fills up once a decade. Is there one scene in particular that you are really proud of having captured? FOTHERGILL: I think the Siberian tiger is a wonderful achievement. It's the first intimate images of these amazing cats in the wild. And to give you a sense of how difficult it was, over two winters, three cameramen were literally locked away inside wooden hides. They didn't come out for six weeks. Everything you need to do to survive they did inside this small box. SHAPIRO: Really? FOTHERGILL: And they worked for two winters. They got one, single shot of a wild Siberian tiger. At the same time, we had about 40 motion control cameras - remote cameras that are set off by the moving animal. And again, the first winter, we got nothing, really. We got lynx going past, other animals of the forest. But over that period, we began to see the movements of the tigers - how they were moving in that area. And the second season, we got 36 precious, precious images. For me, it's a wonderfully emblematic sequence of a wonderfully rare, wild, iconic species of the boreal forest. SHAPIRO: Because you have described the excruciating lengths that you went to to get some of these images, I have to ask whether there were certain images or behaviors that you really wanted to get and just weren't able to. FOTHERGILL: You know, failure is my job. And we failed a lot. Often, to get the sequence, we'd go one season, as I described with the Siberian tiger, back and back and back. And, yes, there are things that we still have to do and still have to film, which is great because I've still got a little life in me. SHAPIRO: On to the next one. FOTHERGILL: On to the next project, yes. (LAUGHTER)SHAPIRO: The final episode of the series has, probably, the most disheartening sequence, and also the most hopeful. This is the episode about forests. The sequence in Madagascar shows these incredible animals in a forest that we learn at the end of the sequence has since been destroyed. FOTHERGILL: The patch of forest where we were filming was destroyed by the end of our filming period, yes. It was desperately, desperately sad. I mean, you know, Madagascar is a poor country. There's a lot of pressure. People need land. But the traditional forest - there's only 3 percent left. It's got so many precious, precious animals there. We really need to help those people to preserve the lemurs and all the wonderful forest that they live in. SHAPIRO: And then we go to Chernobyl at the end of this episode about forests. And this is a story of hope. FOTHERGILL: It is. Thirty-three years ago, of course, famously, the reactor at Chernobyl exploded. It was probably the greatest environmental disaster in living memory. And 30 years later, we will go back. And amazingly, the forest - the resilient forest - has overtaken Chernobyl. It's a green oasis now. And because people can't go there for very long because of the radiation - it's dangerous for us to stay there for a long period - it's been left alone. And we found that an enormous variety of animals had returned, including the wolf. The wolf is an apex predator. The wolves are only there if beneath it, there's a very, very healthy community. And we now know that there are seven times more wolves in the Chernobyl exclusion zone than anywhere else in Eastern Europe. And the key point - and it's very important in our series to remind people that nature is resilient. And if we give it space, if we work together to preserve it, it can bounce back. And Chernobyl is a wonderful example of that. SHAPIRO: Alastair Fothergill is series producer of the eight-part nature documentary \"Our Planet,\" now on Netflix. Thanks so much for joining us. FOTHERGILL: Very welcome.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:   But among the high-definition scenes of tropical reefs and lions on the hunt, there are some images you don't often see in these kinds of shows - those tropical reefs bleached into white bonescapes. Glaciers crumble into arctic seas. CORNISH: While other nature programs might make passing reference to the impact of humans, that message is at the center of \"Our Planet. \" Here's how the narrator, David Attenborough, puts it in the opening sequence. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"OUR PLANET\") DAVID ATTENBOROUGH: This series will celebrate the natural wonders that remain and reveal what we must preserve to ensure people and nature thrive. CHANG: Our co-host Ari Shapiro spoke with the series producer of \"Our Planet,\" Alastair Fothergill. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: You've been responsible for some of the most high-profile nature documentaries of the last decade - \"Planet Earth,\" \"Blue Planet,\" \"Frozen Planet. \" Tell us what made the mission of this one different. ALASTAIR FOTHERGILL: We decided way back, actually, in 2012 the time had come to try and do a series which would be as entertaining and as accessible as series like \"Planet Earth\" but for the first time deal in-depth with the challenges that our planet faces. There's no doubt that, you know, it is seriously under threat. And we felt that it was a story that urgently needed telling now. SHAPIRO: I imagine those threats are inescapable when you're filming any kind of nature documentary. Had you tried to include that narrative in some of the other shows you'd produced and been unable to? FOTHERGILL: To be honest, yes, it was difficult in the past to get broadcasters to include environmental messaging. And even with \"Our Planet,\" we've been very careful not just to film destruction. We've filmed the beauties, the amazing stuff that's still there because, you know, the planet is still, in many places, very healthy. And the important thing is that nature has an amazing ability to bounce back. SHAPIRO: Can you give us an example of a time that you thought, oh, maybe that goes a little too far; we need to pull it back a little bit and not make people feel quite so bleak, necessarily? FOTHERGILL: Well, there is an absolutely extraordinary sequence of walrus in the Arctic Ocean. SHAPIRO: I was going to ask about the walruses, yeah. FOTHERGILL: We went to film what's called a haul-out, where these animals - walrus - prefer to live out on the sea ice. They don't like coming to land. But in recent years, as the sea ice in the summer has declined, they've been hauling-out. And we saw a haul-out of over 110,000 walrus. And so desperate were they for space that some of them climbed up cliffs 100 meters up. These animals have very bad eyesight. And once they got to the top, they could hear their compatriots at sea, going back to sea. And in desperation, they leap off the cliff to their death. SHAPIRO: It's an incredibly disturbing sequence in the second episode. I mean, to be frank, I know more than one person who watched that sequence and said, I can't continue to watch the program. Were you afraid it would have that impact? FOTHERGILL: Of course we were. In editing it, we were very, very careful. There was a lot more of walrus falling off those cliffs than we showed, and we tried to balance it. But, you know, climate change is happening. And there are people that deny it. And I think it's very, very important that you really make people realize that it's not something that's going to happen in 10 and 20 years. It's happening now in the natural world. SHAPIRO: Many of the events you capture in this program occur once a year, maybe once a decade. What was it like to calendar this out as you started to make plans for what you wanted to include? FOTHERGILL: We spent a whole year planning, talking to scientists, talking to conservationists, deciding on our stories. And then we filmed over three years. And we spend a record 3,500 days in the field. To give you an idea, that means for every final minute of the show you watch, we spent 10 days in the field. SHAPIRO: It makes me feel bad for the moments that I reached for popcorn, given all the work that went into it. (LAUGHTER) FOTHERGILL: You know, but we were very specific. You know, although the animals don't read the script, we have a very, very organized and planned script. And we knew exactly the narrative that we wanted to tell. SHAPIRO: Wait; so you're saying that when you decide you're going to profile this particular animal, you know you want a hunt scene, but for that animal, you want a procreation scene? FOTHERGILL: Yes. What is very important to us is that each individual episode tell a bigger story about each individual habitat because what's very interesting is the challenges to their habitats, the threats to the habitats. And the solutions to those habitats differ depending on whether it's the open ocean, the tropical forest or the coniferous forest. SHAPIRO: There's a lot of footage that's never been seen before in this program, from a sequence with a Siberian tiger to an Australian lake that only fills up once a decade. Is there one scene in particular that you are really proud of having captured? FOTHERGILL: I think the Siberian tiger is a wonderful achievement. It's the first intimate images of these amazing cats in the wild. And to give you a sense of how difficult it was, over two winters, three cameramen were literally locked away inside wooden hides. They didn't come out for six weeks. Everything you need to do to survive they did inside this small box. SHAPIRO: Really? FOTHERGILL: And they worked for two winters. They got one, single shot of a wild Siberian tiger. At the same time, we had about 40 motion control cameras - remote cameras that are set off by the moving animal. And again, the first winter, we got nothing, really. We got lynx going past, other animals of the forest. But over that period, we began to see the movements of the tigers - how they were moving in that area. And the second season, we got 36 precious, precious images. For me, it's a wonderfully emblematic sequence of a wonderfully rare, wild, iconic species of the boreal forest. SHAPIRO: Because you have described the excruciating lengths that you went to to get some of these images, I have to ask whether there were certain images or behaviors that you really wanted to get and just weren't able to. FOTHERGILL: You know, failure is my job. And we failed a lot. Often, to get the sequence, we'd go one season, as I described with the Siberian tiger, back and back and back. And, yes, there are things that we still have to do and still have to film, which is great because I've still got a little life in me. SHAPIRO: On to the next one. FOTHERGILL: On to the next project, yes. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: The final episode of the series has, probably, the most disheartening sequence, and also the most hopeful. This is the episode about forests. The sequence in Madagascar shows these incredible animals in a forest that we learn at the end of the sequence has since been destroyed. FOTHERGILL: The patch of forest where we were filming was destroyed by the end of our filming period, yes. It was desperately, desperately sad. I mean, you know, Madagascar is a poor country. There's a lot of pressure. People need land. But the traditional forest - there's only 3 percent left. It's got so many precious, precious animals there. We really need to help those people to preserve the lemurs and all the wonderful forest that they live in. SHAPIRO: And then we go to Chernobyl at the end of this episode about forests. And this is a story of hope. FOTHERGILL: It is. Thirty-three years ago, of course, famously, the reactor at Chernobyl exploded. It was probably the greatest environmental disaster in living memory. And 30 years later, we will go back. And amazingly, the forest - the resilient forest - has overtaken Chernobyl. It's a green oasis now. And because people can't go there for very long because of the radiation - it's dangerous for us to stay there for a long period - it's been left alone. And we found that an enormous variety of animals had returned, including the wolf. The wolf is an apex predator. The wolves are only there if beneath it, there's a very, very healthy community. And we now know that there are seven times more wolves in the Chernobyl exclusion zone than anywhere else in Eastern Europe. And the key point - and it's very important in our series to remind people that nature is resilient. And if we give it space, if we work together to preserve it, it can bounce back. And Chernobyl is a wonderful example of that. SHAPIRO: Alastair Fothergill is series producer of the eight-part nature documentary \"Our Planet,\" now on Netflix. Thanks so much for joining us.

I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. If you want to hear some alarming facts about climate change, Bill McKibben has them. He writes in his new book that as the Earth warms, we're now seeing lethal heatwaves in some parts of the world and that the largest physical structures on our planet - the ice caps, coral reefs and rainforests - are disappearing before our eyes. McKibben's been writing about and advocating for action on climate change since the 1980s, but his new book isn't just a warning of impending disaster. And it isn't just about climate change. McKibben says there are also threats to humanity as we know it from human genetic engineering and from the unbridled development of artificial intelligence. Bill McKibben has written 15 books and is the founder of the environmental organization 350. org. His new book, which offers some dark visions of the future and hope for real change, is called \"Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out? \"Bill McKibben, welcome back to FRESH AIR. You know, you note that climate change is such a familiar term that - you know, like urban sprawl or, you know, gun violence that it's sort of a part of our journalistic lexicon. And there's been a lot of alarming information about climate change. And when I read your book, I found even more alarming information. And I think it's worth dwelling on it just a little bit. One of the things that struck me was heat waves - not heat waves 50 years from now but heat waves today. What are we finding? BILL MCKIBBEN: Well, we're already finding heat that taxes the ability of the human body to endure it. The highest reliably recorded temperatures on Earth have happened in the last couple of years. They've been in parts of the Mideast and the Asian subcontinent where city temperatures have reached 129 degrees. When they try to factor in the humidity and dew point, people have been describing - feels like temperatures as high as 165 degrees. I mean, 129 degrees Fahrenheit - that's about where my oven begins, you know? And a human being can survive it maybe for a few hours inside, in the shade. But they can't survive it long term. And the scientists are telling us without any hesitation that, on current trends, by the middle or latter part of the century, vast swaths of the planet will be experiencing those temperatures for weeks on end. And there'll be, in essence, no-go zones for human beings, no-go zones in those continental interiors but also, of course, no-go zones along the coasts where the oceans are rising and where storms are getting more powerful. The game board on which we play the game of human beings is shrinking and shrinking dramatically for the first time since humans wandered out of Africa and started expanding their range. DAVIES: It's shrinking because coastlines are receding but also because there are places where people can only survive by cowering together in air conditioning. MCKIBBEN: That's right. And there've become severe limits to how long you can make that work. Already, the World Labor Organization (ph) says that human beings are able to do about 10 percent less work in the course of a day outdoors than they used to be able to. It's simply gotten too hot and too humid. By mid-century, that number will be something like 30 percent less work. Really, the ability to be human is starting to vanish in many, many places. DAVIES: What's happening with food supplies? And what can we expect? MCKIBBEN: Well, human beings have had a great run of increasing their supply of food since the end of World War II. But as the Green Revolution begins to play itself out, coming the other direction are these vast heatwaves and shortages of water. And so we're already seeing real effects. I mean, the Arab Spring was triggered in large part by the rise of wheat prices that followed epic drought. The hideous civil war in Syria was triggered in part by epic drought, the deepest drought in the history of what we used to call the Fertile Crescent, that drove a million farmers off their land and into the already destabilized cities of the brutal Assad regime. And we see how those things play out not just in those places but around the world. The refugees that streamed out of Syria were enough to undermine the politics of Western Europe. The refugees now fleeing the highlands of Guatemala and Honduras, where drought has made raising crops an ever iffier proposition, they're, you know, showing up on the southern border and being used as scapegoats by the most vicious elements of our political culture. DAVIES: So climate change-related drought is what's driving the surge of immigrants? MCKIBBEN: There's a terrific story on the front page of The Sunday Times talking about precisely how destabilizing the drought and heat has been. If you look at a map of Central America, it's one of the few places in the world where there are big oceans close by on either side. As, you know, the oceans are soaking up most of the excess heat that we're producing. And that makes places like that particularly vulnerable to kind of whipsaw changes in temperature. DAVIES: And fire. I mean, we've focused a lot on the fires in California because they are nearby. And we see them on television. And they've affected and killed a lot of people. But you write that there are really alarming fires in other parts of the world that we don't pay as much attention to. MCKIBBEN: There are fires in places where there never used to be. I mean, we're seeing routinely now fires 3, 4, 5 degrees of latitude north of where we ever saw them - across Siberia, across much of the Arctic. It's just gotten too hot and too dry. But we shouldn't skip lightly over those California fires, either. I mean, when you look at a place literally called Paradise that literally turned into hell inside half an hour, you begin to understand how the psychological space that we inhabit is beginning to shrink, too. DAVIES: You know, you also write about - the city of Houston, for example, has taken on so much water through Hurricane Harvey and an earlier storm that the sheer weight of it actually made the city sink a couple of centimeters. And I wonder - you know, some people said don't confuse weather with climate. You can't connect any specific weather event to climate change. Is it clear that we're seeing something different in the weather as a result of what's happening to the planet? MCKIBBEN: Yeah, absolutely. Scientists have gotten good at what they call attribution studies. They say, for instance, in the case of Hurricane Harvey that the rainfall was about 40 percent heavier than it would've been without the heating that went on. Warm air holds more water vapor than cold. You get more evaporation. That's why in arid areas, you get more drought. But then once that water is up in the atmosphere, it comes down. And it comes down increasingly in deluge. I mean, look. The - Hurricane Harvey's the perfect example. There were parts of Houston that got near onto 5 feet of water. Not long afterwards, we had the biggest rainfall in the history of the East Coast with the hurricane that hit the Carolinas last fall. It dumped the water equivalent of all of Chesapeake Bay on the Carolinas. So these are entirely unprecedented. And they're happening everywhere. The most tragic example at the moment perhaps is what's going on in Mozambique where Cyclone Idai is being called the worst natural disaster in the history of the Southern Hemisphere. It flooded a vast part of Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi. DAVIES: And before we leave this subject, what is expected in terms of climate refugees in the coming decades? That is to say people who have no choice but to flee either the encroachment of the sea or other changes associated with climate change? MCKIBBEN: The low end of the U. N. prediction is on the neighborhood of 200 million. The high end is closer to a billion. And as we said before, if you look at the havoc that. . . DAVIES: And that's how soon? How soon is that? MCKIBBEN: In the course of the century, yeah. If you look at the havoc wreaked by a million refugees coming out of the Middle East or Central America, you get some sense of how unprepared as a world we are for that. This is one reason why, whatever else you might want to say about them, the Pentagon has, at least in this respect, been quite reality-based. And while the rest of Trump's Washington is pretending climate change doesn't exist, the Pentagon continues to warn that this is a huge threat to stability, which it is, because people on the move are, by nature, destabilizing. It's one of the most fraught things we have coming at us. The idea that anybody's going to be immune from this anywhere is untrue because even, if at the moment, your part of the world is not suffering through some catastrophe, it's going to be dealing with the people who are. DAVIES: Our guest is Bill McKibben. His new book is called \"Falter: Has The Human Game Begun To Play Itself Out? \" We'll talk some more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF BOBBY PREVITE & THE NEW BUMP SONG, \"SHE HAS INFORMATION\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. Our guest is Bill McKibben. He's been writing about and advocating for action on climate change since the 1980s. He's written 15 books. His latest is called \"Falter: Has The Human Game Begun To Play Itself Out? \"In the book, you talk about what we've known and what we've done about this, going back to the '80s, when scientists began to clearly identify what was happening and the threat that it posed. And somehow, our politicians - even those, you write, who recognize the change - have just engaged in baby steps when serious measures are needed. Why? MCKIBBEN: Well, the story of why we've done so little is, in some ways, the most painful part of this whole affair, you know? When I wrote \"The End Of Nature,\" I was 27, and so it did not occur to me that our institutions would show themselves to be so timorous and slow. We've come to understand more of how that happened in the last few years. Great investigative reporting at places like The LA Times and The Columbia Journalism Review and InsideClimate News and elsewhere have documented, beyond any doubt, that the fossil fuel companies knew everything there was to know about climate change in the 1980s. They knew how much it was going to warm and how fast, and they believed it. I mean, Exxon began building all its drilling rigs to compensate for the rise in sea level they knew was coming. What they didn't do was tell any of the rest of us - just the opposite. Beginning right about 1989 or so, they began to pour huge sums of money into this architecture of deceit and denial and disinformation that kept us locked for 30 years in a sterile debate about whether or not global warming was real, a debate that both sides knew the answer to at the beginning. It's just one of them was completely willing to lie, and that lie turns out to be the most consequential lie in human history, I think. It's the thing, more than anything else, that's kept us from reacting with any speed or vigor to the greatest challenge humans have ever faced. DAVIES: Right. And I just want to note - since, Bill McKibben, you're an activist on this and have a strong point of view - that there's a very rich documentary history of this on the Internet if anybody wants to look it up and kind of look at what Exxon says, which is that this is a distorted view of what they did. I mean, I did note that a couple of Harvard researchers looked at this and concluded that, yes, there were moments when Exxon placed, you know, advertorials or, you know, paid statements which acknowledged the human nature of climate change and the need to fight it, but that when you look at where most of their communication was, and particularly where they put their money into research and advocacy, it was to question the reality of it all. MCKIBBEN: Yes. I mean - and it's completely true that I'm an activist, but it's also true that there are hundreds of footnotes in this book. I'm a reporter and writer above all. And this is just part of the story that's, I think, beyond any real doubt. The question now is how to pick up the pieces. Here's the problem. Thirty years ago - and I suppose I should avoid saying, you know, if only you'd listened to me when - but 30 years ago, there were relatively small things we could've done that would've changed the trajectory of this battle. A small price on carbon back then would've yielded a different trajectory, would've put us in a different - we might not have solved climate change yet 'cause it's a huge problem, but we'd be on the way. Having wasted 30 years, doing nothing at the behest of the powers that be, we're now left with a set of very uncomfortable and difficult choices. We have to move much more quickly than is convenient, politically, economically, socially. But what choice do we have? I mean, in the end, this isn't a fight between Republicans and Democrats or environmentalists and industry. It's, in the end, a fight between human beings and physics. And physics is poor at compromise, doesn't negotiate easily. We're going to have to do what physics demands. DAVIES: You know, you write that another element of this is that around the time that this issue was raised by a lot of scientists in the 1980s, you saw inequality in the country, inequality in wealth and income increasing and a lot of players in the political and intellectual world pushing a different vision of the relationship between government and individuals, which really found some purchase. You want to just talk about that a bit? MCKIBBEN: Sure. Look. The - this was one of these perfect examples of bad timing. Right at the moment that the reigning ideology in America - the most important country on Earth, at least during this period. Right at the crucial moment, its reigning ideology became a kind of laissez faire capitalism - unregulated capitalism. Let markets solve all problems. Government, as Ronald Reagan said, isn't the solution. It's the problem - on and on and on. That meant that there was no appetite for doing the kind of regulation that we needed to do to try to rein in climate change when it was easy to do it. That organized selfishness - that's set us back and set us back hard. We're beginning to see the reaction to it with things like the Green New Deal and a big, new focus on dealing with inequality and with climate change and figuring out how they mesh together. It's just that we've waited a long time. The thing never to forget, Dave, about climate change is it's the first timed test that humans have ever had. And the time part is what scares me. It's too bad that this moment of ideological ascension just happened to come in the time and the place when there was enough leverage that, perhaps, it broke the planet in the process. DAVIES: You know, it also occurs to me that one of the fundamental problems in the past 30 years and ongoing is that, you know, yes, we are one species, and we share the same planet. But our instrument of policy is primarily nation-states who compete with one another and, you know, are unlikely or can be resistant to making change if others don't or can point an accusing finger, you know, like, I'm not as bad as they are. How much of that is the problem? And how do we overcome it? MCKIBBEN: Well, it is a big problem. And it's one of the reasons that action has been so slow. I fear that the biggest part of that problem may be right here. I mean, you'll remember that the world finally managed to reach, at least, a beginning of an effort to do something about this at the Paris Accords in 2015 - not anywhere near a perfect agreement but certainly a start and the first time that all the countries of the world came together to pledge some kind of action. And then you'll recall that our president pulled us out of it. You know, the country that has poured more carbon into the atmosphere than any other over the course of human history is also the only country on the planet unwilling to even pay lip service to taking on this problem. The good news is that some other countries seem to be sort of rising to the occasion. China is putting in renewable energy at a pace like we've never seen on the planet before. Maybe even more importantly, India - which is, in energy terms, probably where China was 15 or 20 years ago - seems like it might be poised to become the first great nation that, at least to some degree, skips over the coal-fired part of development and moves straight to renewable energy. The engineers have done such a remarkable job over the last decade - the price of a solar panel has fallen 90 percent - that it simply makes no economic sense anymore to keep doing what we're doing. And that's why, at the moment, India, for instance, is building far more renewable energy than they are conventionally powered power plants. DAVIES: You know, one thing that you write about in the book, which I didn't know, is that the coal industry is promoting itself as the solution for economic poverty or energy poverty in much of the developing world. MCKIBBEN: This was their big shtick a few years ago as protest and activism began to erode their market share in places like the U. S. They - kind of like Philip Morris before them - turned to the developing world as their salvation, arguing that they were somehow going to solve energy poverty and turn on the lights for places where they hadn't been before. It turns out that they were either insincere or dead wrong about that argument. That's not what's turning on the lights. Ninety percent of the people who are getting power for the first time now are getting it from renewable energy because it's so cheap. DAVIES: Bill McKibben's new book is \"Falter: Has The Human Game Begun To Play Itself Out? \" After a break, he'll talk about two other developments he says could threaten humanity as we know it - human genetic engineering and artificial intelligence - and why he says there's still hope for meaningful change. Also, rock critic Ken Tucker reviews a new album from the British band The Mekons. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF ROSWELL RUDD & TOUMANI DIABATE'S \"BAMAKO\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. We're speaking with writer and environmental activist Bill McKibben. His first book, \"The End Of Nature,\" became a bestseller in 1989 and ignited debate about climate change. He's written 14 books since and founded the environmental organization 350. org. His new book is called \"Falter: Has The Human Game Begun To Play Itself Out? \"The book isn't just about climate change. I mean, you are looking at what you say is the human game - this great endeavor - and whether it is sustainable in the coming years. And you identify a couple of other threats to humanity as we know it. One is genetic engineering. Why? MCKIBBEN: Genetic engineering of human beings - you probably saw this story on the front of the Times over the weekend about the doctor in China who apparently, with American help, managed to produce the first two designer babies in the world, a pair of twins in China who'd been genetically altered. This feels like where we were decades ago with climate change - right on the cusp of revolutionary shifts. And those shifts are things that we should take very seriously. We overestimated and took for granted the physical stability of the planet, refused to believe that it could change. We take for granted the idea that human meaning is eternal, too. But think about what happens if we go very far down the road that a lot of scientists and a lot of entrepreneurs have described - a world where you go into a clinic and put your money down and design, to the best of science's ability, the child you want to produce. You may soon be able to figure out how much serotonin, you know, your child produces in an effort to regulate its mood. You may be able to affect, in some way, small or large, its intelligence. Think about what that means - first, the fact that the minute you turn a person into a product, that product faces the inevitable fate of all products - obsolescence. You've been in the clinic with your first kid, put down your money, made your selections. OK. You come back five years later for kid number two. Technology has marched on. You're able to get better upgrades for this one. These are changes that we should avoid and that we can avoid without risk to human health. We know other ways to prevent the transmission of genetic disease and things. This is a real challenge to human beings, I think, and one that we haven't taken seriously enough yet - that these two Chinese babies born last fall seem to have sobered up some of the scientific community. And there's been increased talk about regulation within and outside of the scientific community to try and slow things down. DAVIES: Well, you know, in addition to the issues that you raised, you know, we have a lot of inequality. This - these kinds of treatments would cost money over time. Does it end up with, really, kind of two scales of human beings, one which are - have better mood regulation, who are intellectually brilliant, athletically powerful, and then others who can't afford this? I mean, where does that take us? MCKIBBEN: The head of one of the gene companies at the moment - a Princeton professor - said some years ago that it was only a matter of time before we bifurcated into two species. He called them the GenRich and the naturals. And he predicted that it wouldn't be long before they wouldn't be able to even breed with each other, much less want to, because they'd be on very different paths. This is a way of taking the shameful inequality that mars our society now and that one hopes we are in the process of rebelling against and figuring out how to start changing - it takes that inequality and etches it into our genes. DAVIES: Describe the Chinese baby experiment. MCKIBBEN: A doctor in China, in embryo, altered the genetic makeup of twin girls in order to produce - to make it impossible for them to get HIV. As every doctor and other authority pointed out once this became public, this - even if you wanted to do this kind of work, this was in - a bad place to start because there are a thousand easy ways to make sure you don't get HIV once you're born. This was just an attempt at a kind of proof of concept - to be the first person who produced a designer baby. That's why people reacted strongly to it. Even, I'll say, the Chinese government reacted strongly to it. And this researcher is in a good deal of trouble, as he should be, for proceeding blindly down this path. DAVIES: The other threat you identify is artificial intelligence, and this is really interesting stuff. Let's just start by defining it because a lot of us think we know what it means and don't. What is artificial intelligence? MCKIBBEN: (Laughter) Well, the definitional problems are rife in the field. Suffice it to say, there's several different kinds. We already have specific artificial intelligences, right? We have computers that are able to - programs that are able to beat human beings reliably at chess and pretty much every other game. And now we're weaponizing them to do all kinds of things, some of which are really dark. There was a story in the paper about the fact that the Chinese have developed an AI algorithm that can facially identify Uyghur Muslims anywhere in China and pick them out of crowds in any city. And police departments are deploying this across the People's Republic in order to keep track of this racial minority. That's one of the things we have, I'm afraid, to look forward to in the future. The deeper fears - the sort of real fears about human meaning come when you posit, as many, many scientists do, what they would call general artificial intelligence - AIs designed not for specific tasks, but for broad intelligence - able to teach themselves and to learn and to quickly become more intelligent, maybe a lot more so than human beings. The scientists who work in this field tell us that this is going to happen soon. The definition of soon ranges from 2025 to 2050 or 2060, but those are the consensus predictions within the field. And we haven't at all begun to think out what that means. We've started to worry that people will lose their jobs to automation, which is something very much to worry about, but we haven't really thought about what it means to replace ourselves with something above us. DAVIES: You know, I'm struggling to understand kind of what the threat is posed by this kind of artificial intelligence, and part of it's because we just don't. . . MCKIBBEN: Well, that's 'cause you need to be. . . DAVIES: Right. MCKIBBEN: . . . Upgraded so you'll caughten (ph) on more quickly, Dave. DAVIES: Right. My grandson will have the chip that can do that. But, I mean, to be specific - I mean, there's the movie \"I, Robot,\" where the robots eventually learn that - they start killing human beings on the street because they've taken over. There are a couple of examples in the book of how you give a robotic intelligence a goal, like making paper clips - right? - or. . . MCKIBBEN: This is the classic canonical example in the field. You assign artificial intelligence the task of making paper clips, and it won't be deviated from this task. It gets - it pursues it single-mindedly, as only a machine could, and figures out how to keep you from turning it off 'cause that's not a very hard task for a super intelligent machine. And it figures out how to divert all - in fact, all the powers of the planet to making yet more paper clips until pretty soon, we're reduced to a kind of pile of them. We haven't taken it seriously because it doesn't, at the moment, seem to impinge on our day-to-day life. But one of the things that climate change taught me is that things happen fast - like, really fast. And before you know it, they're out of control. So the time for thinking about them is when there's still some chance at getting a handle on them. DAVIES: Bill McKibben's new book is called \"Falter: Has The Human Game Begun To Play Itself Out? \" We'll talk some more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF AMANDA GARDIER SONG, \"FJORD\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. Our guest is Bill McKibben. He's been writing about and advocating for action on climate change since the 1980s. He's the author of 15 books. His latest is called \"Falter: Has The Human Game Begun To Play Itself Out? \"The last section of your book is called \"Outside Chance\" - you know, hope, but just a little bit, maybe. You said you find hope in two new technologies. One is the solar panel, and you say you kind of fully realized its possibilities on a reporting trip to Africa. What did you find? MCKIBBEN: Look. I'm a good child of the American suburbs, so I grew up taking everything we take for granted for granted. And I got into Ivory Coast and Ghana and Tanzania into remote villages where people have never had electricity. I was sitting around one day with elders in this community in Ghana who had just had their first power from a solar microgrid. It was hot 'cause it's always hot there, and they kept handing me bottles of cold water to drink, for which I was grateful. But it took me a good 15 minutes to figure out why they were so proud of that. It's because there'd never been anything cold in this hot place before until solar panels had allowed them access to electricity. If you look at it that way, a solar panel is Hogwarts-scale magic, man. You point a sheet of glass at the sun, and out the back comes light and cold and information and all the things of modernity. And it does it without causing the damage that burning fossil fuels does. It's pretty magical stuff. DAVIES: Right, and it can transform a home or a village in Africa. Can it scale up to meet the energy needs of an industrial society? MCKIBBEN: We used to wonder about that. Two things have happened in the last little while. One is this dramatic fall in the price of solar panels and wind turbines. The other is a dramatic fall in the price of storage batteries. So now we're at the point where the fact that the sun goes down at night is not a deal-breaker. Increasingly, we're able to take that power and store it. There was a story in Bloomberg a couple of weeks ago saying that solar-plus batteries is now cheaper than natural gas, even in much of the United States. So even without the dire threat posed by climate change, we'd probably be moving in this direction. Because of the dire threat posed by climate change, we should be moving in this direction as fast as it is possible to imagine doing. DAVIES: Right. You live in Vermont. Do you have solar panels in your house? MCKIBBEN: I have solar panels all over my roof. And I'm glad for them, but I try not to fool myself that that's how we're going to solve climate change. We're past the point where we can do this one house at a time. That's the other kind of miracle technology that we have to work with now from the 20th century. It's this idea of nonviolent movement building, the idea that individuals can become a little less individual and join together with others to form movements big enough, maybe, to take on even the power and wealth of the fossil fuel industry. DAVIES: Yeah. Well, you know, it struck me that one of the things that was interesting about what you found in Africa was that these solar panels were being sold by entrepreneurs, right? I mean, there's money to be made in this. What about the big energy companies taking this on and making that their project? MCKIBBEN: Well, you would've thought they would've 30 years ago. And the reason they didn't is because you can make money off the sun and the wind, but you can't make Exxon kind of money. And the reason is that once the solar panel's up there on your roof, the sun comes for free. From Exxon's point of view, that's the stupidest business model possible. They've spent a century getting people to write them a check every month for another delivery, but the sun delivers it for free. That's why they've worked so hard to derail this technology. And it's why, if we deploy it and as we deploy it, not only do we do something about climate change, we also may do something about the imbalances of power and wealth in our society, much of which is based on the fact that people just happen to live above or control the small deposits of coal and oil and gas on which we depend. They'll be rich people in a solar world, but they won't be Koch brothers rich. And they won't have that degree of warping influence on our politics. DAVIES: You've said many times that the question is, can we make change quickly enough? Give us a sense of the - what kind of time pressure we're under. MCKIBBEN: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, our collection of scientists around the world, organized - sort of self-organized, put out their most important report to date last autumn. It said that to meet the targets set in Paris, we would need fundamental transformation underway by 2030. That is, in this country, we'd need to be - at least half our power coming from renewable sources. That's a really hard transition to make in 10 years. It requires a level of focus and attention that we've never come close to in the past on this issue. So it's going to take everything we've got to get it done. DAVIES: If things don't happen in time, one of the things that people are talking about are big bioengineering solutions - I mean, like, you know, towers into the sky to pump gases or extract gases. And I can't even recall all of them. I've read books about them. How do you feel about those ideas? MCKIBBEN: The most common of these is to say we'll fly a constant fleet of airplanes for the rest of time into the atmosphere, dumping sulfur there. And the sulfur will block some of the incoming solar radiation. The craziness of this is manifold. I mean, look. It would probably change the color of the sky to a nice milky white. We think that this mimics what happens with volcanoes when they put a lot of sulfur into the atmosphere and temporarily cool the planet. But one of the things that often happens then is that the monsoon rains move off the subcontinent, which is an existential problem for a couple of billion people. More to the point, none of this does anything about the deadly twin of global warming, which is the rapid acidification of the oceans. We're an ocean planet. The fact that we're - have already made the oceans 30 percent more acidic would be, by itself, enough reason to get off fossil fuel, even if it didn't do a thing to the temperature. We don't need to pour sulfur into the atmosphere. We need to build a lot of windmills and solar panels. DAVIES: One other thing - you know, we live in a time where civility is in short supply. And you've been trolled and harassed for your activism. What kinds of things have you faced? MCKIBBEN: There was a long time when I didn't talk about any of it. But in the last few years, I've written some about the death threats, which have been a kind of standard-issue part of life for 30 years. We're reaching the point where people on the Internet were, you know, publishing my home address and talking about the specific methods they planned to use and so on and so forth. That kind of incivility - if that seems almost too weak a word for it - is part of our life now. But we can't let it be the thing that keeps us from doing our work. All of this seems crazy to me, at some level. When I set out on this journey, I was a writer, not an activist. It never occurred to me that I was going to end up in jail or in handcuffs a bunch of times and things. And one shouldn't have to. I mean, in a rational world, when scientists issue a blunt warning that the worst thing in the world is happening, you would expect our leaders to go to work. But the world in which we live in, apparently, people do have to do these kind of things. And people have to deal with a lot worse than I have to deal with. There's people around the world - environmentalists - who die every year in countries where this sort of thing has become routine. DAVIES: Well, Bill McKibben, thanks so much for speaking with us again. MCKIBBEN: Dave, what a pleasure. And thank you not just for this interview but for all your work every day. We really enjoy it. DAVIES: Bill McKibben founded the environmental organization 350. org. His new book is \"Falter: Has The Human Game Begun To Play Itself Out? \" Coming up, rock critic Ken Tucker reviews a new album from the British band The Mekons. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF DANIEL FREEDMAN'S \"LOVE TAKES TIME\") DAVE DAVIES, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. If you want to hear some alarming facts about climate change, Bill McKibben has them. He writes in his new book that as the Earth warms, we're now seeing lethal heatwaves in some parts of the world and that the largest physical structures on our planet - the ice caps, coral reefs and rainforests - are disappearing before our eyes. McKibben's been writing about and advocating for action on climate change since the 1980s, but his new book isn't just a warning of impending disaster. And it isn't just about climate change. McKibben says there are also threats to humanity as we know it from human genetic engineering and from the unbridled development of artificial intelligence. Bill McKibben has written 15 books and is the founder of the environmental organization 350. org. His new book, which offers some dark visions of the future and hope for real change, is called \"Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out? \" Bill McKibben, welcome back to FRESH AIR. You know, you note that climate change is such a familiar term that - you know, like urban sprawl or, you know, gun violence that it's sort of a part of our journalistic lexicon. And there's been a lot of alarming information about climate change. And when I read your book, I found even more alarming information. And I think it's worth dwelling on it just a little bit. One of the things that struck me was heat waves - not heat waves 50 years from now but heat waves today. What are we finding? BILL MCKIBBEN: Well, we're already finding heat that taxes the ability of the human body to endure it. The highest reliably recorded temperatures on Earth have happened in the last couple of years. They've been in parts of the Mideast and the Asian subcontinent where city temperatures have reached 129 degrees. When they try to factor in the humidity and dew point, people have been describing - feels like temperatures as high as 165 degrees. I mean, 129 degrees Fahrenheit - that's about where my oven begins, you know? And a human being can survive it maybe for a few hours inside, in the shade. But they can't survive it long term. And the scientists are telling us without any hesitation that, on current trends, by the middle or latter part of the century, vast swaths of the planet will be experiencing those temperatures for weeks on end. And there'll be, in essence, no-go zones for human beings, no-go zones in those continental interiors but also, of course, no-go zones along the coasts where the oceans are rising and where storms are getting more powerful. The game board on which we play the game of human beings is shrinking and shrinking dramatically for the first time since humans wandered out of Africa and started expanding their range. DAVIES: It's shrinking because coastlines are receding but also because there are places where people can only survive by cowering together in air conditioning. MCKIBBEN: That's right. And there've become severe limits to how long you can make that work. Already, the World Labor Organization (ph) says that human beings are able to do about 10 percent less work in the course of a day outdoors than they used to be able to. It's simply gotten too hot and too humid. By mid-century, that number will be something like 30 percent less work. Really, the ability to be human is starting to vanish in many, many places. DAVIES: What's happening with food supplies? And what can we expect? MCKIBBEN: Well, human beings have had a great run of increasing their supply of food since the end of World War II. But as the Green Revolution begins to play itself out, coming the other direction are these vast heatwaves and shortages of water. And so we're already seeing real effects. I mean, the Arab Spring was triggered in large part by the rise of wheat prices that followed epic drought. The hideous civil war in Syria was triggered in part by epic drought, the deepest drought in the history of what we used to call the Fertile Crescent, that drove a million farmers off their land and into the already destabilized cities of the brutal Assad regime. And we see how those things play out not just in those places but around the world. The refugees that streamed out of Syria were enough to undermine the politics of Western Europe. The refugees now fleeing the highlands of Guatemala and Honduras, where drought has made raising crops an ever iffier proposition, they're, you know, showing up on the southern border and being used as scapegoats by the most vicious elements of our political culture. DAVIES: So climate change-related drought is what's driving the surge of immigrants? MCKIBBEN: There's a terrific story on the front page of The Sunday Times talking about precisely how destabilizing the drought and heat has been. If you look at a map of Central America, it's one of the few places in the world where there are big oceans close by on either side. As, you know, the oceans are soaking up most of the excess heat that we're producing. And that makes places like that particularly vulnerable to kind of whipsaw changes in temperature. DAVIES: And fire. I mean, we've focused a lot on the fires in California because they are nearby. And we see them on television. And they've affected and killed a lot of people. But you write that there are really alarming fires in other parts of the world that we don't pay as much attention to. MCKIBBEN: There are fires in places where there never used to be. I mean, we're seeing routinely now fires 3, 4, 5 degrees of latitude north of where we ever saw them - across Siberia, across much of the Arctic. It's just gotten too hot and too dry. But we shouldn't skip lightly over those California fires, either. I mean, when you look at a place literally called Paradise that literally turned into hell inside half an hour, you begin to understand how the psychological space that we inhabit is beginning to shrink, too. DAVIES: You know, you also write about - the city of Houston, for example, has taken on so much water through Hurricane Harvey and an earlier storm that the sheer weight of it actually made the city sink a couple of centimeters. And I wonder - you know, some people said don't confuse weather with climate. You can't connect any specific weather event to climate change. Is it clear that we're seeing something different in the weather as a result of what's happening to the planet? MCKIBBEN: Yeah, absolutely. Scientists have gotten good at what they call attribution studies. They say, for instance, in the case of Hurricane Harvey that the rainfall was about 40 percent heavier than it would've been without the heating that went on. Warm air holds more water vapor than cold. You get more evaporation. That's why in arid areas, you get more drought. But then once that water is up in the atmosphere, it comes down. And it comes down increasingly in deluge. I mean, look. The - Hurricane Harvey's the perfect example. There were parts of Houston that got near onto 5 feet of water. Not long afterwards, we had the biggest rainfall in the history of the East Coast with the hurricane that hit the Carolinas last fall. It dumped the water equivalent of all of Chesapeake Bay on the Carolinas. So these are entirely unprecedented. And they're happening everywhere. The most tragic example at the moment perhaps is what's going on in Mozambique where Cyclone Idai is being called the worst natural disaster in the history of the Southern Hemisphere. It flooded a vast part of Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi. DAVIES: And before we leave this subject, what is expected in terms of climate refugees in the coming decades? That is to say people who have no choice but to flee either the encroachment of the sea or other changes associated with climate change? MCKIBBEN: The low end of the U. N. prediction is on the neighborhood of 200 million. The high end is closer to a billion. And as we said before, if you look at the havoc that. . . DAVIES: And that's how soon? How soon is that? MCKIBBEN: In the course of the century, yeah. If you look at the havoc wreaked by a million refugees coming out of the Middle East or Central America, you get some sense of how unprepared as a world we are for that. This is one reason why, whatever else you might want to say about them, the Pentagon has, at least in this respect, been quite reality-based. And while the rest of Trump's Washington is pretending climate change doesn't exist, the Pentagon continues to warn that this is a huge threat to stability, which it is, because people on the move are, by nature, destabilizing. It's one of the most fraught things we have coming at us. The idea that anybody's going to be immune from this anywhere is untrue because even, if at the moment, your part of the world is not suffering through some catastrophe, it's going to be dealing with the people who are. DAVIES: Our guest is Bill McKibben. His new book is called \"Falter: Has The Human Game Begun To Play Itself Out? \" We'll talk some more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF BOBBY PREVITE & THE NEW BUMP SONG, \"SHE HAS INFORMATION\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. Our guest is Bill McKibben. He's been writing about and advocating for action on climate change since the 1980s. He's written 15 books. His latest is called \"Falter: Has The Human Game Begun To Play Itself Out? \" In the book, you talk about what we've known and what we've done about this, going back to the '80s, when scientists began to clearly identify what was happening and the threat that it posed. And somehow, our politicians - even those, you write, who recognize the change - have just engaged in baby steps when serious measures are needed. Why? MCKIBBEN: Well, the story of why we've done so little is, in some ways, the most painful part of this whole affair, you know? When I wrote \"The End Of Nature,\" I was 27, and so it did not occur to me that our institutions would show themselves to be so timorous and slow. We've come to understand more of how that happened in the last few years. Great investigative reporting at places like The LA Times and The Columbia Journalism Review and InsideClimate News and elsewhere have documented, beyond any doubt, that the fossil fuel companies knew everything there was to know about climate change in the 1980s. They knew how much it was going to warm and how fast, and they believed it. I mean, Exxon began building all its drilling rigs to compensate for the rise in sea level they knew was coming. What they didn't do was tell any of the rest of us - just the opposite. Beginning right about 1989 or so, they began to pour huge sums of money into this architecture of deceit and denial and disinformation that kept us locked for 30 years in a sterile debate about whether or not global warming was real, a debate that both sides knew the answer to at the beginning. It's just one of them was completely willing to lie, and that lie turns out to be the most consequential lie in human history, I think. It's the thing, more than anything else, that's kept us from reacting with any speed or vigor to the greatest challenge humans have ever faced. DAVIES: Right. And I just want to note - since, Bill McKibben, you're an activist on this and have a strong point of view - that there's a very rich documentary history of this on the Internet if anybody wants to look it up and kind of look at what Exxon says, which is that this is a distorted view of what they did. I mean, I did note that a couple of Harvard researchers looked at this and concluded that, yes, there were moments when Exxon placed, you know, advertorials or, you know, paid statements which acknowledged the human nature of climate change and the need to fight it, but that when you look at where most of their communication was, and particularly where they put their money into research and advocacy, it was to question the reality of it all. MCKIBBEN: Yes. I mean - and it's completely true that I'm an activist, but it's also true that there are hundreds of footnotes in this book. I'm a reporter and writer above all. And this is just part of the story that's, I think, beyond any real doubt. The question now is how to pick up the pieces. Here's the problem. Thirty years ago - and I suppose I should avoid saying, you know, if only you'd listened to me when - but 30 years ago, there were relatively small things we could've done that would've changed the trajectory of this battle. A small price on carbon back then would've yielded a different trajectory, would've put us in a different - we might not have solved climate change yet 'cause it's a huge problem, but we'd be on the way. Having wasted 30 years, doing nothing at the behest of the powers that be, we're now left with a set of very uncomfortable and difficult choices. We have to move much more quickly than is convenient, politically, economically, socially. But what choice do we have? I mean, in the end, this isn't a fight between Republicans and Democrats or environmentalists and industry. It's, in the end, a fight between human beings and physics. And physics is poor at compromise, doesn't negotiate easily. We're going to have to do what physics demands. DAVIES: You know, you write that another element of this is that around the time that this issue was raised by a lot of scientists in the 1980s, you saw inequality in the country, inequality in wealth and income increasing and a lot of players in the political and intellectual world pushing a different vision of the relationship between government and individuals, which really found some purchase. You want to just talk about that a bit? MCKIBBEN: Sure. Look. The - this was one of these perfect examples of bad timing. Right at the moment that the reigning ideology in America - the most important country on Earth, at least during this period. Right at the crucial moment, its reigning ideology became a kind of laissez faire capitalism - unregulated capitalism. Let markets solve all problems. Government, as Ronald Reagan said, isn't the solution. It's the problem - on and on and on. That meant that there was no appetite for doing the kind of regulation that we needed to do to try to rein in climate change when it was easy to do it. That organized selfishness - that's set us back and set us back hard. We're beginning to see the reaction to it with things like the Green New Deal and a big, new focus on dealing with inequality and with climate change and figuring out how they mesh together. It's just that we've waited a long time. The thing never to forget, Dave, about climate change is it's the first timed test that humans have ever had. And the time part is what scares me. It's too bad that this moment of ideological ascension just happened to come in the time and the place when there was enough leverage that, perhaps, it broke the planet in the process. DAVIES: You know, it also occurs to me that one of the fundamental problems in the past 30 years and ongoing is that, you know, yes, we are one species, and we share the same planet. But our instrument of policy is primarily nation-states who compete with one another and, you know, are unlikely or can be resistant to making change if others don't or can point an accusing finger, you know, like, I'm not as bad as they are. How much of that is the problem? And how do we overcome it? MCKIBBEN: Well, it is a big problem. And it's one of the reasons that action has been so slow. I fear that the biggest part of that problem may be right here. I mean, you'll remember that the world finally managed to reach, at least, a beginning of an effort to do something about this at the Paris Accords in 2015 - not anywhere near a perfect agreement but certainly a start and the first time that all the countries of the world came together to pledge some kind of action. And then you'll recall that our president pulled us out of it. You know, the country that has poured more carbon into the atmosphere than any other over the course of human history is also the only country on the planet unwilling to even pay lip service to taking on this problem. The good news is that some other countries seem to be sort of rising to the occasion. China is putting in renewable energy at a pace like we've never seen on the planet before. Maybe even more importantly, India - which is, in energy terms, probably where China was 15 or 20 years ago - seems like it might be poised to become the first great nation that, at least to some degree, skips over the coal-fired part of development and moves straight to renewable energy. The engineers have done such a remarkable job over the last decade - the price of a solar panel has fallen 90 percent - that it simply makes no economic sense anymore to keep doing what we're doing. And that's why, at the moment, India, for instance, is building far more renewable energy than they are conventionally powered power plants. DAVIES: You know, one thing that you write about in the book, which I didn't know, is that the coal industry is promoting itself as the solution for economic poverty or energy poverty in much of the developing world. MCKIBBEN: This was their big shtick a few years ago as protest and activism began to erode their market share in places like the U. S. They - kind of like Philip Morris before them - turned to the developing world as their salvation, arguing that they were somehow going to solve energy poverty and turn on the lights for places where they hadn't been before. It turns out that they were either insincere or dead wrong about that argument. That's not what's turning on the lights. Ninety percent of the people who are getting power for the first time now are getting it from renewable energy because it's so cheap. DAVIES: Bill McKibben's new book is \"Falter: Has The Human Game Begun To Play Itself Out? \" After a break, he'll talk about two other developments he says could threaten humanity as we know it - human genetic engineering and artificial intelligence - and why he says there's still hope for meaningful change. Also, rock critic Ken Tucker reviews a new album from the British band The Mekons. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF ROSWELL RUDD & TOUMANI DIABATE'S \"BAMAKO\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. We're speaking with writer and environmental activist Bill McKibben. His first book, \"The End Of Nature,\" became a bestseller in 1989 and ignited debate about climate change. He's written 14 books since and founded the environmental organization 350. org. His new book is called \"Falter: Has The Human Game Begun To Play Itself Out? \" The book isn't just about climate change. I mean, you are looking at what you say is the human game - this great endeavor - and whether it is sustainable in the coming years. And you identify a couple of other threats to humanity as we know it. One is genetic engineering. Why? MCKIBBEN: Genetic engineering of human beings - you probably saw this story on the front of the Times over the weekend about the doctor in China who apparently, with American help, managed to produce the first two designer babies in the world, a pair of twins in China who'd been genetically altered. This feels like where we were decades ago with climate change - right on the cusp of revolutionary shifts. And those shifts are things that we should take very seriously. We overestimated and took for granted the physical stability of the planet, refused to believe that it could change. We take for granted the idea that human meaning is eternal, too. But think about what happens if we go very far down the road that a lot of scientists and a lot of entrepreneurs have described - a world where you go into a clinic and put your money down and design, to the best of science's ability, the child you want to produce. You may soon be able to figure out how much serotonin, you know, your child produces in an effort to regulate its mood. You may be able to affect, in some way, small or large, its intelligence. Think about what that means - first, the fact that the minute you turn a person into a product, that product faces the inevitable fate of all products - obsolescence. You've been in the clinic with your first kid, put down your money, made your selections. OK. You come back five years later for kid number two. Technology has marched on. You're able to get better upgrades for this one. These are changes that we should avoid and that we can avoid without risk to human health. We know other ways to prevent the transmission of genetic disease and things. This is a real challenge to human beings, I think, and one that we haven't taken seriously enough yet - that these two Chinese babies born last fall seem to have sobered up some of the scientific community. And there's been increased talk about regulation within and outside of the scientific community to try and slow things down. DAVIES: Well, you know, in addition to the issues that you raised, you know, we have a lot of inequality. This - these kinds of treatments would cost money over time. Does it end up with, really, kind of two scales of human beings, one which are - have better mood regulation, who are intellectually brilliant, athletically powerful, and then others who can't afford this? I mean, where does that take us? MCKIBBEN: The head of one of the gene companies at the moment - a Princeton professor - said some years ago that it was only a matter of time before we bifurcated into two species. He called them the GenRich and the naturals. And he predicted that it wouldn't be long before they wouldn't be able to even breed with each other, much less want to, because they'd be on very different paths. This is a way of taking the shameful inequality that mars our society now and that one hopes we are in the process of rebelling against and figuring out how to start changing - it takes that inequality and etches it into our genes. DAVIES: Describe the Chinese baby experiment. MCKIBBEN: A doctor in China, in embryo, altered the genetic makeup of twin girls in order to produce - to make it impossible for them to get HIV. As every doctor and other authority pointed out once this became public, this - even if you wanted to do this kind of work, this was in - a bad place to start because there are a thousand easy ways to make sure you don't get HIV once you're born. This was just an attempt at a kind of proof of concept - to be the first person who produced a designer baby. That's why people reacted strongly to it. Even, I'll say, the Chinese government reacted strongly to it. And this researcher is in a good deal of trouble, as he should be, for proceeding blindly down this path. DAVIES: The other threat you identify is artificial intelligence, and this is really interesting stuff. Let's just start by defining it because a lot of us think we know what it means and don't. What is artificial intelligence? MCKIBBEN: (Laughter) Well, the definitional problems are rife in the field. Suffice it to say, there's several different kinds. We already have specific artificial intelligences, right? We have computers that are able to - programs that are able to beat human beings reliably at chess and pretty much every other game. And now we're weaponizing them to do all kinds of things, some of which are really dark. There was a story in the paper about the fact that the Chinese have developed an AI algorithm that can facially identify Uyghur Muslims anywhere in China and pick them out of crowds in any city. And police departments are deploying this across the People's Republic in order to keep track of this racial minority. That's one of the things we have, I'm afraid, to look forward to in the future. The deeper fears - the sort of real fears about human meaning come when you posit, as many, many scientists do, what they would call general artificial intelligence - AIs designed not for specific tasks, but for broad intelligence - able to teach themselves and to learn and to quickly become more intelligent, maybe a lot more so than human beings. The scientists who work in this field tell us that this is going to happen soon. The definition of soon ranges from 2025 to 2050 or 2060, but those are the consensus predictions within the field. And we haven't at all begun to think out what that means. We've started to worry that people will lose their jobs to automation, which is something very much to worry about, but we haven't really thought about what it means to replace ourselves with something above us. DAVIES: You know, I'm struggling to understand kind of what the threat is posed by this kind of artificial intelligence, and part of it's because we just don't. . . MCKIBBEN: Well, that's 'cause you need to be. . . DAVIES: Right. MCKIBBEN: . . . Upgraded so you'll caughten (ph) on more quickly, Dave. DAVIES: Right. My grandson will have the chip that can do that. But, I mean, to be specific - I mean, there's the movie \"I, Robot,\" where the robots eventually learn that - they start killing human beings on the street because they've taken over. There are a couple of examples in the book of how you give a robotic intelligence a goal, like making paper clips - right? - or. . . MCKIBBEN: This is the classic canonical example in the field. You assign artificial intelligence the task of making paper clips, and it won't be deviated from this task. It gets - it pursues it single-mindedly, as only a machine could, and figures out how to keep you from turning it off 'cause that's not a very hard task for a super intelligent machine. And it figures out how to divert all - in fact, all the powers of the planet to making yet more paper clips until pretty soon, we're reduced to a kind of pile of them. We haven't taken it seriously because it doesn't, at the moment, seem to impinge on our day-to-day life. But one of the things that climate change taught me is that things happen fast - like, really fast. And before you know it, they're out of control. So the time for thinking about them is when there's still some chance at getting a handle on them. DAVIES: Bill McKibben's new book is called \"Falter: Has The Human Game Begun To Play Itself Out? \" We'll talk some more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF AMANDA GARDIER SONG, \"FJORD\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. Our guest is Bill McKibben. He's been writing about and advocating for action on climate change since the 1980s. He's the author of 15 books. His latest is called \"Falter: Has The Human Game Begun To Play Itself Out? \" The last section of your book is called \"Outside Chance\" - you know, hope, but just a little bit, maybe. You said you find hope in two new technologies. One is the solar panel, and you say you kind of fully realized its possibilities on a reporting trip to Africa. What did you find? MCKIBBEN: Look. I'm a good child of the American suburbs, so I grew up taking everything we take for granted for granted. And I got into Ivory Coast and Ghana and Tanzania into remote villages where people have never had electricity. I was sitting around one day with elders in this community in Ghana who had just had their first power from a solar microgrid. It was hot 'cause it's always hot there, and they kept handing me bottles of cold water to drink, for which I was grateful. But it took me a good 15 minutes to figure out why they were so proud of that. It's because there'd never been anything cold in this hot place before until solar panels had allowed them access to electricity. If you look at it that way, a solar panel is Hogwarts-scale magic, man. You point a sheet of glass at the sun, and out the back comes light and cold and information and all the things of modernity. And it does it without causing the damage that burning fossil fuels does. It's pretty magical stuff. DAVIES: Right, and it can transform a home or a village in Africa. Can it scale up to meet the energy needs of an industrial society? MCKIBBEN: We used to wonder about that. Two things have happened in the last little while. One is this dramatic fall in the price of solar panels and wind turbines. The other is a dramatic fall in the price of storage batteries. So now we're at the point where the fact that the sun goes down at night is not a deal-breaker. Increasingly, we're able to take that power and store it. There was a story in Bloomberg a couple of weeks ago saying that solar-plus batteries is now cheaper than natural gas, even in much of the United States. So even without the dire threat posed by climate change, we'd probably be moving in this direction. Because of the dire threat posed by climate change, we should be moving in this direction as fast as it is possible to imagine doing. DAVIES: Right. You live in Vermont. Do you have solar panels in your house? MCKIBBEN: I have solar panels all over my roof. And I'm glad for them, but I try not to fool myself that that's how we're going to solve climate change. We're past the point where we can do this one house at a time. That's the other kind of miracle technology that we have to work with now from the 20th century. It's this idea of nonviolent movement building, the idea that individuals can become a little less individual and join together with others to form movements big enough, maybe, to take on even the power and wealth of the fossil fuel industry. DAVIES: Yeah. Well, you know, it struck me that one of the things that was interesting about what you found in Africa was that these solar panels were being sold by entrepreneurs, right? I mean, there's money to be made in this. What about the big energy companies taking this on and making that their project? MCKIBBEN: Well, you would've thought they would've 30 years ago. And the reason they didn't is because you can make money off the sun and the wind, but you can't make Exxon kind of money. And the reason is that once the solar panel's up there on your roof, the sun comes for free. From Exxon's point of view, that's the stupidest business model possible. They've spent a century getting people to write them a check every month for another delivery, but the sun delivers it for free. That's why they've worked so hard to derail this technology. And it's why, if we deploy it and as we deploy it, not only do we do something about climate change, we also may do something about the imbalances of power and wealth in our society, much of which is based on the fact that people just happen to live above or control the small deposits of coal and oil and gas on which we depend. They'll be rich people in a solar world, but they won't be Koch brothers rich. And they won't have that degree of warping influence on our politics. DAVIES: You've said many times that the question is, can we make change quickly enough? Give us a sense of the - what kind of time pressure we're under. MCKIBBEN: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, our collection of scientists around the world, organized - sort of self-organized, put out their most important report to date last autumn. It said that to meet the targets set in Paris, we would need fundamental transformation underway by 2030. That is, in this country, we'd need to be - at least half our power coming from renewable sources. That's a really hard transition to make in 10 years. It requires a level of focus and attention that we've never come close to in the past on this issue. So it's going to take everything we've got to get it done. DAVIES: If things don't happen in time, one of the things that people are talking about are big bioengineering solutions - I mean, like, you know, towers into the sky to pump gases or extract gases. And I can't even recall all of them. I've read books about them. How do you feel about those ideas? MCKIBBEN: The most common of these is to say we'll fly a constant fleet of airplanes for the rest of time into the atmosphere, dumping sulfur there. And the sulfur will block some of the incoming solar radiation. The craziness of this is manifold. I mean, look. It would probably change the color of the sky to a nice milky white. We think that this mimics what happens with volcanoes when they put a lot of sulfur into the atmosphere and temporarily cool the planet. But one of the things that often happens then is that the monsoon rains move off the subcontinent, which is an existential problem for a couple of billion people. More to the point, none of this does anything about the deadly twin of global warming, which is the rapid acidification of the oceans. We're an ocean planet. The fact that we're - have already made the oceans 30 percent more acidic would be, by itself, enough reason to get off fossil fuel, even if it didn't do a thing to the temperature. We don't need to pour sulfur into the atmosphere. We need to build a lot of windmills and solar panels. DAVIES: One other thing - you know, we live in a time where civility is in short supply. And you've been trolled and harassed for your activism. What kinds of things have you faced? MCKIBBEN: There was a long time when I didn't talk about any of it. But in the last few years, I've written some about the death threats, which have been a kind of standard-issue part of life for 30 years. We're reaching the point where people on the Internet were, you know, publishing my home address and talking about the specific methods they planned to use and so on and so forth. That kind of incivility - if that seems almost too weak a word for it - is part of our life now. But we can't let it be the thing that keeps us from doing our work. All of this seems crazy to me, at some level. When I set out on this journey, I was a writer, not an activist. It never occurred to me that I was going to end up in jail or in handcuffs a bunch of times and things. And one shouldn't have to. I mean, in a rational world, when scientists issue a blunt warning that the worst thing in the world is happening, you would expect our leaders to go to work. But the world in which we live in, apparently, people do have to do these kind of things. And people have to deal with a lot worse than I have to deal with. There's people around the world - environmentalists - who die every year in countries where this sort of thing has become routine. DAVIES: Well, Bill McKibben, thanks so much for speaking with us again. MCKIBBEN: Dave, what a pleasure. And thank you not just for this interview but for all your work every day. We really enjoy it. DAVIES: Bill McKibben founded the environmental organization 350. org.

JOE PALCA, BYLINE: InSight landed on Mars last November. It was carrying an instrument called a seismometer, a device capable of picking up tiny vibrations. After landing, InSight's robotic arm placed the seismometer on the Martian surface and then covered it with a shell to protect it from picking up vibrations caused by things like blowing wind. Martian quakes are different from earthquakes. On Earth, there are tectonic plates slipping and sliding and banging into each other, causing the ground to shake violently. Mars doesn't have tectonic plates. But occasionally the ground does shake. Sometimes the outer layer of Mars buckles or folds. Sometimes hot material can shift around under the surface. Sometimes a meteorite hits the planet. All of these things can cause measurable tremors. On April 6, the lander's 128th day on Mars, InSight's seismometer recorded this sound. (SOUNDBITE OF ACCELERATED VIBRATIONS)PALCA: It doesn't sound like much, and what you just heard is sped up 60 times because the actual vibrations are too low for the human ear to hear. But mission managers say that is the sound of a marsquake, they think. BRUCE BANERDT: We're not completely sure because it's a very small signal. PALCA: Bruce Banerdt is principal investigator for InSight. He expects the seismometer will hear more quakes. And from the nature of the vibrations, scientists can tell something about the rocks and other materials beneath the surface.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MARVIN: So I went to the store, and I got a bottle of Motrin, and I got a bottle of chewable vitamin C tablets, and I switched the bottles. VEDANTAM: As Anne Marie gave Andrew the vitamins, she made sure the lie didn't look like a lie. MARVIN: I would emphasize that he had to really have a headache. I would treat it as I would a regular drug, that I wouldn't want to medicate unless absolutely necessary. On a couple of rare occasions, he said it didn't work and asked for a second pill. I would make him wait 20 minutes to see if it would work first, as I would a regular medication, before I let him take a second one. I emphasized that I couldn't do any more than that because of the dose. Every single time we used the placebo, the headache went away, usually within about a half an hour. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Anne Marie's small act of parental deception raises lots of questions - if you can make a child's headaches disappear with a vitamin, what else can you do with a placebo? What was happening in Andrew's mind and body as he took the pills? How much was the cure linked to the rituals that Anne Marie built into the treatment? Perhaps most difficult of all, can you get the same results without deception? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: These are not questions doctors generally ask. For centuries, scientists have used placebos mainly to deflate the claims of con men and to test the efficacy of drugs and medical interventions. This week on HIDDEN BRAIN, what it means to be sick and what it means to heal, and the powerful tool that modern medicine has overlooked. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: 1996 was quite the year for men's basketball. It's the year that \"Space Jam,\" starring Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley, made it to theaters. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SPACE JAM\")QUAD CITY DJ'S: (Singing) Welcome to the space jam. Here's your chance, do your dance at the space jam. All right. VEDANTAM: It was also the year of Dream Team III - that was the nickname given to the 1996 U. S. men's Olympic basketball team. They dominated the court in Atlanta. Is that the year we won the gold? J BRUCE MOSELEY: We win the gold every year (laughter). VEDANTAM: (Laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: And they are headed to the gold medal. VEDANTAM: This is Bruce Moseley. If you look closely at old videos of those games, you can see him sitting near the sidelines wearing a sport jacket and tie. He was one of the physicians for the team. You might recognize some of the players Bruce has treated. MOSELEY: Hakeem Olajuwon, Shaquille O'Neal, David Robinson, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, John Stockton, Mitch Richmond. VEDANTAM: For years, Bruce worked as an orthopedic surgeon for the Houston NBA team, the Rockets. He performed lots of intricate surgeries. He loved seeing players glide across the court and soar in the air. He would think, that dunk? I helped make that happen. In a way, that's my knee. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: . . . In game No. 5 in New York. (APPLAUSE)VEDANTAM: Bruce's exceptional surgical skill is what makes it so surprising that he, of all people, would lead a study that questions the primacy of surgical skill. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MOSELEY: Did I ever see myself doing this? The answer is absolutely not. And it wasn't my idea. VEDANTAM: Let's back up a second. In 1989, years before he was a physician for the Rockets, Bruce started working at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. He became interested in a knee surgery that's meant to help people with arthritis. It wasn't a common surgery where he received his medical training. MOSELEY: And then when I came here to Houston, it seemed like surgeons were doing it almost nonstop. VEDANTAM: He found it odd that surgeons in some parts of the country were doing the procedure far more often than others. Patients reported feeling better after the surgery, but no one knew why. Was it because surgeons scrape away bits of tissue from the joint? Was that alleviating the pain? Or could it simply be an effect of saltwater? As part of the procedure, surgeons flush the knee with saline solution. Bruce wanted to run a trial to answer these questions. One set of patients would get the standard surgery; another would just get their joint flushed with saline. He went to a colleague to discuss his plan. MOSELEY: When I pitched it, she was the one that said, well, how do you know it's not all a placebo effect? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: A placebo effect - the same phenomenon that helped 8-year-old Andrew Marvin and the soldiers in \"M*A*S*H. \"MOSELEY: As a surgeon, I was like, this doesn't have anything to do with sugar pills and things like that; this is surgery, after all. VEDANTAM: But Bruce's colleague explained to him that the placebo effect comes in many shapes and sizes. MOSELEY: If it's a small pill, sometimes there's not as big a placebo effect as a bigger pill. Or if they say it's a new and exciting pill, there's probably more of a placebo effect than a traditional pill. And many times an injection can have more of a placebo effect than a pill, and many times, you know, some other intervention can have more of a placebo effect than an injection. And perhaps surgery may have the biggest placebo effect of all. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Surgeons like Bruce don't think about these questions very much because the idea of comparing actual treatment to placebo treatment isn't built into the practice of surgery. MOSELEY: If you're trying to bring a new medication to the market, you have to go through all kinds of randomized trials, including, you know, a placebo group, and prove that your product is superior to the placebo treatment group, while surgeries don't go through that same scrutiny. Surgeries are many times adopted because it's an improvement over a previous surgery, which is an improvement on a previous surgery, which was an improvement on one before that. And long story short, very few surgeries ever go through randomized trials, and almost no surgeries have a placebo control group. VEDANTAM: Bruce and his team decided their study would have not two but three groups. The first would get the real surgery; the second would have saline washed through the joint; the third would be a placebo group. Anyone who signed up was informed about the three possible kinds of treatment. MOSELEY: We told them going in, you're going to get randomized to one of three groups, and these are the three groups. And we actually had them sign a piece of paper that said, I understand that I may be randomized to a control group that is a placebo group, and placebo means pretend, and that if I'm in this group, I'll have a pretend surgery, not a real surgery. And they had to write it in their own handwriting to make sure that they, you know, fully understood everything we were saying. VEDANTAM: The researchers followed certain procedures to make sure all three types of surgeries felt real to everyone involved - real to the patients and their families and as real as possible to the physicians. Bruce would put on his scrubs and walk into the OR without knowing what type of surgery he was going to perform. He found out only when he opened an envelope. MOSELEY: The patient would be wheeled into the room. They'd be placed onto the table. And once they're on the table, we would open the randomization envelope, which would disclose which of the three groups they would be placed into. VEDANTAM: All the patients were given general anesthesia. All got incisions in their knees. Patients in the first two groups received surgery or got their knees flushed with saline. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MOSELEY: And then the third group, the placebo group, they would go to sleep, I'd make three little holes in the skin, and then I wouldn't put any instruments actually inside the knee joint itself. VEDANTAM: Instead, Bruce fired up a video. MOSELEY: I had a videotape of a real arthroscopy that I had done on a patient, and I would pop it in the VCR machine - we would tape all of these surgeries during this time - and I would actually pretend like I was doing with the leg what I would normally do if I was doing those different things during the real surgery. If I put something in the knee on the videotape, I would actually ask for that instrument and pretend like I was doing something. I'd move the leg around. I would splash water. We would ask and pass instruments like we were doing the real thing, even though we weren't doing any real surgery. VEDANTAM: Bruce took these additional measures because he wanted to account for situations where a patient wasn't 100% out from the anesthesia. MOSELEY: The other thing about that videotape was it made certain that we spent the proper amount of time under anesthesia. And for instance, we didn't want the placebo group, where we didn't really do anything, to be much shorter than the other types of surgeries, so that if I went and talked to the nurses in the recovery room or the patient's family afterwards, they could look at their watch and say, oh, that was only 10 minutes, so it must have been a placebo. So we spent the same amount of time with the placebo group pretending to do surgery as if we had done the real surgery in the other groups. VEDANTAM: In all, 180 patients, mostly men, took part in the study. Bruce followed up with them a few times over the course of two years. The results were jaw-dropping. MOSELEY: (Laughter) Yes. I'd say jaw-dropping was probably one of the best ways to describe it. VEDANTAM: Patients in all three groups had similar functioning in their knees. MOSELEY: All three groups basically were the same. All three groups felt they were better off for having had the surgery, that they'd recommend it to family and friends. They'd do it again if they had it - to do all over again. And so the conclusion was that all the benefit of arthroscopic surgery to treat arthritic knees was from a placebo effect. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: To Bruce, the implications were clear. MOSELEY: We shouldn't be doing arthroscopic surgery to treat arthritic knees. And the reason is because, No. 1, it's invasive. And you do go to sleep, and there is risk. And although the complication rate is very low - the chance of bad things happening is pretty low - it's not zero. And so God forbid that you ever put somebody to sleep and did a surgery on them entirely for a pretend surgery effect and they, you know, had a heart attack or stroke or any number of other things, and you would really regret under those circumstances, you know, ever having done that. VEDANTAM: Then there's the money. MOSELEY: If you do arthroscopic knee surgery, which currently is the most commonly performed orthopedic surgery worldwide today, and you're doing it all for a placebo benefit, it's going to run into the millions, probably billions, of dollars of cost. VEDANTAM: If patients are benefiting from the surgery because they're experiencing the placebo effect, Bruce says we should find other more effective treatments and put our money there. To be clear, he doesn't want to suggest that this surgery is ineffective across the board. MOSELEY: This is not an indictment of arthroscopic surgery. I use arthroscopic surgery all the time to treat all kinds of things, just not arthritis. And it's not an indictment of surgery to treat arthritis. We have really effective treatments for severe arthritis. It's called a knee replacement. VEDANTAM: Bruce's study was published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2002. Plenty of people appreciated having an evaluation of this widely used procedure, but many of Bruce's fellow orthopedic surgeons were not pleased. MOSELEY: Oh, my gosh, the vitriol that came out at the different meetings where we presented, and then, if you're a surgeon and you were routinely performing arthroscopic surgery for arthritic knees and your patients were routinely telling you that they were better, you would like to think it's due to your surgical skill. And what my study showed - or I should say our study showed - is that it wasn't due to their surgical skill. It was due to the placebo effect and the fact that patients were going to sleep and believing that they were having something done that would make their knees better. VEDANTAM: Orthopedic surgeons eventually came around. Because of Bruce's study and later trials by other researchers, the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons does not recommend knee arthroscopy in patients with arthritis. In the years since Bruce's study was published, other researchers have run placebo-controlled surgery studies. They've covered a range of pain-related and chronic conditions, from back pain to obesity. In 2015, Bruce looked at the results. Real surgery did help lots of patients, but Bruce also found that substantial numbers of patients got better with placebo surgeries. In the case of pain, improvements from placebo surgeries were almost the same as the improvements were from real surgeries. For Bruce, these results have led him to think about surgery in a new way. MOSELEY: Well, it certainly makes you stop and take pause whenever we're doing a surgery purely for pain relief because from what I know now, just the act of bringing somebody to an operating room, having them go to sleep in this fairly dramatic environment, doing some kind of procedure and having them wake up and go home and then go through a recovery - all of that fuels this very strong emotional and psychological belief on the part of the patient that their pain is going to get better or their, you know, shoulder is going to get better, knee's going to get better, whatever. So it certainly makes you take notice of that. VEDANTAM: But if Bruce has come to feel less confident about the power of some surgeries to heal, he has come to feel more confident about using a power that he previously undervalued. He's realized that the treatment he offers patients isn't just about what he can do in the operating theater. It's about what comes before, what comes after. MOSELEY: Well, I think every time I come out of surgery and go talk to a family that there are aspects of every surgery where you could probably say, I wish I'd done this better or this could have happened a little more efficiently. And most of it's subtlety, nuance. It probably doesn't have anything to do with the ultimate outcome. But I always emphasize the positives, when I'd go talk to the family, that is. I'd share with them all the things that I'm extremely happy about. And I think by emphasizing those things rather than any kind of negatives, the patient's family gets a good feeling about it. They share those feelings with the patient. We emphasize with the patient when they come back to see me in the office the same things. And so I think, you know, all of that you're going to harness the benefit of the placebo effect by fueling into their belief that the surgery or the procedure is going to help them be better. VEDANTAM: All of this, of course, raises tricky ethical and philosophical questions. Should doctors prioritize honesty with their patients above everything else? Or should they prioritize healing even if that occasionally involves deception? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: In 1778, an Austrian physician named Anton Mesmer arrived in Paris. He set up a salon to treat patients. He wanted to heal people, but his treatments involved much more flair and drama than you'd find in most doctor's offices. For one thing, he wore a distinctive outfit. EMILY OGDEN: Mesmer would wear a special purple robe that seemed to be designed to associate him with the signs of the zodiac and astrological power. VEDANTAM: This is Emily Ogden. She's the author of a book about Anton Mesmer and his followers. She's also a professor of English at the University of Virginia. Anton Mesmer's purple robe was a hint of the theatrics that were to come. He'd gather patients in a room decorated with celestial symbols with glass harmonica music filling the air. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: In the middle of the room, there was a device that he called the baquet. Think of a hot tub except shorter with a lid on top. Inside the baquet, there was water and broken glass. OGDEN: And then rods would protrude out of it. VEDANTAM: A group of patients who suffered from a range of physical and psychological maladies sat around the baquet. OGDEN: And he would have each one of them touch one of these metal rods, and he gathered around them a rope which would connect all of the patients to each other. VEDANTAM: Anton Mesmer and his assistants performed a choreographed set of gestures with the patients. OGDEN: It would touch their diaphragms and their stomachs. They would wave iron wands over them. VEDANTAM: The iron rods were supposed to remove the obstructions in the body that cause disease. What happened to these patients after these gestures is part of what made Anton Mesmer famous and infamous. OGDEN: Some of them would become drowsy. Others would become agitated. Some would start to cough and especially cough up fluid, which was not unexpected in the context of signs of illness in humoral medicine at the time. And then some of them would undergo some really dramatic effects, like convulsions. And what seemed to happen, according at least to some of the observers, is that patients would convulse and then that convulsion would spread throughout the room. So it turned into a kind of a pandemonium of symptoms, of convulsions but then also, Mesmer claimed, of cures. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Some patients, in fact, did get better. Anton Mesmer had a theory to explain what was going on. OGDEN: He thought that there was a fluid called animal magnetism that permeated the cosmos but that was particularly active in human nerves. And he thought that through gestures and the use of special instruments you could control the fluid, and that by controlling it, you could cure a wide range of diseases, especially diseases that were thought of at the time as nervous diseases. VEDANTAM: The physician had influential followers, like the French aristocrat Marquis de Lafayette. Lafayette toured the United States to spread word about animal magnetism's miraculous powers. If you're thinking this is bonkers, this Mesmer guy is a fraud, well, you and Ben Franklin have something in common. Yes, that Ben Franklin. He was appointed by the king of France to lead a commission to investigate Mesmer. The commission ran experiments to see if patients were getting better because of animal magnetism or something else. These tests were groundbreaking. They were the first known experiments that involved what we'd now call a placebo control. OGDEN: Which means that they made people believe that they were magnetizing them when they were not magnetizing them. And also conversely, they magnetized patients without their knowledge. VEDANTAM: The results of the experiments did exactly what Anton Mesmer's critics had hoped. They made him look like a fraud. OGDEN: They had one woman who was known to be magnetically susceptible, and they brought her to a room. They blindfolded her. And they had one of the members of the commission pretend to magnetize her, but in fact, he was doing nothing at all. And she, without any magnetization after a certain period of time, went into an elaborate magnetic crisis. VEDANTAM: They did the reverse, too. In one test, an investigator stood behind a panel and waved iron rods at a patient who couldn't see what was happening. OGDEN: She showed no effects whatsoever, although he magnetized her vigorously for some time. And so what the commissioners believed they had shown here was that the effects that Mesmer was eliciting had to do with patient belief and with the bond between the patient and the mesmerizer and not with the animal magnetic fluid. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: The members of the commission believed they had humiliated Anton Mesmer. A future president of the United States made a prediction after the report came out. John Adams said it would annihilate the enthusiasm for mesmerism. The debunking of Anton Mesmer, however, itself fell victim to a falsehood. Investigators did show that mesmeric techniques were no better than a placebo. Critics concluded that mesmerism was worthless, but in fact, this was not true. Some of the investigators themselves noted that while Mesmer's theory of animal magnetism was nonsense, many of his techniques worked. OGDEN: They certainly did think that Mesmer's gestures, that Mesmer's pressure on the stomach, that the excitement of the public treatment salon - they thought that all of those things had their effect. It was just that their effect didn't happen immediately through the communication of animal magnetism but in effect directly by the drama acting on the imagination of the patient. VEDANTAM: When people said mesmerism was worthless, they were saying that only some kinds of cures were real cures. Cures created by drama didn't count. OGDEN: It seems like there's been a kind of an agreement in some of these conversations that in order for a cure to be real, it has to have a physical event associated with it, not a psychological event. VEDANTAM: What Mesmer had really shown was that patients often get better not because of the doctor's skill and not because of the doctors cure but because of the very presence of the doctor. Ironically, most physicians have shied away from this starring role. Only some, like Benjamin Rush, a respected doctor and one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, understood the powerful tool that Anton Mesmer had inadvertently revealed. OGDEN: He said at the time that he deplored Mesmer's silly pretensions to cure by animal magnetism but that he encouraged his medical students to avail themselves of the ability that the imagination had to cure. VEDANTAM: The dilemmas posed by this debate live on in our own time. Even today, centuries after Anton Mesmer produced convulsions in patients, most people in medicine do not believe their job is to harness their patients' imaginations. Ted Kaptchuk is an exception. He believes the drama embedded in the doctor-patient relationship is deeply connected to healing. It's a focus of his research. TED KAPTCHUK: I'm a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, and I'm director of the Program in Placebo Studies at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. VEDANTAM: In the 1970s, when he arrived in Cambridge, Mass. , he was about as far from the world of elite Western medicine as you could imagine. Ted is not a physician. He's an herbalist. He'd studied Chinese medicine in Macao, Taiwan and China. He set up shop on a street in Cambridge with an unflattering reputation. KAPTCHUK: I rented an apartment on quack row. I didn't know it was quack row, but there were lots of all kinds of healers on the street. They were all kinds of energy healers. There were past life - you know, all the new age kind of stuff was on that block. VEDANTAM: Ted's office decor was not what you might call Boston Brahmin. KAPTCHUK: You know, herbalist, so I had at least 200, 300 herbs in jars all over the waiting room and along the walls. I had really wonderful pictures of China. And some of the herbs were animal parts and, you know, lizards and geckos and seahorses. VEDANTAM: Ted got positive feedback from patients all the time, but there were moments that made Ted ask why exactly were patients feeling better. KAPTCHUK: I see people walk into my office, sit down with me for 15, 20 minutes, half hour, and sometimes I'd only write a prescription for herbs. And as they walked out, I saw them walking out with less pain, more bounce in their gait, and their faces were different when they left. And I said, Ted, you just changed that person. That was not the herbs. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Ted looked to traditional Chinese medical texts to help him make sense of these kinds of interactions. KAPTCHUK: And I realized there were statements like the medicine should start working before the patient takes the herbs. I started realizing that something else was going on that was more than my herbs and acupuncture. VEDANTAM: Ted asked himself what was going through the minds of his patients when they walked through his clinic door. They had hope. They'd made the effort to come see him, but many had seen several doctors before him and had been disappointed. KAPTCHUK: So they come with those kinds of feelings, and they go into a ritual that, you know, I ask them how they are. I start talking. They expect me to ask some questions. I usually ask questions they didn't expect to make sure they knew they were getting something different. I listen. I would lean over when I thought the patient wanted me to be a little closer. I'd pull back when I saw the patient didn't want me to be closer. I would actually think and say, let me think for a minute, if I thought the patient needed to see me be attentive. I'd sometimes ask people to explain things better. I got to know something about them personally that was important so I could bring it up the next time. All those maneuvers in the context. . . VEDANTAM: That sounds like - that sounds like acting. KAPTCHUK: Hey, it's a drama. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KAPTCHUK: Healing is a ritual and drama that everyone in the world knows at least their cultural forms of it. That drama activates neurons and activates a neurological process that's involved what we call now in biomedicine at this point the placebo effect. You got it right on the head. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Ted was doing what Anton Mesmer was doing. He was using drama to unleash healing. This is where Ted's work on quack row and at Harvard Medical School connect. In 1990, Harvard recruited Ted to do research on alternative medicine. The idea was his experience practicing traditional Chinese medicine would give other researchers useful perspective. At first, Ted didn't feel at home amongst the M. D. and Ph. D. s. KAPTCHUK: I felt like a reptile in a mammalian environment. I was, like, pre-scientific. VEDANTAM: Gradually, Ted became more comfortable with the techniques and norms of contemporary science. Harvard gave him research training and assigned him to some projects. KAPTCHUK: They told me that your job, Ted, is to help us decide or discover or uncover whether any of these alternate treatments are more than a placebo effect. And I would ask my mentors - I said, so what is this placebo effect? And they said, it's the effect of an inert substance. And I said, that's an oxymoron. And I said, you know what? I'm going to make a pivot. I'm going to study the placebo effect, not alternate medicine. VEDANTAM: It's hard to overstate just how unusual that was. In the 1990s, placebos were not a subject of study. They were a tool that pharmaceutical companies and medical researchers used to figure out whether a drug or treatment was effective. KAPTCHUK: If people get better, we want to know if it's because the drug we gave them or is it spontaneous remission or is it because the doctor-patient interaction? Is it because of the ritual of taking pills? Biomedicine is really - is very interested in whether a drug has a specific target that works independent of all those other factors. That's where the placebo control comes in. It's a way of making medicine more like science and more scientific. And it is. VEDANTAM: The problem is this can lead to the same kind of logic we heard from the people who debunked Anton Mesmer. If a drug improves patients' pain by 70% and a placebo improves it by 70%, researchers don't stop and say, wait, sugar pills are alleviating 70% of the pain. They say this drug doesn't work. In other words, cures don't count as cures when they are caused by placebos. KAPTCHUK: It totally dismisses what happens in the placebo arm of a randomized controlled trial. It says, well, this drug is no good. It's no better than placebo. Or this drug is really good. It's better than placebo. VEDANTAM: Rather than dismiss the placebo effect as merely what happens in the control arm of a trial, Ted decided he would study the placebo in its own right. In 2008, he published a study on treatments for irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS. Two hundred sixty-two patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups. All the patients were screened by a doctor. The first group was told to keep doing what they had been previously doing. The idea was to see if patients got better merely through the passage of time. Think of this as the time heals arm of the study. The second group was assigned to a pretend treatment involving acupuncture needles. The last group got the pretend treatment plus a bonus. They also had a warm, empathetic conversation with the acupuncturist who was trained to ask them a number of questions. KAPTCHUK: Why they thought they had the illness, what made it better, we asked them how does it affect their work, how does it affect their lives, and we did things like touch, attentive listening, we asked them to repeat words to explain to us what was meant. VEDANTAM: Ted also gave the acupuncturists acting advice. KAPTCHUK: Ask the patient if you can be still for 20 seconds and think about them and then ask them an important question that they would want to hear. VEDANTAM: What Ted and his colleagues did with the study was to break down the placebo effect into three components. Each arm built on the other. One - time heals. Two - time heals plus a pretend treatment. Three - time heals plus a pretend treatment plus warm interactions with a health care provider. KAPTCHUK: And we got really a very straight line. We had a small placebo effect with no treatment because time heals. We had a moderate placebo effect with just a fake treatment. And then we did the full monty - it went up to 60% improvement of adequate relief; that's incredible amount of placebo effect. VEDANTAM: Ted had shown that the placebo effect could be valuable in its own right as a treatment. His study demonstrated that the placebo effect was made up of different factors, each of which could be deliberately employed to unleash healing. But Ted also recognized that placebos demanded something that made doctors uncomfortable - deception. KAPTCHUK: Everyone believed that deception or concealment is necessary for people to respond to placebo because the idea was, well, you fake people, you trick them; placebo's kind of this trickery. And I sat with myself for a long time, read the literature, and I said, you know what? No one's tested that ever in history. What's going on here? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: When we come back, is deception necessary for the placebo effect to work? Can honesty and the placebo effect mix? LINDA BONANNO: I find this just as astonishing as anybody else, and I'm the patient here. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: There's something about sitting in a chair at a hair salon that makes people talk. It feels safe to discuss personal things. When clients have a cape draped around their necks and wisps of hair are falling to the floor, they gab. BONANNO: Oh, yeah. They tell you all their problems, their troubles and the good stuff, the bad stuff, yeah (laughter). VEDANTAM: This is Linda Bonanno (ph). She's been a hairdresser in northern Massachusetts for decades. Linda realized that people often walk out of her salon with a feeling of ease; she thinks it's because she's a good listener. How would you be able to tell when someone felt better after they had talked with you? Would you look for signs to sort of know that they were happy? BONANNO: Oh, you could see. You could see they'd have a smile on their face, their personality changes, their attitude changes, tone of their voice. VEDANTAM: Linda has also seen what such interactions look like from the opposite perspective - as someone who confides in others. That's because for many years, she's had to seek out medical care for a debilitating condition. BONANNO: I'd end up with severe diarrhea, intestinal pains, running to the bathroom all the time. Sometimes the pains would come, like, every half an hour. I couldn't even move. It was worse than labor pains. You're better off having a baby than what I went through. It was very, very severe. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: The pain and diarrhea interfered with every part of Linda's life. She had to skip meals before social events. She got used to living gatherings early. She couldn't get work done. BONANNO: I used to run machinery. I worked for a medical company. And I remember one time I was keeling over in pain. I went, oh, how am I going to run this machine? And I figured I'd better go home. My boss wouldn't let me leave early; I had to wait till 7 o'clock. And I'm thinking, how am I going to run this machine? So thank God my buddies there, they know what I go through. They said, Linda, sit down, don't worry about it; we'll take care of it for you until 7 o'clock comes, and then you can leave. But the thing is, the episode makes me drag at least two days. I can't go to work; I can't do anything. VEDANTAM: A doctor told her she was lactose intolerant. She cut out dairy, but it didn't help. She continued to organize her life around the inevitability of pain. Linda had been suffering for a decade when an opportunity appeared on TV. BONANNO: It was like a commercial. The advertising came on, and my eyes perked. I went, oh, what's this? VEDANTAM: A nearby hospital was conducting a study on patients with intestinal problems. Linda wasn't sure she'd be a good fit, but she figured, hey, you never know. She made an appointment and took some tests. It turned out she was a good fit. She was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS. A physician gave Linda capsules to take twice a day. But then he told Linda something that dashed her hopes - the capsules she was about to take, they were a placebo. BONANNO: Oh, I was disappointed; I knew it was a sugar pill. Because I graduated from Hester College (ph) as a medical assistant, so I knew a placebo was a sugar pill. And I thought, he made me come all the way down here to take a sugar pill? (Laughter) I thought to myself, why is he doing this? VEDANTAM: Why tell Linda she was getting a placebo? Wouldn't that undermine the effect of the sugar pill? Well, that's what the study was supposed to test - could a placebo help patients if they knew it was a placebo? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: The study had 80 patients and was being run by Ted Kaptchuk. It was an open-label placebo trial - instead of deception, patients would receive what Ted has called radical honesty. The study was based on an insight - the placebo effect wasn't just about the pills; it was about an edifice of drama, rituals and the trust between patients like Linda and their doctors. Even though Linda was disappointed to get a placebo, she followed her doctor's orders. BONANNO: I just took them and went about my day. I said, this is not going to work if it's a sugar pill. And it wasn't till the fourth day I realized I wasn't sick anymore. I said, this can't be. VEDANTAM: Starting on that fourth day, the pain that Linda had suffered through for a decade vanished. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)BONANNO: For three weeks, I felt fantastic. I had no IBS. I wasn't sick. I was taking those pills every day. And I couldn't believe it. VEDANTAM: Many other patients in the study got similar relief. Volunteers who received the open-label placebo reported twice the improvement in their quality of life as those who received no treatment. Now, this was a small study, but Ted has looked at the effects of using open-label placebos for other medical conditions. He's found similar, sometimes even better, results for low back pain and cancer-related fatigue. Placebos administered with radical honesty have the potential to help people. KAPTCHUK: We turned the apple cart over on placebo studies. We said that everything we were saying about placebo before was actually not true, and there's probably more that's not true. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: After being on the placebo for three weeks, Linda went back to her doctor. She told him how great she felt. She wanted to keep taking the pills, but the doctor said no. The study protocol only permitted patients to get placebos during the study. BONANNO: He said, no, no, no, I can't let you keep them. I said, what? I said, what am I supposed to do now? He says, well, you'll be fine. And I thought, well, all right. And I'm thinking I'm not going to be fine; I know I'm not going to. VEDANTAM: Linda tried to be optimistic. The first few days, she didn't feel pain, so she thought the pills might have gotten rid of her IBS. But on the fourth day, the pain came back. Linda returned to her old ways of coping - taking anti-diarrhea drugs, restricting her diet, staying away from social activities. It went on for years. Finally, Linda reached out to Ted Kaptchuk. He agreed to take her on as a patient, and he offered to put her on a placebo once again. BONANNO: And then I thought, well, that would be great. VEDANTAM: But then her mind quickly jumped to concern. BONANNO: OK, it worked last time. If I take it again this time, is it going to work? I thought maybe it's not going to do anything, second time around, and then I would have been even more disappointed. VEDANTAM: Despite her concerns, she decided to try the placebo again. BONANNO: Because when you're really sick with IBS, you will do and try anything, anything to get rid of the pain and get back to normal. I did whatever these doctors told me to do. And thank God I did because when I went back with Dr. Kaptchuk and he put me back on the placebos, it didn't even take a week, and everything was gone again. And I'm - I still - when I think about it, I'm stunned. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)BONANNO: I don't understand it. I don't - I'm at a point, to tell you the truth (laughter), I don't even care anymore; I just want it to disappear, and that's it. VEDANTAM: Even if Linda didn't fully understand what happened, she has some guesses about what relieved her pain; one vital factor - her deep faith in Ted Kaptchuk. BONANNO: He has a lot of patients. He's extremely intelligent. Something about his personality - very calming. When you talk to him, you feel like you had a complete body massage. VEDANTAM: Contrast this with her impersonal interaction with a doctor who diagnosed her with lactose intolerance. BONANNO: He was the kind of doctor just like a patient at the deli, you know (laughter). VEDANTAM: Of course, there are still many things we don't know. We don't fully understand why Linda got better on the placebo and why she got worse when she stopped. We don't know how generalizable her experience is to others. Would we get less impressive results if placebos became a common treatment rather than a novel one? What if patients obtain placebos from a pharmacy rather than from a kind doctor in a clinic? There's another problem - for some, the idea that placebos may be helpful is frustrating, even infuriating. In 2018, researchers from Northwestern University published a study showing that sugar pills can be effective in treating some patients who suffer from chronic pain. Some of the very patients who might benefit from that insight, people in chronic pain, took to Facebook to describe how demeaned they felt. One woman wrote, this is one of the worst insults to those with true chronic pain. This kind of pain is not all in their heads. They have real, documented reasons to have moderate to severe pain, and offering a placebo is unethical and a grave insult. Ted understands where such criticism is coming from; people think that if a placebo works, that means a patient was faking or that her suffering wasn't real or that the pain was purely psychological. Ted says nothing could be further from the truth. KAPTCHUK: The placebo effect is not a mind-body New Age mind cure. Those things happen not because you think but because you do, you perform, and you enact. The placebo effect is embodied in what patients and doctors do. It's way below and much stronger than thinking you're going to get better, and you get better. VEDANTAM: Patients aren't the only ones who are skeptical of the placebo effect; some researchers are as well. ASBJORN HROBJARTSSON: My name is Asbjorn Hrobjartsson. I'm a professor at the University of Southern Denmark. VEDANTAM: Asbjorn has analyzed hundreds of placebo-controlled studies. In general, he does not find a very strong placebo effect in most of the studies he reviewed. HROBJARTSSON: There is no indication, based on the trials we looked at, that there is a very large effect of placebo on very many patients across very many conditions. VEDANTAM: That said, Asbjorn did find variations in the studies, and in some cases, he did find a large effect. The placebo effect was larger in conditions where patients reported their own outcomes, things like pain and nausea, and smaller in cases where doctors made measurements, things like hypertension. Asbjorn also found what Bruce Moseley discovered in Houston - if a pill produces a small placebo effect, treatments that look and sound dramatic induce bigger effects. HROBJARTSSON: We clearly see that the more theatrical or dramatic placebo, those with kind of - with needling or with machines that make a sound, they tend to have larger effects. VEDANTAM: Most of the studies Asbjorn looked at were testing the efficacy of various drugs; they just had a placebo arm. They were not designed to elicit the placebo effect in the way Ted Kaptchuk has done; they didn't focus on all the rituals around treatment. Asbjorn agrees that studies like those - what are sometimes called active placebo studies - could produce very different results. That's because they're designed to look beyond the effect of pills to activate things like the doctor-patient relationship. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: About a year into her second round of placebo treatment, Linda ended up in the hospital for back surgery. She couldn't get to Ted's office to pick up placebo pills. She was worried her IBS would return. But it didn't. BONANNO: Now I don't even take placebos. You know what it's like to be back to normal, to have a normal life like everybody else and never have to think once what condition you're in or if you're going to get sick or what's going to happen? It doesn't even enter my mind. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: When we go to a doctor, we need two different things. The first is explicit and obvious - we want someone skilled and knowledgeable who can diagnose us correctly, who knows which pills or procedures are likely to help. But we also have implicit needs. We want someone who can attend to our suffering, not just to our illness. We need someone to trust in moments of fear and vulnerability. We want more than answers; we want reassurance. For overworked doctors and overburdened medical systems, our explicit needs can feel more urgent than our implicit needs. Surgeries and medications can seem more rigorous than the techniques to address our implicit needs - acting and storytelling and rituals. On top of that, these elements of performance may feel unseemly, like the behavior of snake oil salesmen. But when both kinds of needs are met, doctors and patients are more likely to get the outcome they both want - healing. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This week's episode was produced by Rhaina Cohen.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: When you're 8 years old, it's not easy to say goodbye to your dad for a whole year. But that's what Andrew Marvin (ph) had to do; his dad was a commander in the Navy and was deployed to Bahrain. While his dad was away, something happened to Andrew. ANNE MARIE MARVIN: Every time my husband's name was brought up, he would develop a headache. VEDANTAM: This is Andrew's mom, Anne Marie Marvin (ph). She knew her son's pain was real. She didn't want him to suffer. As she tried to figure out how to help, she remembered an episode of the TV show \"M*A*S*H. \" The series is set in a fictionalized Army hospital. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"M*A*S*H\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character) Come on, guys. Let's go back to the tent. Come on. Come on. VEDANTAM: The doctors had a problem on their hands - the hospital was full of wounded soldiers but was out of painkillers. A colonel suggested an unusual solution - treat the patients with a placebo. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"M*A*S*H\") HARRY MORGAN: (As Colonel Sherman T. Potter) Here's the formula - if we believe it, they believe it. Otherwise, they're only taking sugar pills. VEDANTAM: The doctors gave out the placebos, while pretending they were real pills; sure enough, it worked. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"M*A*S*H\") MORGAN: (As Colonel Sherman T. Potter) You're really beginning to feel it, aren't you, son? UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character) Yeah. The arm stopped throbbing. MORGAN: (As Colonel Sherman T. Potter) It's going to feel even better. Now get some sleep. VEDANTAM: The lesson Anne Marie took away from the scene was - make the placebo treatment look real. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARVIN: So I went to the store, and I got a bottle of Motrin, and I got a bottle of chewable vitamin C tablets, and I switched the bottles. VEDANTAM: As Anne Marie gave Andrew the vitamins, she made sure the lie didn't look like a lie. MARVIN: I would emphasize that he had to really have a headache. I would treat it as I would a regular drug, that I wouldn't want to medicate unless absolutely necessary. On a couple of rare occasions, he said it didn't work and asked for a second pill. I would make him wait 20 minutes to see if it would work first, as I would a regular medication, before I let him take a second one. I emphasized that I couldn't do any more than that because of the dose. Every single time we used the placebo, the headache went away, usually within about a half an hour. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Anne Marie's small act of parental deception raises lots of questions - if you can make a child's headaches disappear with a vitamin, what else can you do with a placebo? What was happening in Andrew's mind and body as he took the pills? How much was the cure linked to the rituals that Anne Marie built into the treatment? Perhaps most difficult of all, can you get the same results without deception? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: These are not questions doctors generally ask. For centuries, scientists have used placebos mainly to deflate the claims of con men and to test the efficacy of drugs and medical interventions. This week on HIDDEN BRAIN, what it means to be sick and what it means to heal, and the powerful tool that modern medicine has overlooked. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: 1996 was quite the year for men's basketball. It's the year that \"Space Jam,\" starring Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley, made it to theaters. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SPACE JAM\") QUAD CITY DJ'S: (Singing) Welcome to the space jam. Here's your chance, do your dance at the space jam. All right. VEDANTAM: It was also the year of Dream Team III - that was the nickname given to the 1996 U. S. men's Olympic basketball team. They dominated the court in Atlanta. Is that the year we won the gold? J BRUCE MOSELEY: We win the gold every year (laughter). VEDANTAM: (Laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: And they are headed to the gold medal. VEDANTAM: This is Bruce Moseley. If you look closely at old videos of those games, you can see him sitting near the sidelines wearing a sport jacket and tie. He was one of the physicians for the team. You might recognize some of the players Bruce has treated. MOSELEY: Hakeem Olajuwon, Shaquille O'Neal, David Robinson, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, John Stockton, Mitch Richmond. VEDANTAM: For years, Bruce worked as an orthopedic surgeon for the Houston NBA team, the Rockets. He performed lots of intricate surgeries. He loved seeing players glide across the court and soar in the air. He would think, that dunk? I helped make that happen. In a way, that's my knee. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: . . . In game No. 5 in New York. (APPLAUSE) VEDANTAM: Bruce's exceptional surgical skill is what makes it so surprising that he, of all people, would lead a study that questions the primacy of surgical skill. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MOSELEY: Did I ever see myself doing this? The answer is absolutely not. And it wasn't my idea. VEDANTAM: Let's back up a second. In 1989, years before he was a physician for the Rockets, Bruce started working at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. He became interested in a knee surgery that's meant to help people with arthritis. It wasn't a common surgery where he received his medical training. MOSELEY: And then when I came here to Houston, it seemed like surgeons were doing it almost nonstop. VEDANTAM: He found it odd that surgeons in some parts of the country were doing the procedure far more often than others. Patients reported feeling better after the surgery, but no one knew why. Was it because surgeons scrape away bits of tissue from the joint? Was that alleviating the pain? Or could it simply be an effect of saltwater? As part of the procedure, surgeons flush the knee with saline solution. Bruce wanted to run a trial to answer these questions. One set of patients would get the standard surgery; another would just get their joint flushed with saline. He went to a colleague to discuss his plan. MOSELEY: When I pitched it, she was the one that said, well, how do you know it's not all a placebo effect? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: A placebo effect - the same phenomenon that helped 8-year-old Andrew Marvin and the soldiers in \"M*A*S*H. \" MOSELEY: As a surgeon, I was like, this doesn't have anything to do with sugar pills and things like that; this is surgery, after all. VEDANTAM: But Bruce's colleague explained to him that the placebo effect comes in many shapes and sizes. MOSELEY: If it's a small pill, sometimes there's not as big a placebo effect as a bigger pill. Or if they say it's a new and exciting pill, there's probably more of a placebo effect than a traditional pill. And many times an injection can have more of a placebo effect than a pill, and many times, you know, some other intervention can have more of a placebo effect than an injection. And perhaps surgery may have the biggest placebo effect of all. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Surgeons like Bruce don't think about these questions very much because the idea of comparing actual treatment to placebo treatment isn't built into the practice of surgery. MOSELEY: If you're trying to bring a new medication to the market, you have to go through all kinds of randomized trials, including, you know, a placebo group, and prove that your product is superior to the placebo treatment group, while surgeries don't go through that same scrutiny. Surgeries are many times adopted because it's an improvement over a previous surgery, which is an improvement on a previous surgery, which was an improvement on one before that. And long story short, very few surgeries ever go through randomized trials, and almost no surgeries have a placebo control group. VEDANTAM: Bruce and his team decided their study would have not two but three groups. The first would get the real surgery; the second would have saline washed through the joint; the third would be a placebo group. Anyone who signed up was informed about the three possible kinds of treatment. MOSELEY: We told them going in, you're going to get randomized to one of three groups, and these are the three groups. And we actually had them sign a piece of paper that said, I understand that I may be randomized to a control group that is a placebo group, and placebo means pretend, and that if I'm in this group, I'll have a pretend surgery, not a real surgery. And they had to write it in their own handwriting to make sure that they, you know, fully understood everything we were saying. VEDANTAM: The researchers followed certain procedures to make sure all three types of surgeries felt real to everyone involved - real to the patients and their families and as real as possible to the physicians. Bruce would put on his scrubs and walk into the OR without knowing what type of surgery he was going to perform. He found out only when he opened an envelope. MOSELEY: The patient would be wheeled into the room. They'd be placed onto the table. And once they're on the table, we would open the randomization envelope, which would disclose which of the three groups they would be placed into. VEDANTAM: All the patients were given general anesthesia. All got incisions in their knees. Patients in the first two groups received surgery or got their knees flushed with saline. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MOSELEY: And then the third group, the placebo group, they would go to sleep, I'd make three little holes in the skin, and then I wouldn't put any instruments actually inside the knee joint itself. VEDANTAM: Instead, Bruce fired up a video. MOSELEY: I had a videotape of a real arthroscopy that I had done on a patient, and I would pop it in the VCR machine - we would tape all of these surgeries during this time - and I would actually pretend like I was doing with the leg what I would normally do if I was doing those different things during the real surgery. If I put something in the knee on the videotape, I would actually ask for that instrument and pretend like I was doing something. I'd move the leg around. I would splash water. We would ask and pass instruments like we were doing the real thing, even though we weren't doing any real surgery. VEDANTAM: Bruce took these additional measures because he wanted to account for situations where a patient wasn't 100% out from the anesthesia. MOSELEY: The other thing about that videotape was it made certain that we spent the proper amount of time under anesthesia. And for instance, we didn't want the placebo group, where we didn't really do anything, to be much shorter than the other types of surgeries, so that if I went and talked to the nurses in the recovery room or the patient's family afterwards, they could look at their watch and say, oh, that was only 10 minutes, so it must have been a placebo. So we spent the same amount of time with the placebo group pretending to do surgery as if we had done the real surgery in the other groups. VEDANTAM: In all, 180 patients, mostly men, took part in the study. Bruce followed up with them a few times over the course of two years. The results were jaw-dropping. MOSELEY: (Laughter) Yes. I'd say jaw-dropping was probably one of the best ways to describe it. VEDANTAM: Patients in all three groups had similar functioning in their knees. MOSELEY: All three groups basically were the same. All three groups felt they were better off for having had the surgery, that they'd recommend it to family and friends. They'd do it again if they had it - to do all over again. And so the conclusion was that all the benefit of arthroscopic surgery to treat arthritic knees was from a placebo effect. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: To Bruce, the implications were clear. MOSELEY: We shouldn't be doing arthroscopic surgery to treat arthritic knees. And the reason is because, No. 1, it's invasive. And you do go to sleep, and there is risk. And although the complication rate is very low - the chance of bad things happening is pretty low - it's not zero. And so God forbid that you ever put somebody to sleep and did a surgery on them entirely for a pretend surgery effect and they, you know, had a heart attack or stroke or any number of other things, and you would really regret under those circumstances, you know, ever having done that. VEDANTAM: Then there's the money. MOSELEY: If you do arthroscopic knee surgery, which currently is the most commonly performed orthopedic surgery worldwide today, and you're doing it all for a placebo benefit, it's going to run into the millions, probably billions, of dollars of cost. VEDANTAM: If patients are benefiting from the surgery because they're experiencing the placebo effect, Bruce says we should find other more effective treatments and put our money there. To be clear, he doesn't want to suggest that this surgery is ineffective across the board. MOSELEY: This is not an indictment of arthroscopic surgery. I use arthroscopic surgery all the time to treat all kinds of things, just not arthritis. And it's not an indictment of surgery to treat arthritis. We have really effective treatments for severe arthritis. It's called a knee replacement. VEDANTAM: Bruce's study was published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2002. Plenty of people appreciated having an evaluation of this widely used procedure, but many of Bruce's fellow orthopedic surgeons were not pleased. MOSELEY: Oh, my gosh, the vitriol that came out at the different meetings where we presented, and then, if you're a surgeon and you were routinely performing arthroscopic surgery for arthritic knees and your patients were routinely telling you that they were better, you would like to think it's due to your surgical skill. And what my study showed - or I should say our study showed - is that it wasn't due to their surgical skill. It was due to the placebo effect and the fact that patients were going to sleep and believing that they were having something done that would make their knees better. VEDANTAM: Orthopedic surgeons eventually came around. Because of Bruce's study and later trials by other researchers, the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons does not recommend knee arthroscopy in patients with arthritis. In the years since Bruce's study was published, other researchers have run placebo-controlled surgery studies. They've covered a range of pain-related and chronic conditions, from back pain to obesity. In 2015, Bruce looked at the results. Real surgery did help lots of patients, but Bruce also found that substantial numbers of patients got better with placebo surgeries. In the case of pain, improvements from placebo surgeries were almost the same as the improvements were from real surgeries. For Bruce, these results have led him to think about surgery in a new way. MOSELEY: Well, it certainly makes you stop and take pause whenever we're doing a surgery purely for pain relief because from what I know now, just the act of bringing somebody to an operating room, having them go to sleep in this fairly dramatic environment, doing some kind of procedure and having them wake up and go home and then go through a recovery - all of that fuels this very strong emotional and psychological belief on the part of the patient that their pain is going to get better or their, you know, shoulder is going to get better, knee's going to get better, whatever. So it certainly makes you take notice of that. VEDANTAM: But if Bruce has come to feel less confident about the power of some surgeries to heal, he has come to feel more confident about using a power that he previously undervalued. He's realized that the treatment he offers patients isn't just about what he can do in the operating theater. It's about what comes before, what comes after. MOSELEY: Well, I think every time I come out of surgery and go talk to a family that there are aspects of every surgery where you could probably say, I wish I'd done this better or this could have happened a little more efficiently. And most of it's subtlety, nuance. It probably doesn't have anything to do with the ultimate outcome. But I always emphasize the positives, when I'd go talk to the family, that is. I'd share with them all the things that I'm extremely happy about. And I think by emphasizing those things rather than any kind of negatives, the patient's family gets a good feeling about it. They share those feelings with the patient. We emphasize with the patient when they come back to see me in the office the same things. And so I think, you know, all of that you're going to harness the benefit of the placebo effect by fueling into their belief that the surgery or the procedure is going to help them be better. VEDANTAM: All of this, of course, raises tricky ethical and philosophical questions. Should doctors prioritize honesty with their patients above everything else? Or should they prioritize healing even if that occasionally involves deception? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: In 1778, an Austrian physician named Anton Mesmer arrived in Paris. He set up a salon to treat patients. He wanted to heal people, but his treatments involved much more flair and drama than you'd find in most doctor's offices. For one thing, he wore a distinctive outfit. EMILY OGDEN: Mesmer would wear a special purple robe that seemed to be designed to associate him with the signs of the zodiac and astrological power. VEDANTAM: This is Emily Ogden. She's the author of a book about Anton Mesmer and his followers. She's also a professor of English at the University of Virginia. Anton Mesmer's purple robe was a hint of the theatrics that were to come. He'd gather patients in a room decorated with celestial symbols with glass harmonica music filling the air. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: In the middle of the room, there was a device that he called the baquet. Think of a hot tub except shorter with a lid on top. Inside the baquet, there was water and broken glass. OGDEN: And then rods would protrude out of it. VEDANTAM: A group of patients who suffered from a range of physical and psychological maladies sat around the baquet. OGDEN: And he would have each one of them touch one of these metal rods, and he gathered around them a rope which would connect all of the patients to each other. VEDANTAM: Anton Mesmer and his assistants performed a choreographed set of gestures with the patients. OGDEN: It would touch their diaphragms and their stomachs. They would wave iron wands over them. VEDANTAM: The iron rods were supposed to remove the obstructions in the body that cause disease. What happened to these patients after these gestures is part of what made Anton Mesmer famous and infamous. OGDEN: Some of them would become drowsy. Others would become agitated. Some would start to cough and especially cough up fluid, which was not unexpected in the context of signs of illness in humoral medicine at the time. And then some of them would undergo some really dramatic effects, like convulsions. And what seemed to happen, according at least to some of the observers, is that patients would convulse and then that convulsion would spread throughout the room. So it turned into a kind of a pandemonium of symptoms, of convulsions but then also, Mesmer claimed, of cures. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Some patients, in fact, did get better. Anton Mesmer had a theory to explain what was going on. OGDEN: He thought that there was a fluid called animal magnetism that permeated the cosmos but that was particularly active in human nerves. And he thought that through gestures and the use of special instruments you could control the fluid, and that by controlling it, you could cure a wide range of diseases, especially diseases that were thought of at the time as nervous diseases. VEDANTAM: The physician had influential followers, like the French aristocrat Marquis de Lafayette. Lafayette toured the United States to spread word about animal magnetism's miraculous powers. If you're thinking this is bonkers, this Mesmer guy is a fraud, well, you and Ben Franklin have something in common. Yes, that Ben Franklin. He was appointed by the king of France to lead a commission to investigate Mesmer. The commission ran experiments to see if patients were getting better because of animal magnetism or something else. These tests were groundbreaking. They were the first known experiments that involved what we'd now call a placebo control. OGDEN: Which means that they made people believe that they were magnetizing them when they were not magnetizing them. And also conversely, they magnetized patients without their knowledge. VEDANTAM: The results of the experiments did exactly what Anton Mesmer's critics had hoped. They made him look like a fraud. OGDEN: They had one woman who was known to be magnetically susceptible, and they brought her to a room. They blindfolded her. And they had one of the members of the commission pretend to magnetize her, but in fact, he was doing nothing at all. And she, without any magnetization after a certain period of time, went into an elaborate magnetic crisis. VEDANTAM: They did the reverse, too. In one test, an investigator stood behind a panel and waved iron rods at a patient who couldn't see what was happening. OGDEN: She showed no effects whatsoever, although he magnetized her vigorously for some time. And so what the commissioners believed they had shown here was that the effects that Mesmer was eliciting had to do with patient belief and with the bond between the patient and the mesmerizer and not with the animal magnetic fluid. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: The members of the commission believed they had humiliated Anton Mesmer. A future president of the United States made a prediction after the report came out. John Adams said it would annihilate the enthusiasm for mesmerism. The debunking of Anton Mesmer, however, itself fell victim to a falsehood. Investigators did show that mesmeric techniques were no better than a placebo. Critics concluded that mesmerism was worthless, but in fact, this was not true. Some of the investigators themselves noted that while Mesmer's theory of animal magnetism was nonsense, many of his techniques worked. OGDEN: They certainly did think that Mesmer's gestures, that Mesmer's pressure on the stomach, that the excitement of the public treatment salon - they thought that all of those things had their effect. It was just that their effect didn't happen immediately through the communication of animal magnetism but in effect directly by the drama acting on the imagination of the patient. VEDANTAM: When people said mesmerism was worthless, they were saying that only some kinds of cures were real cures. Cures created by drama didn't count. OGDEN: It seems like there's been a kind of an agreement in some of these conversations that in order for a cure to be real, it has to have a physical event associated with it, not a psychological event. VEDANTAM: What Mesmer had really shown was that patients often get better not because of the doctor's skill and not because of the doctors cure but because of the very presence of the doctor. Ironically, most physicians have shied away from this starring role. Only some, like Benjamin Rush, a respected doctor and one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, understood the powerful tool that Anton Mesmer had inadvertently revealed. OGDEN: He said at the time that he deplored Mesmer's silly pretensions to cure by animal magnetism but that he encouraged his medical students to avail themselves of the ability that the imagination had to cure. VEDANTAM: The dilemmas posed by this debate live on in our own time. Even today, centuries after Anton Mesmer produced convulsions in patients, most people in medicine do not believe their job is to harness their patients' imaginations. Ted Kaptchuk is an exception. He believes the drama embedded in the doctor-patient relationship is deeply connected to healing. It's a focus of his research. TED KAPTCHUK: I'm a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, and I'm director of the Program in Placebo Studies at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. VEDANTAM: In the 1970s, when he arrived in Cambridge, Mass. , he was about as far from the world of elite Western medicine as you could imagine. Ted is not a physician. He's an herbalist. He'd studied Chinese medicine in Macao, Taiwan and China. He set up shop on a street in Cambridge with an unflattering reputation. KAPTCHUK: I rented an apartment on quack row. I didn't know it was quack row, but there were lots of all kinds of healers on the street. They were all kinds of energy healers. There were past life - you know, all the new age kind of stuff was on that block. VEDANTAM: Ted's office decor was not what you might call Boston Brahmin. KAPTCHUK: You know, herbalist, so I had at least 200, 300 herbs in jars all over the waiting room and along the walls. I had really wonderful pictures of China. And some of the herbs were animal parts and, you know, lizards and geckos and seahorses. VEDANTAM: Ted got positive feedback from patients all the time, but there were moments that made Ted ask why exactly were patients feeling better. KAPTCHUK: I see people walk into my office, sit down with me for 15, 20 minutes, half hour, and sometimes I'd only write a prescription for herbs. And as they walked out, I saw them walking out with less pain, more bounce in their gait, and their faces were different when they left. And I said, Ted, you just changed that person. That was not the herbs. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Ted looked to traditional Chinese medical texts to help him make sense of these kinds of interactions. KAPTCHUK: And I realized there were statements like the medicine should start working before the patient takes the herbs. I started realizing that something else was going on that was more than my herbs and acupuncture. VEDANTAM: Ted asked himself what was going through the minds of his patients when they walked through his clinic door. They had hope. They'd made the effort to come see him, but many had seen several doctors before him and had been disappointed. KAPTCHUK: So they come with those kinds of feelings, and they go into a ritual that, you know, I ask them how they are. I start talking. They expect me to ask some questions. I usually ask questions they didn't expect to make sure they knew they were getting something different. I listen. I would lean over when I thought the patient wanted me to be a little closer. I'd pull back when I saw the patient didn't want me to be closer. I would actually think and say, let me think for a minute, if I thought the patient needed to see me be attentive. I'd sometimes ask people to explain things better. I got to know something about them personally that was important so I could bring it up the next time. All those maneuvers in the context. . . VEDANTAM: That sounds like - that sounds like acting. KAPTCHUK: Hey, it's a drama. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KAPTCHUK: Healing is a ritual and drama that everyone in the world knows at least their cultural forms of it. That drama activates neurons and activates a neurological process that's involved what we call now in biomedicine at this point the placebo effect. You got it right on the head. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Ted was doing what Anton Mesmer was doing. He was using drama to unleash healing. This is where Ted's work on quack row and at Harvard Medical School connect. In 1990, Harvard recruited Ted to do research on alternative medicine. The idea was his experience practicing traditional Chinese medicine would give other researchers useful perspective. At first, Ted didn't feel at home amongst the M. D. and Ph. D. s. KAPTCHUK: I felt like a reptile in a mammalian environment. I was, like, pre-scientific. VEDANTAM: Gradually, Ted became more comfortable with the techniques and norms of contemporary science. Harvard gave him research training and assigned him to some projects. KAPTCHUK: They told me that your job, Ted, is to help us decide or discover or uncover whether any of these alternate treatments are more than a placebo effect. And I would ask my mentors - I said, so what is this placebo effect? And they said, it's the effect of an inert substance. And I said, that's an oxymoron. And I said, you know what? I'm going to make a pivot. I'm going to study the placebo effect, not alternate medicine. VEDANTAM: It's hard to overstate just how unusual that was. In the 1990s, placebos were not a subject of study. They were a tool that pharmaceutical companies and medical researchers used to figure out whether a drug or treatment was effective. KAPTCHUK: If people get better, we want to know if it's because the drug we gave them or is it spontaneous remission or is it because the doctor-patient interaction? Is it because of the ritual of taking pills? Biomedicine is really - is very interested in whether a drug has a specific target that works independent of all those other factors. That's where the placebo control comes in. It's a way of making medicine more like science and more scientific. And it is. VEDANTAM: The problem is this can lead to the same kind of logic we heard from the people who debunked Anton Mesmer. If a drug improves patients' pain by 70% and a placebo improves it by 70%, researchers don't stop and say, wait, sugar pills are alleviating 70% of the pain. They say this drug doesn't work. In other words, cures don't count as cures when they are caused by placebos. KAPTCHUK: It totally dismisses what happens in the placebo arm of a randomized controlled trial. It says, well, this drug is no good. It's no better than placebo. Or this drug is really good. It's better than placebo. VEDANTAM: Rather than dismiss the placebo effect as merely what happens in the control arm of a trial, Ted decided he would study the placebo in its own right. In 2008, he published a study on treatments for irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS. Two hundred sixty-two patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups. All the patients were screened by a doctor. The first group was told to keep doing what they had been previously doing. The idea was to see if patients got better merely through the passage of time. Think of this as the time heals arm of the study. The second group was assigned to a pretend treatment involving acupuncture needles. The last group got the pretend treatment plus a bonus. They also had a warm, empathetic conversation with the acupuncturist who was trained to ask them a number of questions. KAPTCHUK: Why they thought they had the illness, what made it better, we asked them how does it affect their work, how does it affect their lives, and we did things like touch, attentive listening, we asked them to repeat words to explain to us what was meant. VEDANTAM: Ted also gave the acupuncturists acting advice. KAPTCHUK: Ask the patient if you can be still for 20 seconds and think about them and then ask them an important question that they would want to hear. VEDANTAM: What Ted and his colleagues did with the study was to break down the placebo effect into three components. Each arm built on the other. One - time heals. Two - time heals plus a pretend treatment. Three - time heals plus a pretend treatment plus warm interactions with a health care provider. KAPTCHUK: And we got really a very straight line. We had a small placebo effect with no treatment because time heals. We had a moderate placebo effect with just a fake treatment. And then we did the full monty - it went up to 60% improvement of adequate relief; that's incredible amount of placebo effect. VEDANTAM: Ted had shown that the placebo effect could be valuable in its own right as a treatment. His study demonstrated that the placebo effect was made up of different factors, each of which could be deliberately employed to unleash healing. But Ted also recognized that placebos demanded something that made doctors uncomfortable - deception. KAPTCHUK: Everyone believed that deception or concealment is necessary for people to respond to placebo because the idea was, well, you fake people, you trick them; placebo's kind of this trickery. And I sat with myself for a long time, read the literature, and I said, you know what? No one's tested that ever in history. What's going on here? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: When we come back, is deception necessary for the placebo effect to work? Can honesty and the placebo effect mix? LINDA BONANNO: I find this just as astonishing as anybody else, and I'm the patient here. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: There's something about sitting in a chair at a hair salon that makes people talk. It feels safe to discuss personal things. When clients have a cape draped around their necks and wisps of hair are falling to the floor, they gab. BONANNO: Oh, yeah. They tell you all their problems, their troubles and the good stuff, the bad stuff, yeah (laughter). VEDANTAM: This is Linda Bonanno (ph). She's been a hairdresser in northern Massachusetts for decades. Linda realized that people often walk out of her salon with a feeling of ease; she thinks it's because she's a good listener. How would you be able to tell when someone felt better after they had talked with you? Would you look for signs to sort of know that they were happy? BONANNO: Oh, you could see. You could see they'd have a smile on their face, their personality changes, their attitude changes, tone of their voice. VEDANTAM: Linda has also seen what such interactions look like from the opposite perspective - as someone who confides in others. That's because for many years, she's had to seek out medical care for a debilitating condition. BONANNO: I'd end up with severe diarrhea, intestinal pains, running to the bathroom all the time. Sometimes the pains would come, like, every half an hour. I couldn't even move. It was worse than labor pains. You're better off having a baby than what I went through. It was very, very severe. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: The pain and diarrhea interfered with every part of Linda's life. She had to skip meals before social events. She got used to living gatherings early. She couldn't get work done. BONANNO: I used to run machinery. I worked for a medical company. And I remember one time I was keeling over in pain. I went, oh, how am I going to run this machine? And I figured I'd better go home. My boss wouldn't let me leave early; I had to wait till 7 o'clock. And I'm thinking, how am I going to run this machine? So thank God my buddies there, they know what I go through. They said, Linda, sit down, don't worry about it; we'll take care of it for you until 7 o'clock comes, and then you can leave. But the thing is, the episode makes me drag at least two days. I can't go to work; I can't do anything. VEDANTAM: A doctor told her she was lactose intolerant. She cut out dairy, but it didn't help. She continued to organize her life around the inevitability of pain. Linda had been suffering for a decade when an opportunity appeared on TV. BONANNO: It was like a commercial. The advertising came on, and my eyes perked. I went, oh, what's this? VEDANTAM: A nearby hospital was conducting a study on patients with intestinal problems. Linda wasn't sure she'd be a good fit, but she figured, hey, you never know. She made an appointment and took some tests. It turned out she was a good fit. She was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS. A physician gave Linda capsules to take twice a day. But then he told Linda something that dashed her hopes - the capsules she was about to take, they were a placebo. BONANNO: Oh, I was disappointed; I knew it was a sugar pill. Because I graduated from Hester College (ph) as a medical assistant, so I knew a placebo was a sugar pill. And I thought, he made me come all the way down here to take a sugar pill? (Laughter) I thought to myself, why is he doing this? VEDANTAM: Why tell Linda she was getting a placebo? Wouldn't that undermine the effect of the sugar pill? Well, that's what the study was supposed to test - could a placebo help patients if they knew it was a placebo? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: The study had 80 patients and was being run by Ted Kaptchuk. It was an open-label placebo trial - instead of deception, patients would receive what Ted has called radical honesty. The study was based on an insight - the placebo effect wasn't just about the pills; it was about an edifice of drama, rituals and the trust between patients like Linda and their doctors. Even though Linda was disappointed to get a placebo, she followed her doctor's orders. BONANNO: I just took them and went about my day. I said, this is not going to work if it's a sugar pill. And it wasn't till the fourth day I realized I wasn't sick anymore. I said, this can't be. VEDANTAM: Starting on that fourth day, the pain that Linda had suffered through for a decade vanished. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) BONANNO: For three weeks, I felt fantastic. I had no IBS. I wasn't sick. I was taking those pills every day. And I couldn't believe it. VEDANTAM: Many other patients in the study got similar relief. Volunteers who received the open-label placebo reported twice the improvement in their quality of life as those who received no treatment. Now, this was a small study, but Ted has looked at the effects of using open-label placebos for other medical conditions. He's found similar, sometimes even better, results for low back pain and cancer-related fatigue. Placebos administered with radical honesty have the potential to help people. KAPTCHUK: We turned the apple cart over on placebo studies. We said that everything we were saying about placebo before was actually not true, and there's probably more that's not true. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: After being on the placebo for three weeks, Linda went back to her doctor. She told him how great she felt. She wanted to keep taking the pills, but the doctor said no. The study protocol only permitted patients to get placebos during the study. BONANNO: He said, no, no, no, I can't let you keep them. I said, what? I said, what am I supposed to do now? He says, well, you'll be fine. And I thought, well, all right. And I'm thinking I'm not going to be fine; I know I'm not going to. VEDANTAM: Linda tried to be optimistic. The first few days, she didn't feel pain, so she thought the pills might have gotten rid of her IBS. But on the fourth day, the pain came back. Linda returned to her old ways of coping - taking anti-diarrhea drugs, restricting her diet, staying away from social activities. It went on for years. Finally, Linda reached out to Ted Kaptchuk. He agreed to take her on as a patient, and he offered to put her on a placebo once again. BONANNO: And then I thought, well, that would be great. VEDANTAM: But then her mind quickly jumped to concern. BONANNO: OK, it worked last time. If I take it again this time, is it going to work? I thought maybe it's not going to do anything, second time around, and then I would have been even more disappointed. VEDANTAM: Despite her concerns, she decided to try the placebo again. BONANNO: Because when you're really sick with IBS, you will do and try anything, anything to get rid of the pain and get back to normal. I did whatever these doctors told me to do. And thank God I did because when I went back with Dr. Kaptchuk and he put me back on the placebos, it didn't even take a week, and everything was gone again. And I'm - I still - when I think about it, I'm stunned. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) BONANNO: I don't understand it. I don't - I'm at a point, to tell you the truth (laughter), I don't even care anymore; I just want it to disappear, and that's it. VEDANTAM: Even if Linda didn't fully understand what happened, she has some guesses about what relieved her pain; one vital factor - her deep faith in Ted Kaptchuk. BONANNO: He has a lot of patients. He's extremely intelligent. Something about his personality - very calming. When you talk to him, you feel like you had a complete body massage. VEDANTAM: Contrast this with her impersonal interaction with a doctor who diagnosed her with lactose intolerance. BONANNO: He was the kind of doctor just like a patient at the deli, you know (laughter). VEDANTAM: Of course, there are still many things we don't know. We don't fully understand why Linda got better on the placebo and why she got worse when she stopped. We don't know how generalizable her experience is to others. Would we get less impressive results if placebos became a common treatment rather than a novel one? What if patients obtain placebos from a pharmacy rather than from a kind doctor in a clinic? There's another problem - for some, the idea that placebos may be helpful is frustrating, even infuriating. In 2018, researchers from Northwestern University published a study showing that sugar pills can be effective in treating some patients who suffer from chronic pain. Some of the very patients who might benefit from that insight, people in chronic pain, took to Facebook to describe how demeaned they felt. One woman wrote, this is one of the worst insults to those with true chronic pain. This kind of pain is not all in their heads. They have real, documented reasons to have moderate to severe pain, and offering a placebo is unethical and a grave insult. Ted understands where such criticism is coming from; people think that if a placebo works, that means a patient was faking or that her suffering wasn't real or that the pain was purely psychological. Ted says nothing could be further from the truth. KAPTCHUK: The placebo effect is not a mind-body New Age mind cure. Those things happen not because you think but because you do, you perform, and you enact. The placebo effect is embodied in what patients and doctors do. It's way below and much stronger than thinking you're going to get better, and you get better. VEDANTAM: Patients aren't the only ones who are skeptical of the placebo effect; some researchers are as well. ASBJORN HROBJARTSSON: My name is Asbjorn Hrobjartsson. I'm a professor at the University of Southern Denmark. VEDANTAM: Asbjorn has analyzed hundreds of placebo-controlled studies. In general, he does not find a very strong placebo effect in most of the studies he reviewed. HROBJARTSSON: There is no indication, based on the trials we looked at, that there is a very large effect of placebo on very many patients across very many conditions. VEDANTAM: That said, Asbjorn did find variations in the studies, and in some cases, he did find a large effect. The placebo effect was larger in conditions where patients reported their own outcomes, things like pain and nausea, and smaller in cases where doctors made measurements, things like hypertension. Asbjorn also found what Bruce Moseley discovered in Houston - if a pill produces a small placebo effect, treatments that look and sound dramatic induce bigger effects. HROBJARTSSON: We clearly see that the more theatrical or dramatic placebo, those with kind of - with needling or with machines that make a sound, they tend to have larger effects. VEDANTAM: Most of the studies Asbjorn looked at were testing the efficacy of various drugs; they just had a placebo arm. They were not designed to elicit the placebo effect in the way Ted Kaptchuk has done; they didn't focus on all the rituals around treatment. Asbjorn agrees that studies like those - what are sometimes called active placebo studies - could produce very different results. That's because they're designed to look beyond the effect of pills to activate things like the doctor-patient relationship. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: About a year into her second round of placebo treatment, Linda ended up in the hospital for back surgery. She couldn't get to Ted's office to pick up placebo pills. She was worried her IBS would return. But it didn't. BONANNO: Now I don't even take placebos. You know what it's like to be back to normal, to have a normal life like everybody else and never have to think once what condition you're in or if you're going to get sick or what's going to happen? It doesn't even enter my mind. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: When we go to a doctor, we need two different things. The first is explicit and obvious - we want someone skilled and knowledgeable who can diagnose us correctly, who knows which pills or procedures are likely to help. But we also have implicit needs. We want someone who can attend to our suffering, not just to our illness. We need someone to trust in moments of fear and vulnerability. We want more than answers; we want reassurance. For overworked doctors and overburdened medical systems, our explicit needs can feel more urgent than our implicit needs. Surgeries and medications can seem more rigorous than the techniques to address our implicit needs - acting and storytelling and rituals. On top of that, these elements of performance may feel unseemly, like the behavior of snake oil salesmen. But when both kinds of needs are met, doctors and patients are more likely to get the outcome they both want - healing.

Now, after years of political stalemate on this, private companies are proposing their own solutions. NPR's Jeff Brady explains the problem and one idea to address it. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: The Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station sits along the Susquehanna River in southeast Pennsylvania. To get inside, you walk past concrete barriers, armed security guards and air-puffer machines that detect explosives. (SOUNDBITE OF MACHINE BEEPING)BRADY: Up an elevator and through hallways is a room that looks like a warehouse. MARK PARRISH: Welcome to the Peach Bottom Unit 3 fuel floor. What you see here is the spent fuel pool. BRADY: Mark Parrish is the reactor engineering manager and says the pool is the first place spent nuclear fuel is stored after it's removed from the reactor. The pool is surrounded with a bright-yellow plastic barrier and signs that read, caution radiation area. Parrish says the spent fuel will stay in the pool for up to 10 years. PARRISH: There's about 2,800 fuel assemblies still in that pool. They are under about 22 feet of water. And they're continuously being cooled, as they still have some amount of decay heat even after they've operated in the reactor. BRADY: Around the country, pools like this are filling up so operators move the spent fuel outside once it's safe to store there. Pat Navin oversees operations at Peach Bottom and points to a concrete pad against the hillside where there are white metal casks lined up. They look like big hot-water heaters. PAT NAVIN: That is 40 years' worth of spent fuel stored over there currently. And it's less than the size of a football field, that's for sure. About probably half a football field there. BRADY: It's not much waste when you consider that's enough spent fuel to produce about 10 percent of Pennsylvania's electricity over four decades. But without permanent storage, Navin says they're running out of room. That's why an expansion is underway. (SOUNDBITE OF CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT DRILLING)BRADY: A construction crew is working on the foundation. Navin says eventually the site will store 60 years of waste. Meantime, Navin says this storage is safe for now. The metal containers are sturdy enough to withstand an earthquake and - eventually - a move. NAVIN: When the opportunity comes for these to be sent somewhere else. And these will double as a shipping container, as well. BRADY: They're packed and ready to go, but with no destination. One company is proposing a temporary storage site in New Mexico. But Edwin Lyman, with the Union of Concerned Scientists, says the country needs a permanent site that doesn't require humans to manage it because. . . EDWIN LYMAN: Institutions go away. There's no guarantee the owner will still be around for the duration of time when that waste remains dangerous, which is tens or hundreds of thousands of years. BRADY: A California company called Deep Isolation says it has a permanent solution. The firm wants to store spent nuclear fuel in holes drilled at least a thousand feet underground in stable rock formations. CEO Elizabeth Muller says the waste would be separate from groundwater and where it can't hurt people. ELIZABETH MULLER: I like to imagine having a playground at the top of the Deep Isolation bore hole where my kids and I can go play. BRADY: Muller promotes her company's technology through events like this recent webcast. Last November, the firm conducted a test in Texas. Crews lowered an 80-pound canister into a drilled hole. It was a simulation. So no radioactive substances. The goal was to determine whether they could retrieve the canister later. (SOUNDBITE OF WEBCAST)MULLER: Is that it, right there? (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING)BRADY: This successful test was important. Regulators want the ability to retrieve waste, in case new technology develops to better deal with the spent fuel. And the public is more likely to accept disposal programs that can be reversed. The technology may be the easy part. The bigger hurdle is federal law, which doesn't allow private companies to permanently store waste from nuclear power plants. It also says the spent fuel will go to Yucca Mountain. Deep Isolation's proposal would store waste around the country. Again, Edwin Lyman at Union of Concerned Scientists. LYMAN: I just don't see how there would be political support from every other state other than Nevada for changing the law so that spent nuclear fuel could stay in your state forever instead of being shipped out of your state. BRADY: But for now, despite the law, spent fuel does continue to pile up at nuclear power plants around the country. Jeff Brady, NPR News.

DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Republican State Representative Terri Collins defended her Human Life Protection Act during, at times, contentious debate in the Alabama House yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TERRI COLLINS: This bill is focused on that baby that's in the womb that is a person. That baby, I believe, would choose life. ELLIOTT: Democratic lawmakers walked out in protest before the final 74-3 vote. During debate, they questioned the motive for an abortion ban in a state that's refused to expand Medicaid. Representative Merika Coleman. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MERIKA COLEMAN: Well, I do support life, but there are some people that just support birth. They don't support life because after a child is actually born, there are some things that need to happen. We need to make sure that that child has adequate health care. ELLIOTT: Other states, including neighboring Georgia and Mississippi, have passed laws that prohibit abortion once a fetal heartbeat can be detected. But Collins says Alabama's ban would apply even earlier. COLLINS: When a woman is pregnant, an abortion is no longer legal. ELLIOTT: The bill criminalizes abortion, meaning doctors would face felony jail time up to 99 years if convicted. The only exceptions are for a serious health risk to the pregnant woman or a lethal anomaly of the fetus. There are no exceptions for cases of rape or incest. A woman would not be held criminally liable for having an abortion. Collins says the bill follows a constitutional amendment approved by Alabama voters last year that recognizes what it calls the rights of unborn children in direct defiance of the U. S. Supreme Court's landmark decision that protects a woman's right to abortion. COLLINS: This bill is simply about Roe v. Wade - that the decision that was made back in 1973 would not be the same decision that was decided upon today if you relooked at the issue. ELLIOTT: Her bill cites abolition, the civil rights movement and women's suffrage as justification for establishing the human rights of a fetus. Alabama is one of more than two dozen states seeking to restrict abortion rights this year, testing federal legal precedent. Alabama Pro-Life Coalition President Eric Johnston says there's a reason there's so much activity right now. ERIC JOHNSTON: The dynamic has changed. You know, the judges have changed. A lot of changes over that time. So I think we're at the point where we need to take a bigger and a bolder step. ELLIOTT: By outlawing nearly all abortions. The move is drawing protests from abortion rights advocates. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) The people are the future, the past and the present. ELLIOTT: A coalition called URGE - Unite for Reproductive and Gender Equity - demonstrated outside the Alabama State House last month. AMANDA REYES: This bill is an awful piece of grandstanding. ELLIOTT: Amanda Reyes of Tuscaloosa is president of the Yellowhammer Fund, a group that helps women pay for abortions. REYES: If you make abortion illegal somewhere, that doesn't mean that abortion goes away. It just becomes more difficult and more dangerous to access. ELLIOTT: The ACLU of Alabama says it will sue if the abortion ban becomes law. It's expected to win final passage in the Republican-majority Alabama Senate. ACLU Executive Director Randall Marshall says the bill is unconstitutional. RANDALL MARSHALL: There is simply nothing that Alabama can do to interfere with the right of access to abortion because that is a federal right. And the federal Constitution clearly trumps all state law. ELLIOTT: With two Trump appointees now on the U. S. Supreme Court, anti-abortion forces are optimistic that judicial interpretation could be reversed. Debbie Elliott, NPR News, Montgomery.

I wonder if he's an ancestor of BJ Leiderman, who writes our theme music. A Buddhist monk found the jawbone. In 2010, scientists began to study it. Now they say it belongs to a human relative that lived as long as 150,000 years ago. NPR's Christopher Joyce reports on what scientists make of it. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: The Denisovans are a mystery. Their only remains - a few bone fragments and teeth - were found in a cave called Denisova in Siberia. In 2010, scientists concluded from those fragments and their DNA that Denisovans were slightly different from us, slightly different from Neanderthals, too - in short, a third kind of human. What they didn't know was that 30 years earlier, a Tibetan monk had found part of a jawbone in a cave on the Tibetan Plateau, home of the Himalayas. He gave it to the sixth living Buddha, a holy man there, who passed it on to scientists. They started studying it nine years ago. Now they say it's DenisovanJEAN-JACQUES HUBLIN: The specimen is much more complete than anything else we know in the Denisova cave. JOYCE: Jean-Jacques Hublin from the Max Planck Institute in Germany is part of a Chinese and European team that announced the discovery this week. HUBLIN: It's the first time that Denisovans are identified far away from the Denisova cave. JOYCE: The bone was found in a huge cave almost 11,000 feet up in the plateau. HUBLIN: It's a big surprise because most people thought that challenging environments like the high altitudes were colonized only by modern humans like us. JOYCE: But the fact that some Denisovans lived in Tibet makes sense. Here's why. Modern humans have some Denisovan genes. One of those genes gives people the ability to live at very high altitudes with low oxygen levels. And modern Tibetans have that gene. So apparently, some early Denisovans lived on the Tibetan Plateau. The jaw is 160,000 years old. They developed the low oxygen trait and passed it on to humans. MATTHEW TOCHERI: It's in the modern human gene pool because of interbreeding with Denisovans. JOYCE: Matthew Tocheri is a paleoanthropologist at Lakehead University in Canada. TOCHERI: And now this particular jaw that's been identified as Denisovan is actually from the Tibetan Plateau. So it connects these dots. JOYCE: Tocheri says the discovery reinforces the idea that the human lineage was like a landscape of parallel streams. And some were pretty far off the mainstream, like the 4 foot tall Homo floresiensis or the hobbit. It lived as recently as 50,000 years ago on a remote island in Indonesia and had numerous primitive ape-like characteristics. TOCHERI: It wasn't that long ago that humans were way more diverse than they are today. And we carry on some of that diversity because we sort of have some of these genes that survive in us.

Shankar here. Some of you may have recently noticed a bunch of extra episodes from different NPR shows in your podcast feed. If so, it was caused by a web server error at our end. We're very sorry about this, and we're working to fix the problem. We'll have updates at npr. org/help. OK. Here's the show. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED CHORUS: (Singing) Good Christians all, rejoice, and sing. VEDANTAM: On a hot summer morning, worshippers gather at the First Baptist Church in Washington, D. C. They've come in their Sunday best - sharp suits and flowing skirts, shined dress shoes and spiky high heels. They've come to be among friends and family, to pray and sing and rejoice after a long and hectic week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED CHORUS: (Singing) Now is the triumph of. . . VEDANTAM: If you've taken part in a religious service at a church or another house of worship, have you ever stopped to think about how it all came to be? How did people become believers? Where did the rituals come from? And most of all, what purpose does it all serve? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED CHORUS: (Singing) Hallelujah. VEDANTAM: When we ask these questions, we most often look to history or theology for answers. But some social scientists are asking if we can better understand religion through the lens of human behavior. If people behave in particular ways when exposed to different religious cues, can we use this information to work backwards and understand how those religious practices came about in the first place? Can the rise and fall of different religions tell us something about the needs of societies and how those needs change over time? Today, we're going to take an in-depth look at these provocative ideas through the work of Azim Shariff, a psychology professor at the University of British Columbia. He studies religion not from the point of view of faith or spirituality but from a psychological perspective. He argues that human societies changed in a fundamental way several thousand years ago, and this required a new psychological innovation. AZIM SHARIFF: So for the vast, vast history of our species, we didn't live in large groups. We lived in very small groups, groups about 50 people, groups that never really got larger than 150. And the reason for that is because from a genetic standpoint, we're only built to be able to cooperate with as many people as we can know well. So when you start having anonymous strangers in groups, when you start having people whose reputation you're unfamiliar with, what that means is that people can free ride on the group. They can cheat on the group with impunity. And when you start having large groups of free riders and cheaters in a group, it can't sustain itself. You need a level of cooperation between the people in a group for it to act and to work harmoniously. And so it was only in the last 12,000 years that we started getting groups that bubbled up from beyond 100, 150 people to 1,000, 10,000 people. And what that means is that it needed something more than just our genetic inheritance. It needed a cultural idea. It needed a cultural innovation to allow us to succeed in these larger groups. And so one of the things that me and my colleagues have been arguing is that religion was one of these cultural innovations. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: And not just religion in general. It was one specific aspect of religion - the idea of a supernatural punisher, also known as God. It's a concept we'll return to over and over again this hour. Basically, if early humans could be convinced that a god was going to punish them if they didn't act in line with the interests of the group, well, they would start to cooperate. SHARIFF: And we see really interesting examples of this - so large trade networks that have existed in North Africa where you have people who have no way that they can know each other. They're from opposite ends of an entire continent. And yet simply because they have a common religion - in this case, Islam - they can trust that the other person is going to be a reliable trading partner. And so just knowing that other people are God-fearing believers is sufficient to act as a cue of trust. UNIDENTIFIED SINGER #1: (Singing in Arabic). VEDANTAM: So how does this clinical view of religion square with the way most believers think about faith? UNIDENTIFIED SINGER #1: (Singing in Arabic). AKBAR AHMED: The azan, or the call to prayer, is when Muslims are asked to come to a mosque or to an Islamic center five times a day to remember God. VEDANTAM: Throughout this episode, we're going to have religious scholars and practitioners talk about their experience of faith. Here's Islamic scholar Akbar Ahmed on the Muslim call to prayer. AHMED: The call to prayer in Arabic is very simple. It simply is Allahu akbar; Allahu akbar; Allahu akbar. Hayya 'alas-salah. Hayya 'alas-salah. Hayya 'alal-falah. Hayya 'alal-falah. It's simply saying, God is great. God is great. God is great. God is great. Come to prayer. Come to prayer. Then it repeats, come to welfare, to what is good for you. Come to what is good for you. And then ends by saying again, Allahu akbar; Allahu akbar. So in a sense, it's a very simple call to put aside the daily tedium, the daily tensions and problems. And it can be very therapeutic. UNIDENTIFIED SINGER #1: (Singing in Arabic). VEDANTAM: Azim Shariff hears the Muslim call to prayer very differently. He hears it as a researcher. He cites evidence from psychology and anthropology to show that religious practices like the Muslim call to prayer have measurable effects on human behavior. SHARIFF: These studies are taking advantage of existing naturalistic cues of religion that are all around people when they're living in the Muslim world. This is the most salient reminder of religion in Muslim-majority countries. And so a couple of studies have used that as the cue. One of them looked at cheating behavior. And what they found is that when the azaan, the call to prayer, is audible, people are much less likely to cheat. UNIDENTIFIED SINGER #2: (Singing in Arabic). VEDANTAM: In another study, researcher Eric Duhaime gave money to shopkeepers in Morocco and told them they could either keep the money for themselves or donate it to charity. SHARIFF: And he recorded how much they gave during regular parts of the day and how much they gave when the call to prayer was going off. And the results were remarkable. So first of all, the shopkeepers were generally quite generous. And they were generally quite charitable. But when the call to prayer was audible, everybody gave all the money to charity. It's the most remarkably consistent finding that I've seen. It was a remarkable effect that this audible queue of religion actually had on people. UNIDENTIFIED SINGER #2: (Singing in Arabic). VEDANTAM: Azim's point is not that religion always has positive effects on people. He's saying it's possible to study the effects of religious practices on human behavior just like you can study the effect of financial incentives or education. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: By measuring which religious practices change how people behave and which don't, you can start to understand the roles that different religions have played in different societies. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Take a look at this now-classic study from the Princeton Theological Seminary in 1973. Two researchers tested the effect of religious cues on helpfulness. Surely, students training to be pastors would lend someone a hand, right? It's known as the good Samaritan study, and it's based on a famous parable from the Bible. In the story, a traveler is robbed, beaten and left for dead along the side of a road. Two people walk by and do nothing to help. And then, finally someone stops, a Samaritan. It's a tale that's been told and retold for centuries like in the sermon by Martin Luther King Jr. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARTIN LUTHER KING JR: Finally, a man of another race came by. He got down from his beast, decided not to be compassionate by proxy. But he got down with him, administered first aid and helped the man in need. Jesus ended up saying, this was the good man; this was the great man. VEDANTAM: So the students were told the story of the good Samaritan and then asked to go to another building to complete a task. But here's a sneaky part. Along the way, the researcher strategically placed a man slumped over in an alleyway who looked like he needed some help just like in the Bible story they had heard a few minutes ago. Would they stop and lend him a hand? SHARIFF: The study famously did not find any difference between the religious people and nonreligious people. In fact, the only predictor of whether somebody would help or not was whether they were in a rush or not. So if you were in a rush, regardless of whether you're religious or nonreligious, you wouldn't help. And if you were not in a rush, well, then you would help regardless of these fundamental beliefs that you have about religiosity. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: So we've seen one example where a cue from religion changes how people behave, the Muslim call to prayer in Morocco and another where it doesn't, the good Samaritan study. So why does one queue make a difference while the other does not? Azim says a lot depends on the context. One important piece of context you might not consider - the kind of God being invoked. Consider the difference between depictions of gods who are angry. . . (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE TEN COMMANDMENTS\")CHARLTON HESTON: (As Moses) Those who will not live by the law shall die by the law. VEDANTAM: . . . And voices that are much less scary. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED SINGER #3: (Singing) God is love. He loves his children, and he's willing to forgive them. God is love. VEDANTAM: You run your own studies on cheating. And in one of them, you wrote how much you believe in God matters less than what kind of god you believe in. What did you mean? SHARIFF: Well, so there we wanted to see whether believing in a punitive God versus believing in a forgiving God - so a forgiving God would be one that you see predominantly to be loving and comforting and forgiving but not angry, vengeful or punitive - whether that makes a difference in terms of your likelihood to cheat. And the reason that's significant is because there are theories which suggest that a punitive God has become so popular in religions because it's an effective stick to deter people from immoral behavior. And so in this study, we had students come in and do this math task where we made it very tempting for them to cheat. And we wanted to see who would cheat. But we also collected data on what their view of God was. So we had them fill out their belief that their God is represented by various adjectives. And some of these adjectives were loving, comforting, kind, forgiving, and others were angry, vengeful, punitive, wrathful. And we wanted to see whether that made a difference. And indeed it did. We found that the people - the more you believed your god to be on the punitive side that spectrum, the less likely you were to cheat, whereas the more you believed your god to be loving, the actual more likely you were to cheat. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED SINGER #3: (Singing) He loves his children. And he's willing to forgive them. God is love. VEDANTAM: What you're suggesting in some ways is that people are behaving, you know, very rationally. If you believe in an angry, vengeful, punitive god and you believe that this god is going to harm you if you do something wrong, it's perfectly rational for you to stick to the straight and narrow. SHARIFF: Yeah. And I would argue that this, again, is - I think it's no accident why the most successful religions have been - and I mean successful in terms of just sheer numbers. The societies that have been able to grow largest with the religions that they believe in have had this idea of supernatural punishment at their core because it is an effective deterrent. It does compel people rationally to act in ways which will avoid the wrath of a punitive god who can punish you quite severely. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: So according to the Scriptures, hell is a place that literally exists. That's not a Baptist doctrine. That's not a Methodist doctrine. That's a doctrine of the Bible. It exists, friend. It was made, therefore, as a place of punishment, not a place to simply go to. . . VEDANTAM: Besides the psychological studies, Azim says there's evidence from history and anthropology that suggests modern religions arose to solve problems related to trust and cooperation. All the world's major religions today arose at times when human societies were struggling with the challenges of size, complexity or scarcity. SHARIFF: Certain religious ideas that would be most effective at encouraging people to be prosocial, like this idea of a big, omniscient, punitive god, tend to crop up in those particular circumstances when cooperation is particularly necessary. So if you look at societies that were larger - that is, with more anonymous strangers - you tend to see these types of gods emerge more frequently in those societies. But you also see them emerge more frequently in societies that faced, say, particularly acute resource scarcity issues. So in a place where it's very, very important that you share water in trustworthy, equitable ways, you see these types of big, omniscient, punitive gods emerge there, as well. And so there is this, yes, this correlation, as far as we can tell now, between the necessity of cooperation and the types of cultural innovation, the religious innovations that would be most effective at bringing it about. VEDANTAM: What is the evidence that we have that in earlier societies that were much smaller, people didn't believe in these big gods or these gods that have these huge effects or these punitive gods? SHARIFF: So if you look both at the archaeological record, as well as modern hunter-gatherer tribes - so modern tribes that still live in ways that were similar to how we lived prior to 12,000 years when there was the agricultural revolution, we started settling in large groups - those types of small societies where you don't have those anonymous stranger challenges tend not to have these large, punitive gods. Their gods tend to be smaller and weaker and less morally concerned. And so you tend to see that those large gods, the punitive gods, only emerge when it's necessary to have that cooperation spread. And when you have these small societies, you don't need that. VEDANTAM: Can you give me an example? SHARIFF: So a lot of research has been done on these small tribes like the Hadza, where the gods are - they're more like trickster spirits. They're neither omniscient nor are they punishing the types of immoral behavior that would be necessary to get rid of in order to be cooperative. The gods are, again, small, forest spirits or trickster spirits that don't have the power nor the punitive ability nor the, really, concern for these moral issues. VEDANTAM: Now, of course, this view of religion - comparing ancient hunter-gatherer tribes with modern societies or measuring which gods produce what behavior - this kind of thinking can seem completely upside down to you if you're a person of faith. If you're a believer, this is not the way you think about religion. Your faith is a source of meaning, guidance, comfort. It's a connection to something greater than yourself. Let's go back to Islamic scholar Akbar Ahmed. AHMED: I know that at times when I'm sitting in the Muslim world, especially in the evening at (speaking Arabic) time, when you know there's that magical moment when the day has just died and the night has not quite begun and there's that twilight in the atmosphere and suddenly, there's a complete hush for a few seconds. Then you hear the azan, the beautiful azan. And it drifts. And writers have said, poets have said, it's like a feather in flight. It just drifts on in the air almost as if it is weightless in its beauty. And it just undulates on and on, so in that sense, it is a beautiful part of the symphony of Islam itself. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED SINGER #1: (Singing in Arabic). VEDANTAM: I'm wondering whether you ever get pushback from religious people who basically are angry that you are dissecting their faith in a way that says, I can study this as if it's an organism under a microscope. I can study when it flourishes, when it doesn't flourish, how it grows, why it grows in one context, doesn't grow in another context. And people say, I believe because this god is a real god. I believe because this god has a real effect in my life, you shouldn't be coming in and studying this as if it's a scientific project. SHARIFF: So, yes, there is pushback. There's pushback from both sides for different reasons. I get pushback for that precise reason. People who are people of faith believe their religions to be divinely inspired. And so when you're reaching for naturalistic explanations for religion, that leaves little room for the divine inspiration. The origins for the religion become overdetermined. You have both a naturalistic reason for why it exists, and you have a divine reason for why it exists. And you don't need both. And so if you're positing a naturalistic explanation, well, then maybe it casts some doubt or threat on the divine inspiration explanation. And so that's a very, I think, legitimate pushback from their perspective. I also get pushback from people who have a bone to pick against religion. And the reason for that is because some of the research I do empirically demonstrates some of the positive effects that religion has. And if people have a bone to pick with religion, they tend not to like to admit that there's anything good about religion. And so I get hate mail from both sides. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: When we come back, we'll take a closer look at one of Azim's more controversial ideas. Given that different religions have risen and fallen over the centuries, can you study religion as if it were a living organism subject to the rules of Darwinian natural selection? SHARIFF: I think that the application of evolutionary theory has really revolutionized our understanding of the origins and functions of religion. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. Let's take a moment to go back in time. For the vast majority of human history, we lived in small groups of around 50 people. Everyone knew everybody. If you told a lie, stole someone's dinner or didn't defend the group against its enemies, there was no way to disappear into the crowd. Everyone knew you, and you would get punished. But in the last 12,000 years or so, human groups began to expand from a few dozen to more than a thousand. And now it wasn't so easy to punish the cheaters and the free riders. So we needed something big, vast, an epic force that could see what everyone was doing and enforce the rules. Since individual people could no longer police gigantic groups, the policing had to be done by a force that was superhuman. That force, according to psychologist Azim Shariff, was the modern idea of a punitive god, the kind that many preachers warn can send you to hell. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Hell is a place. It is a place that existed before you were ever born. It is there. It's going to be there. And there's nothing you can do to change that one bit, whatsoever. VEDANTAM: Azim says the many religions we see around us today emerged in different societies at different times as mechanisms to solve problems of trust and cooperation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: It doesn't make any difference if the churches today have stopped preaching on hell, if the preachers don't preach on hell. It is still a place that you must deal with one day. VEDANTAM: So the picture that you're painting for me, Azim, is this really fascinating picture that religion has all these different effects on people. It has an effect on how we trust one another, how we're generous towards one another. Sometimes we're generous when we're reminded of religiosity, when we're reminded of the divine. It makes a difference whether the gods we believe in are benevolent gods or angry gods. It's also the case that maybe some religions flourish and thrive at a certain moment or in a certain ecosystem but then wither and fail away in another ecosystem. And it seems to me all of these different things are pointing to the same fundamental theory, which is that you're looking at religion as an evolutionary phenomenon. You're trying to understand how it can work in one context, how it can fail in another context, how you can study it almost as a living organism. SHARIFF: Yes. I think that's exactly right. I think that the application of evolutionary theory has really revolutionized our understanding of the origins and functions of religion. Now, in evolutionary theory, one of the most exciting developments is extending the Darwinian logic of selection of organisms based on how well they fit their environment to cultural ideas, as well, and cultural groups, as well. And this is what's called cultural evolution, or cultural evolutionary theory. It's also called dual inheritance theory. And the reason it's called dual inheritance theory is because unlike most other animals, humans come into the world with not just a genetic inheritance from their parents but an entire line of cultural ideas that get passed down to them, as well. And for about a hundred thousand years, we have been a necessarily cultural species. We have not been able to survive without the cultural knowledge that we inherit. And so a good example of this is fire. That's a cultural idea. If we didn't have that, we would not be able to survive because our bodies have now adapted to needing fire to predigest - that is, cook our food. And so the idea is that religion is one of these cultural ideas that similarly serves these functional roles in our lives and has done for at least 10,000 years. So what that means is that you can understand religions as they are today - today's major religions - as bearing the legacy of thousands of years of trial and error and selection so that what current religions are made up of, they're made up of those things because those served social functions in the past. They contributed to the societies that they were attached to surviving. VEDANTAM: You can see these patterns in the historical record. For example, ancient humans worshipped gods who could prevent natural disasters. But as the needs of societies changed, their gods changed, too. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Let us pray. VEDANTAM: As people built cities and civilizations that were more resilient, new kinds of gods. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Welcome to the prayer to do well in school. VEDANTAM: . . . With different powers emerged, and the requests people made of them changed as well. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Father, we decree and declare that, as they prepare for school - for tests and exams - show them what to study and how to study most effectively. Lord, please give them wisdom and understanding, as well as knowledge. . . VEDANTAM: Azim's point is that local conditions, like individual ecosystems, can create conditions where certain beliefs flourish and where others fade away. If belief in a certain god helps a group to thrive, that religion is likely to spread. An evolutionary theory of religion could also explain why many religions are deeply - some might say obsessively - interested in questions related to sex. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: No. 1 warning sign - amorous glances. VEDANTAM: You can hear these themes in religious broadcasts all the time - how much sex to have. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Flirtatious looks. Look at Proverbs 6 and 25 with me, if you would. VEDANTAM: . . . Whom to have sex with. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: It says do not lust after her beauty in your heart. . . VEDANTAM: . . . How to avoid certain kinds of sex. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: . . . Nor let her allure you with her eyelids. VEDANTAM: And it makes sense from a Darwinian perspective. Sex is about reproduction, and the organization of families and the growth of a population are integral to the long-term survival of societies. SHARIFF: One of the things that's very common among religions is to have norms regulating what you could call family values. You should have a lot of kids. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Three, four, six, 12? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: (Laughter). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: I mean, how many - is there a biblical mandate of how many we should have? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Well, there is a biblical mandate, if you will, that says, God blessed them and said, be fruitful and multiply. SHARIFF: You shouldn't have homosexual relationships. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: I say it's wrong because that's what the Scripture says. SHARIFF: You shouldn't have that much birth control. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #7: If we look at the Bible tonight and examine this, we'll see that this is actually not something that God wants us to do. SHARIFF: Now, those also serve these culturally adaptive purposes because they encourage people to produce lots of children. Having lots of children leads to larger societies. Larger societies can outcompete those societies that didn't have a lot of children. So if you had two religions - one which said, have a lot of sex, make a lot of children, don't use birth control, another one that said, never have sex, or, if you do, only use birth control - which society, looking down one, two, three generations, is going to be better off? Well, the one that actually produced offspring, became a larger civilization, a civilization that was able to outcompete either in active warfare or just through taking the resources of the other society. It's a competition between cultural ideas and cultural groups such that those socially functional ideas tend to be preserved over generations. And so this is how cultural evolution works. VEDANTAM: So if you buy the idea that religions arose at a certain point of time, that in some ways they're a form of cultural evolution, and certain types of religions and certain types of gods arose at certain points in time in order to confer certain kinds of cultural benefits on groups of people, one of the challenges, of course, is that, if I'm a religious person, and I now think of religion as being a marker of my willingness to trust the next person who's also a religious person, there is an incentive for people to cheat - for people to sort of say, I'm actually a religious person, I deeply believe in this God, when in fact they don't because they just want to take all the advantages that come from religious faith. And this brings us to the idea of rituals and the idea of costly rituals. Talk about this idea. Why would you have the development of costly rituals, in some ways, as a precondition to how religion ends up enforcing these cultural norms? SHARIFF: So this is one of the really great examples of how evolutionary theory can inform our understanding of religion. Things that were previously mysterious about religion now makes sense in an evolutionary perspective. So in evolution, there's this concept of costly signaling, that you have a hard-to-fake signal, which serves as a reliable cue of something you're trying to demonstrate. So the classic example of this is peacock feathers. (SOUNDBITE OF PEACOCK CALL)SHARIFF: The male peacock has this beautiful plumage, which is a sexual display. And the reason it's an effective sexual display is because only the healthiest peacocks can have the large plumage because of how costly it is to other aspects of the peacock's life. It can't fly very fast. It can't run away very much. It makes it very visible to other predators. And so if you're not the healthiest of peacocks and you try to fake this plumage, well, you're going to get eaten. And so the peahens, the female peahens, can use the display as a reliable indicator that, well, if I mate with this one, he actually has good genes because if he didn't have good genes, he would not be able to have this beautiful plumage. And so that might seem like an unrelated example, but if you look at the costly rituals that happen in religion, those are indications to other people in your group that you are a true believer. You are showing in a costly way indications that you're a believer. It is a hard-to-fake signal. If you weren't a true believer, you wouldn't go through all that effort. VEDANTAM: Effort like following the vows of chastity, poverty and obedience in Catholicism. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #8: We don't see them as restrictive rules. We see them as freeing. VEDANTAM: . . . Keeping kosher in Judaism. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #9: When I eat, I know that I am a Jew. VEDANTAM: And wearing a veil or headscarf in Islam. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #10: I use it to identify myself. I use it to be a symbol of who I am. SHARIFF: Now you have trustable cues, credibility-enhancing displays of people's genuine religiosity, which indicates that you actually can trust them. VEDANTAM: I want to take a closer look at one of those rituals to underscore the difference between the way believers think about religious practices and Azim's theory. Jainism, a small South Asian religion, has lots of rituals that ask for sacrifices, like fasting. (SOUNDBITE OF BANGING)VEDANTAM: Jainism is somewhat similar to Hinduism and Buddhism in that one of its core tenets is nonviolence. Jains are strict vegetarians. And each year, they observe a holiday called Paryushan. It's a week-long fast where practitioners limit their consumption of both food and water. We've come to a Jain temple on the outskirts of Washington, D. C. It's a balmy Friday morning, and around two dozen people have gathered to celebrate the last day of Paryushan. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting in foreign language). VEDANTAM: The temple is actually a converted ranch-style house. The walls have been knocked down to make space for seating. The purpose of Paryushan is to repent for one's sins over the past year. Kamlesh Shah (ph) says these are seven days when he nourishes his soul rather than his body. KAMLESH SHAH: I have done the full Upvas. VEDANTAM: Upvas is a kind of fast. K SHAH: An Upvas means that you do not eat anything at all. VEDANTAM: The only nourishment is water. And that, too, has to be boiled first and then blessed. Many of the Jains who have gathered at the temple have completed similar fasts. Pahlavi Shah (ph) says Paryushan gives her a better perspective on the struggles that other people face in the world. PAHLAVI SHAH: Yes, I did three fasting - three days separate, you know, without water. And I believe in that because if I do fast, you know, without food, what is my body? I can, you know - like, I can feel that, without food, we are nothing. So you know, that way, you know, I can help other people when they are hungry. VEDANTAM: This willingness to go hungry for her faith also identifies Pahlavi as a true believer. She's willing to make a sacrifice that others are not. Now, of course, most religious people who make such sacrifices don't see what they're doing as costly signaling. Pahlavi isn't fasting in order to communicate to other Jains that she's a trustworthy member of the group. She's saying, I'm a devout person. My religion calls on me to make the sacrifice. I asked Azim about the difference between an evolutionary theory of rituals and how believers think about their behavior. Again, I just wanted to clarify the difference between how people think in an individual way and sort of the effect this has at a group level. So for example, let's say your religion commands you to take a very costly and difficult pilgrimage, for example, that involves maybe physical difficulties or, you know, financial difficulties. The people who are embarking on that pilgrimage are not thinking to themselves, what I'm doing is a costly signal to other members of my religion. They're saying, I'm just a devout person. My religion calls on me to do this thing, and that's why I'm doing it. So there's a difference between how this might work in some ways at a community level, at a society level and how the individual practitioner thinks about it. The individual practitioner, the individual peacock, isn't thinking, let me grow beautiful feathers because that sends a costly signal. SHARIFF: Yeah. So there's something that we can call functional opacity - that people are not aware of these ultimate reasons, the ultimate evolutionary reasons, why they're engaging in this behavior. They're aware of the - what we could call the proximate reasons, the immediate reasons, what they believe the reason they're doing it for. They're doing it because their god asks them to do it. But really, the reason that there is a belief that god would ask you to do that - the reason why that belief exists in the first place is because it serves that functional purpose. And so they're enacting rituals that serve larger, hidden purposes that are very functional for their societies. But to them, it's just what their religion tells them to do. VEDANTAM: You know, I came by two interesting studies recently, one of them by Nicholas Hobson. And he found, along with other colleagues, that novel rituals, even when they are completely meaningless - you ask a group of people to perform a novel ritual, it has the power to increase trust among fellow members who are performing this novel ritual. The other study was by Panagiotis Mitkidis. And he showed, along with his colleagues, that extreme rituals often had a big effect on promoting moral behavior, not among the performers of the ritual but on observers. SHARIFF: Yeah. So one of the leaders in this type of extreme ritual research is this anthropologist, Dimitris Xygalatas, who's done this really interesting research on fire walkers. And what you find is that when you have observers watching people undergoing these rituals, their actual heart beats synchronize with the people engaging in the rituals. And the more you have that synchronization, the more they feel like they're part of a group. And so you ask, well, why did fire walking emerge? Why did circumcision emerge? Why did any of these painful rituals - there's many, many more examples of really terribly painful rituals. Why did they emerge? It's not random. The ones that we have, the ones that have been preserved, exist because they have this impact on our psychology that allow groups to cohere around each other that allow this communication between members of the group that encourage trust between them. So another example is this work on what's called synchrony, which is just engaging in actions at the same pace in the same rhythm as others. And you have this in terms of hymn singing. But you also have this in terms of marching that is often used in military drills for the same reason. When you're engaging in an action in rhythm with somebody else, that creates the psychological connection that makes people feel fused as a group. VEDANTAM: You can hear the power of synchrony in chants of the word om. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting) Om. VEDANTAM: Here's Hinduism scholar Shubha Pathak. SHUBHA PATHAK: It's a sacred syllable that seems to be created by adding three different Sanskrit letters together - the letter A, the letter U, and the letter ma (ph). It doesn't have a dictionary meaning, but it has a lot of connotations. And so in early Hinduism, in texts like the Upanishads - philosophical texts - it is used to represent the reality that encompasses the entire universe. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting) Ooh. PATHAK: Often a text or a chant, a mantra, will start with the syllable om. And I think the reason why that is is not only does it have this significance of standing for a particular god in his totality or her totality, but you have this column of sound that gives you a sense of vastness. I think it's sort of similar to what happens when you have two singers singing at the exact same frequency. You start to have these beats in the room. With om, it creates something around you, I think, that makes you feel like you're part of something. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting) Ooh. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. We've looked at a theory that suggests that religions arose to solve problems of social cohesion. Psychologist Azim Shariff makes the case that much like living organisms, religions have evolved over time with different gods and different faiths rising and falling away over the millennia. Azim argues that religions play a functional role in societies, helping them run more smoothly and strengthening the bonds of trust. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: But religion can also be a source of conflict and war. Religious violence is often in the headlines. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: In Egypt this morning, there's new fighting between Christians and Muslims. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Buddhist monks have attacked dozens of mosques and churches in the last year. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: The new extremists set fire to an orphanage. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: It appears to show his beheading at the hands of ISIS. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Critics of religion sometimes point to such fanatical behavior and say, look; this is evidence that there's something wrong with religious faith. Psychologist Azim Shariff says such criticisms miss the point. SHARIFF: So the first thing that needs to be said is that coalitional violence is very old in our species. It's something that we see shared with our closest cousins, the chimpanzees. And so it's something that does precede religion. But what religion adds to it I think is actually consistent with this evolutionary perspective, which is that we're going to engage in wars. The question is, does religion enhance your side's ability to triumph in those wars? And the thing that religion adds is more than any other factor I can think of, aside from perhaps family, religion allows people to be bound together in a way that allows them to die for and kill for each other. And so this ability to form very cohesive, very tight coalitions, as well as to introduce sacred values, things that people are willing to fight for beyond all utilitarian or rational calculus, allows religion to make people better fighters. So, yes, religion does contribute to our warlike nature, but it does so in a very adaptive - culturally adaptive way. VEDANTAM: Azim is not saying that religious violence is socially desirable. He's saying that natural selection doesn't really care about being socially desirable. On average, a religion that helps societies triumph in war is a religion that spreads. So there are lots of examples when I look at modern societies today where I see other institutions, other forces that in some ways offer competition to religion. When I think about what will cause people to fight and die, you now no longer need religious faith. You can have nationalism. You can have patriotism - people willing to die for the flag. When it comes to trust, you know, it - you and I don't have to belong to the same religion anymore. We can both agree - you can sell a house to me and I can buy a house from you because we both believe that there are institutions organized by the state that will ensure that you will actually sell the house to me and I will actually give you money for it. I put my money in a bank every month, and I actually only see a bunch of digits on a piece of paper. But I trust that the bank at some level is actually holding onto my money. And I have absolutely no idea what religion the bankers belong to. Are these all examples of how modern societies have come to essentially displace the need for religion? SHARIFF: So, yes, I think so. So in terms of these other isms that people are willing to fight and die for, it's important to know that the idea of sacred values extends beyond just religious values. There are nonreligious things that we sacralize. So as soon as you sacralize something, it allows people to fight and die for it, right? So we have a fertile psychological meadow that's ready to sacralize things. And you just have to find the right key to fit into that lock. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER\")SHARIFF: Religion is a great one. It fits very well. But it's not the only thing that does so. (SOOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BARACK OBAMA: Thank you. God bless you, and God bless these United States of America. (APPLAUSE)SHARIFF: We'll sacralize ideas like freedom. We'll sacralize our nation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America. SHARIFF: We'll sacralize the flag. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: To the flag of the United States of America. And to the republic. . . SHARIFF: And in terms of the governmental institutions that can spread trust, one of the interesting things you see is that if you look across countries, those countries that report having the least importance of religion to their daily lives are the countries that have the highest faith in the rule of law. So those are the places where you trust the institutions, like the bank or contract enforcement or the police or the justice system. Once you can set up those types of trusted secular institutions, well, that obviates the need for a lot of what religion has done. Now, it's only been in recent years that we've been able to have those types of centralized effective institutions. And still, in most parts of the worlds, we're not able to. But in those places where we are, we see ourselves moving towards a post-religious world where a lot of the functions of religion are accomplished by other means and potentially better means. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Azim thinks that if regulations and good governance provide the trust and cooperation that religious bonds once provided, new kinds of faith might flourish - religions that don't have an angry god who threatens to punish you if you step out of line, religions that don't talk a lot about hell and damnation but instead spend more time on building community, offering services like cooking classes or singles' nights or child care. SHARIFF: Especially in places where you had other structures that were allowing for people to act in these harmonious, cooperative ways - say, secular institutions of law - under that umbrella where religion no longer has to shoulder the burden of enforcing cooperation, you can have religions start tilting in the other direction, more towards the religious benevolence and away from the religious malevolence, which is no longer as necessary for that religion. So a good example of this are Jehovah's Witnesses, and this is actually where some of these theories came from. I had Jehovah's Witnesses who would visit me when I was living in Vancouver. They'd visit me quite frequently because the first time they visited, my roommate was baking cookies, and she offered them cookies, and so they kept coming back. And I was fascinated by the conversations we had because one of them - they had their little Watchtower magazine, and it said - do we believe in hell? - on the cover. And then you had to open up and read that they didn't. And Jehovah's Witnesses - that's a relatively new religion, a relatively new sect of Christianity and one that emerged under this umbrella of an existing secular society. It emerged in the United States when the United States had laws that ensured that people would follow the rules. VEDANTAM: I have to ask you. Have you ever been religious yourself? SHARIFF: I was raised religious. I was raised Muslim, but I wandered away from the faith as a teenager. And I would consider myself a secular atheist now. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering if you're ever at family gatherings or even family gatherings that are inspired by some kind of religious occasion where people feel that you are judging them and studying them and analyzing them the way that a scientist would study microbes under a microscope, that you're basically saying, I understand why you do this because there's a naturalistic explanation for this. And for someone who is deeply religious, for whom religion means a great deal emotionally, there is something probably quite painful about having someone come along and say, look; this is opaque to you, but there is a deep and hidden evolutionary reason why you believe what you believe. They're going to be upset at you, I would think. SHARIFF: Yeah, so I do have a lot of religious family, still. And I've learnt over the years that I've been studying this topic that you pick your battles. You don't need to be confrontational about this. People benefit a lot from religion. People suffer a lot from religion, as well. But you can see when you know somebody very closely who is religious, often who's potentially going through struggles in their life - illnesses, whatever - that they benefit from the religion. And so I don't feel the need to explicitly threaten what is benefiting them quite a bit by challenging it. I think that people who are close to me know my position on religion, but I don't feel the need to be antagonistic about it. And as a result, I think we reach maybe some sort of uneasy peace.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CHORUS: (Singing) Good Christians all, rejoice, and sing. VEDANTAM: On a hot summer morning, worshippers gather at the First Baptist Church in Washington, D. C. They've come in their Sunday best - sharp suits and flowing skirts, shined dress shoes and spiky high heels. They've come to be among friends and family, to pray and sing and rejoice after a long and hectic week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CHORUS: (Singing) Now is the triumph of. . . VEDANTAM: If you've taken part in a religious service at a church or another house of worship, have you ever stopped to think about how it all came to be? How did people become believers? Where did the rituals come from? And most of all, what purpose does it all serve? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CHORUS: (Singing) Hallelujah. VEDANTAM: When we ask these questions, we most often look to history or theology for answers. But some social scientists are asking if we can better understand religion through the lens of human behavior. If people behave in particular ways when exposed to different religious cues, can we use this information to work backwards and understand how those religious practices came about in the first place? Can the rise and fall of different religions tell us something about the needs of societies and how those needs change over time? Today, we're going to take an in-depth look at these provocative ideas through the work of Azim Shariff, a psychology professor at the University of British Columbia. He studies religion not from the point of view of faith or spirituality but from a psychological perspective. He argues that human societies changed in a fundamental way several thousand years ago, and this required a new psychological innovation. AZIM SHARIFF: So for the vast, vast history of our species, we didn't live in large groups. We lived in very small groups, groups about 50 people, groups that never really got larger than 150. And the reason for that is because from a genetic standpoint, we're only built to be able to cooperate with as many people as we can know well. So when you start having anonymous strangers in groups, when you start having people whose reputation you're unfamiliar with, what that means is that people can free ride on the group. They can cheat on the group with impunity. And when you start having large groups of free riders and cheaters in a group, it can't sustain itself. You need a level of cooperation between the people in a group for it to act and to work harmoniously. And so it was only in the last 12,000 years that we started getting groups that bubbled up from beyond 100, 150 people to 1,000, 10,000 people. And what that means is that it needed something more than just our genetic inheritance. It needed a cultural idea. It needed a cultural innovation to allow us to succeed in these larger groups. And so one of the things that me and my colleagues have been arguing is that religion was one of these cultural innovations. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: And not just religion in general. It was one specific aspect of religion - the idea of a supernatural punisher, also known as God. It's a concept we'll return to over and over again this hour. Basically, if early humans could be convinced that a god was going to punish them if they didn't act in line with the interests of the group, well, they would start to cooperate. SHARIFF: And we see really interesting examples of this - so large trade networks that have existed in North Africa where you have people who have no way that they can know each other. They're from opposite ends of an entire continent. And yet simply because they have a common religion - in this case, Islam - they can trust that the other person is going to be a reliable trading partner. And so just knowing that other people are God-fearing believers is sufficient to act as a cue of trust. UNIDENTIFIED SINGER #1: (Singing in Arabic). VEDANTAM: So how does this clinical view of religion square with the way most believers think about faith? UNIDENTIFIED SINGER #1: (Singing in Arabic). AKBAR AHMED: The azan, or the call to prayer, is when Muslims are asked to come to a mosque or to an Islamic center five times a day to remember God. VEDANTAM: Throughout this episode, we're going to have religious scholars and practitioners talk about their experience of faith. Here's Islamic scholar Akbar Ahmed on the Muslim call to prayer. AHMED: The call to prayer in Arabic is very simple. It simply is Allahu akbar; Allahu akbar; Allahu akbar. Hayya 'alas-salah. Hayya 'alas-salah. Hayya 'alal-falah. Hayya 'alal-falah. It's simply saying, God is great. God is great. God is great. God is great. Come to prayer. Come to prayer. Then it repeats, come to welfare, to what is good for you. Come to what is good for you. And then ends by saying again, Allahu akbar; Allahu akbar. So in a sense, it's a very simple call to put aside the daily tedium, the daily tensions and problems. And it can be very therapeutic. UNIDENTIFIED SINGER #1: (Singing in Arabic). VEDANTAM: Azim Shariff hears the Muslim call to prayer very differently. He hears it as a researcher. He cites evidence from psychology and anthropology to show that religious practices like the Muslim call to prayer have measurable effects on human behavior. SHARIFF: These studies are taking advantage of existing naturalistic cues of religion that are all around people when they're living in the Muslim world. This is the most salient reminder of religion in Muslim-majority countries. And so a couple of studies have used that as the cue. One of them looked at cheating behavior. And what they found is that when the azaan, the call to prayer, is audible, people are much less likely to cheat. UNIDENTIFIED SINGER #2: (Singing in Arabic). VEDANTAM: In another study, researcher Eric Duhaime gave money to shopkeepers in Morocco and told them they could either keep the money for themselves or donate it to charity. SHARIFF: And he recorded how much they gave during regular parts of the day and how much they gave when the call to prayer was going off. And the results were remarkable. So first of all, the shopkeepers were generally quite generous. And they were generally quite charitable. But when the call to prayer was audible, everybody gave all the money to charity. It's the most remarkably consistent finding that I've seen. It was a remarkable effect that this audible queue of religion actually had on people. UNIDENTIFIED SINGER #2: (Singing in Arabic). VEDANTAM: Azim's point is not that religion always has positive effects on people. He's saying it's possible to study the effects of religious practices on human behavior just like you can study the effect of financial incentives or education. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: By measuring which religious practices change how people behave and which don't, you can start to understand the roles that different religions have played in different societies. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Take a look at this now-classic study from the Princeton Theological Seminary in 1973. Two researchers tested the effect of religious cues on helpfulness. Surely, students training to be pastors would lend someone a hand, right? It's known as the good Samaritan study, and it's based on a famous parable from the Bible. In the story, a traveler is robbed, beaten and left for dead along the side of a road. Two people walk by and do nothing to help. And then, finally someone stops, a Samaritan. It's a tale that's been told and retold for centuries like in the sermon by Martin Luther King Jr. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARTIN LUTHER KING JR: Finally, a man of another race came by. He got down from his beast, decided not to be compassionate by proxy. But he got down with him, administered first aid and helped the man in need. Jesus ended up saying, this was the good man; this was the great man. VEDANTAM: So the students were told the story of the good Samaritan and then asked to go to another building to complete a task. But here's a sneaky part. Along the way, the researcher strategically placed a man slumped over in an alleyway who looked like he needed some help just like in the Bible story they had heard a few minutes ago. Would they stop and lend him a hand? SHARIFF: The study famously did not find any difference between the religious people and nonreligious people. In fact, the only predictor of whether somebody would help or not was whether they were in a rush or not. So if you were in a rush, regardless of whether you're religious or nonreligious, you wouldn't help. And if you were not in a rush, well, then you would help regardless of these fundamental beliefs that you have about religiosity. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: So we've seen one example where a cue from religion changes how people behave, the Muslim call to prayer in Morocco and another where it doesn't, the good Samaritan study. So why does one queue make a difference while the other does not? Azim says a lot depends on the context. One important piece of context you might not consider - the kind of God being invoked. Consider the difference between depictions of gods who are angry. . . (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE TEN COMMANDMENTS\") CHARLTON HESTON: (As Moses) Those who will not live by the law shall die by the law. VEDANTAM: . . . And voices that are much less scary. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED SINGER #3: (Singing) God is love. He loves his children, and he's willing to forgive them. God is love. VEDANTAM: You run your own studies on cheating. And in one of them, you wrote how much you believe in God matters less than what kind of god you believe in. What did you mean? SHARIFF: Well, so there we wanted to see whether believing in a punitive God versus believing in a forgiving God - so a forgiving God would be one that you see predominantly to be loving and comforting and forgiving but not angry, vengeful or punitive - whether that makes a difference in terms of your likelihood to cheat. And the reason that's significant is because there are theories which suggest that a punitive God has become so popular in religions because it's an effective stick to deter people from immoral behavior. And so in this study, we had students come in and do this math task where we made it very tempting for them to cheat. And we wanted to see who would cheat. But we also collected data on what their view of God was. So we had them fill out their belief that their God is represented by various adjectives. And some of these adjectives were loving, comforting, kind, forgiving, and others were angry, vengeful, punitive, wrathful. And we wanted to see whether that made a difference. And indeed it did. We found that the people - the more you believed your god to be on the punitive side that spectrum, the less likely you were to cheat, whereas the more you believed your god to be loving, the actual more likely you were to cheat. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED SINGER #3: (Singing) He loves his children. And he's willing to forgive them. God is love. VEDANTAM: What you're suggesting in some ways is that people are behaving, you know, very rationally. If you believe in an angry, vengeful, punitive god and you believe that this god is going to harm you if you do something wrong, it's perfectly rational for you to stick to the straight and narrow. SHARIFF: Yeah. And I would argue that this, again, is - I think it's no accident why the most successful religions have been - and I mean successful in terms of just sheer numbers. The societies that have been able to grow largest with the religions that they believe in have had this idea of supernatural punishment at their core because it is an effective deterrent. It does compel people rationally to act in ways which will avoid the wrath of a punitive god who can punish you quite severely. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: So according to the Scriptures, hell is a place that literally exists. That's not a Baptist doctrine. That's not a Methodist doctrine. That's a doctrine of the Bible. It exists, friend. It was made, therefore, as a place of punishment, not a place to simply go to. . . VEDANTAM: Besides the psychological studies, Azim says there's evidence from history and anthropology that suggests modern religions arose to solve problems related to trust and cooperation. All the world's major religions today arose at times when human societies were struggling with the challenges of size, complexity or scarcity. SHARIFF: Certain religious ideas that would be most effective at encouraging people to be prosocial, like this idea of a big, omniscient, punitive god, tend to crop up in those particular circumstances when cooperation is particularly necessary. So if you look at societies that were larger - that is, with more anonymous strangers - you tend to see these types of gods emerge more frequently in those societies. But you also see them emerge more frequently in societies that faced, say, particularly acute resource scarcity issues. So in a place where it's very, very important that you share water in trustworthy, equitable ways, you see these types of big, omniscient, punitive gods emerge there, as well. And so there is this, yes, this correlation, as far as we can tell now, between the necessity of cooperation and the types of cultural innovation, the religious innovations that would be most effective at bringing it about. VEDANTAM: What is the evidence that we have that in earlier societies that were much smaller, people didn't believe in these big gods or these gods that have these huge effects or these punitive gods? SHARIFF: So if you look both at the archaeological record, as well as modern hunter-gatherer tribes - so modern tribes that still live in ways that were similar to how we lived prior to 12,000 years when there was the agricultural revolution, we started settling in large groups - those types of small societies where you don't have those anonymous stranger challenges tend not to have these large, punitive gods. Their gods tend to be smaller and weaker and less morally concerned. And so you tend to see that those large gods, the punitive gods, only emerge when it's necessary to have that cooperation spread. And when you have these small societies, you don't need that. VEDANTAM: Can you give me an example? SHARIFF: So a lot of research has been done on these small tribes like the Hadza, where the gods are - they're more like trickster spirits. They're neither omniscient nor are they punishing the types of immoral behavior that would be necessary to get rid of in order to be cooperative. The gods are, again, small, forest spirits or trickster spirits that don't have the power nor the punitive ability nor the, really, concern for these moral issues. VEDANTAM: Now, of course, this view of religion - comparing ancient hunter-gatherer tribes with modern societies or measuring which gods produce what behavior - this kind of thinking can seem completely upside down to you if you're a person of faith. If you're a believer, this is not the way you think about religion. Your faith is a source of meaning, guidance, comfort. It's a connection to something greater than yourself. Let's go back to Islamic scholar Akbar Ahmed. AHMED: I know that at times when I'm sitting in the Muslim world, especially in the evening at (speaking Arabic) time, when you know there's that magical moment when the day has just died and the night has not quite begun and there's that twilight in the atmosphere and suddenly, there's a complete hush for a few seconds. Then you hear the azan, the beautiful azan. And it drifts. And writers have said, poets have said, it's like a feather in flight. It just drifts on in the air almost as if it is weightless in its beauty. And it just undulates on and on, so in that sense, it is a beautiful part of the symphony of Islam itself. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED SINGER #1: (Singing in Arabic). VEDANTAM: I'm wondering whether you ever get pushback from religious people who basically are angry that you are dissecting their faith in a way that says, I can study this as if it's an organism under a microscope. I can study when it flourishes, when it doesn't flourish, how it grows, why it grows in one context, doesn't grow in another context. And people say, I believe because this god is a real god. I believe because this god has a real effect in my life, you shouldn't be coming in and studying this as if it's a scientific project. SHARIFF: So, yes, there is pushback. There's pushback from both sides for different reasons. I get pushback for that precise reason. People who are people of faith believe their religions to be divinely inspired. And so when you're reaching for naturalistic explanations for religion, that leaves little room for the divine inspiration. The origins for the religion become overdetermined. You have both a naturalistic reason for why it exists, and you have a divine reason for why it exists. And you don't need both. And so if you're positing a naturalistic explanation, well, then maybe it casts some doubt or threat on the divine inspiration explanation. And so that's a very, I think, legitimate pushback from their perspective. I also get pushback from people who have a bone to pick against religion. And the reason for that is because some of the research I do empirically demonstrates some of the positive effects that religion has. And if people have a bone to pick with religion, they tend not to like to admit that there's anything good about religion. And so I get hate mail from both sides. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: When we come back, we'll take a closer look at one of Azim's more controversial ideas. Given that different religions have risen and fallen over the centuries, can you study religion as if it were a living organism subject to the rules of Darwinian natural selection? SHARIFF: I think that the application of evolutionary theory has really revolutionized our understanding of the origins and functions of religion. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. Let's take a moment to go back in time. For the vast majority of human history, we lived in small groups of around 50 people. Everyone knew everybody. If you told a lie, stole someone's dinner or didn't defend the group against its enemies, there was no way to disappear into the crowd. Everyone knew you, and you would get punished. But in the last 12,000 years or so, human groups began to expand from a few dozen to more than a thousand. And now it wasn't so easy to punish the cheaters and the free riders. So we needed something big, vast, an epic force that could see what everyone was doing and enforce the rules. Since individual people could no longer police gigantic groups, the policing had to be done by a force that was superhuman. That force, according to psychologist Azim Shariff, was the modern idea of a punitive god, the kind that many preachers warn can send you to hell. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Hell is a place. It is a place that existed before you were ever born. It is there. It's going to be there. And there's nothing you can do to change that one bit, whatsoever. VEDANTAM: Azim says the many religions we see around us today emerged in different societies at different times as mechanisms to solve problems of trust and cooperation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: It doesn't make any difference if the churches today have stopped preaching on hell, if the preachers don't preach on hell. It is still a place that you must deal with one day. VEDANTAM: So the picture that you're painting for me, Azim, is this really fascinating picture that religion has all these different effects on people. It has an effect on how we trust one another, how we're generous towards one another. Sometimes we're generous when we're reminded of religiosity, when we're reminded of the divine. It makes a difference whether the gods we believe in are benevolent gods or angry gods. It's also the case that maybe some religions flourish and thrive at a certain moment or in a certain ecosystem but then wither and fail away in another ecosystem. And it seems to me all of these different things are pointing to the same fundamental theory, which is that you're looking at religion as an evolutionary phenomenon. You're trying to understand how it can work in one context, how it can fail in another context, how you can study it almost as a living organism. SHARIFF: Yes. I think that's exactly right. I think that the application of evolutionary theory has really revolutionized our understanding of the origins and functions of religion. Now, in evolutionary theory, one of the most exciting developments is extending the Darwinian logic of selection of organisms based on how well they fit their environment to cultural ideas, as well, and cultural groups, as well. And this is what's called cultural evolution, or cultural evolutionary theory. It's also called dual inheritance theory. And the reason it's called dual inheritance theory is because unlike most other animals, humans come into the world with not just a genetic inheritance from their parents but an entire line of cultural ideas that get passed down to them, as well. And for about a hundred thousand years, we have been a necessarily cultural species. We have not been able to survive without the cultural knowledge that we inherit. And so a good example of this is fire. That's a cultural idea. If we didn't have that, we would not be able to survive because our bodies have now adapted to needing fire to predigest - that is, cook our food. And so the idea is that religion is one of these cultural ideas that similarly serves these functional roles in our lives and has done for at least 10,000 years. So what that means is that you can understand religions as they are today - today's major religions - as bearing the legacy of thousands of years of trial and error and selection so that what current religions are made up of, they're made up of those things because those served social functions in the past. They contributed to the societies that they were attached to surviving. VEDANTAM: You can see these patterns in the historical record. For example, ancient humans worshipped gods who could prevent natural disasters. But as the needs of societies changed, their gods changed, too. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Let us pray. VEDANTAM: As people built cities and civilizations that were more resilient, new kinds of gods. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Welcome to the prayer to do well in school. VEDANTAM: . . . With different powers emerged, and the requests people made of them changed as well. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Father, we decree and declare that, as they prepare for school - for tests and exams - show them what to study and how to study most effectively. Lord, please give them wisdom and understanding, as well as knowledge. . . VEDANTAM: Azim's point is that local conditions, like individual ecosystems, can create conditions where certain beliefs flourish and where others fade away. If belief in a certain god helps a group to thrive, that religion is likely to spread. An evolutionary theory of religion could also explain why many religions are deeply - some might say obsessively - interested in questions related to sex. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: No. 1 warning sign - amorous glances. VEDANTAM: You can hear these themes in religious broadcasts all the time - how much sex to have. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Flirtatious looks. Look at Proverbs 6 and 25 with me, if you would. VEDANTAM: . . . Whom to have sex with. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: It says do not lust after her beauty in your heart. . . VEDANTAM: . . . How to avoid certain kinds of sex. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: . . . Nor let her allure you with her eyelids. VEDANTAM: And it makes sense from a Darwinian perspective. Sex is about reproduction, and the organization of families and the growth of a population are integral to the long-term survival of societies. SHARIFF: One of the things that's very common among religions is to have norms regulating what you could call family values. You should have a lot of kids. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Three, four, six, 12? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: (Laughter). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: I mean, how many - is there a biblical mandate of how many we should have? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Well, there is a biblical mandate, if you will, that says, God blessed them and said, be fruitful and multiply. SHARIFF: You shouldn't have homosexual relationships. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: I say it's wrong because that's what the Scripture says. SHARIFF: You shouldn't have that much birth control. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #7: If we look at the Bible tonight and examine this, we'll see that this is actually not something that God wants us to do. SHARIFF: Now, those also serve these culturally adaptive purposes because they encourage people to produce lots of children. Having lots of children leads to larger societies. Larger societies can outcompete those societies that didn't have a lot of children. So if you had two religions - one which said, have a lot of sex, make a lot of children, don't use birth control, another one that said, never have sex, or, if you do, only use birth control - which society, looking down one, two, three generations, is going to be better off? Well, the one that actually produced offspring, became a larger civilization, a civilization that was able to outcompete either in active warfare or just through taking the resources of the other society. It's a competition between cultural ideas and cultural groups such that those socially functional ideas tend to be preserved over generations. And so this is how cultural evolution works. VEDANTAM: So if you buy the idea that religions arose at a certain point of time, that in some ways they're a form of cultural evolution, and certain types of religions and certain types of gods arose at certain points in time in order to confer certain kinds of cultural benefits on groups of people, one of the challenges, of course, is that, if I'm a religious person, and I now think of religion as being a marker of my willingness to trust the next person who's also a religious person, there is an incentive for people to cheat - for people to sort of say, I'm actually a religious person, I deeply believe in this God, when in fact they don't because they just want to take all the advantages that come from religious faith. And this brings us to the idea of rituals and the idea of costly rituals. Talk about this idea. Why would you have the development of costly rituals, in some ways, as a precondition to how religion ends up enforcing these cultural norms? SHARIFF: So this is one of the really great examples of how evolutionary theory can inform our understanding of religion. Things that were previously mysterious about religion now makes sense in an evolutionary perspective. So in evolution, there's this concept of costly signaling, that you have a hard-to-fake signal, which serves as a reliable cue of something you're trying to demonstrate. So the classic example of this is peacock feathers. (SOUNDBITE OF PEACOCK CALL) SHARIFF: The male peacock has this beautiful plumage, which is a sexual display. And the reason it's an effective sexual display is because only the healthiest peacocks can have the large plumage because of how costly it is to other aspects of the peacock's life. It can't fly very fast. It can't run away very much. It makes it very visible to other predators. And so if you're not the healthiest of peacocks and you try to fake this plumage, well, you're going to get eaten. And so the peahens, the female peahens, can use the display as a reliable indicator that, well, if I mate with this one, he actually has good genes because if he didn't have good genes, he would not be able to have this beautiful plumage. And so that might seem like an unrelated example, but if you look at the costly rituals that happen in religion, those are indications to other people in your group that you are a true believer. You are showing in a costly way indications that you're a believer. It is a hard-to-fake signal. If you weren't a true believer, you wouldn't go through all that effort. VEDANTAM: Effort like following the vows of chastity, poverty and obedience in Catholicism. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #8: We don't see them as restrictive rules. We see them as freeing. VEDANTAM: . . . Keeping kosher in Judaism. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #9: When I eat, I know that I am a Jew. VEDANTAM: And wearing a veil or headscarf in Islam. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #10: I use it to identify myself. I use it to be a symbol of who I am. SHARIFF: Now you have trustable cues, credibility-enhancing displays of people's genuine religiosity, which indicates that you actually can trust them. VEDANTAM: I want to take a closer look at one of those rituals to underscore the difference between the way believers think about religious practices and Azim's theory. Jainism, a small South Asian religion, has lots of rituals that ask for sacrifices, like fasting. (SOUNDBITE OF BANGING) VEDANTAM: Jainism is somewhat similar to Hinduism and Buddhism in that one of its core tenets is nonviolence. Jains are strict vegetarians. And each year, they observe a holiday called Paryushan. It's a week-long fast where practitioners limit their consumption of both food and water. We've come to a Jain temple on the outskirts of Washington, D. C. It's a balmy Friday morning, and around two dozen people have gathered to celebrate the last day of Paryushan. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting in foreign language). VEDANTAM: The temple is actually a converted ranch-style house. The walls have been knocked down to make space for seating. The purpose of Paryushan is to repent for one's sins over the past year. Kamlesh Shah (ph) says these are seven days when he nourishes his soul rather than his body. KAMLESH SHAH: I have done the full Upvas. VEDANTAM: Upvas is a kind of fast. K SHAH: An Upvas means that you do not eat anything at all. VEDANTAM: The only nourishment is water. And that, too, has to be boiled first and then blessed. Many of the Jains who have gathered at the temple have completed similar fasts. Pahlavi Shah (ph) says Paryushan gives her a better perspective on the struggles that other people face in the world. PAHLAVI SHAH: Yes, I did three fasting - three days separate, you know, without water. And I believe in that because if I do fast, you know, without food, what is my body? I can, you know - like, I can feel that, without food, we are nothing. So you know, that way, you know, I can help other people when they are hungry. VEDANTAM: This willingness to go hungry for her faith also identifies Pahlavi as a true believer. She's willing to make a sacrifice that others are not. Now, of course, most religious people who make such sacrifices don't see what they're doing as costly signaling. Pahlavi isn't fasting in order to communicate to other Jains that she's a trustworthy member of the group. She's saying, I'm a devout person. My religion calls on me to make the sacrifice. I asked Azim about the difference between an evolutionary theory of rituals and how believers think about their behavior. Again, I just wanted to clarify the difference between how people think in an individual way and sort of the effect this has at a group level. So for example, let's say your religion commands you to take a very costly and difficult pilgrimage, for example, that involves maybe physical difficulties or, you know, financial difficulties. The people who are embarking on that pilgrimage are not thinking to themselves, what I'm doing is a costly signal to other members of my religion. They're saying, I'm just a devout person. My religion calls on me to do this thing, and that's why I'm doing it. So there's a difference between how this might work in some ways at a community level, at a society level and how the individual practitioner thinks about it. The individual practitioner, the individual peacock, isn't thinking, let me grow beautiful feathers because that sends a costly signal. SHARIFF: Yeah. So there's something that we can call functional opacity - that people are not aware of these ultimate reasons, the ultimate evolutionary reasons, why they're engaging in this behavior. They're aware of the - what we could call the proximate reasons, the immediate reasons, what they believe the reason they're doing it for. They're doing it because their god asks them to do it. But really, the reason that there is a belief that god would ask you to do that - the reason why that belief exists in the first place is because it serves that functional purpose. And so they're enacting rituals that serve larger, hidden purposes that are very functional for their societies. But to them, it's just what their religion tells them to do. VEDANTAM: You know, I came by two interesting studies recently, one of them by Nicholas Hobson. And he found, along with other colleagues, that novel rituals, even when they are completely meaningless - you ask a group of people to perform a novel ritual, it has the power to increase trust among fellow members who are performing this novel ritual. The other study was by Panagiotis Mitkidis. And he showed, along with his colleagues, that extreme rituals often had a big effect on promoting moral behavior, not among the performers of the ritual but on observers. SHARIFF: Yeah. So one of the leaders in this type of extreme ritual research is this anthropologist, Dimitris Xygalatas, who's done this really interesting research on fire walkers. And what you find is that when you have observers watching people undergoing these rituals, their actual heart beats synchronize with the people engaging in the rituals. And the more you have that synchronization, the more they feel like they're part of a group. And so you ask, well, why did fire walking emerge? Why did circumcision emerge? Why did any of these painful rituals - there's many, many more examples of really terribly painful rituals. Why did they emerge? It's not random. The ones that we have, the ones that have been preserved, exist because they have this impact on our psychology that allow groups to cohere around each other that allow this communication between members of the group that encourage trust between them. So another example is this work on what's called synchrony, which is just engaging in actions at the same pace in the same rhythm as others. And you have this in terms of hymn singing. But you also have this in terms of marching that is often used in military drills for the same reason. When you're engaging in an action in rhythm with somebody else, that creates the psychological connection that makes people feel fused as a group. VEDANTAM: You can hear the power of synchrony in chants of the word om. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting) Om. VEDANTAM: Here's Hinduism scholar Shubha Pathak. SHUBHA PATHAK: It's a sacred syllable that seems to be created by adding three different Sanskrit letters together - the letter A, the letter U, and the letter ma (ph). It doesn't have a dictionary meaning, but it has a lot of connotations. And so in early Hinduism, in texts like the Upanishads - philosophical texts - it is used to represent the reality that encompasses the entire universe. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting) Ooh. PATHAK: Often a text or a chant, a mantra, will start with the syllable om. And I think the reason why that is is not only does it have this significance of standing for a particular god in his totality or her totality, but you have this column of sound that gives you a sense of vastness. I think it's sort of similar to what happens when you have two singers singing at the exact same frequency. You start to have these beats in the room. With om, it creates something around you, I think, that makes you feel like you're part of something. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting) Ooh. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. We've looked at a theory that suggests that religions arose to solve problems of social cohesion. Psychologist Azim Shariff makes the case that much like living organisms, religions have evolved over time with different gods and different faiths rising and falling away over the millennia. Azim argues that religions play a functional role in societies, helping them run more smoothly and strengthening the bonds of trust. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: But religion can also be a source of conflict and war. Religious violence is often in the headlines. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: In Egypt this morning, there's new fighting between Christians and Muslims. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Buddhist monks have attacked dozens of mosques and churches in the last year. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: The new extremists set fire to an orphanage. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: It appears to show his beheading at the hands of ISIS. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Critics of religion sometimes point to such fanatical behavior and say, look; this is evidence that there's something wrong with religious faith. Psychologist Azim Shariff says such criticisms miss the point. SHARIFF: So the first thing that needs to be said is that coalitional violence is very old in our species. It's something that we see shared with our closest cousins, the chimpanzees. And so it's something that does precede religion. But what religion adds to it I think is actually consistent with this evolutionary perspective, which is that we're going to engage in wars. The question is, does religion enhance your side's ability to triumph in those wars? And the thing that religion adds is more than any other factor I can think of, aside from perhaps family, religion allows people to be bound together in a way that allows them to die for and kill for each other. And so this ability to form very cohesive, very tight coalitions, as well as to introduce sacred values, things that people are willing to fight for beyond all utilitarian or rational calculus, allows religion to make people better fighters. So, yes, religion does contribute to our warlike nature, but it does so in a very adaptive - culturally adaptive way. VEDANTAM: Azim is not saying that religious violence is socially desirable. He's saying that natural selection doesn't really care about being socially desirable. On average, a religion that helps societies triumph in war is a religion that spreads. So there are lots of examples when I look at modern societies today where I see other institutions, other forces that in some ways offer competition to religion. When I think about what will cause people to fight and die, you now no longer need religious faith. You can have nationalism. You can have patriotism - people willing to die for the flag. When it comes to trust, you know, it - you and I don't have to belong to the same religion anymore. We can both agree - you can sell a house to me and I can buy a house from you because we both believe that there are institutions organized by the state that will ensure that you will actually sell the house to me and I will actually give you money for it. I put my money in a bank every month, and I actually only see a bunch of digits on a piece of paper. But I trust that the bank at some level is actually holding onto my money. And I have absolutely no idea what religion the bankers belong to. Are these all examples of how modern societies have come to essentially displace the need for religion? SHARIFF: So, yes, I think so. So in terms of these other isms that people are willing to fight and die for, it's important to know that the idea of sacred values extends beyond just religious values. There are nonreligious things that we sacralize. So as soon as you sacralize something, it allows people to fight and die for it, right? So we have a fertile psychological meadow that's ready to sacralize things. And you just have to find the right key to fit into that lock. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER\") SHARIFF: Religion is a great one. It fits very well. But it's not the only thing that does so. (SOOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BARACK OBAMA: Thank you. God bless you, and God bless these United States of America. (APPLAUSE) SHARIFF: We'll sacralize ideas like freedom. We'll sacralize our nation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America. SHARIFF: We'll sacralize the flag. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: To the flag of the United States of America. And to the republic. . . SHARIFF: And in terms of the governmental institutions that can spread trust, one of the interesting things you see is that if you look across countries, those countries that report having the least importance of religion to their daily lives are the countries that have the highest faith in the rule of law. So those are the places where you trust the institutions, like the bank or contract enforcement or the police or the justice system. Once you can set up those types of trusted secular institutions, well, that obviates the need for a lot of what religion has done. Now, it's only been in recent years that we've been able to have those types of centralized effective institutions. And still, in most parts of the worlds, we're not able to. But in those places where we are, we see ourselves moving towards a post-religious world where a lot of the functions of religion are accomplished by other means and potentially better means. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Azim thinks that if regulations and good governance provide the trust and cooperation that religious bonds once provided, new kinds of faith might flourish - religions that don't have an angry god who threatens to punish you if you step out of line, religions that don't talk a lot about hell and damnation but instead spend more time on building community, offering services like cooking classes or singles' nights or child care. SHARIFF: Especially in places where you had other structures that were allowing for people to act in these harmonious, cooperative ways - say, secular institutions of law - under that umbrella where religion no longer has to shoulder the burden of enforcing cooperation, you can have religions start tilting in the other direction, more towards the religious benevolence and away from the religious malevolence, which is no longer as necessary for that religion. So a good example of this are Jehovah's Witnesses, and this is actually where some of these theories came from. I had Jehovah's Witnesses who would visit me when I was living in Vancouver. They'd visit me quite frequently because the first time they visited, my roommate was baking cookies, and she offered them cookies, and so they kept coming back. And I was fascinated by the conversations we had because one of them - they had their little Watchtower magazine, and it said - do we believe in hell? - on the cover. And then you had to open up and read that they didn't. And Jehovah's Witnesses - that's a relatively new religion, a relatively new sect of Christianity and one that emerged under this umbrella of an existing secular society. It emerged in the United States when the United States had laws that ensured that people would follow the rules. VEDANTAM: I have to ask you. Have you ever been religious yourself? SHARIFF: I was raised religious. I was raised Muslim, but I wandered away from the faith as a teenager. And I would consider myself a secular atheist now. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering if you're ever at family gatherings or even family gatherings that are inspired by some kind of religious occasion where people feel that you are judging them and studying them and analyzing them the way that a scientist would study microbes under a microscope, that you're basically saying, I understand why you do this because there's a naturalistic explanation for this. And for someone who is deeply religious, for whom religion means a great deal emotionally, there is something probably quite painful about having someone come along and say, look; this is opaque to you, but there is a deep and hidden evolutionary reason why you believe what you believe. They're going to be upset at you, I would think. SHARIFF: Yeah, so I do have a lot of religious family, still. And I've learnt over the years that I've been studying this topic that you pick your battles. You don't need to be confrontational about this. People benefit a lot from religion. People suffer a lot from religion, as well. But you can see when you know somebody very closely who is religious, often who's potentially going through struggles in their life - illnesses, whatever - that they benefit from the religion. And so I don't feel the need to explicitly threaten what is benefiting them quite a bit by challenging it. I think that people who are close to me know my position on religion, but I don't feel the need to be antagonistic about it. And as a result, I think we reach maybe some sort of uneasy peace.

They can help firefighters find hot spots. They can let environmental monitors pinpoint the source of hazardous chemical leaks. But small drones have a problem. They can't fly for very long. NPR's Joe Palca reports on a new solution. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Small quad copters have become extremely popular. You see them at sporting events or outdoor concerts, maybe around your neighborhood. But it takes a lot of power to spin four helicopter blades fast enough to keep a quadcopter in the air. KAIYU HANG: If you fly it with full battery, you can use it for at most, like, 25 minutes to half an hour. PALCA: Kaiyu Hang and his colleagues at Yale University are trying to extend the time a drone can stay on the job. And for inspiration, they turn to birds. HANG: Birds usually fly somewhere. They stay at the top of the roof or some tree branches, and then they look for their prey or they just stay there without, you know, flapping their wings all the time. And then they can still observe what is happening around them. PALCA: And observing takes a lot less energy than flying. Hang and his colleagues developed a claw-like landing system that lets a drone grab on to a branch or pole and turn off its engines. And Hang says their new system allows a drone to save energy even when no suitable branch is available. HANG: We have developed, like, modularized landing gear framework that allows the drone to not only perch on some structures, but also the drone can rest on some structures when perching is not possible. PALCA: By resting, Hang means the quadcopter can essentially lean against the ledge and stay there using just two of its four rotors, saving energy. Hang describes his work in the journal Science Robotics. Mark Cutkosky also works on drone landing systems. He's at Stanford University. He says the ability to perch can be handy for a number of reasons. MARK CUTKOSKY: If you perch, for example, underneath a bridge or underneath the eaves of a building, you can ride out storms or bad weather that would make it hard to fly. PALCA: Cutkosky says the Yale team's new landing system does have some drawbacks. For one thing, it adds weight to the drone. That means it takes more energy to keep it aloft. CUTKOSKY: So there had better be a good tradeoff in terms of really improving mission time in order to pay for that added weight. PALCA: Another drawback is, for now, a human has to fly the drone to the perch site. To make the landing system really useful, the drone should be able to land on its own. So the question is. . . CUTKOSKY: What sorts of strategies can we use that would allow this system to discover perchable sites? PALCA: Cutkosky says the Yale team has already begun integrating the drone's computer with its onboard camera. So he thinks before too long, drones will be able to decide on their own where to settle down for a rest. Joe Palca, NPR News.

It's small, and nuclear-powered electricity is an important part of Saudi Arabia's plans for its future. But as NPR's Geoff Brumfiel reports, there may be an ulterior reason for the interest in nukes. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Right now Saudi Arabia generates its electricity with fossil fuels. SHARON SQUASSONI: They're one of the few countries that actually uses oil for electricity. Most countries stopped doing that in the '70s. BRUMFIEL: Sharon Squassoni is at George Washington University. It's totally obvious why Saudi Arabia does this. They have lots of oil and natural gas. But looking to the future, the Saudi government predicts that oil will be more valuable as an export. So starting in the late 2000s, Saudi Arabia began pursuing an ambitious plan to start a nuclear energy program. Even after the 2011 nuclear disaster in Japan, Squassoni says Saudi Arabia kept at it. SQUASSONI: Most countries were walking away from nuclear. But they decided, look; this is our long-term plan. BRUMFIEL: Which she finds a little puzzling given that the country is perfectly suited for other kinds of less costly electricity production, particularly renewables. SQUASSONI: They have these vast deserts that'd be pretty easy, I would think, to put out big solar farmsBRUMFIEL: Squassoni's background is an arms control, and she's worried that Saudi Arabia might be interested in nuclear technology for a different reason, nuclear weapons - why? - because of their chief rival in the region. SQUASSONI: The big thing is Iran. BRUMFIEL: Its nuclear program has had military dimensions in the past according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Speaking last year on CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said, if Iran got a nuke, Saudi Arabia would, too. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"60 MINUTES\")CROWN PRINCE MOHAMMED BIN SALMAN: (Through interpreter) Saudi Arabia does not want to acquire any nuclear bomb. But without a doubt, if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible. BRUMFIEL: Bin Salman's words matter because Saudi Arabia's nuclear plans are moving from paper to reality. Recent satellite images show construction is underway on its first research reactor on the outskirts of Riyadh. Aaron Stein is director of the Middle East Program at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. He says this new reactor is too small and too low-power to be of any use in bomb-making. AARON STEIN: This is not something that a country would engage upon for a weapons program. BRUMFIEL: In fact, even large civilian nuclear power plants can't be used easily to make bombs. But there are other parts of a civilian nuclear program that can. In particular, if Saudi Arabia decides it wants to make its own fuel for its nuclear reactors instead of buying it on the open market, that would require enriching uranium, which uses the same technologies that can be used to enrich uranium for bombs. STEIN: I think that would send alarm bells throughout the region. I think that there would be interpreted as a move to hedge and to consider building nuclear weapons down the line. BRUMFIEL: Saudi Arabia hasn't said whether it wants fuel-making technology, but there's plenty of reason to worry. Iran already has it, thousands of uranium centrifuges which for now remain under heavy international monitoring. The Trump administration is reportedly negotiating a nuclear cooperation deal with Saudi Arabia. Squassoni says that deal should be carefully crafted. SQUASSONI: The big, big question in the background for the U. S. and for all suppliers of nuclear technology to the Saudis is - do we think we have enough controls in place that we can trust them since they've been pretty clear about their intentions should things go bad with Iran?

DAVID GREENE, HOST: Yeah, that's right. It's a new beat here at NPR West in Culver City, Calif. And the beat belongs to our colleague Elise Hu. She is covering the future, among other things, in a new monthly video series. It's called Future You. And Elise is with me. Elise, how do you cover the future when it hasn't happened yet? ELISE HU, BYLINE: Well, it means I can't get anything wrong. . . GREENE: That's true. That's good. HU: . . . Or you can't fact-check me until way later. GREENE: Yeah, that's a perk. But seriously, what have you been looking at? HU: Well, what we're really focusing on is how human intelligence and artificial intelligence are melding more and more. GREENE: Sounds like stuff out of a science fiction movie, but it - that's really happening. HU: Yeah, and there's a lot more happening than I thought was possible. Elon Musk started a company called Neuralink that's working on this. Facebook began working on a way for us to type straight from our brains. And the Venmo billionaire Bryan Johnson started a company called Kernel, and he says the goal is improving human cognition. So all these companies and researchers are saying that connecting the most sophisticated computer on the planet, which is our brains, to outside machines could change who we are as humans. GREENE: So you sort of immersed yourself in this world recently. And just take us there. Tell me what you've been discovering. HU: Well, there have been a number of developments just within the past few years. People can now just wear a cap that's plugged into what's called a brain machine interface and learn how to move things like robot arms or send thoughts. Computer-assisted telepathy - I tried it. GREENE: This is crazy. HU: And while we can't see what private tech firms are doing, we are able to see some of the published research. So I went to the University of Washington Center for Neurotechnology and met the head of the center there, Rajesh Rao. RAJESH RAO: All right. Here we are. HU: OK. This is everybody. RAO: So we have a brain-to-brain interface called BrainNet, which allows two people to communicate with a third person directly using brain signals. HU: So the experiment lets three players, one in each room, simultaneously play a video game like Tetris. Remember Tetris, David? GREENE: Of course - moving blocks, rotating them to make sure they fall into place. Yeah. HU: Right. So in this situation, there were three of us, each in separate rooms, looking at screens. And we're all wearing these caps with electrodes on them called EEG caps, hooked up to computers. Two of us are the senders of thoughts. So we could see the block in the bottom row. . . GREENE: Which is critical to make sure that it fits in if you have to rotate it. HU: Exactly. GREENE: Yeah. HU: But the third player - the one who actually had to decide whether to rotate the block to clear the row - he couldn't see that bottom row. So he completely relied on us to tell him whether to rotate the block through our minds. And all we did was look at flashing strobe lights that flashed at different rates for yes or for no when we decided to send the thought. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: All you got to do is just sit back and relax. HU: Let's do - sit back and relax in your brain bonnet while strobing lights come at you. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Exactly. HU: . . . At different frequencies. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Yep. HU: So the computer can pick up on my brain reacting to the flashing light at yes or at a different rate of pulsing on no. So then it would send that signal to the player in the other room. He would see a kind of glow in his field of vision that, yes, he should rotate the block. GREENE: Did it work? HU: Oh, yeah. We totally did it. This experiment has been run a number of times now, and it's a well-known test case for computer-assisted telepathy. GREENE: OK. So this is an early experiment, but what are researchers saying? Where could this go? HU: Well, I asked Rajesh Rao, the head of UW's neurotech center, about this and what he imagines. RAO: Transfer of knowledge and skills definitely is a possibility. If you watched the movie \"The Matrix\" - learning kung fu, for example, just by downloading it. So how'd you do in calculus? Were you great in calculus? Well. . . HU: No. RAO: (Laughter) No. OK. HU: Absolutely not. RAO: So that's an example where just downloading it might not be sufficient 'cause you might have questions. So you might want to have interactive tutoring - you know, brain tutoring. GREENE: I could've just tutored my brain directly and not studied calculus. HU: Yeah. Maybe direct knowledge transfer is a possibility for the future. GREENE: Is it - am I wrong? This is kind of creepy, too. HU: Well, all technology can have malicious uses and be used for ill, right? But in this case, it gets even thornier. And Rao addressed some of that, too. RAO: You could have brain tapping - you know, somebody reading your thoughts. You could have computer viruses. Imagine, you know, somebody doing that with a - like, a mind virus. HU: So malware for the brain or something. RAO: Exactly. HU: Yeah, mind malware. GREENE: That's crazy. Like, you could be thinking that you wanted to infect my brain somehow and make me have different thoughts. HU: Well, worse, it would be used by businesses or governments. GREENE: So this is important stuff you're covering. HU: Yeah, and it's exactly why I thought that it was an important frontier for us to be looking at. GREENE: All right. And you can look at it much more by watching the premiere episode of Elise's new video series Future You, With Elise Hu. I like the rhyme. Just go to npr. org/futureyou. Elise, thanks.

That means even more flooding for communities in the Midwest that have been dealing with high water for more than a month. Even though flooding along the river is increasingly frequent and severe, many places are not prepared to handle the water. NPR's Rebecca Hersher reports one reason may be the words officials use when they talk about flood risk. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: If you live in a flood-prone area as tens of millions of Americans do, you've heard the words I'm talking about. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: We are at a thousand-year level. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: . . . Called 500-year rainfall. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: One hundred years flood. HERSHER: Is this a good phrase - hundred-year flood? ALICE HILL: I think it's highly confusing to people. It's based on probabilities. HERSHER: Alice Hill studies disaster resilience at the Hoover Institution, and she was a climate advisor in the Obama administration. HILL: Many people assume that if their area has experienced the one in 100 year flood, that means that for the next 99 years, they need not worry about flooding. So. . . HERSHER: And that's not the case. HILL: It's not the case. HERSHER: So here's what a hundred-year flood does mean. It means there's a 1% chance it will happen each year. If it happens this year, there is still a 1% chance it will happen next year. HILL: As with the flip of a coin, if you flip heads twice in a row, that doesn't mean that you're going to get tails the next time. So you could have three very significant floods right in a row. HERSHER: That kind of thing has happened a lot recently. For example, North Carolina got hit by two really wet hurricanes in a row. And that prompted then-Governor Roy Cooper to say this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ROY COOPER: When you have two 500-year floods within two years of each other, it's pretty clear it's not a 500-year flood. HERSHER: But that's not it. Both floods had a low probability of happening, but sometimes low probability things do happen. And Hill says the widespread confusion about basic flood probability is a big problem. HILL: We are leading people to be unprepared. HERSHER: It's not surprising that the one in 100-year language isn't helping people prepare for flooding. It was never meant to. The hundred-year flood term was adopted by Congress back in the 1970s to describe who would be required to buy flood insurance, and researchers say there are better ways to communicate flood risk. Instead of talking about how likely a given flood is to happen each year, talk about how likely that flood is to happen over many years. For example, if there is a 1% chance of a flood happening each year, that means there is a 26% chance it will happen over the course of a 30-year mortgage. And if you live your whole life in a flood zone, you'll be more likely than not to experience a hundred-year flood. Explaining flood probability that way helps people understand their risk over time. Robert Holmes is the national flood hazard coordinator for the U. S. Geological Survey. He says his team is trying to move away from the one in 100 year language in their public documents in part because the misunderstandings undercut the public's trust in flood science. ROBERT HOLMES: The educated lay person or elected officials - they think well, you scientists and engineers can't get it straight because we had a hundred-year flood two years ago. Why are we having another one? You guys must have your numbers wrong, or you're doing something wrong. And that's not the case. I mean, it makes people think, well, we just don't know what we're doing. HERSHER: Holmes says the stakes are high when it comes to flood risk. In many parts of the country, flooding is getting more frequent and severe. Climate change is part of the problem. Warmer air can hold more moisture, which falls as more extreme rain. And in many places, development is also creating more runoff, all of which puts more people in harm's way, many of whom don't know they're at risk. HOLMES: You know, if you build in the wrong spot or you buy a house that, you know, you were unaware that you had a risk, you know, you could lose your life savings. Or worst case, you lose a member of your family or your own life. HERSHER: Rebecca Hersher, NPR News.

An Oregon company wants to build a new kind of nuclear power plant that many see as the future of the industry. NPR's Jeff Brady reports. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: Power plants are so big because they're designed to take advantage of economies of scale. JOSE REYES: What we've done is we've developed economies of small. BRADY: Jose Reyes is co-founder of NuScale Power and says his company's reactors are more adaptable for a world moving away from fossil fuels to cleaner forms of energy. REYES: We haven't just taken a large plant and shrunk it down. We've completely simplified it and changed how we operate those plants. BRADY: And, Reyes says, the design cuts expensive construction time by about half. NuScale hasn't actually built a plant yet, though it does have models of its design about an hour and a half south of Portland, Ore. One is a simulated control room. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: The room we're in is the same size as the room we expect the control room to be in. BRADY: Outside, there's a mockup of one of the modules that would hold a NuScale reactor. It's a big, metal tank several stories tall but still much smaller than a typical reactor. And this one has a very squeaky door. (SOUNDBITE OF DOOR SQUEAKING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: This is kind of the main access port for when we want to. . . BRADY: Inside, it's painted industrial gray, and only a few people can fit at a time. Instead of one big reactor powering a plant, NuScale plans a series of up to 12 much smaller reactors like this one. They'd be built in a factory and transported by truck. Karin Feldman is a vice president with the company and says that manufacturing will get more efficient over time. KARIN FELDMAN: We know that the first one's going to take longer than the second one. But we anticipate by the time you get to, say, the third one or the fourth one, you've learned everything that you need to learn about that manufacturing process. And you can be very predictable. BRADY: Feldman says this design is safer, too. The Fukushima disaster in 2011 happened when a tsunami knocked offline the emergency generators that cooled the reactors and spent fuel, leading to a meltdown. Feldman says NuScale's design is cooled passively. The reactors sit underground in a huge pool of water that can absorb heat. FELDMAN: The reactor will fail to a safe position. It doesn't require additional water, doesn't require AC or DC power, doesn't require any operator action. And it can stay in that safe configuration for as long as it's needed. BRADY: NuScale plans to build its first nuclear power plant at the Idaho National Lab. The electricity will head across the state border to a group of utilities called the Utah Associated Municipal Power System - or UAMPS. The group was looking for a carbon-free source of electricity to generate power when solar panels and wind turbines can't. While big nuclear reactors run all the time, this collection of smaller reactors can be ramped up and down relatively quickly to meet demand. Batteries can do that too, but UAMPS CEO Doug Hunter says NuScale's reactors are cheaper. DOUG HUNTER: Each module will be - have enough fuel in it for two years of operation, so it's like we're a battery that has a two-year charge to it. BRADY: NuScale still must convince regulators the plant is safe. That's a challenge because the design is so different that existing regulations have to be changed. That worries Edwin Lyman with the Union of Concerned Scientists. EDWIN LYMAN: My concern about NuScale is that they believe so deeply that the reactor is safe and doesn't need to meet the same criteria as the large reactors that it's pushing for lots of exemptions and exceptions. BRADY: So Lyman will be among those watching regulators closely as NuScale pushes to have its first power plant built and operating in 2026. Jeff Brady, NPR News.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. In 2012, Maranda Dynda had a lot on her plate. She was 18. All her friends were getting ready for college and busy being teenagers, but Maranda was on a different path. She was pregnant. MARANDA DYNDA: So I was very nervous, and I felt really uneasy but excited at the same time. VEDANTAM: To calm her anxieties, Maranda did some research on childbirth. DYNDA: I decided I wanted a home birth. VEDANTAM: For that, she would need a midwife. She searched for months for someone who could come to her apartment in rural Pennsylvania. Eventually, she found a woman who seemed perfect. We'll call her M, her first initial, to protect her privacy. From the very first moment they met, Maranda knew everything was going to be fine. DYNDA: She said she had been a home birth midwife for over a decade. VEDANTAM: She was no nonsense, the mother of eight. DYNDA: She was very open and honest and friendly, so she definitely seemed like someone who I could trust. VEDANTAM: About an hour into that first meeting, M brought up a question that struck Maranda as strange. DYNDA: She said, have you ever considered not vaccinating? VEDANTAM: Maranda hadn't. Vaccines had never crossed her mind. DYNDA: So I asked her - you know, I was very confused. I was like, what do you mean you - why would I consider that? VEDANTAM: M explained that, years ago, something bad had happened after she vaccinated her first child. She went on to describe a progression of events that lead some parents to a powerful but faulty conclusion. M told Maranda that right after her son got his shots, his development regressed. One minute, he was fine; the next, he was autistic. She said the light had left his eyes, so M decided not to vaccinate her other children. DYNDA: And she very much implored me to do the same and to look into it, so I did. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Maranda started on Google. It led her to Facebook groups. DYNDA: It's very easy to find them. So, yeah, even if you just Google, you know, support groups for parents who don't vaccinate, you will find a lot. VEDANTAM: The moms in these groups echoed what M had told her. DYNDA: And they welcomed me with open arms and immediately were just practically bombarding me with information, telling me your midwife's right, this is why you shouldn't vaccinate, this is why I don't vaccinate, this is what happened to my child who I did vaccinate versus my child who I didn't vaccinate - things like that. VEDANTAM: Everyone was caring and attentive. They didn't just talk about vaccines. They talked about regular mom stuff, things that Maranda found hard to talk about with anyone else. DYNDA: Diapers and birth plans and hospitals and midwives and breast pumps and stuff like that. VEDANTAM: Maranda trusted them. DYNDA: To me, it seemed so clear. It seemed like I had just found this secret information that only some people come across. And I thought, why would I not use this information? Why would I not use this to my benefit, to my child's benefit? So it did not take me very long at all before I was solidly saying I will not vaccinate my child when she is born. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TO RAMONA\")BOB DYLAN: (Singing) Ramona, come closer, shut softly your watery eyes. VEDANTAM: She named her daughter Ramona after the song by Bob Dylan. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TO RAMONA\")DYLAN: (Singing) The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise. DYNDA: Ramona, as a newborn, she was very active. She was very bright. She was very happy. She was a great baby, honestly. She was a wonderful baby. VEDANTAM: When the doctors said it was time to vaccinate Ramona, Maranda was ready. She had a script she'd been practicing in her head for months. DYNDA: And I said, no, thank you. We - I have decided that I do not want to vaccinate. Please, respect my opinions. Thank you very much. VEDANTAM: For the next two years, Maranda continued to say no to vaccines. Occasionally, when she encountered information that conflicted with her decision, a pamphlet at the doctor's office, a website, she dismissed it. DYNDA: I just very quickly went, that's not true. I don't agree with that. And I moved on. VEDANTAM: At some point, though, her conviction started to waver. Those doting moms on Facebook, they had some weird beliefs. DYNDA: People denying that AIDS exists, people saying that the reason there's gay people is vaccines - on and on and on with really crazy conspiracy theories. VEDANTAM: And then it hit her. If she didn't believe those ideas, why was she trusting them on vaccines? DYNDA: And I stepped back. I stopped going to the Facebook group as much, and I decided I needed to look at this issue from a purely logical perspective - no emotion in it, no, oh, my God, what if something happens to my baby? And I completely readdressed the issue all over again pretty much from the start. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Maranda started seeking out perspectives that the moms had urged her to avoid - information from the Centers for Disease Control and medical journals. DYNDA: I started reading all kinds of things, basically opening my mind to more than just vaccines are bad to the other side of the coin. VEDANTAM: It didn't take her long to change her mind. She got Ramona vaccinated. Looking back, Maranda can't believe how easy it was to embrace beliefs that were false. DYNDA: And what I would say to someone who's about to become a new mom, especially if they're a young mom, is don't try to confirm your own fears online. It is so, so easy to Google, what if this happens, and find something that's probably not true that confirms your fear, that confirms your anxieties. Don't do that. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Maranda's story tells us a lot about the psychology of false beliefs, how they spread and how they persist even in the face of conflicting information. This week, we look at how we rely on people we trust to shape what we believe and why emotions can be more powerful than facts. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Tali Sharot is a professor at University College London. She is the author of \"The Influential Mind: What The Brain Reveals About Our Power To Change Others. \" Tali is a mom and so she understands on a personal level why Maranda was so worried about the safety of her child. A few years ago, when her baby was just a few weeks old, Tali was listening to a Republican presidential debate. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You take this little, beautiful baby and you pump - I mean, it looks just like it's meant for a horse, not for a child. VEDANTAM: Candidate Donald Trump had been asked a question about the safety of childhood vaccines. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: And we've had so many instances, people that work for me, just the other day, 2 years old, 2 1/2 years old, a child, a beautiful child, went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic. TALI SHAROT: So when I was listening to Trump at that debate, it really tapped into this fear that I had and the anxiety that I already had. And when he talked about this huge syringe, a horse-sized syringe that was going to go into the baby, in my mind, I could imagine this syringe inserted into my small, little child and all the bad things that could happen. And this was a very irrational reaction on my end because I know that there is not an actual link between autism and vaccines. But it's not enough to have the data. Ben Carson - Dr. Ben Carson - was on the other end. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BEN CARSON: Well, let me put it this way. There has - there have been numerous studies, and they have not demonstrated that there is any correlation between vaccinations and autism. SHAROT: But that wasn't enough because the data is not enough. And even if the data is based on very good science, it has to be communicated in a way that would really tap into people's needs, their desires. If people are afraid, we should address that. VEDANTAM: I'm curious. When you sort of contrasted, you know, the weight of the evidence on the one hand and this very powerful image of the horse syringe and your 7-week-old baby on the other hand, how did you talk yourself into trusting the data over that emotional image? SHAROT: What really helped is that I understood what was happening to me. Because this is what I study, I knew what my reaction was. I knew where it was coming from. I knew how it was going to affect me. And I think that awareness helped me to put it aside and say, OK, I know that I am anxious for the wrong reasons, and this is the action that I should take. It's a little bit when you're on a plane and there's turbulence and you get scared but telling yourself I know that turbulence is not actually anything that's dangerous, I know the statistics on safety in planes and so on, it helps. It helps people reduce their anxiety. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: But facts don't always relieve our anxieties. Sometimes they harden our views. Some time ago, Tali wanted to test how people update their beliefs when confronted with new information. So she presented statements to two kinds of people - those who believe that climate change was real and those who were deniers. She found that for both groups, when the statement confirmed what they already thought, this strengthened their beliefs. But when it challenged their views, they ignored it. Tali says it's because of a powerful phenomenon known as confirmation bias. SHAROT: Confirmation bias is our tendency to take in any kind of data that confirms our prior convictions and to disregard data that does not conform to what we already believe. And when we see data that doesn't conform to what we believe, what we do is we try to distance ourselves from it. We say, well, that data is not credible, right? It's not good evidence for what it's saying. So we're trying to reframe it to discredit it. All right. So I give an example in my book where if someone comes in and says, I just saw pink elephants flying in the sky and I have a very strong belief obviously that no pink elephants fly in the sky, I would then think that they're either delusional or they're lying. And there's good reason for me to believe that. So it's actually the correct approach to assess data in light of what you believe. There's four factors that determine whether we're going to change our beliefs - our old belief, our confidence in that old belief, the new piece of data and our confidence in that piece of data. And the further away the piece of data is from what you already believe, the less likely it is to change your belief. And on average, as you go about the world, that is not a bad approach. However, it also means that it's really hard to change false beliefs. So if someone holds a belief very strongly but it is a false belief, it's very hard to change it with data. VEDANTAM: So if data and facts don't work, what does? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: How do you get people to buy the truth? Well, you could try scaring them. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)RUDY GIULIANI: The vast majority of Americans today do not feel safe. HILLARY CLINTON: On Sunday, Americans woke up to a nightmare that's become mind-numbingly familiar. TRUMP: This could be the great Trojan horse of all time. VEDANTAM: Politicians use fear to get us to vote. TV programs use fear to get us to keep watching. Public health officials use fear to get us to quit smoking. I ask Tali whether fear might be an effective way to persuade people to change their minds and maybe even their behavior. SHAROT: Fear works in two situations. It works when people are already stressed out. And it also works when what you're trying to do is get someone not to do something, an inaction. For example, if you try to get someone not to vaccinate their kids, fear may work. If there's, you know, an apple that looks bad, I don't eat it. Fear is actually not such a good motivator for inducing action, while hope is a better motivator, on average, for motivating action. VEDANTAM: You talk about one study in your book where a hospital managed to get its workers to practice hand hygiene to get staff members to wash their hands regularly. But it turned out the most effective thing wasn't frightening the staff about the risks of transmitting infections. It was something else. SHAROT: So in a hospital on the East Coast, a camera was installed to see how often medical staff actually sanitize their hand before and after entering a patient's room. And the medical staff knew that the camera was installed and yet only 1 in 10 medical staff sanitized their hands before and after entering a patient's room. But then an intervention was introduced - an electronic board that was put above each door, and it gave the medical staff in real time positive feedback. It showed them the percentage of medical staff that wash their hands in the current shift and the weekly rate as well. So anytime a medical staff will wash their hands, the numbers will immediately go up and there will be a positive feedback saying, you know, good job. And that affected the likelihood of people washing their hands significantly. It went up from 10% to 90%, and it stayed there. Instead of using the normal approach, instead of saying, you know, you have to wash your hands because otherwise you'll spread the disease - basically instead of warning them of all the bad things that can happen in the future, which actually results in inaction, they gave them positive feedback. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: I wrapped up my conversation with Tali by exploring another idea about how we might convince others to listen to views that conflict with their own. It had to do with a study of Princeton students who got their brains scanned while they listened to stirring, emotional speeches. SHAROT: What they found was the brains of the different people listening to those speeches started synchronizing. So if we all listen, for example, to Kennedy's famous moon speech, our brains would likely look very much alike. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHN F KENNEDY: Those who came before us made certain that this country rode the first waves of the Industrial Revolution. SHAROT: And this is not only in regions that are important for language and hearing. It's also in regions that are important for emotion, in regions that are important for what's known as theory of mind - our ability to think about what other people are thinking - in regions that are important for associations. And you try to think, well, what's common to all these influential speeches that can cause so many people's activity to synchronize? And one of the most important things is emotion. If the storyteller or the person giving the speech is able to elicit emotion in the other person, then he's actually having somewhat of a control on that person's state of mind. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KENNEDY: And this generation does not intend to founder in the backwash of the coming age of space. We mean to be a part of it. We mean to lead it. (APPLAUSE)SHAROT: So think about it like this. If you're very sad and I'm telling you a joke, well, you're sad, so you're not going to perceive the joke as I perceive it when I'm happy. But if I'm able to first make you happy and then tell you the joke, well, then you'll perceive it more from my point of view. So by eliciting emotion, what you're able to do is change the perception of everything that comes after - to perceive information as the person who's giving this speech wants you to perceive it. VEDANTAM: So you can see how this coupling, this idea that the audience's mind and the speaker's mind are in some ways coupled together, you can see how this could potentially be used to spread good information. You know, you have a great teacher in high school and you're captivated by the teacher and you're being pulled along by the story the teacher is telling you, maybe about history or maybe about geography. But you can also see equally how the same thing can work in the opposite direction, that you could be listening to a demagogue or you could be listening to somebody who has a very sort of captivating rhetorical style. And this person could also lead you astray in just the same way that the great teacher can lead you to knowledge and to positive things. SHAROT: Absolutely. All the different factors that affect whether we will be influenced by one person or ignore another person are the same whether the person has good intentions or bad intentions, right? The factors that affect whether you're influential can be can you elicit emotion in the other person? Can you tell a story? Are you taking into account the state of mind of the person that's in front of you? Are you giving them data that confirms to their preconceived notions? All those factors that make one speech more influential than the other or more likely to create an impact can be used for good and can be used for bad. VEDANTAM: Tali Sharot, I want to thank you for joining me on HIDDEN BRAIN today. SHAROT: Thank you so much for having me. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: We've been exploring why we cling to beliefs. After the break, we look at how we spread them, from person to person to person. We'll talk to a mathematician about the power of social networks to circulate ideas. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. During the Middle Ages, word spread to Europe about a peculiar plant found in Asia. This plant had a long stalk with heavy pods attached. When you cut those pods open, inside you would find a tiny little lamb. (SOUNDBITE OF LAMB BLEATING)CAILIN O'CONNOR: Complete with flesh and wool like a live animal lamb. (SOUNDBITE OF LAMB BLEATING)VEDANTAM: This creature, half plant, half animal, came to be known as the Vegetable Lamb of Tartary. O'CONNOR: Various travel writers wrote that they had either heard about this or that they had eaten one of these lambs. And many of them said they had sawn the kind of downy wool from the lamb. VEDANTAM: When these narratives made their way to Europe, people felt they had a view of a different world. Of course, no one in Europe had ever seen the Vegetable Lamb of Tartary because there was no such thing. But for centuries, people kept talking about this fantastical creature as if it were real. It even came up in scholarly works right next to pictures of oak trees and rabbits. O'CONNOR: If people hadn't been telling each other about these things, nobody would believe that there were vegetable lambs because nobody had ever seen them, right? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)O'CONNOR: And this is, by no means, a unique happening at that time. VEDANTAM: At that time. Of course, we would never fall for vegetable lambs. We live in an era of science, of evidence-based reasoning, of calm, cool analysis. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: But maybe there are vegetable lambs that persist even today even among highly trained scientists, physicians and researchers. Maybe there are spectacularly bad ideas that we haven't yet recognized as spectacularly bad. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Cailin O'Connor is a philosopher and mathematician at the University of California, Irvine. She studies how information, both good and bad, can pass from person to person. She is co-author with James Weatherall of the book \"The Misinformation Age: How False Beliefs Spread. \"Cailin, welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. O'CONNOR: Oh, thank you for having me. VEDANTAM: So one of the fundamental premises in your book is that human beings are extremely dependent on the opinions and knowledge of other people. And this is what creates channels for fake news to flourish and spread. Let's talk about this idea. Can you give me some sense of our dependence on what you call the testimony of others? O'CONNOR: So one reason we wrote this book is that we noticed that a lot of people thinking about fake news and false belief were thinking about problems with individual psychology, so the way we have biases and processing information, the fact that we're bad at probability. But if you think about the things you believe, almost every single belief you have has come from another person. And that's just where we get our beliefs because we're social animals. And that's really wonderful for us. That's why we have culture and technology. You know, that's how we went to the moon. But if you imagine this social spread of beliefs as opening a door, when you open a door for true beliefs to spread from person to person, you also open the door for false beliefs to spread from person to person. So it's this kind of double-sided coin. VEDANTAM: And what's interesting, of course, is that if you close the door, you close the door to both, and if you open the door, you open the door to both. O'CONNOR: That's right. So if you want to be social learners who can do the kinds of cultural things we can do, it has to be the case that you also have to have this channel by which you can spread falsehood and misinformation, too. VEDANTAM: So as I was reading the book, I was reflecting on the things that I know or the things that I think I know, and I couldn't come up with a good answer for how I actually know that it's the Earth that revolves around the sun and not the other way around. O'CONNOR: Yeah. That's right. Ninety-nine percent of the things you believe probably you have no direct evidence of yourself. You have to trust other people to find those things out, get the evidence and tell it to you. And so one thing that we talk a lot about in the book is the fact that we all have to ground our beliefs in social trust. So we have to decide what sources and what people we trust and therefore what beliefs we're going to take up because there's just this problem where we cannot go verify everything that we learned directly. We have to trust someone else to do that for us. VEDANTAM: We trust the historian who teaches us about Christopher Columbus. We trust the images from NASA showing how our solar system is organized. Now, we say we know Columbus was Italian, and we know the Earth revolves around the sun. But, really, what we mean to say is we trust the teacher, and we trust NASA to tell us what is true. O'CONNOR: And the social trust and ability to spread beliefs, I mean, it's remarkable what it's let humans do. You know, no other animal has this ability to sort of transfer ideas and knowledge dependably from person to person over generation after generation to accumulate that knowledge. But you do just see sometimes very funny examples of false beliefs being spread in the same way. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: As a philosopher of science, Cailin studies how scientists communicate and share information. If we rely on scientists to tell us what to believe, who do they rely on? Turns out, other scientists. Now, showing that this is the case isn't easy. The process by which scientists change their minds on questions such as the spread of disease or the movement of objects through space is very complex. Studying this complex process can be mind-boggling. Say, for instance, Dr. A. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Hello? VEDANTAM: . . . Talks to doctor B one day about her research. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Hello. VEDANTAM: It also turns out that Dr. B is collaborating with Dr. C who recently met Dr. D at a conference. Now, Dr. D frequently reads Dr. A's papers but doesn't know about Dr. C's research. A couple of years later, Dr. E reads what Dr. B has written about what Dr. A said in an article that Dr. C cited before Dr. F had even published her results. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)O'CONNOR: Empirically, it's hard to study scientists because things like theory change will happen over the course of 10 or 20 years and involve thousands and thousands of interactions between different scientists. You know, how would you ever study that? VEDANTAM: How would you ever study that? Because Cailin can't follow all these interactions, she recreates them in a computer simulation. O'CONNOR: You'd want to think of it as a really kind of simplified representation of what's happening in the real world. VEDANTAM: She creates groups of fictional scientists, and she gives them a series of rules, like who they can talk to and who they trust. These simulated scientists collect data and discuss their simulated research. Cailin sits back and watches what happens. O'CONNOR: So one thing we find sometimes in these models is that one agent or scientist will get data supporting the false belief. They'll share it with the entire community of scientists. And then everyone will come to all believe the false thing at once and sort of ignore a better theory. And part of what happens there is this social spread of knowledge and belief causing everyone to turn away from a good theory. So if you have almost too much social influence within a community, that can be really bad because everyone can stop gathering data since the entire community is exposed to the same spurious results. VEDANTAM: If I hear you correctly, what you're saying is that psychological factors can have an effect, but you can have the spread of bad information even in the absence of biases or stupidity. O'CONNOR: Yeah. So one way that the models we look at are really useful is that you can kind of pare away things that are happening in the real world and see, well, suppose we didn't have any psychological biases. Suppose we were perfectly rational. Would we always come to the right answer in science and in our day-to-day lives and see that the answer is no? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Coming up - case studies from the world of supposedly rational scientific communities that show how good information sometimes fails to spread and how bad information can metastasize. I'm Shankar Vedantam, and this is NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. Mathematician and philosopher Cailin O'Connor studies how information spreads through social networks. People who know and trust one another efficiently pass information back and forth and learn from one another. Unfortunately, the same rules of social trust can sometimes be a roadblock for the truth. Mary Wortley Montagu learned this lesson hundreds of years ago. She was an English aristocrat who found herself living for a while in what is modern-day Turkey. O'CONNOR: So Mary Montagu seems to have been really enchanted by Turkish culture. You know, she was coming from England, an aristocratic culture there. In Turkey, she discovered these beautiful shopping centers, bath houses. She seemed to be - have been enchanted by bath houses where there would be a lot of women sort of lounging naked going in the hot water, drinking hot drinks together. VEDANTAM: Another thing that struck Mary about Turkish women - they used an innovative technique to limit the spread of smallpox. It was called variolation. O'CONNOR: What this involved - I mean, it's a bit like vaccination now. You would scratch maybe the arm of a patient and take pus from a smallpox pustule and put that pus into the scratch. So what would happen after you did that is that the patient would get a very mild smallpox infection. Some small percentage of patients would die but many, many fewer than who would die of an actual smallpox infection. And after they had that more mild infection, they would actually be immune to smallpox. So this was practiced commonly in Turkey - basically unheard of in England at the time. Mary Montagu had herself had smallpox and survived when she was younger. She had lost a brother to smallpox. And so when she encountered variolation in Turkey, she decided, well, you know, why don't we do this in England? She had her own son variolated, and she decided she was going to try to spread this practice in her native country. VEDANTAM: So when she returns to Britain, in some ways, Mary Montagu here functions like one of your agents in your computer models because you have, you know, one cluster over here in Turkey and one cluster over here in Britain. And essentially, you have an agent walking over from Turkey to Britain. And Mary Montagu says here's this wonderful idea. We can limit the spread of smallpox in Britain. Britain, in fact, at the time, was actually facing a smallpox crisis. How were her ideas received? O'CONNOR: So her ideas were not received very well when she first came back. One thing we talk a lot about in the book is that almost everyone has what you might call a conformist bias. We don't like to publicly state things that are different from the people in our social networks. We don't like to have beliefs that are different from the people around us. It's somehow very socially uncomfortable to do that. And we don't like our actions to not conform with the people who we know and love. So when she got back to England, you know, it was already the case that all these physicians in England didn't believe in variolation. They thought this was a crazy idea. And none of them were going to stand out from the pack of physicians and say, yeah, I'm the person who's going to try this or going to believe that this practice works because they were all busy conforming with each other. VEDANTAM: And, of course, these ideas were coming from another country, a country with very different cultural practices that seemed in some ways very foreign. The idea and the country itself seemed very foreign. O'CONNOR: That's right. So it's not just that it's a weird, new idea that none of them believe in their kind of in-group. It's also that it's coming from Turkey. And furthermore, it's coming from women in Turkey, so it was a practice mostly done by women. And a woman is bringing it to England as well, so they also don't really trust her as a woman and someone who's not a physician. So social trust is a really important aspect in understanding how people form beliefs. Because we can't go out and figure out ourselves whether the things people tell us are true, usually we just always have to decide who to trust. And people have little shortcuts in how they do this. They tend to trust those who are more like them. They also tend to trust those who share beliefs and values and practices with them. So, for example, if you are a physician, you might tend to trust a physician. If you believe in homeopathy, you might tend to trust someone who believes in homeopathy. We all use these kinds of tricks. So what we saw in the variolation case with Mary Montagu, the physicians aren't going to trust this woman who doesn't share their beliefs and practices, who isn't much like them. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Now, you could argue that the physicians who rejected Mary Montagu's ideas were not behaving like real scientists. They weren't being dispassionate. They weren't being objective. They were bringing psychological biases into the picture - sexism, xenophobia, tribalism. In the real world, misinformation spreads because of some combination of network effects and psychological and cognitive biases. You see the same thing in the case of the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis. He was an insider, a man and a doctor. He even had the assistance of scientific evidence to support his claims. But it turned out even these were not enough to overcome the barriers that confront the truth. O'CONNOR: Ignaz Semmelweis was a physician living in Vienna. He was put in charge of this clinic, the first obstetrical clinic in Vienna. Next door was the second obstetrical clinic of Vienna. He was in charge of training new doctors in obstetrics, and at the second clinic, they were training midwives. And shortly after he took over, he realized that something really terrible was going on because in his clinic, 10% of the women were dying, mostly of childbed fever, while the midwives next door who presumably, you know, they would have thought they were - less expertise - only 3 to 4% of their patients were dying. So Semmelweis was obviously really worried about this. He had patients who would be begging on their knees to be transferred to the other clinic. He had this kind of breakthrough moment when a colleague of his was conducting an autopsy and accidentally cut himself. And then shortly thereafter, he died of something that looked a lot like childbed fever. Semmelweis realized, well, I've got all these physicians who are conducting autopsies on cadavers and then immediately going and delivering babies. And he thought, well, maybe there's something transferred on their hands, and he called this cadaverous particles. Of course, now we know that that is bacteria, but they didn't have a theory of bacteria at the time. So he started requiring the physicians to wash their hands in a chlorinated solution, and the death rate in his clinic dropped way down. VEDANTAM: And, of course, the way we think about science, we say, all right, we have - someone's discovered something wonderful. Everyone must have instantly adopted this brilliant, new idea. O'CONNOR: You would think, right? And he has this wonderful evidence, right? It was 10%, he introduced the practice, goes down to 3%. But that's not what happened. So he published his ideas, and the other gentleman physicians did not take them up. In fact, they found them kind of offensive. They thought this is - you know, he's writing that we have dirty hands, we have unclean hands, but in fact, we're gentlemen. They also thought it was just really far out of the range of theories that could possibly be true, so they didn't believe him despite the really good evidence and the deep importance. You know, people's lives were really at stake. And it took decades for his handwashing practice to actually spread. VEDANTAM: In fact, I understand that Semmelweis himself eventually suffered a nervous breakdown. How did his own story end? O'CONNOR: So the way the story goes - though this is a little hard to verify - is that he was so frustrated that people weren't adopting his handwashing practice that he had a nervous breakdown as a result. He was put into a Viennese mental hospital where he was beaten by guards and died of blood poisoning a few weeks later. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: We've seen how being an outsider or breaking with tradition can be barriers to the spread of a good scientific information, but you could argue that these examples were from a long-gone era of gentlemen physicians and amateur scientists. But even in the modern day of science, where researchers demand hard evidence to be convinced, it turns out that false, inaccurate and incomplete information can still take hold. In 1954, E. D. Palmer published a paper that changed how doctors thought about stomach ulcers. O'CONNOR: So what he did was looked at a lot of stomachs, I believe somewhere in the range of a thousand, and he found that there were no bacteria whatsoever in the stomachs that he investigated. A lot of people at that time had been arguing over whether stomach ulcers were caused by stomach acid or some kind of bacteria. This was taken as really decisive evidence showing that OK, well, it can't be bacteria because everyone thought Palmer's study showed there are no bacteria in stomachs, so it absolutely must be stomach acid. VEDANTAM: And, of course, in this case, Palmer was not trying to fabricate his data or make up data. He was sincerely arriving at what he thought was a very good conclusion. O'CONNOR: That's right. And it seems that it just was a problem with his methodology. Of course, there are bacteria in our stomachs. He just didn't see them because of the way he was doing his particular experiment. This was not a fabrication at all. VEDANTAM: One of the things that's interesting about this episode involving Palmer and the stomach ulcers is that as individuals essentially came over to believe what Palmer was telling them, there was a consensus that started to grow. And as each new person added to the consensus, it became a little bit stronger, which made it even harder to challenge. O'CONNOR: Yeah. So although they had been arguing for decades about whether ulcers were caused by acid or by bacteria, at this point people started to share Palmer's results. Pretty much everybody saw them. And this consensus was arrived at. OK, it's acid. And everyone who had been studying the possibility that bacteria caused stomach ulcers stopped studying that. VEDANTAM: Well, not everyone. Fast-forward a few decades to the early 1980s. In Australia, a physician named Barry Marshall grew skeptical of the acid theory. His experiment suggested that ulcers were caused by bacteria, not stomach acid. But this theory was met with stony-faced resistance. He couldn't even get his articles published. Scientists sniped at him behind his back even though, as it turned out, his data was far better than the stomach studies by E. D. Palmer. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Coming up - what Barry Marshall did to fight misinformation and what we can learn from his story about how to spread the truth. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Barry Marshall was frustrated that no one seemed willing to listen to his findings. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BARRY MARSHALL: People were bleeding in my practice and dying from ulcers in my hospital. I could see it. VEDANTAM: So he figured out a way to get everyone's attention. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARSHALL: The only person in the world at that time who could make an informed consent was me. So I had to be in my own experiment. O'CONNOR: And so he did this demonstration. VEDANTAM: He took bacteria from the stomach of one of his sick patients. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARSHALL: So we cultured a patient with gastritis. VEDANTAM: He stirred it into a broth and then. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARSHALL: I drank the bacteria - 10 to the ninth colony-forming units. O'CONNOR: He gave himself stomach ulcers. And then he later cured them with antibiotics in this publicity stunt, almost, to convince people that, in fact, ulcers were caused by bacteria. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Eventually, Barry Marshall and Robin Warren went on to win the Nobel Prize in medicine for their discoveries. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Mary Montagu, the woman who faced resistance in bringing variolation to England, never won a prestigious prize, but she also found a way to spread the truth. Like Barry Marshall, she found it had more to do with her sales pitch than with the evidence. O'CONNOR: So in the end, she did something really smart, which took advantage of the ways that we use our social connections to ground our beliefs and our trust. So she ended up convincing Princess Caroline of Ansbach to variolate her own two small daughters and to do it in this kind of public way. So she got one of the most influential people in the entire country to engage in this practice. So that did two things. So No. 1, it made clear, you know, because she did in this kind of public way and her daughters were fine, it gave people evidence that this is, in fact, a safe practice, and it's a good idea. But it also made clear to people that if they want to conform to the norm, if they want to share a practice with this really influential person, then they should do the same thing. And after Princess Caroline did this, variolation spread much more quickly, especially among people who had a personal connection to either Mary Montagu or to the princess. VEDANTAM: What's fascinating here is that this wasn't, in some ways, a rational way to solve the problem. It wasn't saying, look; there's really convincing evidence here. You're almost using a technique that's pretty close to propaganda. O'CONNOR: It is a propaganda technique. Absolutely. So propagandists tend to be very savvy about the ways that people use their social connections to ground trust and knowledge and choose their beliefs. And they take advantage of those. In this case, it was using those - that social trust for good. But in many cases, people use it for bad. And if you look at the history of industrial propaganda in the U. S. or if you look at the way Russia conducted propaganda before the last election, people have taken advantage of these kinds of social ties and beliefs to try to convince us of whatever it is they're selling. VEDANTAM: One last idea in how you counter bad information, Semmelweis, as we saw, did not succeed in persuading other doctors during his lifetime to wash their hands thoroughly before they were treating patients. But, of course, now that idea is widely adopted. What does that tell us, Cailin, about how science in some ways might be self-correcting? It might not be self-correcting at the pace that we want, but over time, it appears that good ideas do beat out the bad ones. O'CONNOR: Yeah, so we have thousands and thousands of examples in science of exactly that happening, of good ideas beating out the bad ones. Of course, now we can look back and say, oh, well, that good idea won out and that good idea won out. We can't actually look at right now and know which of the ideas we believe now are correct ones or good ones. So there are actually philosophers of science like Larry Laudan and Kyle Stanford who argue for something called the pessimistic meta-induction, which is something like this - because scientific theories in the past have always eventually been overturned, we ought to think that our theories now will probably be overturned as well. But there is actually an optimistic side to this, which is that if you look at many theories in the past, ones that were overturned, often the reason people believed them is that even if they were wrong, they were a good guide to action. Even the theory of stomach acid causing ulcers - well, if you treat stomach acid, it actually does help with ulcers. You know, it wasn't a completely unsuccessful theory. It's just that it wasn't totally right, and it wasn't as successful as the bacteria theory of ulcers because antibiotics do better. VEDANTAM: One of the interesting implications about all of this is how we should think about the truth. And in some ways, I think the picture that I'm getting from you is a picture that says the truth is not a binary question. It's not, you know, is it true, is it false? I mean, some questions, of course, perhaps can be reduced to is it true, is it false? But, really, science is in the business of producing probability estimates for various claims. And I think what you're saying is that for us to actually be on the right side of the misinformation information divide, it's helpful for us to think in probabilistic terms rather than in binary terms. O'CONNOR: Yeah, that's absolutely right. So we do think it's really important to think about belief in terms of degrees and evidence and believing something strongly enough. And part of the reason is that there has been this strategy where people who are trying to subvert our beliefs will say, but we're not sure about something. They'll say, evolution is just a theory or there's some doubt about global warming. But, ultimately, not being sure about something is not what matters. We're never really 100% sure about anything. I mean, if you think about, think about any belief you could have - you know, that the sun will come up tomorrow. Well, it always has in the past, but that doesn't mean that 100% sure it will tomorrow. There's a really good chance it will tomorrow. We shouldn't be looking for certainty. Instead, we need to be saying to ourselves when do we have enough evidence to make good decisions? VEDANTAM: Cailin O'Connor is a philosopher and mathematician at the University of California, Irvine. She studies how social networks can spread both good information and bad. Along with James Weatherall, she is co-author of the book \"The Misinformation Age: How False Beliefs Spread. \" Cailin, thank you for joining me today on HIDDEN BRAIN.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST:  This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. In 2012, Maranda Dynda had a lot on her plate. She was 18. All her friends were getting ready for college and busy being teenagers, but Maranda was on a different path. She was pregnant. MARANDA DYNDA: So I was very nervous, and I felt really uneasy but excited at the same time. VEDANTAM: To calm her anxieties, Maranda did some research on childbirth. DYNDA: I decided I wanted a home birth. VEDANTAM: For that, she would need a midwife. She searched for months for someone who could come to her apartment in rural Pennsylvania. Eventually, she found a woman who seemed perfect. We'll call her M, her first initial, to protect her privacy. From the very first moment they met, Maranda knew everything was going to be fine. DYNDA: She said she had been a home birth midwife for over a decade. VEDANTAM: She was no nonsense, the mother of eight. DYNDA: She was very open and honest and friendly, so she definitely seemed like someone who I could trust. VEDANTAM: About an hour into that first meeting, M brought up a question that struck Maranda as strange. DYNDA: She said, have you ever considered not vaccinating? VEDANTAM: Maranda hadn't. Vaccines had never crossed her mind. DYNDA: So I asked her - you know, I was very confused. I was like, what do you mean you - why would I consider that? VEDANTAM: M explained that, years ago, something bad had happened after she vaccinated her first child. She went on to describe a progression of events that lead some parents to a powerful but faulty conclusion. M told Maranda that right after her son got his shots, his development regressed. One minute, he was fine; the next, he was autistic. She said the light had left his eyes, so M decided not to vaccinate her other children. DYNDA: And she very much implored me to do the same and to look into it, so I did. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Maranda started on Google. It led her to Facebook groups. DYNDA: It's very easy to find them. So, yeah, even if you just Google, you know, support groups for parents who don't vaccinate, you will find a lot. VEDANTAM: The moms in these groups echoed what M had told her. DYNDA: And they welcomed me with open arms and immediately were just practically bombarding me with information, telling me your midwife's right, this is why you shouldn't vaccinate, this is why I don't vaccinate, this is what happened to my child who I did vaccinate versus my child who I didn't vaccinate - things like that. VEDANTAM: Everyone was caring and attentive. They didn't just talk about vaccines. They talked about regular mom stuff, things that Maranda found hard to talk about with anyone else. DYNDA: Diapers and birth plans and hospitals and midwives and breast pumps and stuff like that. VEDANTAM: Maranda trusted them. DYNDA: To me, it seemed so clear. It seemed like I had just found this secret information that only some people come across. And I thought, why would I not use this information? Why would I not use this to my benefit, to my child's benefit? So it did not take me very long at all before I was solidly saying I will not vaccinate my child when she is born. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TO RAMONA\") BOB DYLAN: (Singing) Ramona, come closer, shut softly your watery eyes. VEDANTAM: She named her daughter Ramona after the song by Bob Dylan. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TO RAMONA\") DYLAN: (Singing) The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise. DYNDA: Ramona, as a newborn, she was very active. She was very bright. She was very happy. She was a great baby, honestly. She was a wonderful baby. VEDANTAM: When the doctors said it was time to vaccinate Ramona, Maranda was ready. She had a script she'd been practicing in her head for months. DYNDA: And I said, no, thank you. We - I have decided that I do not want to vaccinate. Please, respect my opinions. Thank you very much. VEDANTAM: For the next two years, Maranda continued to say no to vaccines. Occasionally, when she encountered information that conflicted with her decision, a pamphlet at the doctor's office, a website, she dismissed it. DYNDA: I just very quickly went, that's not true. I don't agree with that. And I moved on. VEDANTAM: At some point, though, her conviction started to waver. Those doting moms on Facebook, they had some weird beliefs. DYNDA: People denying that AIDS exists, people saying that the reason there's gay people is vaccines - on and on and on with really crazy conspiracy theories. VEDANTAM: And then it hit her. If she didn't believe those ideas, why was she trusting them on vaccines? DYNDA: And I stepped back. I stopped going to the Facebook group as much, and I decided I needed to look at this issue from a purely logical perspective - no emotion in it, no, oh, my God, what if something happens to my baby? And I completely readdressed the issue all over again pretty much from the start. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Maranda started seeking out perspectives that the moms had urged her to avoid - information from the Centers for Disease Control and medical journals. DYNDA: I started reading all kinds of things, basically opening my mind to more than just vaccines are bad to the other side of the coin. VEDANTAM: It didn't take her long to change her mind. She got Ramona vaccinated. Looking back, Maranda can't believe how easy it was to embrace beliefs that were false. DYNDA: And what I would say to someone who's about to become a new mom, especially if they're a young mom, is don't try to confirm your own fears online. It is so, so easy to Google, what if this happens, and find something that's probably not true that confirms your fear, that confirms your anxieties. Don't do that. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Maranda's story tells us a lot about the psychology of false beliefs, how they spread and how they persist even in the face of conflicting information. This week, we look at how we rely on people we trust to shape what we believe and why emotions can be more powerful than facts. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Tali Sharot is a professor at University College London. She is the author of \"The Influential Mind: What The Brain Reveals About Our Power To Change Others. \" Tali is a mom and so she understands on a personal level why Maranda was so worried about the safety of her child. A few years ago, when her baby was just a few weeks old, Tali was listening to a Republican presidential debate. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You take this little, beautiful baby and you pump - I mean, it looks just like it's meant for a horse, not for a child. VEDANTAM: Candidate Donald Trump had been asked a question about the safety of childhood vaccines. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: And we've had so many instances, people that work for me, just the other day, 2 years old, 2 1/2 years old, a child, a beautiful child, went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic. TALI SHAROT: So when I was listening to Trump at that debate, it really tapped into this fear that I had and the anxiety that I already had. And when he talked about this huge syringe, a horse-sized syringe that was going to go into the baby, in my mind, I could imagine this syringe inserted into my small, little child and all the bad things that could happen. And this was a very irrational reaction on my end because I know that there is not an actual link between autism and vaccines. But it's not enough to have the data. Ben Carson - Dr. Ben Carson - was on the other end. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BEN CARSON: Well, let me put it this way. There has - there have been numerous studies, and they have not demonstrated that there is any correlation between vaccinations and autism. SHAROT: But that wasn't enough because the data is not enough. And even if the data is based on very good science, it has to be communicated in a way that would really tap into people's needs, their desires. If people are afraid, we should address that. VEDANTAM: I'm curious. When you sort of contrasted, you know, the weight of the evidence on the one hand and this very powerful image of the horse syringe and your 7-week-old baby on the other hand, how did you talk yourself into trusting the data over that emotional image? SHAROT: What really helped is that I understood what was happening to me. Because this is what I study, I knew what my reaction was. I knew where it was coming from. I knew how it was going to affect me. And I think that awareness helped me to put it aside and say, OK, I know that I am anxious for the wrong reasons, and this is the action that I should take. It's a little bit when you're on a plane and there's turbulence and you get scared but telling yourself I know that turbulence is not actually anything that's dangerous, I know the statistics on safety in planes and so on, it helps. It helps people reduce their anxiety. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: But facts don't always relieve our anxieties. Sometimes they harden our views. Some time ago, Tali wanted to test how people update their beliefs when confronted with new information. So she presented statements to two kinds of people - those who believe that climate change was real and those who were deniers. She found that for both groups, when the statement confirmed what they already thought, this strengthened their beliefs. But when it challenged their views, they ignored it. Tali says it's because of a powerful phenomenon known as confirmation bias. SHAROT: Confirmation bias is our tendency to take in any kind of data that confirms our prior convictions and to disregard data that does not conform to what we already believe. And when we see data that doesn't conform to what we believe, what we do is we try to distance ourselves from it. We say, well, that data is not credible, right? It's not good evidence for what it's saying. So we're trying to reframe it to discredit it. All right. So I give an example in my book where if someone comes in and says, I just saw pink elephants flying in the sky and I have a very strong belief obviously that no pink elephants fly in the sky, I would then think that they're either delusional or they're lying. And there's good reason for me to believe that. So it's actually the correct approach to assess data in light of what you believe. There's four factors that determine whether we're going to change our beliefs - our old belief, our confidence in that old belief, the new piece of data and our confidence in that piece of data. And the further away the piece of data is from what you already believe, the less likely it is to change your belief. And on average, as you go about the world, that is not a bad approach. However, it also means that it's really hard to change false beliefs. So if someone holds a belief very strongly but it is a false belief, it's very hard to change it with data. VEDANTAM: So if data and facts don't work, what does? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: How do you get people to buy the truth? Well, you could try scaring them. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) RUDY GIULIANI: The vast majority of Americans today do not feel safe. HILLARY CLINTON: On Sunday, Americans woke up to a nightmare that's become mind-numbingly familiar. TRUMP: This could be the great Trojan horse of all time. VEDANTAM: Politicians use fear to get us to vote. TV programs use fear to get us to keep watching. Public health officials use fear to get us to quit smoking. I ask Tali whether fear might be an effective way to persuade people to change their minds and maybe even their behavior. SHAROT: Fear works in two situations. It works when people are already stressed out. And it also works when what you're trying to do is get someone not to do something, an inaction. For example, if you try to get someone not to vaccinate their kids, fear may work. If there's, you know, an apple that looks bad, I don't eat it. Fear is actually not such a good motivator for inducing action, while hope is a better motivator, on average, for motivating action. VEDANTAM: You talk about one study in your book where a hospital managed to get its workers to practice hand hygiene to get staff members to wash their hands regularly. But it turned out the most effective thing wasn't frightening the staff about the risks of transmitting infections. It was something else. SHAROT: So in a hospital on the East Coast, a camera was installed to see how often medical staff actually sanitize their hand before and after entering a patient's room. And the medical staff knew that the camera was installed and yet only 1 in 10 medical staff sanitized their hands before and after entering a patient's room. But then an intervention was introduced - an electronic board that was put above each door, and it gave the medical staff in real time positive feedback. It showed them the percentage of medical staff that wash their hands in the current shift and the weekly rate as well. So anytime a medical staff will wash their hands, the numbers will immediately go up and there will be a positive feedback saying, you know, good job. And that affected the likelihood of people washing their hands significantly. It went up from 10% to 90%, and it stayed there. Instead of using the normal approach, instead of saying, you know, you have to wash your hands because otherwise you'll spread the disease - basically instead of warning them of all the bad things that can happen in the future, which actually results in inaction, they gave them positive feedback. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: I wrapped up my conversation with Tali by exploring another idea about how we might convince others to listen to views that conflict with their own. It had to do with a study of Princeton students who got their brains scanned while they listened to stirring, emotional speeches. SHAROT: What they found was the brains of the different people listening to those speeches started synchronizing. So if we all listen, for example, to Kennedy's famous moon speech, our brains would likely look very much alike. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN F KENNEDY: Those who came before us made certain that this country rode the first waves of the Industrial Revolution. SHAROT: And this is not only in regions that are important for language and hearing. It's also in regions that are important for emotion, in regions that are important for what's known as theory of mind - our ability to think about what other people are thinking - in regions that are important for associations. And you try to think, well, what's common to all these influential speeches that can cause so many people's activity to synchronize? And one of the most important things is emotion. If the storyteller or the person giving the speech is able to elicit emotion in the other person, then he's actually having somewhat of a control on that person's state of mind. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KENNEDY: And this generation does not intend to founder in the backwash of the coming age of space. We mean to be a part of it. We mean to lead it. (APPLAUSE) SHAROT: So think about it like this. If you're very sad and I'm telling you a joke, well, you're sad, so you're not going to perceive the joke as I perceive it when I'm happy. But if I'm able to first make you happy and then tell you the joke, well, then you'll perceive it more from my point of view. So by eliciting emotion, what you're able to do is change the perception of everything that comes after - to perceive information as the person who's giving this speech wants you to perceive it. VEDANTAM: So you can see how this coupling, this idea that the audience's mind and the speaker's mind are in some ways coupled together, you can see how this could potentially be used to spread good information. You know, you have a great teacher in high school and you're captivated by the teacher and you're being pulled along by the story the teacher is telling you, maybe about history or maybe about geography. But you can also see equally how the same thing can work in the opposite direction, that you could be listening to a demagogue or you could be listening to somebody who has a very sort of captivating rhetorical style. And this person could also lead you astray in just the same way that the great teacher can lead you to knowledge and to positive things. SHAROT: Absolutely. All the different factors that affect whether we will be influenced by one person or ignore another person are the same whether the person has good intentions or bad intentions, right? The factors that affect whether you're influential can be can you elicit emotion in the other person? Can you tell a story? Are you taking into account the state of mind of the person that's in front of you? Are you giving them data that confirms to their preconceived notions? All those factors that make one speech more influential than the other or more likely to create an impact can be used for good and can be used for bad. VEDANTAM: Tali Sharot, I want to thank you for joining me on HIDDEN BRAIN today. SHAROT: Thank you so much for having me. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: We've been exploring why we cling to beliefs. After the break, we look at how we spread them, from person to person to person. We'll talk to a mathematician about the power of social networks to circulate ideas. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. During the Middle Ages, word spread to Europe about a peculiar plant found in Asia. This plant had a long stalk with heavy pods attached. When you cut those pods open, inside you would find a tiny little lamb. (SOUNDBITE OF LAMB BLEATING) CAILIN O'CONNOR: Complete with flesh and wool like a live animal lamb. (SOUNDBITE OF LAMB BLEATING) VEDANTAM: This creature, half plant, half animal, came to be known as the Vegetable Lamb of Tartary. O'CONNOR: Various travel writers wrote that they had either heard about this or that they had eaten one of these lambs. And many of them said they had sawn the kind of downy wool from the lamb. VEDANTAM: When these narratives made their way to Europe, people felt they had a view of a different world. Of course, no one in Europe had ever seen the Vegetable Lamb of Tartary because there was no such thing. But for centuries, people kept talking about this fantastical creature as if it were real. It even came up in scholarly works right next to pictures of oak trees and rabbits. O'CONNOR: If people hadn't been telling each other about these things, nobody would believe that there were vegetable lambs because nobody had ever seen them, right? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) O'CONNOR: And this is, by no means, a unique happening at that time. VEDANTAM: At that time. Of course, we would never fall for vegetable lambs. We live in an era of science, of evidence-based reasoning, of calm, cool analysis. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: But maybe there are vegetable lambs that persist even today even among highly trained scientists, physicians and researchers. Maybe there are spectacularly bad ideas that we haven't yet recognized as spectacularly bad. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Cailin O'Connor is a philosopher and mathematician at the University of California, Irvine. She studies how information, both good and bad, can pass from person to person. She is co-author with James Weatherall of the book \"The Misinformation Age: How False Beliefs Spread. \" Cailin, welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. O'CONNOR: Oh, thank you for having me. VEDANTAM: So one of the fundamental premises in your book is that human beings are extremely dependent on the opinions and knowledge of other people. And this is what creates channels for fake news to flourish and spread. Let's talk about this idea. Can you give me some sense of our dependence on what you call the testimony of others? O'CONNOR: So one reason we wrote this book is that we noticed that a lot of people thinking about fake news and false belief were thinking about problems with individual psychology, so the way we have biases and processing information, the fact that we're bad at probability. But if you think about the things you believe, almost every single belief you have has come from another person. And that's just where we get our beliefs because we're social animals. And that's really wonderful for us. That's why we have culture and technology. You know, that's how we went to the moon. But if you imagine this social spread of beliefs as opening a door, when you open a door for true beliefs to spread from person to person, you also open the door for false beliefs to spread from person to person. So it's this kind of double-sided coin. VEDANTAM: And what's interesting, of course, is that if you close the door, you close the door to both, and if you open the door, you open the door to both. O'CONNOR: That's right. So if you want to be social learners who can do the kinds of cultural things we can do, it has to be the case that you also have to have this channel by which you can spread falsehood and misinformation, too. VEDANTAM: So as I was reading the book, I was reflecting on the things that I know or the things that I think I know, and I couldn't come up with a good answer for how I actually know that it's the Earth that revolves around the sun and not the other way around. O'CONNOR: Yeah. That's right. Ninety-nine percent of the things you believe probably you have no direct evidence of yourself. You have to trust other people to find those things out, get the evidence and tell it to you. And so one thing that we talk a lot about in the book is the fact that we all have to ground our beliefs in social trust. So we have to decide what sources and what people we trust and therefore what beliefs we're going to take up because there's just this problem where we cannot go verify everything that we learned directly. We have to trust someone else to do that for us. VEDANTAM: We trust the historian who teaches us about Christopher Columbus. We trust the images from NASA showing how our solar system is organized. Now, we say we know Columbus was Italian, and we know the Earth revolves around the sun. But, really, what we mean to say is we trust the teacher, and we trust NASA to tell us what is true. O'CONNOR: And the social trust and ability to spread beliefs, I mean, it's remarkable what it's let humans do. You know, no other animal has this ability to sort of transfer ideas and knowledge dependably from person to person over generation after generation to accumulate that knowledge. But you do just see sometimes very funny examples of false beliefs being spread in the same way. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: As a philosopher of science, Cailin studies how scientists communicate and share information. If we rely on scientists to tell us what to believe, who do they rely on? Turns out, other scientists. Now, showing that this is the case isn't easy. The process by which scientists change their minds on questions such as the spread of disease or the movement of objects through space is very complex. Studying this complex process can be mind-boggling. Say, for instance, Dr. A. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Hello? VEDANTAM: . . . Talks to doctor B one day about her research. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Hello. VEDANTAM: It also turns out that Dr. B is collaborating with Dr. C who recently met Dr. D at a conference. Now, Dr. D frequently reads Dr. A's papers but doesn't know about Dr. C's research. A couple of years later, Dr. E reads what Dr. B has written about what Dr. A said in an article that Dr. C cited before Dr. F had even published her results. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) O'CONNOR: Empirically, it's hard to study scientists because things like theory change will happen over the course of 10 or 20 years and involve thousands and thousands of interactions between different scientists. You know, how would you ever study that? VEDANTAM: How would you ever study that? Because Cailin can't follow all these interactions, she recreates them in a computer simulation. O'CONNOR: You'd want to think of it as a really kind of simplified representation of what's happening in the real world. VEDANTAM: She creates groups of fictional scientists, and she gives them a series of rules, like who they can talk to and who they trust. These simulated scientists collect data and discuss their simulated research. Cailin sits back and watches what happens. O'CONNOR: So one thing we find sometimes in these models is that one agent or scientist will get data supporting the false belief. They'll share it with the entire community of scientists. And then everyone will come to all believe the false thing at once and sort of ignore a better theory. And part of what happens there is this social spread of knowledge and belief causing everyone to turn away from a good theory. So if you have almost too much social influence within a community, that can be really bad because everyone can stop gathering data since the entire community is exposed to the same spurious results. VEDANTAM: If I hear you correctly, what you're saying is that psychological factors can have an effect, but you can have the spread of bad information even in the absence of biases or stupidity. O'CONNOR: Yeah. So one way that the models we look at are really useful is that you can kind of pare away things that are happening in the real world and see, well, suppose we didn't have any psychological biases. Suppose we were perfectly rational. Would we always come to the right answer in science and in our day-to-day lives and see that the answer is no? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Coming up - case studies from the world of supposedly rational scientific communities that show how good information sometimes fails to spread and how bad information can metastasize. I'm Shankar Vedantam, and this is NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. Mathematician and philosopher Cailin O'Connor studies how information spreads through social networks. People who know and trust one another efficiently pass information back and forth and learn from one another. Unfortunately, the same rules of social trust can sometimes be a roadblock for the truth. Mary Wortley Montagu learned this lesson hundreds of years ago. She was an English aristocrat who found herself living for a while in what is modern-day Turkey. O'CONNOR: So Mary Montagu seems to have been really enchanted by Turkish culture. You know, she was coming from England, an aristocratic culture there. In Turkey, she discovered these beautiful shopping centers, bath houses. She seemed to be - have been enchanted by bath houses where there would be a lot of women sort of lounging naked going in the hot water, drinking hot drinks together. VEDANTAM: Another thing that struck Mary about Turkish women - they used an innovative technique to limit the spread of smallpox. It was called variolation. O'CONNOR: What this involved - I mean, it's a bit like vaccination now. You would scratch maybe the arm of a patient and take pus from a smallpox pustule and put that pus into the scratch. So what would happen after you did that is that the patient would get a very mild smallpox infection. Some small percentage of patients would die but many, many fewer than who would die of an actual smallpox infection. And after they had that more mild infection, they would actually be immune to smallpox. So this was practiced commonly in Turkey - basically unheard of in England at the time. Mary Montagu had herself had smallpox and survived when she was younger. She had lost a brother to smallpox. And so when she encountered variolation in Turkey, she decided, well, you know, why don't we do this in England? She had her own son variolated, and she decided she was going to try to spread this practice in her native country. VEDANTAM: So when she returns to Britain, in some ways, Mary Montagu here functions like one of your agents in your computer models because you have, you know, one cluster over here in Turkey and one cluster over here in Britain. And essentially, you have an agent walking over from Turkey to Britain. And Mary Montagu says here's this wonderful idea. We can limit the spread of smallpox in Britain. Britain, in fact, at the time, was actually facing a smallpox crisis. How were her ideas received? O'CONNOR: So her ideas were not received very well when she first came back. One thing we talk a lot about in the book is that almost everyone has what you might call a conformist bias. We don't like to publicly state things that are different from the people in our social networks. We don't like to have beliefs that are different from the people around us. It's somehow very socially uncomfortable to do that. And we don't like our actions to not conform with the people who we know and love. So when she got back to England, you know, it was already the case that all these physicians in England didn't believe in variolation. They thought this was a crazy idea. And none of them were going to stand out from the pack of physicians and say, yeah, I'm the person who's going to try this or going to believe that this practice works because they were all busy conforming with each other. VEDANTAM: And, of course, these ideas were coming from another country, a country with very different cultural practices that seemed in some ways very foreign. The idea and the country itself seemed very foreign. O'CONNOR: That's right. So it's not just that it's a weird, new idea that none of them believe in their kind of in-group. It's also that it's coming from Turkey. And furthermore, it's coming from women in Turkey, so it was a practice mostly done by women. And a woman is bringing it to England as well, so they also don't really trust her as a woman and someone who's not a physician. So social trust is a really important aspect in understanding how people form beliefs. Because we can't go out and figure out ourselves whether the things people tell us are true, usually we just always have to decide who to trust. And people have little shortcuts in how they do this. They tend to trust those who are more like them. They also tend to trust those who share beliefs and values and practices with them. So, for example, if you are a physician, you might tend to trust a physician. If you believe in homeopathy, you might tend to trust someone who believes in homeopathy. We all use these kinds of tricks. So what we saw in the variolation case with Mary Montagu, the physicians aren't going to trust this woman who doesn't share their beliefs and practices, who isn't much like them. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Now, you could argue that the physicians who rejected Mary Montagu's ideas were not behaving like real scientists. They weren't being dispassionate. They weren't being objective. They were bringing psychological biases into the picture - sexism, xenophobia, tribalism. In the real world, misinformation spreads because of some combination of network effects and psychological and cognitive biases. You see the same thing in the case of the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis. He was an insider, a man and a doctor. He even had the assistance of scientific evidence to support his claims. But it turned out even these were not enough to overcome the barriers that confront the truth. O'CONNOR: Ignaz Semmelweis was a physician living in Vienna. He was put in charge of this clinic, the first obstetrical clinic in Vienna. Next door was the second obstetrical clinic of Vienna. He was in charge of training new doctors in obstetrics, and at the second clinic, they were training midwives. And shortly after he took over, he realized that something really terrible was going on because in his clinic, 10% of the women were dying, mostly of childbed fever, while the midwives next door who presumably, you know, they would have thought they were - less expertise - only 3 to 4% of their patients were dying. So Semmelweis was obviously really worried about this. He had patients who would be begging on their knees to be transferred to the other clinic. He had this kind of breakthrough moment when a colleague of his was conducting an autopsy and accidentally cut himself. And then shortly thereafter, he died of something that looked a lot like childbed fever. Semmelweis realized, well, I've got all these physicians who are conducting autopsies on cadavers and then immediately going and delivering babies. And he thought, well, maybe there's something transferred on their hands, and he called this cadaverous particles. Of course, now we know that that is bacteria, but they didn't have a theory of bacteria at the time. So he started requiring the physicians to wash their hands in a chlorinated solution, and the death rate in his clinic dropped way down. VEDANTAM: And, of course, the way we think about science, we say, all right, we have - someone's discovered something wonderful. Everyone must have instantly adopted this brilliant, new idea. O'CONNOR: You would think, right? And he has this wonderful evidence, right? It was 10%, he introduced the practice, goes down to 3%. But that's not what happened. So he published his ideas, and the other gentleman physicians did not take them up. In fact, they found them kind of offensive. They thought this is - you know, he's writing that we have dirty hands, we have unclean hands, but in fact, we're gentlemen. They also thought it was just really far out of the range of theories that could possibly be true, so they didn't believe him despite the really good evidence and the deep importance. You know, people's lives were really at stake. And it took decades for his handwashing practice to actually spread. VEDANTAM: In fact, I understand that Semmelweis himself eventually suffered a nervous breakdown. How did his own story end? O'CONNOR: So the way the story goes - though this is a little hard to verify - is that he was so frustrated that people weren't adopting his handwashing practice that he had a nervous breakdown as a result. He was put into a Viennese mental hospital where he was beaten by guards and died of blood poisoning a few weeks later. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: We've seen how being an outsider or breaking with tradition can be barriers to the spread of a good scientific information, but you could argue that these examples were from a long-gone era of gentlemen physicians and amateur scientists. But even in the modern day of science, where researchers demand hard evidence to be convinced, it turns out that false, inaccurate and incomplete information can still take hold. In 1954, E. D. Palmer published a paper that changed how doctors thought about stomach ulcers. O'CONNOR: So what he did was looked at a lot of stomachs, I believe somewhere in the range of a thousand, and he found that there were no bacteria whatsoever in the stomachs that he investigated. A lot of people at that time had been arguing over whether stomach ulcers were caused by stomach acid or some kind of bacteria. This was taken as really decisive evidence showing that OK, well, it can't be bacteria because everyone thought Palmer's study showed there are no bacteria in stomachs, so it absolutely must be stomach acid. VEDANTAM: And, of course, in this case, Palmer was not trying to fabricate his data or make up data. He was sincerely arriving at what he thought was a very good conclusion. O'CONNOR: That's right. And it seems that it just was a problem with his methodology. Of course, there are bacteria in our stomachs. He just didn't see them because of the way he was doing his particular experiment. This was not a fabrication at all. VEDANTAM: One of the things that's interesting about this episode involving Palmer and the stomach ulcers is that as individuals essentially came over to believe what Palmer was telling them, there was a consensus that started to grow. And as each new person added to the consensus, it became a little bit stronger, which made it even harder to challenge. O'CONNOR: Yeah. So although they had been arguing for decades about whether ulcers were caused by acid or by bacteria, at this point people started to share Palmer's results. Pretty much everybody saw them. And this consensus was arrived at. OK, it's acid. And everyone who had been studying the possibility that bacteria caused stomach ulcers stopped studying that. VEDANTAM: Well, not everyone. Fast-forward a few decades to the early 1980s. In Australia, a physician named Barry Marshall grew skeptical of the acid theory. His experiment suggested that ulcers were caused by bacteria, not stomach acid. But this theory was met with stony-faced resistance. He couldn't even get his articles published. Scientists sniped at him behind his back even though, as it turned out, his data was far better than the stomach studies by E. D. Palmer. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Coming up - what Barry Marshall did to fight misinformation and what we can learn from his story about how to spread the truth. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Barry Marshall was frustrated that no one seemed willing to listen to his findings. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BARRY MARSHALL: People were bleeding in my practice and dying from ulcers in my hospital. I could see it. VEDANTAM: So he figured out a way to get everyone's attention. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARSHALL: The only person in the world at that time who could make an informed consent was me. So I had to be in my own experiment. O'CONNOR: And so he did this demonstration. VEDANTAM: He took bacteria from the stomach of one of his sick patients. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARSHALL: So we cultured a patient with gastritis. VEDANTAM: He stirred it into a broth and then. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARSHALL: I drank the bacteria - 10 to the ninth colony-forming units. O'CONNOR: He gave himself stomach ulcers. And then he later cured them with antibiotics in this publicity stunt, almost, to convince people that, in fact, ulcers were caused by bacteria. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Eventually, Barry Marshall and Robin Warren went on to win the Nobel Prize in medicine for their discoveries. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Mary Montagu, the woman who faced resistance in bringing variolation to England, never won a prestigious prize, but she also found a way to spread the truth. Like Barry Marshall, she found it had more to do with her sales pitch than with the evidence. O'CONNOR: So in the end, she did something really smart, which took advantage of the ways that we use our social connections to ground our beliefs and our trust. So she ended up convincing Princess Caroline of Ansbach to variolate her own two small daughters and to do it in this kind of public way. So she got one of the most influential people in the entire country to engage in this practice. So that did two things. So No. 1, it made clear, you know, because she did in this kind of public way and her daughters were fine, it gave people evidence that this is, in fact, a safe practice, and it's a good idea. But it also made clear to people that if they want to conform to the norm, if they want to share a practice with this really influential person, then they should do the same thing. And after Princess Caroline did this, variolation spread much more quickly, especially among people who had a personal connection to either Mary Montagu or to the princess. VEDANTAM: What's fascinating here is that this wasn't, in some ways, a rational way to solve the problem. It wasn't saying, look; there's really convincing evidence here. You're almost using a technique that's pretty close to propaganda. O'CONNOR: It is a propaganda technique. Absolutely. So propagandists tend to be very savvy about the ways that people use their social connections to ground trust and knowledge and choose their beliefs. And they take advantage of those. In this case, it was using those - that social trust for good. But in many cases, people use it for bad. And if you look at the history of industrial propaganda in the U. S. or if you look at the way Russia conducted propaganda before the last election, people have taken advantage of these kinds of social ties and beliefs to try to convince us of whatever it is they're selling. VEDANTAM: One last idea in how you counter bad information, Semmelweis, as we saw, did not succeed in persuading other doctors during his lifetime to wash their hands thoroughly before they were treating patients. But, of course, now that idea is widely adopted. What does that tell us, Cailin, about how science in some ways might be self-correcting? It might not be self-correcting at the pace that we want, but over time, it appears that good ideas do beat out the bad ones. O'CONNOR: Yeah, so we have thousands and thousands of examples in science of exactly that happening, of good ideas beating out the bad ones. Of course, now we can look back and say, oh, well, that good idea won out and that good idea won out. We can't actually look at right now and know which of the ideas we believe now are correct ones or good ones. So there are actually philosophers of science like Larry Laudan and Kyle Stanford who argue for something called the pessimistic meta-induction, which is something like this - because scientific theories in the past have always eventually been overturned, we ought to think that our theories now will probably be overturned as well. But there is actually an optimistic side to this, which is that if you look at many theories in the past, ones that were overturned, often the reason people believed them is that even if they were wrong, they were a good guide to action. Even the theory of stomach acid causing ulcers - well, if you treat stomach acid, it actually does help with ulcers. You know, it wasn't a completely unsuccessful theory. It's just that it wasn't totally right, and it wasn't as successful as the bacteria theory of ulcers because antibiotics do better. VEDANTAM: One of the interesting implications about all of this is how we should think about the truth. And in some ways, I think the picture that I'm getting from you is a picture that says the truth is not a binary question. It's not, you know, is it true, is it false? I mean, some questions, of course, perhaps can be reduced to is it true, is it false? But, really, science is in the business of producing probability estimates for various claims. And I think what you're saying is that for us to actually be on the right side of the misinformation information divide, it's helpful for us to think in probabilistic terms rather than in binary terms. O'CONNOR: Yeah, that's absolutely right. So we do think it's really important to think about belief in terms of degrees and evidence and believing something strongly enough. And part of the reason is that there has been this strategy where people who are trying to subvert our beliefs will say, but we're not sure about something. They'll say, evolution is just a theory or there's some doubt about global warming. But, ultimately, not being sure about something is not what matters. We're never really 100% sure about anything. I mean, if you think about, think about any belief you could have - you know, that the sun will come up tomorrow. Well, it always has in the past, but that doesn't mean that 100% sure it will tomorrow. There's a really good chance it will tomorrow. We shouldn't be looking for certainty. Instead, we need to be saying to ourselves when do we have enough evidence to make good decisions?

S. rivalry with China involves the way that China has obtained U. S. technology. And this year, the United States will likely add new restrictions on the export of certain technologies, a move that is mostly aimed at China. It is meant to help American companies, but it turns out it could also limit the ability of American firms to compete. Here's NPR's Emily Feng. EMILY FENG, BYLINE: The cybersecurity firm McAfee, known for its antivirus software, is constantly monitoring the Internet, searching for the next big threat. The company's chief technology officer, Steve Grobman, explains. STEVE GROBMAN: We actually have a billion sensors deployed around the world that allows us to see new threats, track where they go. FENG: Now McAfee is one of thousands of American technology companies at the frontlines of a global tech rivalry between the U. S. and China. Grobman says the Trump administration's plans to update export controls, which would restrict U. S. companies from exporting sensitive technologies, could give the bad guys the upper hand. GROBMAN: They're going to use the best technology that they can get their hands on in order to create the most malicious capabilities that would potentially impact our customers. FENG: Those controls are the most ambitious measures thus far, aimed at shutting down Chinese hackers and companies stealing technology to get ahead. That theft is a key sticking point in ongoing trade talks between Beijing and Washington to resolve a nearly one-year trade war. In November, the administration sought comment on possible new export controls for emerging and foundational technologies, technologies core to cutting-edge applications. That concerns researchers such as Joanne Kamens. JOANNE KAMENS: It just slows down science in general for all the people doing good and important discovery research. FENG: Kamens is executive director of Addgene, a biomedical nonprofit that supports research by sharing material like chromosomal DNA worldwide. She warns export controls could hurt this kind of cooperation, cutting the U. S. off from a global research community. That would open the door to China to race ahead. KAMENS: DNA is a linear sequence of letters. Once the letters are known, anyone in the world could, for money and time, make any one of these things. FENG: The new proposed controls could even restrict who universities and companies hire. Erin Ennis, the senior vice president of the U. S. -China Business Council, explains how companies might have to be licensed to pass knowledge of a technology to a foreign citizen. ERIN ENNIS: Not only is the product that they make covered by an export control, but the employees that they have would be covered by them, as well. FENG: That's worrying for many tech companies, such as those writing code and working on artificial intelligence. Addgene's Joanne Kamens stresses that modern research almost always crosses international boundaries. KAMENS: Basic research, which has given rise, of course, to so many important discoveries that have driven all of the cures in the clinic - you know, all of that work is done collaboratively with scientists between countries. FENG: Instead, cybersecurity analysts like New America's Samm Sacks advocate a small yard, high fence approach - restricting the sale of specific technologies with military applications but leaving everything else accessible. SAMM SACKS: Because tools like export controls, these kinds of things were meant to be used as scalpels but not as blunt instruments. FENG: Sometime this summer, the U. S. Commerce Department will release a second proposed export controls list for foundational technologies. American tech companies who submitted comments hope the Commerce Department will narrow down what is restricted. So far, they haven't heard back. Emily Feng, NPR News.

Researchers in Seattle may have a solution to that. They're developing a smartphone app that parents might be able to use to detect fluid in a child's ear. And that could help diagnose that vexing and common childhood ailment - the ear infection. NPR science correspondent Richard Harris reports on a clever use of phone technology in the crowded world of health apps. RICHARD HARRIS, BYLINE: Justin Chan, who is working toward his computer science Ph. D. at the University of Washington, noticed that his nephews and nieces were always getting earaches that sent them to the pediatrician to see if they had ear infections. JUSTIN CHAN: So I was just thinking - you know, wouldn't it be good if we could design the technology that a parent could just use in their home that is super accurate and also accessible to be used without, you know, years of clinical training? HARRIS: Chan realized that smartphones actually have what's needed to look for one prominent symptom of ear infections - fluid behind the eardrum. J. CHAN: All you really need to do to detect ear fluid is using sound. HARRIS: He and his collaborators designed a simple paper funnel that gets taped to the bottom of the smartphone so both the speaker and the microphone can focus on the ear canal. The end of the funnel is positioned on the ear. J. CHAN: And then the speaker can play a few soft chirps, kind of like a bird chirping. (SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CHIRPING)J. CHAN: Once you place it in the ear, it takes about three seconds to transmit the chirps and only takes, like, less than a second for the data to be processed and to give you a result. So it can be easily done locally on the phone. You don't even need a Wi-Fi connection. HARRIS: The algorithm on the phone can tell if there's fluid behind the eardrum by analyzing the sound that bounces back up the funnel and into the microphone, Chan explains. J. CHAN: Just kind of like a wine glass - if a wine glass is empty or half full, tapping on it is going to produce a different sound. And that's exactly what we do with our tool. HARRIS: They tested it on about 50 children, and it was right about 85 percent of the time, he says. That's about as good as the high-priced professional instruments that hearing clinics use. PAMELA MUDD: I think the thing seemed really awesome. HARRIS: Pamela Mudd, an ear, nose and throat doctor at Children's National Health System in Washington, D. C. , was impressed by the technology as described in a paper published by the journal Science Translational Medicine. She's not quite sure how it would work out in practice. MUDD: Not all fluid is an infection. HARRIS: So if a parent finds fluid in a child's ear, that doesn't mean it's time for antibiotics. Their first impulse will probably be to call the pediatrician and bring the child in for a more thorough exam. MUDD: Is the child having a fever? Has the child had a cold recently? There's other things to take into consideration. HARRIS: Mudd says this could be a useful tool for children who have ongoing problems with fluid in the ear. MUDD: But I think it's really important that parents who are picking up this application have talked to their pediatrician about it - maybe their ENT provider if they have one - before they go and use it because they may be confused rather than helped by the results. HARRIS: Though the app developers are hopeful that it will relieve parents of needless trips to the pediatrician, it could do just the opposite, says Dr. Kenny Chan, chief of pediatric otolaryngology at Children's Hospital Colorado. KENNY CHAN: To speculate that this may replace the need for a physician's visit, I think that's a little far-fetched. HARRIS: He's also waiting for the results of bigger studies to see whether the app really would work as well as the developers hope. Justin Chan, in Seattle, says he and his team have formed a company and are seeking Food and Drug Administration clearance for their software once they gather more needed data. J.

CORNISH: As NPR's Christopher Joyce reports, that's just what was on the surface. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Jennifer Lavers went to the Cocos Keeling Islands, way off the northwest coast of Australia. It was a good place because almost no one lives there. That meant the plastic debris there was not local. It floated in, and no one was picking it up. That gave her a good notion of just how much was bobbing around in the ocean. She was flabbergasted by what she found. LAVERS: So more than 414 million pieces of plastic debris are estimated to be currently sitting on the Cocos Keeling Islands, weighing a remarkable 238 tons.

LAVERS: What was really quite amazing was that the deeper we went, the more plastic we were actually finding. And what you see is only the tip. JOYCE: What happens is that the sun breaks down the plastic on the surface, and the waves pummel it into tiny pieces and drive it into the sand. LAVERS: But it's the little stuff that's perfectly bite-sized, the stuff that fish and squid and birds and even turtles can eat. JOYCE: In fact, most of the plastic waste was just under the surface. LAVERS: We estimated that what was hidden below the sediment was somewhere in the range of 380 million pieces of plastic. JOYCE: But not permanently. Eventually, she says, high tides or storms will carry it out to sea. Lavers, who's at the University of Tasmania in Australia, described what she found in the journal Nature Scientific Reports.

That's what one government agency did thanks, in large part, to a staffer there who saw a chance to cultivate some stunning research. As NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports, it was a huge risk. And it's paying off big time. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Richard Isaacson and I are wearing the same socks - black with gold toes. I know this because our shoes are off so we can walk around on one of his fabulous antique carpets. He likes ones with geometric designs. Collecting textiles from Central Asia is what he does now. But he used to do physics. RICHARD ISAACSON: Since modern physics is highly geometrical, it's not all that different except that physicists work in somewhere between four or 10 dimensions usually. So for a retirement career, working in two dimensions is a piece of cake. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He unrolls a red carpet made by an Uzbek tribe in the mid-19th century. He thinks the forgotten weavers who made this were a hundred years ahead of famous modern art celebrities. ISAACSON: They were anonymous women. And they were completely ignored. But they were doing beautiful things. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The reason I'm here is that Isaacson is also kind of anonymous. And he also did a lot of painstaking work that resulted in something beautiful. It all started back in the 1960s, when he was a Ph. D. student. He got interested in a prediction made by Albert Einstein. Einstein said anytime two massive objects crash together, shock waves should move through the very fabric of the universe. These gravitational waves are like the ripples you see in water when you toss in a pebble. ISAACSON: For my thesis, I showed how gravitational waves behave like other kinds of waves, like light and radar and X-rays. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Now, Einstein thought that gravitational waves would most likely never be detected. They're just too tiny. Isaacson was more optimistic. ISAACSON: So I imagined that sometime in my career we would see it. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He was right. The first detection was made just a few years ago. This has opened up a whole new way to find and study some of the most powerful extreme events in the universe. It was such a huge deal that the work almost immediately got a Nobel Prize. Rai Weiss is a physicist at MIT, 1 of the 3 people who won the prize. He says lots of people helped pull off this historic feat. RAI WEISS: Why should I have a Nobel Prize when there were at least 20 other people who have had equivalent input into this thing, too? GREENFIELDBOYCE: Still, he thinks one person does deserve special recognition. He thinks it's Rich Isaacson. WEISS: Rich was in a singular place, fighting on a singular war that nobody else could have fought. I think he's the hero. You know, he is the singular hero. We just don't have a good way of recognizing people like that. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says in the early 1970s, Isaacson was working at the National Science Foundation. And Weiss wanted this fledgling agency to fund a kind of crazy idea. Weiss thought it could be possible to detect gravitational waves using lasers. Lasers could, in theory, measure very, very small distortions in space, like changes that were a thousandth of the width of an atomic nucleus. WEISS: Most people have said, holy mackerel, that - he must be nuts. You can't do that. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The technology was just too hard. Plus, no one even knew what in the universe could spew out gravitational waves strong enough to be measured like that. WEISS: With those two things, you would have normally - if that was now the situation in the NSF, that proposal would have been dead on arrival. But it wasn't that way with Rich. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Because Rich Isaacson had previously studied gravitational waves, he saw the potential. So Weiss says Isaacson personally shepherded this research for almost 30 years. It became the biggest project the National Science Foundation had ever funded. WEISS: He sat in the NSF and single-handedly - I mean, single-handedly - convinced everybody in the NSF this was the right thing for the NSF to support. And the science was going to be spectacular if it should succeed. And he made the argument stick. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He made it stick through prototype tests and expert review panels and feasibility studies and management nightmares. Isaacson says lots of people thought it was crazy to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to build giant detectors that might never detect anything. ISAACSON: There is always a danger that the project can get stopped. And like all of the big projects in science, it's a roller coaster ride. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Officially, Isaacson never worked on this more than half time. In reality, it was all-consuming. The long workdays took a toll. At one point, his blood pressure went sky high, and his doctor became alarmed. Isaacson told me he felt lucky to have been in a position to help change history. ISAACSON: But history demands you pay a price for that privilege, you know, in terms of all the stress and agony and lifestyles, you know, family events. And if you're willing to pay the price, OK, then you've got this chance. And you can go ahead, and maybe it'll work - maybe it won't. GREENFIELDBOYCE: In 2002, Isaacson retired. That was also the year the agency started searching with its brand new Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, two massive detectors - one in Washington state and one in Louisiana. Each has lasers that travel down pipes 2 1/2 miles long. As Isaacson focused on his beloved textiles, these detectors hunted for gravitational waves and found nothing. For years, scientists stuck with it. They improved the detectors' instruments. And in 2015, Isaacson traveled to Maine for a vacation getaway with Weiss and another colleague who opened up a laptop to reveal measurements that were made just a couple days before - the first-ever detection of gravitational waves from two black holes that collided over a billion light years away. ISAACSON: It was absolutely clear that this fantastic thing had just happened. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Did you feel, like, different in any way? ISAACSON: Well, a little warm glow. I guess now that I'm a few years away from it, I'm beginning to feel it more. GREENFIELDBOYCE: I asked him what he thinks the chances are that a project like this could happen today. ISAACSON: Zero. We live in a very different time. Nobody can, I think, take such large-scale, high-risk, long-term research. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Just last month, researchers started up the massive detectors after another major hardware upgrade. They've already detected at least five more gravitational wave events.

So for a retirement career, working in two dimensions is a piece of cake. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He unrolls a red carpet made by an Uzbek tribe in the mid-19th century. He thinks the forgotten weavers who made this were a hundred years ahead of famous modern art celebrities. ISAACSON: They were anonymous women. And they were completely ignored. But they were doing beautiful things. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The reason I'm here is that Isaacson is also kind of anonymous. And he also did a lot of painstaking work that resulted in something beautiful. It all started back in the 1960s, when he was a Ph. D. student. He got interested in a prediction made by Albert Einstein. Einstein said anytime two massive objects crash together, shock waves should move through the very fabric of the universe. These gravitational waves are like the ripples you see in water when you toss in a pebble. ISAACSON: For my thesis, I showed how gravitational waves behave like other kinds of waves, like light and radar and X-rays. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Now, Einstein thought that gravitational waves would most likely never be detected. They're just too tiny. Isaacson was more optimistic. ISAACSON: So I imagined that sometime in my career we would see it. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He was right. The first detection was made just a few years ago. This has opened up a whole new way to find and study some of the most powerful extreme events in the universe. It was such a huge deal that the work almost immediately got a Nobel Prize. Rai Weiss is a physicist at MIT, 1 of the 3 people who won the prize. He says lots of people helped pull off this historic feat. RAI WEISS: Why should I have a Nobel Prize when there were at least 20 other people who have had equivalent input into this thing, too? GREENFIELDBOYCE: Still, he thinks one person does deserve special recognition. He thinks it's Rich Isaacson. WEISS: Rich was in a singular place, fighting on a singular war that nobody else could have fought. I think he's the hero. You know, he is the singular hero. We just don't have a good way of recognizing people like that. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says in the early 1970s, Isaacson was working at the National Science Foundation. And Weiss wanted this fledgling agency to fund a kind of crazy idea. Weiss thought it could be possible to detect gravitational waves using lasers. Lasers could, in theory, measure very, very small distortions in space, like changes that were a thousandth of the width of an atomic nucleus. WEISS: Most people have said, holy mackerel, that - he must be nuts. You can't do that. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The technology was just too hard. Plus, no one even knew what in the universe could spew out gravitational waves strong enough to be measured like that. WEISS: With those two things, you would have normally - if that was now the situation in the NSF, that proposal would have been dead on arrival. But it wasn't that way with Rich. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Because Rich Isaacson had previously studied gravitational waves, he saw the potential. So Weiss says Isaacson personally shepherded this research for almost 30 years. It became the biggest project the National Science Foundation had ever funded. WEISS: He sat in the NSF and single-handedly - I mean, single-handedly - convinced everybody in the NSF this was the right thing for the NSF to support. And the science was going to be spectacular if it should succeed. And he made the argument stick. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He made it stick through prototype tests and expert review panels and feasibility studies and management nightmares. Isaacson says lots of people thought it was crazy to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to build giant detectors that might never detect anything. ISAACSON: There is always a danger that the project can get stopped. And like all of the big projects in science, it's a roller coaster ride. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Officially, Isaacson never worked on this more than half time. In reality, it was all-consuming. The long workdays took a toll. At one point, his blood pressure went sky high, and his doctor became alarmed. Isaacson told me he felt lucky to have been in a position to help change history. ISAACSON: But history demands you pay a price for that privilege, you know, in terms of all the stress and agony and lifestyles, you know, family events. And if you're willing to pay the price, OK, then you've got this chance. And you can go ahead, and maybe it'll work - maybe it won't. GREENFIELDBOYCE: In 2002, Isaacson retired. That was also the year the agency started searching with its brand new Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, two massive detectors - one in Washington state and one in Louisiana. Each has lasers that travel down pipes 2 1/2 miles long. As Isaacson focused on his beloved textiles, these detectors hunted for gravitational waves and found nothing. For years, scientists stuck with it. They improved the detectors' instruments. And in 2015, Isaacson traveled to Maine for a vacation getaway with Weiss and another colleague who opened up a laptop to reveal measurements that were made just a couple days before - the first-ever detection of gravitational waves from two black holes that collided over a billion light years away. ISAACSON: It was absolutely clear that this fantastic thing had just happened. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Did you feel, like, different in any way? ISAACSON: Well, a little warm glow. I guess now that I'm a few years away from it, I'm beginning to feel it more. GREENFIELDBOYCE: I asked him what he thinks the chances are that a project like this could happen today. ISAACSON: Zero. We live in a very different time. Nobody can, I think, take such large-scale, high-risk, long-term research. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Just last month, researchers started up the massive detectors after another major hardware upgrade. They've already detected at least five more gravitational wave events.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. If you're like me, you know this feeling. Maybe you're at a party or you're walking down the street and suddenly, out of a sea of passing faces, one of them lights up looking right at you. This person starts waving, says hello. This person is glad to see you. And you? You have no idea who you're looking at. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. Today on the show, we're talking about faces. Recognizing faces is a crucial skill. It's so crucial that there are regions of the brain devoted to facial recognition. But although your mind is amazing at identifying your boyfriend or your child in a crowd, there are important limits to this ability. Some of us, like me, are extremely bad at it. Some of us are terrific. On today's show, we look at some people who are on opposite ends of the spectrum and talk about how our ability to recognize faces has broad implications in our lives. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: We'll start with someone whose job requires her to be quick with faces. She's a cop. ALISON YOUNG: My name's Alison Young, and I'm a police officer in the Metropolitan Police in London. VEDANTAM: She started out several years ago working on response teams in east London. These are the cops who mostly just respond to 911 calls. Then about 3 1/2 years into that job, she and a bunch of her fellow officers were invited to take a series of tests at a university. YOUNG: You get given, like, three or four different faces and you have to memorize those faces. VEDANTAM: Then a new screen appears with other faces. These ones are obscured in some way or heavily pixilated. One of the faces you saw earlier might now show up wearing a beard. YOUNG: So you have to try and work out which one of the faces is a face that you've seen before. And it's that kind of thing. VEDANTAM: The test, of course, was measuring how good officers were at recognizing faces. A while later, Alison received her results. She came in second out of all the officers. YOUNG: And they asked me to come down to Scotland Yard. VEDANTAM: Scotland Yard, of course, is the headquarters for London police. When she got there, she was told she was being added to a new unit they were forming. It was called the super-recognizer unit. YOUNG: Yes, that's what - that's the name that they've given (laughter). VEDANTAM: Do you feel like a super-recognizer? YOUNG: I don't know. I don't - well, I guess so, but I don't think I'd necessarily say that a lot because it's just the word super, isn't it? It sounds a bit super. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). YOUNG: It's just - I don't know, it's just the notion of the word super kind of brings out as if we're some sort of superhero or something like that, whereas that isn't the case. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Here's how the super-recognizer unit works. This pool of cops with above-average abilities to recognize faces sits in front of computers. They have faces of criminal suspects shown to them and they try, in essence, to play a matching game. YOUNG: Well, there's a catalog of criminals, essentially, that are wanted by police. And what they decided to develop was a thing called snapping, which meant that we may not know who that person is, but if I look at this face - No. 1 photo on this chart - and then I continue to go through further and further and further through different photos, can I find him in any other photos that he's wanted for? Which then means that we've got him for one offense of - I don't know - theft. We find him for another offense to do with theft, and you end up accruing this one person for around 25 to 30 different crimes. VEDANTAM: Now, computers are getting better at this kind of task. And maybe one day algorithms will come to replace human beings in making these kinds of matches for police. But for now, Scotland Yard decided to put its faith in humans like Alison. That's because there are some things that humans can do that computers can't. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Last year, for example, the transit police came to Scotland Yard for help. A 21-year-old woman and two girls aged 15 and 16 complained that a man had inappropriately touched them while riding the bus. Transit police pulled security footage taken from the various buses. From the pictures and the witness accounts, it appeared his modus operandi was to get on the bus with a newspaper. He would sit next to the young woman and then attempt to fondle her under cover of the newspaper. YOUNG: And they were overtly young, in the respect that some of them were in school uniforms. VEDANTAM: The security footage was grainy. The transit police didn't have an ID on the man. And because he struck at different times on different buses, they didn't know how to track him down. YOUNG: And they basically had said to us, we need to find this man. It's young girls, it's predatory, et cetera. So myself and my colleague, Detective Sergeant Eliot Porritt, just, like, did some investigation. VEDANTAM: They studied the security videos and eventually they figured out which station the man tended to frequent. YOUNG: After a lot of investigation, we discovered that he had quite a specific route of generally being around Camden Town, which is an area in northwest London. VEDANTAM: Camden Town is a busy neighborhood. It's heavily populated, with lots of shops and tourists and people always milling about. It's perfect, in other words, for someone to blend into the background. Alison and Eliot Porritt knew what they had to do. YOUNG: So we made our way to Camden Town from Scotland Yard on a Wednesday. I can't remember the exact date, but I know it was a Wednesday. VEDANTAM: This was supposed to be just a scouting mission to get a sense of the Camden Town bus station. Alison and her partner decided to look through old security footage in the CCTV room. YOUNG: So we went to the CCTV bit, which was just behind a clear Perspex glass where people buy their tickets. So it's right by the entrance foyer to the station. VEDANTAM: Detective Porritt began talking with the transit security. Alison was looking through the glass at the commuters milling about the station. YOUNG: I just glanced up and through the crowd I just saw him. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)YOUNG: I saw him walk in, pick up a newspaper and leave or go to leave. And at which point, I - I mean, I screamed because - I don't know why I did it, I just screamed (laughter). I don't know, I can't quite work out why but I just made quite a loud noise and just said to Sergeant Porritt, he's outside. VEDANTAM: They both stopped what they were doing and rushed to catch up with the man. YOUNG: But it was quite difficult to get out because we had to go all the way back round, back round to the foyer. So by the time we'd got into the main foyer where he was, we couldn't see him anymore. VEDANTAM: They ran out of the station to see if he'd left. They looked left, couldn't see him. They looked right, Alison caught a quick glimpse of a man disappearing around a corner. This fraction of a second was all she needed to recognize her target. The cops started running toward the corner. YOUNG: And as we turned, we looked just behind the wall. He was there. VEDANTAM: The officers approached the man. YOUNG: Soon as we got up to him, as in face to face with him, the pair of us - myself, Detective Sergeant Porritt - we were a 100,000,000% certain that this is the exact same gentleman in all the photos. So he was taken in handcuffs immediately and explained to him what he was being arrested for, et cetera. And it was extremely noticeable that he was very nervous. His mouth just went completely dry. And he just wasn't able to speak. VEDANTAM: The man was recently sentenced to prison and is suspended from using London's public transit after he's released. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Alison Young no longer works on the super-recognizer unit. She's gone on to other detective work. But she says the time she spent on this unusual unit was the first she ever realized she had an above-average ability. The thing is, she's still not sure where the skill comes from. YOUNG: Yeah. I think my mom was just always, oh, you got that from me - modest as ever, my mother. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). YOUNG: But my mommy's very, very, very good with faces - very good. We would be walking just doing some shopping and she would see someone and go and speak to them. And she'd have known them from primary school and she'll remember them. And my mom's - what is she now, 61? And she went to primary school at, like, 7 or 8 with them and she'll remember them. VEDANTAM: So do you think this is genetic or do you think this is learned? YOUNG: I have no - I don't think it's learned, I don't. I don't think you could teach someone. I don't think you could teach someone to be able to just do it at all. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Coming up, how common is Alison's skill? Are you a super-recognizer? Can you learn to be one? That and more from a scientist who studies how we identify faces. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. So the other week, I was at the airport, and just like everyone else, I showed my driver's license to get past security. And it occurred to me that I was operating on an assumption that I think is widely shared. I assume the TSA officer was pretty good at matching my face with the photo on my driver's license. So I asked Mike Burton - he's a professor of psychology at the University of York in the United Kingdom - if that assumption was true. MIKE BURTON: It's not, although it is a very common assumption. Most of us think we're pretty good at recognizing faces. But when you actually test people out, particularly in this situation where somebody who doesn't know you is checking a photo against you, it turns out people are really bad at this. Interestingly, even professionals are really bad at it. So we did some work with passport officers last year, where we showed that even passport officers find this a very difficult task and are often inaccurate. VEDANTAM: When I showed my ID at the airport last week, Mike, I handed over the ID and I noticed that the officer looked at the ID first and then looked at my face second. And I assume there must be some trick to this, that it actually is - you're able to make a better connection if you don't actually look at the person's face, that you start with the ID and then look at the face. Is there any truth to that? BURTON: No. There's all kinds of techniques that the people who do this professionally use. And what's interesting is they all believe themselves to be performing quite well. But when you test them, just like anybody else, they're actually not very accurate at this. VEDANTAM: It's a little terrifying what you're telling me because you're saying that this thing that we're relying on to keep ourselves safe to run security systems at airports and other places, that this is a fundamentally bad system? BURTON: That is exactly what I'm telling you. I think that what's sort of interesting is that we have come to rely on this, but I think we've come to rely on it for an interesting reason. We are fantastic at recognizing faces, those faces of people we know. We can recognize our family and friends across a huge range of conditions, you know, at distances, in bad light, all kinds. But we falsely assume that this means we're quite good at faces in general and, in fact, we're not. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Mike can say all this with some degree of confidence because he ran a study to test for it. BURTON: So we set up this little experiment where we asked people to match pairs of faces. They just have to say, are these two faces the same person or not? VEDANTAM: Mike and his colleagues ran this experiment in both the United Kingdom and in Australia. In both countries, they selected some faces that were likely to be well-known locally but unlikely to be known globally. BURTON: Yes, we use what we call B-list celebrities. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). BURTON: So we check it out beforehand, but we use people who are known very well by our - by the local population. These are people like, you know, news readers, local sports people. And they tend to be very well known by the local community but not by people internationally. What we find then is that when the U. K. people are matching U. K. celebrities, they're really good at it. And they're really poor at matching the Australian celebrities, the people that they don't know. When you look at the Australian students looking at these photos, you find exactly the opposite pattern. They're great at matching Australian celebrities and poor at matching U. K. celebrities. So at this point, we know that there's nothing in the faces themselves that make them easy or hard to match. It's just in the perceptions of the viewers. So far so good, we know that people are better at matching familiar faces. But what we then ask is, how well do you think other people will do on these faces when we give them the same task? And what you find is that the U. K. viewers think other people will find the U. K. faces easier. The Australian viewers think other people will find the Australian photos easier. That can't both be true. It must be that they are falsely generalizing their own knowledge to other people. VEDANTAM: You make a very interesting point in the paper, and I was struck by it, which is that in some ways, this might be part of a general phenomenon in cognition where we do not fully understand how difficult a task is for someone else to do. And especially when we are good at something, it's very, very difficult for us to anticipate how much harder it could be for somebody else to do the very same task. BURTON: That's right. It's - it comes up in a number of areas of psychology, even something simple like general knowledge. If you happen to have read some books about Napoleon and be knowledgeable about Napoleon, you falsely generalize that and assume that other people know more about Napoleon than they actually do. Of course, we all have our own different areas of specialist knowledge. And people turn out to be rather poor at understanding that and being able to generalize it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSICVEDANTAM: I'm wondering how good you are at facial recognition? BURTON: I'm poor. On the tests, I'm just a little below average. VEDANTAM: And has doing these tests and studying this, has it sort of changed the way you yourself trust yourself or your ability to recognize faces? BURTON: Well, I do now know how poor I am. I certainly would try not to rely on my own ability to do it. But I think that nobody really knew until the last few years just how bad we all are with unfamiliar faces. And it's just becoming clear now. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Our chronic inability to recognize faces, coupled with our chronic overconfidence in our ability to recognize faces, has big consequences. One place that's especially true is in the criminal justice system where eyewitness identifications are often central to police investigations. But this issue also shows up in lots of other settings with lower stakes - recognizing colleagues at an office party or a fellow parent at a school meeting. Julie Doerschlag from Washington, D. C. , has had this problem for a long time. JULIE DOERSCHLAG: I've had a lot of uncomfortable situations - forgetting people and have been accused of being a snob or racist or, I mean, everything. VEDANTAM: If Alison Young - the cop we heard from earlier - was a super-recognizer, you might call Julie face blind. Her whole life, she's been terrible with faces. J DOERSCHLAG: When I was in college, I - you know, you're on a campus, you meet a lot of people all the time. And there were people I met for a few minutes at a party or something, a meeting, I don't know. And I'd be on campus - small campus - walking and I'd walk past them, didn't think anything of it, just smile and keep going. And they were offended. I've heard over time, people were offended. I got this little reputation of being this snobby person because I didn't greet everybody that I met or how are you doing or - so - and I normally would if I knew them or thought I knew them. VEDANTAM: Julie's struggles followed her as she left college and entered the working world. J DOERSCHLAG: I worked for an architecture firm in Philadelphia, and we had to go to a meeting. And I swore after going into the meeting and then coming back - going back into the meeting room, I talked to this guy as if I knew him. He happened to be African-American and I was talking to him. He's like, I'm not that man. I said, oh, I'm sorry, I could have sworn. He's like, oh, OK. So it became that. And it's not people of just color or different ethnicity. VEDANTAM: What do you do about it? J DOERSCHLAG: I apologize profusely and usually the people just walk away from me (laughter). So I just stop - I just feel - I'm just used to being embarrassed. VEDANTAM: Research suggests, by the way, that people are worse at recognizing faces of people from unfamiliar groups. Many Americans are worse at recognizing the face of someone from a different race than a face of someone from their own race. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Now what makes Julie's dilemma especially acute is her husband, Marty. MARTY DOERSCHLAG: When I look at somebody, I never forget their face. If I spend about 30 seconds looking at somebody, I will remember their face for years and years and years. VEDANTAM: Marty Doerschlag, Julie's husband, is a super-recognizer. For years, Julie's been keenly aware of her husband's super power. One time, they were in Las Vegas sitting down for dinner at a restaurant. Marty glanced up at the waiter. J DOERSCHLAG: He's like, oh, you waited on me in Columbus, Ohio, in X year. The guy just froze. And then he's like, oh, yeah. And you - and I don't know how you put it together. You named the restaurant, the time, the place. And it was probably 15 years before. And he said, yeah, you're right. And so he does it a lot with servers. And, you know, I think people in the restaurant industry travel, and he remembers them because they're servers. You see their face. VEDANTAM: Marty's had lots of encounters like this. Like at the Dallas airport, he spotted a man he sat behind at a University of Michigan football game three years earlier. Now, you might think that with this gift, Marty could at least be Julie's crutch, but it doesn't always work out like that. M DOERSCHLAG: If we're in a place, I'll always - sometimes - and I'll whisper in the back of her ear, that's Jim, you know, who works at so-and-so. J DOERSCHLAG: Well, sometimes he doesn't catch me in time. I think we were at one of your friend's apartments. A guy came in and I went up and hugged him and said, oh, it's so good to see you again. And Marty's friend leaned over and said, why is Julie hugging the caterer? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)J DOERSCHLAG: So. . . M DOERSCHLAG: Yeah. J DOERSCHLAG: Yeah. M DOERSCHLAG: I remember that, too. And I. . . J DOERSCHLAG: But they let that one go 'cause they thought that was funny. M DOERSCHLAG: But I saw it coming, too. I saw Julie approaching the guy. And I said to my friend, I said, watch, she's going to think that's your roommate. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). M DOERSCHLAG: . . . Because they look sort of - they look - I mean, they had the same color hair, I think, or something. And they were the same size. And I said to him, here it comes, watch. And sure enough, she did it. It was. . . J DOERSCHLAG: But I touched him. I hugged him. So that goes into another - you have to be careful. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Julie's cringeworthy ordeals hit close to home. Recently, I was watching a play. The lead actor looked familiar. I stared at his face for the better part of 90 minutes. But it took me until after the play was over to realize this was a colleague of mine from NPR. I'd be absolutely terrible as a TSA agent. And it got me wondering, are there any solutions here? Julie's picked a simple one. J DOERSCHLAG: I don't approach people with as much joie de vivre. I don't touch them until I'm sure they want to be touched (laughter) and - or that I know them. And also I sort of create this verbal cue for them to tell me why I know them. So if I shake their hand I'll say, oh, right, do I know you from somewhere? And they're like - if they say, I don't think so, I said, OK, you just looked a little familiar. I'd rather err on that side than not knowing them. And if they finish the sentence, I said, yes, that's right. Good to see you again. But I don't use again until now that they've filled in the blank. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: For many thousands of years, humans lived in small, nomadic groups. Everyone probably knew everyone else. People didn't have the information overload we have today. You and I can come into contact with hundreds, thousands of people in a single day. Our minds simply haven't evolved at the same speed as our societies. There are going to be outliers among us, people with extraordinary skill at recognizing faces. Some of them may end up as security officers or gregarious socialites or politicians. The rest of us are going to keep smiling awkwardly at office parties at people we're supposed to know. It's what happens when you stumble around in the 21st century with a mind that was designed in the Stone Age. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This week's show was produced by Chris Benderev and edited by Jenny Schmidt. Our supervising producer is Tara Boyle. Our team includes Renee Cohen, Parth Shah, Laura Kwerel, Thomas Lu and Angus Chen. Our unsung hero this week is Alexander Diaz, who troubleshoots technical problems whenever they arise and has the most unflappable, kind disposition in the face of whatever crisis we throw his way. Producers at NPR have taken to calling him Batman because he's constantly, silently, secretly saving the day. Thanks, Batman. If you like today's episode, please take a second to share it with a friend. We're always looking for new people to discover our show. I'm Shankar Vedantam, and this is NPR.

They have faces of criminal suspects shown to them and they try, in essence, to play a matching game. YOUNG: Well, there's a catalog of criminals, essentially, that are wanted by police. And what they decided to develop was a thing called snapping, which meant that we may not know who that person is, but if I look at this face - No. 1 photo on this chart - and then I continue to go through further and further and further through different photos, can I find him in any other photos that he's wanted for? Which then means that we've got him for one offense of - I don't know - theft. We find him for another offense to do with theft, and you end up accruing this one person for around 25 to 30 different crimes. VEDANTAM: Now, computers are getting better at this kind of task. And maybe one day algorithms will come to replace human beings in making these kinds of matches for police. But for now, Scotland Yard decided to put its faith in humans like Alison. That's because there are some things that humans can do that computers can't. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Last year, for example, the transit police came to Scotland Yard for help. A 21-year-old woman and two girls aged 15 and 16 complained that a man had inappropriately touched them while riding the bus. Transit police pulled security footage taken from the various buses. From the pictures and the witness accounts, it appeared his modus operandi was to get on the bus with a newspaper. He would sit next to the young woman and then attempt to fondle her under cover of the newspaper. YOUNG: And they were overtly young, in the respect that some of them were in school uniforms. VEDANTAM: The security footage was grainy. The transit police didn't have an ID on the man. And because he struck at different times on different buses, they didn't know how to track him down. YOUNG: And they basically had said to us, we need to find this man. It's young girls, it's predatory, et cetera. So myself and my colleague, Detective Sergeant Eliot Porritt, just, like, did some investigation. VEDANTAM: They studied the security videos and eventually they figured out which station the man tended to frequent. YOUNG: After a lot of investigation, we discovered that he had quite a specific route of generally being around Camden Town, which is an area in northwest London. VEDANTAM: Camden Town is a busy neighborhood. It's heavily populated, with lots of shops and tourists and people always milling about. It's perfect, in other words, for someone to blend into the background. Alison and Eliot Porritt knew what they had to do. YOUNG: So we made our way to Camden Town from Scotland Yard on a Wednesday. I can't remember the exact date, but I know it was a Wednesday. VEDANTAM: This was supposed to be just a scouting mission to get a sense of the Camden Town bus station. Alison and her partner decided to look through old security footage in the CCTV room. YOUNG: So we went to the CCTV bit, which was just behind a clear Perspex glass where people buy their tickets. So it's right by the entrance foyer to the station. VEDANTAM: Detective Porritt began talking with the transit security. Alison was looking through the glass at the commuters milling about the station. YOUNG: I just glanced up and through the crowd I just saw him. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) YOUNG: I saw him walk in, pick up a newspaper and leave or go to leave. And at which point, I - I mean, I screamed because - I don't know why I did it, I just screamed (laughter). I don't know, I can't quite work out why but I just made quite a loud noise and just said to Sergeant Porritt, he's outside. VEDANTAM: They both stopped what they were doing and rushed to catch up with the man. YOUNG: But it was quite difficult to get out because we had to go all the way back round, back round to the foyer. So by the time we'd got into the main foyer where he was, we couldn't see him anymore. VEDANTAM: They ran out of the station to see if he'd left. They looked left, couldn't see him. They looked right, Alison caught a quick glimpse of a man disappearing around a corner. This fraction of a second was all she needed to recognize her target. The cops started running toward the corner. YOUNG: And as we turned, we looked just behind the wall. He was there. VEDANTAM: The officers approached the man. YOUNG: Soon as we got up to him, as in face to face with him, the pair of us - myself, Detective Sergeant Porritt - we were a 100,000,000% certain that this is the exact same gentleman in all the photos. So he was taken in handcuffs immediately and explained to him what he was being arrested for, et cetera. And it was extremely noticeable that he was very nervous. His mouth just went completely dry. And he just wasn't able to speak. VEDANTAM: The man was recently sentenced to prison and is suspended from using London's public transit after he's released. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Alison Young no longer works on the super-recognizer unit. She's gone on to other detective work. But she says the time she spent on this unusual unit was the first she ever realized she had an above-average ability. The thing is, she's still not sure where the skill comes from. YOUNG: Yeah. I think my mom was just always, oh, you got that from me - modest as ever, my mother. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). YOUNG: But my mommy's very, very, very good with faces - very good. We would be walking just doing some shopping and she would see someone and go and speak to them. And she'd have known them from primary school and she'll remember them. And my mom's - what is she now, 61? And she went to primary school at, like, 7 or 8 with them and she'll remember them. VEDANTAM: So do you think this is genetic or do you think this is learned? YOUNG: I have no - I don't think it's learned, I don't. I don't think you could teach someone. I don't think you could teach someone to be able to just do it at all. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Coming up, how common is Alison's skill? Are you a super-recognizer? Can you learn to be one? That and more from a scientist who studies how we identify faces. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. So the other week, I was at the airport, and just like everyone else, I showed my driver's license to get past security. And it occurred to me that I was operating on an assumption that I think is widely shared. I assume the TSA officer was pretty good at matching my face with the photo on my driver's license. So I asked Mike Burton - he's a professor of psychology at the University of York in the United Kingdom - if that assumption was true. MIKE BURTON: It's not, although it is a very common assumption. Most of us think we're pretty good at recognizing faces. But when you actually test people out, particularly in this situation where somebody who doesn't know you is checking a photo against you, it turns out people are really bad at this. Interestingly, even professionals are really bad at it. So we did some work with passport officers last year, where we showed that even passport officers find this a very difficult task and are often inaccurate. VEDANTAM: When I showed my ID at the airport last week, Mike, I handed over the ID and I noticed that the officer looked at the ID first and then looked at my face second. And I assume there must be some trick to this, that it actually is - you're able to make a better connection if you don't actually look at the person's face, that you start with the ID and then look at the face. Is there any truth to that? BURTON: No. There's all kinds of techniques that the people who do this professionally use. And what's interesting is they all believe themselves to be performing quite well. But when you test them, just like anybody else, they're actually not very accurate at this. VEDANTAM: It's a little terrifying what you're telling me because you're saying that this thing that we're relying on to keep ourselves safe to run security systems at airports and other places, that this is a fundamentally bad system? BURTON: That is exactly what I'm telling you. I think that what's sort of interesting is that we have come to rely on this, but I think we've come to rely on it for an interesting reason. We are fantastic at recognizing faces, those faces of people we know. We can recognize our family and friends across a huge range of conditions, you know, at distances, in bad light, all kinds. But we falsely assume that this means we're quite good at faces in general and, in fact, we're not. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Mike can say all this with some degree of confidence because he ran a study to test for it. BURTON: So we set up this little experiment where we asked people to match pairs of faces. They just have to say, are these two faces the same person or not? VEDANTAM: Mike and his colleagues ran this experiment in both the United Kingdom and in Australia. In both countries, they selected some faces that were likely to be well-known locally but unlikely to be known globally. BURTON: Yes, we use what we call B-list celebrities. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). BURTON: So we check it out beforehand, but we use people who are known very well by our - by the local population. These are people like, you know, news readers, local sports people. And they tend to be very well known by the local community but not by people internationally. What we find then is that when the U. K. people are matching U. K. celebrities, they're really good at it. And they're really poor at matching the Australian celebrities, the people that they don't know. When you look at the Australian students looking at these photos, you find exactly the opposite pattern. They're great at matching Australian celebrities and poor at matching U. K. celebrities. So at this point, we know that there's nothing in the faces themselves that make them easy or hard to match. It's just in the perceptions of the viewers. So far so good, we know that people are better at matching familiar faces. But what we then ask is, how well do you think other people will do on these faces when we give them the same task? And what you find is that the U. K. viewers think other people will find the U. K. faces easier. The Australian viewers think other people will find the Australian photos easier. That can't both be true. It must be that they are falsely generalizing their own knowledge to other people. VEDANTAM: You make a very interesting point in the paper, and I was struck by it, which is that in some ways, this might be part of a general phenomenon in cognition where we do not fully understand how difficult a task is for someone else to do. And especially when we are good at something, it's very, very difficult for us to anticipate how much harder it could be for somebody else to do the very same task. BURTON: That's right. It's - it comes up in a number of areas of psychology, even something simple like general knowledge. If you happen to have read some books about Napoleon and be knowledgeable about Napoleon, you falsely generalize that and assume that other people know more about Napoleon than they actually do. Of course, we all have our own different areas of specialist knowledge. And people turn out to be rather poor at understanding that and being able to generalize it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC VEDANTAM: I'm wondering how good you are at facial recognition? BURTON: I'm poor. On the tests, I'm just a little below average. VEDANTAM: And has doing these tests and studying this, has it sort of changed the way you yourself trust yourself or your ability to recognize faces? BURTON: Well, I do now know how poor I am. I certainly would try not to rely on my own ability to do it. But I think that nobody really knew until the last few years just how bad we all are with unfamiliar faces. And it's just becoming clear now. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Our chronic inability to recognize faces, coupled with our chronic overconfidence in our ability to recognize faces, has big consequences. One place that's especially true is in the criminal justice system where eyewitness identifications are often central to police investigations. But this issue also shows up in lots of other settings with lower stakes - recognizing colleagues at an office party or a fellow parent at a school meeting. Julie Doerschlag from Washington, D. C. , has had this problem for a long time. JULIE DOERSCHLAG: I've had a lot of uncomfortable situations - forgetting people and have been accused of being a snob or racist or, I mean, everything. VEDANTAM: If Alison Young - the cop we heard from earlier - was a super-recognizer, you might call Julie face blind. Her whole life, she's been terrible with faces. J DOERSCHLAG: When I was in college, I - you know, you're on a campus, you meet a lot of people all the time. And there were people I met for a few minutes at a party or something, a meeting, I don't know. And I'd be on campus - small campus - walking and I'd walk past them, didn't think anything of it, just smile and keep going. And they were offended. I've heard over time, people were offended. I got this little reputation of being this snobby person because I didn't greet everybody that I met or how are you doing or - so - and I normally would if I knew them or thought I knew them. VEDANTAM: Julie's struggles followed her as she left college and entered the working world. J DOERSCHLAG: I worked for an architecture firm in Philadelphia, and we had to go to a meeting. And I swore after going into the meeting and then coming back - going back into the meeting room, I talked to this guy as if I knew him. He happened to be African-American and I was talking to him. He's like, I'm not that man. I said, oh, I'm sorry, I could have sworn. He's like, oh, OK. So it became that. And it's not people of just color or different ethnicity. VEDANTAM: What do you do about it? J DOERSCHLAG: I apologize profusely and usually the people just walk away from me (laughter). So I just stop - I just feel - I'm just used to being embarrassed. VEDANTAM: Research suggests, by the way, that people are worse at recognizing faces of people from unfamiliar groups. Many Americans are worse at recognizing the face of someone from a different race than a face of someone from their own race. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Now what makes Julie's dilemma especially acute is her husband, Marty. MARTY DOERSCHLAG: When I look at somebody, I never forget their face. If I spend about 30 seconds looking at somebody, I will remember their face for years and years and years. VEDANTAM: Marty Doerschlag, Julie's husband, is a super-recognizer. For years, Julie's been keenly aware of her husband's super power. One time, they were in Las Vegas sitting down for dinner at a restaurant. Marty glanced up at the waiter. J DOERSCHLAG: He's like, oh, you waited on me in Columbus, Ohio, in X year. The guy just froze. And then he's like, oh, yeah. And you - and I don't know how you put it together. You named the restaurant, the time, the place. And it was probably 15 years before. And he said, yeah, you're right. And so he does it a lot with servers. And, you know, I think people in the restaurant industry travel, and he remembers them because they're servers. You see their face. VEDANTAM: Marty's had lots of encounters like this. Like at the Dallas airport, he spotted a man he sat behind at a University of Michigan football game three years earlier. Now, you might think that with this gift, Marty could at least be Julie's crutch, but it doesn't always work out like that. M DOERSCHLAG: If we're in a place, I'll always - sometimes - and I'll whisper in the back of her ear, that's Jim, you know, who works at so-and-so. J DOERSCHLAG: Well, sometimes he doesn't catch me in time. I think we were at one of your friend's apartments. A guy came in and I went up and hugged him and said, oh, it's so good to see you again. And Marty's friend leaned over and said, why is Julie hugging the caterer? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) J DOERSCHLAG: So. . . M DOERSCHLAG: Yeah. J DOERSCHLAG: Yeah. M DOERSCHLAG: I remember that, too. And I. . . J DOERSCHLAG: But they let that one go 'cause they thought that was funny. M DOERSCHLAG: But I saw it coming, too. I saw Julie approaching the guy. And I said to my friend, I said, watch, she's going to think that's your roommate. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). M DOERSCHLAG: . . . Because they look sort of - they look - I mean, they had the same color hair, I think, or something. And they were the same size. And I said to him, here it comes, watch. And sure enough, she did it. It was. . . J DOERSCHLAG: But I touched him. I hugged him. So that goes into another - you have to be careful. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Julie's cringeworthy ordeals hit close to home. Recently, I was watching a play. The lead actor looked familiar. I stared at his face for the better part of 90 minutes. But it took me until after the play was over to realize this was a colleague of mine from NPR. I'd be absolutely terrible as a TSA agent. And it got me wondering, are there any solutions here? Julie's picked a simple one. J DOERSCHLAG: I don't approach people with as much joie de vivre. I don't touch them until I'm sure they want to be touched (laughter) and - or that I know them. And also I sort of create this verbal cue for them to tell me why I know them. So if I shake their hand I'll say, oh, right, do I know you from somewhere? And they're like - if they say, I don't think so, I said, OK, you just looked a little familiar. I'd rather err on that side than not knowing them. And if they finish the sentence, I said, yes, that's right. Good to see you again. But I don't use again until now that they've filled in the blank. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: For many thousands of years, humans lived in small, nomadic groups. Everyone probably knew everyone else. People didn't have the information overload we have today. You and I can come into contact with hundreds, thousands of people in a single day. Our minds simply haven't evolved at the same speed as our societies. There are going to be outliers among us, people with extraordinary skill at recognizing faces. Some of them may end up as security officers or gregarious socialites or politicians. The rest of us are going to keep smiling awkwardly at office parties at people we're supposed to know. It's what happens when you stumble around in the 21st century with a mind that was designed in the Stone Age.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"GRAPEVINE\")TIESTO: (Singing) My mind, my mind, my mind. My mind, my mind, my mind. My mind, my mind, my mind. SIMON: Then Joe said the story is not about electronic dance music - much favored by BJ Leiderman, who writes our theme music - but instead the electric dipole moment of the neutron. We said, what is that? Joe said he'd explain. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: When Indiana University physicist Chen-Yu Liu is asked why she's interested in the electric dipole moment of the neutron, she's ready with an answer. CHEN-YU LIU: I say I'm trying to understand why we exist. PALCA: In fact, she's trying to understand why everything exists - you, me, stars, galaxies, corned beef sandwiches, everything. Theories say the explanation may be hidden in the electric dipole moment of the neutron. It's not a moment as in a moment in time. It refers to the neutron being slightly more football shaped than perfectly spherical. You see, at the instant the universe came into existence billions of years ago, energy turned into matter. Now, matter comes in two types - matter and antimatter. And when a particle of antimatter meets a particle of matter, they annihilate each other, and all that's left is light. So somehow, somewhere there had to be a slight imbalance, a bit more matter than antimatter, to make all the stuff in the universe. Theories predict the signal that explains that imbalance would be found if the neutron had a measurable electric dipole moment. But so far, no one has been able to measure one. Chen-Yu Liu says that maybe because it's small and hard to measure in neutrons. LIU: To do measurement precisely, we need to be able to slow them down, confine them in space and watch them for a very long time. PALCA: So basically you're trying to get the neutron to sit still while you study it. LIU: Exactly. PALCA: Liu is working on one way to slow down neutrons. At Oak Ridge National Lab in Tennessee, they're working on another. VINCE CIANCIOLO: All right, so the main target is down there. PALCA: We're at something called this Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge. It's a cavernous room that throbs with energy. Vince Cianciolo is a physicist here. He says when you shoot a beam of protons at a target made of mercury, you get a spray of neutrons that can be diverted into multiple beamlines. CIANCIOLO: This is the fundamental physics beamline - beamline 13 - and the dipole moment experiment will be mounted next on this beamline. PALCA: To get the neutrons to slow down so you can study them, you need to build a special chamber where the neutrons can be chilled colder than 450 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. And that's just one of the challenges. Cianciolo points to a spot at the end of the beamline where the chamber will be installed. CIANCIOLO: The support of this whole foundation has to be non-magnetic, so you can't use standard rebar. You have to use - we'll probably use fiberglass rebar. PALCA: The construction here will take place over the next couple years. In the meantime, other pieces of the experiment are taking shape. At Caltech in Pasadena, physics grad student Marie Blatnik is working on that chamber that will ultimately go to Oak Ridge. It's a giant aluminum cylinder. MARIE BLATNIK: We get to probe the smallest parts of the universe by making the world's largest machines. I mean, look at this thing (laughter). It's huge. PALCA: Blatnik's adviser Brad Filippone says people have been trying for decades to find the neutron's electric dipole moment. He says the apparatus they're building here will take the search to the next level. BRAD FILIPPONE: We believe we'll be able to increase the sensitivity by a factor of 100. PALCA: But it's possible that even after this more sensitive search, physicists may still come up empty. Filippone says that's OK. Physicists will learn something. FILIPPONE: Looking for the electric dipole moment is relatively easy to make the science case to other physicists. The question is, how much are you willing to spend? PALCA: And convincing non-physicists the search is worth the money can be harder. Just ask physicist Leah Broussard at Oak Ridge. LEAH BROUSSARD: My mom says, why are my tax dollars being wasted on this research? PALCA: But Broussard has an answer for her mom. BROUSSARD: Humans are explorers. We explore the unknown frontiers. I want to know how the universe came to be. Don't we all? PALCA: I imagine so. Joe Palca, NPR News. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  When NPR science correspondent Joe Palca came to us and said he had a story about EDM, we thought (laughter) we could get down with that. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"GRAPEVINE\") TIESTO: (Singing) My mind, my mind, my mind. My mind, my mind, my mind. My mind, my mind, my mind. SIMON: Then Joe said the story is not about electronic dance music - much favored by BJ Leiderman, who writes our theme music - but instead the electric dipole moment of the neutron. We said, what is that? Joe said he'd explain. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: When Indiana University physicist Chen-Yu Liu is asked why she's interested in the electric dipole moment of the neutron, she's ready with an answer. CHEN-YU LIU: I say I'm trying to understand why we exist. PALCA: In fact, she's trying to understand why everything exists - you, me, stars, galaxies, corned beef sandwiches, everything. Theories say the explanation may be hidden in the electric dipole moment of the neutron. It's not a moment as in a moment in time. It refers to the neutron being slightly more football shaped than perfectly spherical. You see, at the instant the universe came into existence billions of years ago, energy turned into matter. Now, matter comes in two types - matter and antimatter. And when a particle of antimatter meets a particle of matter, they annihilate each other, and all that's left is light. So somehow, somewhere there had to be a slight imbalance, a bit more matter than antimatter, to make all the stuff in the universe. Theories predict the signal that explains that imbalance would be found if the neutron had a measurable electric dipole moment. But so far, no one has been able to measure one. Chen-Yu Liu says that maybe because it's small and hard to measure in neutrons. LIU: To do measurement precisely, we need to be able to slow them down, confine them in space and watch them for a very long time.

These drones are relatively low tech, yet as NPR's Geoff Brumfiel reports, they are the clearest sign yet that a new era of warfare has begun. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Back in January, a group of high-level military commanders gathered for an event at an airbase in Yemen. It was far from the front lines of the ongoing civil war. But then as the cameras were rolling, something suddenly appeared out of the sky. And a warning - what you're about to hear is loud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Foreign language spoken). (SOUNDBITE OF EXPLOSION)NICK WATERS: It's pretty scary because it's clear that these guys had absolutely no idea what had just happened. BRUMFIEL: Nick Waters is with Bellingcat, a group of open-source researchers. What had happened was a small drone had flown over the dais and detonated, peppering the ground with shrapnel. According to press reports, the blast killed several, including the head of military intelligence. This weapon was launched by Houthi rebels over 18 miles away. Waters says it was a glorified model airplane with an explosive on the front and a propeller on the back. It flew a pre-programmed route using GPS. WATERS: Although it's, like, relatively simple, it can be very effective. BRUMFIEL: In recent weeks, Houthi rebels have sent similar drones to targets inside Saudi Arabia, including oil pumping stations and airfields. Experts say these drones likely come from the Houthis' main sponsor, Iran. ARIANE TABATABAI: So Iran started to develop drones in the 1980s. BRUMFIEL: Ariane Tabatabai is a political scientist at the RAND Corporation. TABATABAI: That was in the context of the Iran-Iraq War, and it was largely trying to make up for its lack of conventional capabilities. BRUMFIEL: Iran has been under various arms embargoes for decades, so Iranian engineers developed drones on their own. Iran has kept the technology to itself until a few years ago when the rival Islamic State, or ISIS, started to gain territory nearby. TABATABAI: The rise of ISIS in Syria and Iraq was really the main driver behind Iran starting to deploy its drones outside of its borders. BRUMFIEL: In fact, the Syrian civil war has been a drone testing ground for all sides. Israel has sent drones to hunt Syrian air defenses. Russia has tried out its newest technology. Even ISIS used commercial drones to drop small explosives on the enemy. Many of Iran's drones occupy a sort of middle ground between the advanced weapons of major powers and the off-the-shelf technology used by ISIS. Ali Vaez is with the international Crisis Group. He says taking cheap drones to the next level is exactly the kind of thing Iran is good at. ALI VAEZ: It is very much in line with Iranians' modus operandi. BRUMFIEL: Vaez says these drones fit well with the nation's overall defense strategy, using asymmetric warfare and proxy groups to take on its enemies far from its own borders. He's also not surprised by recent evidence that Iran is sharing not just drones but drone technologies so that partner groups like the Houthis in Yemen can build their own drones. VAEZ: The Iranian mentality is generally that instead of giving fish to your partners and proxies in the region, you should teach them how to do fishing. BRUMFIEL: Nick Waters, who tracks weapons systems in Yemen and elsewhere, says there is evidence that the Houthi rebels are building their own drones now. And he says small drones are showing up in conflict zones from Ukraine to the Philippines.

S. are underwater. But look at the federal government's flood insurance maps, and many of them are in what's called areas of minimal flood risk. That's because the maps are old - sometimes 50 years old or more. That means hundreds of thousands of Americans are at risk for flooding, and they don't even know it. Here's NPR's Rebecca Hersher on a piece of technology used by scientists that could help. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: The technology is a way to map the surface of the Earth and see even tiny little bumps. It's called LiDAR, short for light detection and ranging. And for people who study rocks and ruins and rivers, it's like having a superpower. ROBERT YOUNG: The story of LiDAR, as a research tool, is really a happy one. HERSHER: Robert Young is a geologist at Western Carolina University. He uses LiDAR data all the time for his research. It's so detailed it can show where ancient rivers used to flow by mapping subtle changes in elevation. And the government also uses LiDAR to map areas along the coasts. YOUNG: The United States Geological Survey began a lot of the early LiDAR studies that allowed us to quantify the volume change in a barrier island during a hurricane, you know, like, really neat things that we would never have been able to do before. HERSHER: But until recently, that information was still mostly for research. It was only in the last few years that local governments have realized, hey. We also want a super-detailed map of the land we live on. Maybe if we know exactly how high things are, we'll be able to predict where water will go during a flood. In recent years, state and city governments have started collecting LiDAR data. North Carolina, Delaware, big chunks of Florida and major cities like Houston and Atlanta are all doing it. Lou Gritzo is the lead engineer for flood mapping at the private insurance giant FM Global. LOU GRITZO: I think the most important thing is that, you know, cities are understanding the value of having data like LiDAR. And there's lots of different reasons why they would do that - for urban planning, for development. Flood is one of the biggest reasons. HERSHER: His company is the biggest provider of private, commercial flood insurance in the country, which means they're really focused on making accurate flood maps. He says having more accurate data can be useful. But collecting LiDAR data is not enough on its own. You also need good computer models and old-fashioned humans to look for things that even LiDAR can't see. GRITZO: There can be lots of little features that are even difficult to pick up with high-resolution LiDAR data. And those can be drainage pipes. They can be a covered area where there's a passageway into a basement, where there's high-value property. HERSHER: Basically, LiDAR is helpful. But it's not enough to just use LiDAR to figure out how high or low every building is and then assume that the low ones will flood and the high ones will be safe. As states and cities update flood maps, they've also had to make sure that they backup their LiDAR data with enough manpower. Geologist Robert Young says that lesson has been showing up in some parts of North Carolina. YOUNG: LiDAR is being misused, in my opinion. HERSHER: Many coastal flood maps in the state have been updated in recent years using LiDAR data about elevation. If the LiDAR says the house is higher, it's assumed to be at lower risk, which sounds logical until you look at what some homes are sitting on top of. YOUNG: Those are not granite peaks sitting out there on the barrier islands in North Carolina. They're sand dunes. HERSHER: And, of course, sand dunes can erode. YOUNG: You know, even my 11-year-old can tell you that you can make a 10-foot-high sandcastle on the oceanfront if you want to, but the waves are still going to chew it apart. So, you know, we have this tool that allows us to map elevation in ways we've never been able to before, but you still have to have a basic understanding of what that elevation means. HERSHER: Many local officials say the new flood maps are still more accurate and easier to use than the old ones. But understanding that LiDAR data needs to be accompanied by strong models is increasingly important. That's because Congress is currently deciding on big changes to the National Flood Insurance Program. And so far, every plan has set aside big money for mapping technology like LiDAR.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. There is comfort in the familiar. That's why Marlon Wade (ph) likes to head over to his local barbershop, Wrist Action. MARLON WADE: I just stop in. VEDANTAM: It's on MacArthur Boulevard in Oakland, Calif. He doesn't come for a cut. WADE: No hair, no hair. I just wear the bald head. VEDANTAM: He comes to shoot the breeze. WADE: (Laughter). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Yeah, yeah. VEDANTAM: He points to one of the barbers, who's a friend. WADE: That's my son's godfather. That's one of my old school teammates. We played baseball together. VEDANTAM: Basically, Marlon likes to hang with people who know and understand him, people he grew up with. WADE: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: Some years ago, when Marlon was in the market for a new doctor, he looked for that same feeling of connection. WADE: I have various choices. I had, like - I had over 20 doctors to choose from. VEDANTAM: But one stood out. She was, like him, black and, like him, a practicing Muslim. WADE: She gets me. I get her. We talk about life. We talk about our religion. You know, if something wrong with me, she going to let me know. VEDANTAM: It's the kind of trusting relationship Marlon doesn't believe he'd find in a doctor of a different race. WADE: I don't think a lot of these doctors relate to people of my skin color. Like, when it comes to heart disease, diabetes, like, a lot of these diseases can be researched and medically something done for it. But at the end of the day, my community not getting that service. VEDANTAM: A variety of studies do suggest that black men in America often receive inferior care compared to white patients. They have the lowest life expectancy of any major demographic group. Many of the diseases they're dying from are chronic or preventable. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Now a growing body of research suggests Marlon Wade might be onto something in his choice of doctor. OWEN GARRICK: The black doctors were able to convince more effectively the patients to take more of the preventative services compared to the nonblack doctors. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This week on HIDDEN BRAIN, we considered a simple but controversial way to improve outcomes in medicine, education and other fields. And we ask, what happens when the ideal of a colorblind society runs into hard evidence that you may get better outcomes by not being colorblind? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Where Owen Garrick was a kid growing up in the South Bronx, he lived across the street from a bunch of relatives, including his Uncle Bobby. GARRICK: So he was the one that you could always hang out with, to the mall or to the store or to some friend's house. You can go swimming with him. He's a guy you can just jump in his car, come back at all hours of the evening, and he was your excuse, right? You know, Mom, Uncle Bobby let - you know, had me staying out all night. VEDANTAM: But when he was 66 years old, Uncle Bobby found out he was dying of prostate cancer. GARRICK: So he started having bone pain due to the metastases to his bone, and that brought him - and the pain brought him in. And so then he was diagnosed. He probably died a few months after he was diagnosed. VEDANTAM: In Owen's opinion, it was a preventable death. Prostate cancer is usually slow growing. It's easy to detect. GARRICK: He could still be very much alive and still very much active in his community and with his family but unfortunately wouldn't go in for his preventative services. VEDANTAM: Owen says many of the older men in his family were the same way. They didn't trust doctors. They didn't get preventative care. This is the kind of story told over and over again in black America. And it's a story reflected in a grim statistic. The average life expectancy of black men is 72 years - about four years shorter than the average for white men. GARRICK: It's not just prostate cancer. It's cardiovascular disease, stroke. It's diabetes. Most of the death is due to preventable or chronic conditions. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This is something Owen wants to change. He's a doctor and researcher. He runs Bridge Clinical Research, a company whose mission is to make the medical system work better for black Americans. Owen is tired of the bad news about black men and health care in America. He's tired of talking about the disparity in health outcomes. What Owen wants is a fix, a way to get black men, particularly low-income black men, to go to the doctor for preventative care. He wants doctors who will listen to patients and patients who will listen to doctors. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: So Owen and his fellow researchers, Marcella Alsan and Grant Graziani, designed a field study to try to answer one simple question. GARRICK: Will black men take more preventative care services if they're randomly assigned to a black doctor? VEDANTAM: Is it possible that the race of your physician matters in terms of your own health? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: To find out, Owen and his colleagues rented a medical clinic in Oakland. They recruited 14 black and nonblack doctors to staff the clinic during the study. For patients, they turned to flea markets and barbershops in and around the East Bay, places like Wrist Action where Marlon Wade likes to hang out. GARRICK: And if you go to a black barbershop, you will have all sorts of black men in the barbershop. WADE: Not much, but how you doin'? GARRICK: You'll have folks who - like me. You'll have my kids at that barbershop. You'll have folks who didn't graduate from high school and their kids. VEDANTAM: The first step was asking patrons in these places if they'd answer some basic questions. Some 1,300 men agreed to fill out a short survey about their socioeconomic status, health history and level of trust in the medical system. For these efforts, they received cash or a voucher for a free haircut plus a coupon for a free health screening. About half the men showed up at the clinic for that screening. Before their checkup, the clinic staff showed the men a picture of the doctor they'd been randomly assigned. They also asked them to select from a list of preventative care services that they'd be willing to receive. GARRICK: Height and weight to check body mass index, blood pressure, cholesterol, which was total cholesterol and a diabetes screen, which is hemoglobin A1c. VEDANTAM: At first, the men made similar choices. GARRICK: They all accepted generally the same level of preventative services. VEDANTAM: In other words, seeing the photos of the doctors did not change patients' decisions about what services to accept. Typically, the men would choose some of the services but not all. They might agree to get their body mass index and blood pressure checked but forgo the tests for diabetes and cholesterol that come with a needle stick. But what happened next changed their choices. GARRICK: The doctor then comes in and says, OK, Mr. Smith, you've only selected these three. You know, you've only selected height and weight and blood pressure. We really recommend that you take all five because they're all recommended. They're all good for your health. VEDANTAM: As I said, some of the black patients were randomized to receive this advice from a black doctor, some from a nonblack doctor. Did the race of the physician affect what patients did? GARRICK: The black doctors were able to convince more effectively of the patients to take more of the preventative services. VEDANTAM: And not just by a little - by a lot. The black doctors were about 20% more successful than nonblack doctors at getting patients to have their blood pressure and body mass measured. They were even more effective at persuading their patients to have invasive tests. For diabetes and the flu shot, the black doctors were about 50% more successful than nonblack doctors. And then came the cholesterol results. GARRICK: There was a 72% difference in the ability of the black doctor to recommend and have the black male patient take cholesterol screening compared to the nonblack doctor. VEDANTAM: Seventy-two percent. Now, the real-life implications of these results might be significant. High cholesterol, for instance, can lead to heart attacks, strokes. What if black patients in the real world responded to their physicians like their counterparts in the study? Owen Garrick says the gap in the United States between blacks and whites in cardiovascular disease outcomes might shrink by nearly 20%. GARRICK: That could be 20% of the people living to see their grandkids graduate from college and high school, right? That's how I think about it. (SOUNDBITE OF SIR EDWARD ELGAR'S \"POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE\")VEDANTAM: These results suggest they might be an easy, low-cost way to save the lives of black men. Owen and his colleagues wanted to understand what was going on. Why were the black doctors so much more effective? The researchers didn't think prejudice was at play because the patients rated all the physicians, black and nonblack, as equally good. But then they discovered a clue. It was in the notes the doctors had written about their patients. GARRICK: We found that the black doctors actually wrote more notes compared to the nonblack doctors about their patients. And often, those notes talked about their non-health care issues - a wedding is coming up; will the Warriors repeat as NBA champions? Like, so nonmedical issues. VEDANTAM: The black doctors and black patients were connecting as human beings. They were talking about family, sports, life. It's the kind of chitchat that says, I know where you're coming from. I hear you. Marlon Wade from the barbershop made the very same point about his doctor. WADE: She gets me. I get her. We talk about life. We talk about our religion. You know, if something wrong with me, she going to let me know. VEDANTAM: Owen's research is part of a growing body of work that suggests matching patients and doctors by race can make a difference in health outcomes. In another study, researchers found that Florida patients assigned to physicians of their own race were 13% less likely to die while in the hospital. These results were driven almost entirely by black patients matched with black physicians. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: The research raises difficult questions about our medical system, our society and our biases. The clearest takeaway from the research is that warm and empathetic communication matters. Owen Garrick believes that doctors might be taught to bridge some of the differences he observed in his study. GARRICK: Because if communication is the mechanism, you can train - or you should be able to train nonblack doctors to more effectively communicate with their patients. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: There is a more daunting takeaway. If you want better outcomes in health care, especially among the most vulnerable patients, having a more diverse pool of physicians is crucial. Owen says what he wants is for patients to have a choice. If they want to see a black doctor, they can choose one. But right now, that's often not possible. GARRICK: Four percent of physicians are black. Blacks represent 13% of the U. S. population. So an underrepresentation. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: It's important to note that choice is not just something blacks might prefer. In a follow-up survey, Owen and his team found that both black and white respondents indicated a same-race preference. Sixty-five percent of blacks surveyed said a black doctor would better understand their concerns. Seventy percent of whites said a white doctor would better understand them. There is a third implication of Owen's research, and it feels radioactive. Given the results, I asked him, should hospitals and medical centers match patients and doctors by race, particularly when it comes to black men? Owen challenged the notion that this needed to be a radioactive idea. GARRICK: Fraternities and sororities self-select by gender. You could argue that that's segregation. I wouldn't argue that that's segregation. But, you know, someone might. You know, a pessimist might. And I think in - the pessimists of the world might argue that recommending black physicians for black patients is segregation. I don't see it that way. VEDANTAM: Still, Owen acknowledges he would be uncomfortable with the idea that hospitals would deliberately steer black patients to black doctors and white patients to white doctors. After all, we struggled as a nation for decades to overcome segregation. How would patients react if they were told when they showed up at a clinic, you're black so we're sending you to the black doctor? There is some tension here, right? Because there are two values, I think, that are in conflict with one another here. I mean, there is one value that basically says, you know, we should all essentially treat one another the same. We should all get along well. We should all, you know, as Dr. King would say, look at each other's character and abilities and not the color of our skin or our gender. I mean, so that is an ideal. And the other ideal is we should trust the data, and we should trust the evidence and we should follow where the evidence leads. And it feels like those two values, following the evidence and the data and following this norm that we have about how we'd like our society to be, these two values are in conflict. GARRICK: Right. And they're partly in conflict because we don't live in an ideal world. And some might argue, skeptics of the world might argue, that we profess to live in an ideal world when we know absolutely the world is not ideal. So given that, given the cards you're dealt, the life you live, the world we exist in, how do you best, in our case, accomplish, improve health outcomes for all populations - and specifically in our research study, the black male population? And this issue of the race of the doctor seems to work. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: And it isn't just in medicine. When we come back, the results of matching people by their identities from education, to retail, to banking. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: In 1985, researchers in Tennessee launched a massive experiment to see if class sizes affected learning. There was plenty of anecdotal evidence at the time suggesting that kids did better in smaller classes, but there was no hard data to prove it. Project STAR changed that. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: More than 11,000 students from kindergarten through third grade were randomly assigned to one of three class-size groups. Researchers tracked their performance over time. The experiment is now considered one of the most important education studies ever conducted. It showed that smaller class sizes led to substantial improvements in early learning, especially for minority students. In the decades since, researchers have also come to realize the random placement of kids in Project STAR could be used to study something else. CONSTANCE LINDSAY: If you are randomizing by class size, you are also randomizing by teacher race. VEDANTAM: This is Constance Lindsay. She is an education professor at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. She said this insight led to a new research question. Do children who have a teacher of the same race do better than children who don't? Education researcher Thomas Dee was the first to analyze the Project STAR data in this new way. Did students do better if they were matched with a teacher of the same race? In 2004, he published his findings. Constance says they were striking. LINDSAY: If you're a black student and you have a black teacher, on average, you're going to have a higher test score than a black student who has a white teacher. VEDANTAM: The findings weren't just specific to black kids. They also held true for white students. Both black and white kids did better on math and reading achievement tests if they had a teacher of the same race. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Thomas Dee worried that his results might cause people to call for increased racial segregation in schools. He felt that would be a mistake. He first noted that his results only apply to how kids were doing during the four-year experiment. The results did not predict achievement over longer time periods. Second, he felt the best takeaway would be more study. He urged researchers to continue exploring why race dynamics matter in the classroom. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Fourteen years later, Constance Lindsay and her colleagues did just that. LINDSAY: Basically, what we did is we said let's use the fact that we can follow the students over many, many years and see what happens to them in terms of high school dropout, whether they take a college entrance exam, and then whether they enroll in college. VEDANTAM: In other words, they tried to answer the open question Thomas Dee had raised, do black children who are randomly assigned to black teachers perform better over the long term? What they found is those early interactions had a lasting effect. LINDSAY: Black students in our sample who were matched to a black teacher were less likely to drop out of high school, more likely to sit for a college entrance exam - so think, you know, SAT, ACT - and then more likely to enroll in college. VEDANTAM: The success of black students increased with every year they were matched with black teachers. Black students who spent more time with black teachers did better than black students who spent less time. These results could have huge implications. They suggest that race matching might be one way to get more at-risk black kids to stay in school and go on to higher education. Of course, Tennessee is just one state, and researchers wanted to make sure they weren't looking at a one-state phenomenon. So they turned to North Carolina. This state has a huge public school database. It contains all kinds of information about students, including their demographics, the classes they've taken and the race of various teachers over the years. Again, the researchers looked at kids in elementary school and then tracked them over time. Now, these kids weren't randomly matched like they were in Tennessee, but still, they had exposure to black and nonblack teachers. Constance says the results told the same story. Black kids who had had black teachers were less likely to drop out of high school. LINDSAY: And then when you finish high school in North Carolina, there's a survey you fill out that says, I will attend college, I will not attend college. It's basically, like, an intent-to-attend-college measure. And we find that more black students who are matched to black teachers report wanting to attend college. VEDANTAM: Students who benefited the most from having a black teacher were those most at risk of dropping out, low-income black boys. The North Carolina data showed that these boys were 39% less likely to drop out of high school if they had a black teacher in elementary school - 39%. What Constance and her colleagues were seeing in education is what Owen Garrick saw in medicine - race matters. Now, we don't know why these black teachers were making such a difference in the lives of their black students, but the researchers think a variety of forces might be at work. One could be implicit bias. Teachers may hold unconscious prejudices that negatively affect black students. LINDSAY: That prevent them from, you know, maybe identifying kids for things like gifted programs or enacting harsher discipline punishments. VEDANTAM: Constance says black teachers also serve as powerful role models for black students. LINDSAY: The presence of, you know, a college-educated adult in your life makes a difference. VEDANTAM: And then there's what's called cultural competence. LINDSAY: Which is that teachers are able to read behavior better if you sort of share - you know, if you have cultural things that you share in common. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This seems especially true in the area of discipline. In another research project, Constance and her colleagues have found that one reason black boys sometimes get into trouble at school is because of something researchers call willful defiance. LINDSAY: Willful defiance is, I get into an argument with the teacher and, you know, maybe I talk back, or something along those lines, and then you have to go to the principal's office. VEDANTAM: And so what do you see with willful defiance? LINDSAY: So we see that the drops in willful defiance are huge when you have a black teacher. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: But just as there's a shortage of black doctors in America, there's also a shortage of black teachers. Nationwide, teachers in elementary and secondary schools are overwhelmingly white despite growing racial diversity among students. LINDSAY: So for example, in the North Carolina data, both in the long-term study and in the discipline study that I have, over 50% of the black students never have a black teacher. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: On a very personal level, Constance knows well the lasting impression a black teacher can leave on students. LINDSAY: 'Cause my grandmother was a teacher here in D. C. public schools for a very long time. VEDANTAM: Constance describes her as a warm demander. LINDSAY: This is someone who is - you know, sort of holds you accountable for the things that you should be doing, but does it in a warm fashion. VEDANTAM: Her name was Mae Wilson (ph). DONALD WILLIAMS: Mae Wilson. Well, dealing with her, she was stern. She kept an orderly classroom. She was the boss, you know? VEDANTAM: This is Donald Williams (ph). He's in his late 60s and has lived nearly all his life in Washington, D. C. In the early 1970s, Don was a student at a school that has educated generations of African-American students, Dunbar High School. This is where Mae Wilson taught. (SOUNDBITE OF BOOK PAGES TURNING)WILLIAMS: Man, it's been a long time since I looked in this book. VEDANTAM: From an old yearbook. . . WILLIAMS: Wow. VEDANTAM: . . . Don points to his younger self, a star football player at Dunbar. WILLIAMS: Here, I was blocking. There, I was running with the football. There, I was running with the football. There, I got tackled. VEDANTAM: Most of Don's memories from high school revolve around football. Except for that homeroom teacher, Mae Wilson, whom he's never forgotten. WILLIAMS: She's, like, 5'5\", 5'4\", but her demeanor was bigger than that, you know? She didn't take a lot of, you know, nonsense. You knew it. You knew. She was like your mother away from home. But she didn't take any stuff. She didn't cut any corners. VEDANTAM: Don says there was something about Mae Wilson that made you pay attention. Maybe it was the tailored skirt suit she wore, or her air of authority. WILLIAMS: She always looked business. She always looked business. She never came in a nightclub dress, or something like that. She always looked professional. So that's another message that you saw in her, that she was - she'd stick to the rules of being on time, doing things that you need to do, not being rowdy, controlling yourself in public. VEDANTAM: Her lessons ultimately stuck and became life lessons for Don. I asked him if it made a difference to him that Mae Wilson was black. He told me the question was a no-brainer - yes, of course, it made a difference. WILLIAMS: As a black kid, you can relate better when you see someone in the position that you're in 'cause if you're not black, you can't understand what I'm saying. You can - yeah, you can say it 'cause it's the right thing - oh, I under - no. You don't. You couldn't possibly know. 'Cause you're not black. VEDANTAM: Don has the same feeling about his football coaches. He says shared identity often led to trust. WILLIAMS: Like I said, a kid needs to see someone who's been there. It's easy for you to talk it when you got it. It's easy for a rich man to tell you to save your money. He got money. How can a rich man tell a poor man what's going on, what life is about? It's got to be someone that knows the avenues to go to that someone that's black that's been through it. You know, you got to - and then, you know, that's his ticket. That's his motivation there to show you what's - how it can be done. VEDANTAM: Giving students the feeling that they are understood by their teachers, who can say this is a bad idea? But if you zoom out, putting this idea into practice runs into all sorts of problems related to history, politics and optics. I asked Constance Lindsay about this. Let's say you're the principal of a school, and you have one black teacher in second grade, and you have, let's say, 15 black students spread across five sections of second grade. Would you assign all those 15 students to the black teacher? LINDSAY: I probably would not do that. If I had students that in that particular set of 15 that were particularly disadvantaged, I might. I might also explore ways in which teachers could co-teach so that, you know, all of those 15 students would have the opportunity to interact with that teacher. But I definitely wouldn't advocate sort of segregating them into one class. VEDANTAM: Why not? That's what your data show works. LINDSAY: That is what the data show that works. But I think we agreed that segregation is bad. VEDANTAM: But I think this is what makes the paper really, really tricky, which is it's actually suggesting that's something that we thought was a good thing might have an outcome that is not such a good thing. LINDSAY: That's right. That's right. So I guess if you held a gun to my head and you said I had to pick between segregating students and, you know, making sure that students had a black teacher, I would pick that they had a black teacher. VEDANTAM: So you actually would put the students in the same class then? LINDSAY: If you said I had to. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: No, I guess what I'm asking you is not so much whether I have to but, you know, if you looked at the data and said that you are improving the odds of students by 10, 15, maybe 20%, and you did not do that thing that could improve their odds by 10, 15, 20%, I mean, that is immoral. LINDSAY: You could say that. You could say that. I mean, if I were a parent of a black boy, and there was one black male teacher in the school, I would go tell the principal to assign my child to him. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: There is some evidence the race-matching effects we see in medicine and education also show up in other spheres. At Temple University, Derek Avery and his colleagues found that customers at a retail store who interacted with sales agents of the same race had higher levels of satisfaction. This was especially true in areas where racial minorities were a larger share of the customer base. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Columbia University's Raymond Fisman found in a study conducted in India that ethnic and religious matching between bankers and customers increased the likelihood of loans being repaid. It also lowered the cost of loans because banks perceived there was a lower risk in lending money. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Other workers observed that gender can act in similar ways to racial or religious identification. Brad Greenwood at the University of Minnesota found that more women in Florida survived a heart attack when their doctor was a woman rather than a man. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: At the University of Massachusetts, social psychologist Nilanjana Dasgupta has found that female students in calculus classes were more engaged in the subject when they had a female professor rather than a male professor. NILANJANA DASGUPTA: Just having a female professor ends up making women feel they'll do better in the class or making them feel more confident, making them feel that they care more about math than when the same course material, same exam, same syllabus is taught by a male professor. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This is important because calculus is a gateway class to degrees in careers in math and science, where women are currently underrepresented. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: There are three lessons from all these examples. The first is that we really need doctors and teachers and loan officers and store clerks from different races and different backgrounds. It can have tangible and measurable outcomes. The second lesson is that if we want to be understood by people who are different from us in some way, it's going to take work. You can't just assume that your job begins and ends with teaching a course or diagnosing the patient. You have to make a connection with the human being across from you. The final lesson has to do with a seemingly contradictory effect of diversity. In an earlier episode of HIDDEN BRAIN, The Edge Effect, we talked about how diversity boosts creativity and innovation. By contrast, here we've seen how connecting with people who are like us can produce better outcomes. One explanation for this contradiction lies in what you are trying to achieve. You want novelty and creativity? Those flourish from bringing together different perspectives. But if you want trust and communication, those come easier when we have things in common. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This week's episode was produced by Jenny Schmidt and Parth Shah. It was edited by Tara Boyle and Rhaina Cohen. Our team includes Laura Kwerel and Thomas Lu. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Our Unsung Hero this week is Jeff Rogers. Jeff helps to run two of our sister NPR shows, the TED Radio Hour and How I Built This. He played an early role in helping get HIDDEN BRAIN off the ground. He's also the kind of person you want to have when things are changing quickly around you. Jeff can be coach, friend and taskmaster. He has an uncanny ability to stay calm, which is why so many people say whenever they have a problem, I'm sure Jeff can help with that. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: For more HIDDEN BRAIN, you can find us on Facebook and Twitter. If this episode reminded you of someone who connected in a meaningful way with you, whether in the classroom, the doctor's office or at work, please share this episode with that person. Tell them the impact they had on your life. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: I'm Shankar Vedantam, and this is NPR. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST:  This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. There is comfort in the familiar. That's why Marlon Wade (ph) likes to head over to his local barbershop, Wrist Action. MARLON WADE: I just stop in. VEDANTAM: It's on MacArthur Boulevard in Oakland, Calif. He doesn't come for a cut. WADE: No hair, no hair. I just wear the bald head. VEDANTAM: He comes to shoot the breeze. WADE: (Laughter). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Yeah, yeah. VEDANTAM: He points to one of the barbers, who's a friend. WADE: That's my son's godfather. That's one of my old school teammates. We played baseball together. VEDANTAM: Basically, Marlon likes to hang with people who know and understand him, people he grew up with. WADE: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: Some years ago, when Marlon was in the market for a new doctor, he looked for that same feeling of connection. WADE: I have various choices. I had, like - I had over 20 doctors to choose from. VEDANTAM: But one stood out. She was, like him, black and, like him, a practicing Muslim. WADE: She gets me. I get her. We talk about life. We talk about our religion. You know, if something wrong with me, she going to let me know. VEDANTAM: It's the kind of trusting relationship Marlon doesn't believe he'd find in a doctor of a different race. WADE: I don't think a lot of these doctors relate to people of my skin color. Like, when it comes to heart disease, diabetes, like, a lot of these diseases can be researched and medically something done for it. But at the end of the day, my community not getting that service. VEDANTAM: A variety of studies do suggest that black men in America often receive inferior care compared to white patients. They have the lowest life expectancy of any major demographic group. Many of the diseases they're dying from are chronic or preventable. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Now a growing body of research suggests Marlon Wade might be onto something in his choice of doctor. OWEN GARRICK: The black doctors were able to convince more effectively the patients to take more of the preventative services compared to the nonblack doctors. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This week on HIDDEN BRAIN, we considered a simple but controversial way to improve outcomes in medicine, education and other fields. And we ask, what happens when the ideal of a colorblind society runs into hard evidence that you may get better outcomes by not being colorblind? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Where Owen Garrick was a kid growing up in the South Bronx, he lived across the street from a bunch of relatives, including his Uncle Bobby. GARRICK: So he was the one that you could always hang out with, to the mall or to the store or to some friend's house. You can go swimming with him. He's a guy you can just jump in his car, come back at all hours of the evening, and he was your excuse, right? You know, Mom, Uncle Bobby let - you know, had me staying out all night. VEDANTAM: But when he was 66 years old, Uncle Bobby found out he was dying of prostate cancer. GARRICK: So he started having bone pain due to the metastases to his bone, and that brought him - and the pain brought him in. And so then he was diagnosed. He probably died a few months after he was diagnosed. VEDANTAM: In Owen's opinion, it was a preventable death. Prostate cancer is usually slow growing. It's easy to detect. GARRICK: He could still be very much alive and still very much active in his community and with his family but unfortunately wouldn't go in for his preventative services. VEDANTAM: Owen says many of the older men in his family were the same way. They didn't trust doctors. They didn't get preventative care. This is the kind of story told over and over again in black America. And it's a story reflected in a grim statistic. The average life expectancy of black men is 72 years - about four years shorter than the average for white men. GARRICK: It's not just prostate cancer. It's cardiovascular disease, stroke. It's diabetes. Most of the death is due to preventable or chronic conditions. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is something Owen wants to change. He's a doctor and researcher. He runs Bridge Clinical Research, a company whose mission is to make the medical system work better for black Americans. Owen is tired of the bad news about black men and health care in America. He's tired of talking about the disparity in health outcomes. What Owen wants is a fix, a way to get black men, particularly low-income black men, to go to the doctor for preventative care. He wants doctors who will listen to patients and patients who will listen to doctors. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: So Owen and his fellow researchers, Marcella Alsan and Grant Graziani, designed a field study to try to answer one simple question. GARRICK: Will black men take more preventative care services if they're randomly assigned to a black doctor? VEDANTAM: Is it possible that the race of your physician matters in terms of your own health? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: To find out, Owen and his colleagues rented a medical clinic in Oakland. They recruited 14 black and nonblack doctors to staff the clinic during the study. For patients, they turned to flea markets and barbershops in and around the East Bay, places like Wrist Action where Marlon Wade likes to hang out. GARRICK: And if you go to a black barbershop, you will have all sorts of black men in the barbershop. WADE: Not much, but how you doin'? GARRICK: You'll have folks who - like me. You'll have my kids at that barbershop. You'll have folks who didn't graduate from high school and their kids. VEDANTAM: The first step was asking patrons in these places if they'd answer some basic questions. Some 1,300 men agreed to fill out a short survey about their socioeconomic status, health history and level of trust in the medical system. For these efforts, they received cash or a voucher for a free haircut plus a coupon for a free health screening. About half the men showed up at the clinic for that screening. Before their checkup, the clinic staff showed the men a picture of the doctor they'd been randomly assigned. They also asked them to select from a list of preventative care services that they'd be willing to receive. GARRICK: Height and weight to check body mass index, blood pressure, cholesterol, which was total cholesterol and a diabetes screen, which is hemoglobin A1c. VEDANTAM: At first, the men made similar choices. GARRICK: They all accepted generally the same level of preventative services. VEDANTAM: In other words, seeing the photos of the doctors did not change patients' decisions about what services to accept. Typically, the men would choose some of the services but not all. They might agree to get their body mass index and blood pressure checked but forgo the tests for diabetes and cholesterol that come with a needle stick. But what happened next changed their choices. GARRICK: The doctor then comes in and says, OK, Mr. Smith, you've only selected these three. You know, you've only selected height and weight and blood pressure. We really recommend that you take all five because they're all recommended. They're all good for your health. VEDANTAM: As I said, some of the black patients were randomized to receive this advice from a black doctor, some from a nonblack doctor. Did the race of the physician affect what patients did? GARRICK: The black doctors were able to convince more effectively of the patients to take more of the preventative services. VEDANTAM: And not just by a little - by a lot. The black doctors were about 20% more successful than nonblack doctors at getting patients to have their blood pressure and body mass measured. They were even more effective at persuading their patients to have invasive tests. For diabetes and the flu shot, the black doctors were about 50% more successful than nonblack doctors. And then came the cholesterol results. GARRICK: There was a 72% difference in the ability of the black doctor to recommend and have the black male patient take cholesterol screening compared to the nonblack doctor. VEDANTAM: Seventy-two percent. Now, the real-life implications of these results might be significant. High cholesterol, for instance, can lead to heart attacks, strokes. What if black patients in the real world responded to their physicians like their counterparts in the study? Owen Garrick says the gap in the United States between blacks and whites in cardiovascular disease outcomes might shrink by nearly 20%. GARRICK: That could be 20% of the people living to see their grandkids graduate from college and high school, right? That's how I think about it. (SOUNDBITE OF SIR EDWARD ELGAR'S \"POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE\") VEDANTAM: These results suggest they might be an easy, low-cost way to save the lives of black men. Owen and his colleagues wanted to understand what was going on. Why were the black doctors so much more effective? The researchers didn't think prejudice was at play because the patients rated all the physicians, black and nonblack, as equally good. But then they discovered a clue. It was in the notes the doctors had written about their patients. GARRICK: We found that the black doctors actually wrote more notes compared to the nonblack doctors about their patients. And often, those notes talked about their non-health care issues - a wedding is coming up; will the Warriors repeat as NBA champions? Like, so nonmedical issues. VEDANTAM: The black doctors and black patients were connecting as human beings. They were talking about family, sports, life. It's the kind of chitchat that says, I know where you're coming from. I hear you. Marlon Wade from the barbershop made the very same point about his doctor. WADE: She gets me. I get her. We talk about life. We talk about our religion. You know, if something wrong with me, she going to let me know. VEDANTAM: Owen's research is part of a growing body of work that suggests matching patients and doctors by race can make a difference in health outcomes. In another study, researchers found that Florida patients assigned to physicians of their own race were 13% less likely to die while in the hospital. These results were driven almost entirely by black patients matched with black physicians. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: The research raises difficult questions about our medical system, our society and our biases. The clearest takeaway from the research is that warm and empathetic communication matters. Owen Garrick believes that doctors might be taught to bridge some of the differences he observed in his study. GARRICK: Because if communication is the mechanism, you can train - or you should be able to train nonblack doctors to more effectively communicate with their patients. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: There is a more daunting takeaway. If you want better outcomes in health care, especially among the most vulnerable patients, having a more diverse pool of physicians is crucial. Owen says what he wants is for patients to have a choice. If they want to see a black doctor, they can choose one. But right now, that's often not possible. GARRICK: Four percent of physicians are black. Blacks represent 13% of the U. S. population. So an underrepresentation. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: It's important to note that choice is not just something blacks might prefer. In a follow-up survey, Owen and his team found that both black and white respondents indicated a same-race preference. Sixty-five percent of blacks surveyed said a black doctor would better understand their concerns. Seventy percent of whites said a white doctor would better understand them. There is a third implication of Owen's research, and it feels radioactive. Given the results, I asked him, should hospitals and medical centers match patients and doctors by race, particularly when it comes to black men? Owen challenged the notion that this needed to be a radioactive idea. GARRICK: Fraternities and sororities self-select by gender. You could argue that that's segregation. I wouldn't argue that that's segregation. But, you know, someone might. You know, a pessimist might. And I think in - the pessimists of the world might argue that recommending black physicians for black patients is segregation. I don't see it that way. VEDANTAM: Still, Owen acknowledges he would be uncomfortable with the idea that hospitals would deliberately steer black patients to black doctors and white patients to white doctors. After all, we struggled as a nation for decades to overcome segregation. How would patients react if they were told when they showed up at a clinic, you're black so we're sending you to the black doctor? There is some tension here, right? Because there are two values, I think, that are in conflict with one another here. I mean, there is one value that basically says, you know, we should all essentially treat one another the same. We should all get along well. We should all, you know, as Dr. King would say, look at each other's character and abilities and not the color of our skin or our gender. I mean, so that is an ideal. And the other ideal is we should trust the data, and we should trust the evidence and we should follow where the evidence leads. And it feels like those two values, following the evidence and the data and following this norm that we have about how we'd like our society to be, these two values are in conflict. GARRICK: Right. And they're partly in conflict because we don't live in an ideal world. And some might argue, skeptics of the world might argue, that we profess to live in an ideal world when we know absolutely the world is not ideal. So given that, given the cards you're dealt, the life you live, the world we exist in, how do you best, in our case, accomplish, improve health outcomes for all populations - and specifically in our research study, the black male population? And this issue of the race of the doctor seems to work. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: And it isn't just in medicine. When we come back, the results of matching people by their identities from education, to retail, to banking. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: In 1985, researchers in Tennessee launched a massive experiment to see if class sizes affected learning. There was plenty of anecdotal evidence at the time suggesting that kids did better in smaller classes, but there was no hard data to prove it. Project STAR changed that. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: More than 11,000 students from kindergarten through third grade were randomly assigned to one of three class-size groups. Researchers tracked their performance over time. The experiment is now considered one of the most important education studies ever conducted. It showed that smaller class sizes led to substantial improvements in early learning, especially for minority students. In the decades since, researchers have also come to realize the random placement of kids in Project STAR could be used to study something else. CONSTANCE LINDSAY: If you are randomizing by class size, you are also randomizing by teacher race. VEDANTAM: This is Constance Lindsay. She is an education professor at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. She said this insight led to a new research question. Do children who have a teacher of the same race do better than children who don't? Education researcher Thomas Dee was the first to analyze the Project STAR data in this new way. Did students do better if they were matched with a teacher of the same race? In 2004, he published his findings. Constance says they were striking. LINDSAY: If you're a black student and you have a black teacher, on average, you're going to have a higher test score than a black student who has a white teacher. VEDANTAM: The findings weren't just specific to black kids. They also held true for white students. Both black and white kids did better on math and reading achievement tests if they had a teacher of the same race. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Thomas Dee worried that his results might cause people to call for increased racial segregation in schools. He felt that would be a mistake. He first noted that his results only apply to how kids were doing during the four-year experiment. The results did not predict achievement over longer time periods. Second, he felt the best takeaway would be more study. He urged researchers to continue exploring why race dynamics matter in the classroom. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Fourteen years later, Constance Lindsay and her colleagues did just that. LINDSAY: Basically, what we did is we said let's use the fact that we can follow the students over many, many years and see what happens to them in terms of high school dropout, whether they take a college entrance exam, and then whether they enroll in college. VEDANTAM: In other words, they tried to answer the open question Thomas Dee had raised, do black children who are randomly assigned to black teachers perform better over the long term? What they found is those early interactions had a lasting effect. LINDSAY: Black students in our sample who were matched to a black teacher were less likely to drop out of high school, more likely to sit for a college entrance exam - so think, you know, SAT, ACT - and then more likely to enroll in college. VEDANTAM: The success of black students increased with every year they were matched with black teachers. Black students who spent more time with black teachers did better than black students who spent less time. These results could have huge implications. They suggest that race matching might be one way to get more at-risk black kids to stay in school and go on to higher education. Of course, Tennessee is just one state, and researchers wanted to make sure they weren't looking at a one-state phenomenon. So they turned to North Carolina. This state has a huge public school database. It contains all kinds of information about students, including their demographics, the classes they've taken and the race of various teachers over the years. Again, the researchers looked at kids in elementary school and then tracked them over time. Now, these kids weren't randomly matched like they were in Tennessee, but still, they had exposure to black and nonblack teachers. Constance says the results told the same story. Black kids who had had black teachers were less likely to drop out of high school. LINDSAY: And then when you finish high school in North Carolina, there's a survey you fill out that says, I will attend college, I will not attend college. It's basically, like, an intent-to-attend-college measure. And we find that more black students who are matched to black teachers report wanting to attend college. VEDANTAM: Students who benefited the most from having a black teacher were those most at risk of dropping out, low-income black boys. The North Carolina data showed that these boys were 39% less likely to drop out of high school if they had a black teacher in elementary school - 39%. What Constance and her colleagues were seeing in education is what Owen Garrick saw in medicine - race matters. Now, we don't know why these black teachers were making such a difference in the lives of their black students, but the researchers think a variety of forces might be at work. One could be implicit bias. Teachers may hold unconscious prejudices that negatively affect black students. LINDSAY: That prevent them from, you know, maybe identifying kids for things like gifted programs or enacting harsher discipline punishments. VEDANTAM: Constance says black teachers also serve as powerful role models for black students. LINDSAY: The presence of, you know, a college-educated adult in your life makes a difference. VEDANTAM: And then there's what's called cultural competence. LINDSAY: Which is that teachers are able to read behavior better if you sort of share - you know, if you have cultural things that you share in common. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This seems especially true in the area of discipline. In another research project, Constance and her colleagues have found that one reason black boys sometimes get into trouble at school is because of something researchers call willful defiance. LINDSAY: Willful defiance is, I get into an argument with the teacher and, you know, maybe I talk back, or something along those lines, and then you have to go to the principal's office. VEDANTAM: And so what do you see with willful defiance? LINDSAY: So we see that the drops in willful defiance are huge when you have a black teacher. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: But just as there's a shortage of black doctors in America, there's also a shortage of black teachers. Nationwide, teachers in elementary and secondary schools are overwhelmingly white despite growing racial diversity among students. LINDSAY: So for example, in the North Carolina data, both in the long-term study and in the discipline study that I have, over 50% of the black students never have a black teacher. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: On a very personal level, Constance knows well the lasting impression a black teacher can leave on students. LINDSAY: 'Cause my grandmother was a teacher here in D. C. public schools for a very long time. VEDANTAM: Constance describes her as a warm demander. LINDSAY: This is someone who is - you know, sort of holds you accountable for the things that you should be doing, but does it in a warm fashion. VEDANTAM: Her name was Mae Wilson (ph). DONALD WILLIAMS: Mae Wilson. Well, dealing with her, she was stern. She kept an orderly classroom. She was the boss, you know? VEDANTAM: This is Donald Williams (ph). He's in his late 60s and has lived nearly all his life in Washington, D. C. In the early 1970s, Don was a student at a school that has educated generations of African-American students, Dunbar High School. This is where Mae Wilson taught. (SOUNDBITE OF BOOK PAGES TURNING) WILLIAMS: Man, it's been a long time since I looked in this book. VEDANTAM: From an old yearbook. . . WILLIAMS: Wow. VEDANTAM: . . . Don points to his younger self, a star football player at Dunbar. WILLIAMS: Here, I was blocking. There, I was running with the football. There, I was running with the football. There, I got tackled. VEDANTAM: Most of Don's memories from high school revolve around football. Except for that homeroom teacher, Mae Wilson, whom he's never forgotten. WILLIAMS: She's, like, 5'5\", 5'4\", but her demeanor was bigger than that, you know? She didn't take a lot of, you know, nonsense. You knew it. You knew. She was like your mother away from home. But she didn't take any stuff. She didn't cut any corners. VEDANTAM: Don says there was something about Mae Wilson that made you pay attention. Maybe it was the tailored skirt suit she wore, or her air of authority. WILLIAMS: She always looked business. She always looked business. She never came in a nightclub dress, or something like that. She always looked professional. So that's another message that you saw in her, that she was - she'd stick to the rules of being on time, doing things that you need to do, not being rowdy, controlling yourself in public. VEDANTAM: Her lessons ultimately stuck and became life lessons for Don. I asked him if it made a difference to him that Mae Wilson was black. He told me the question was a no-brainer - yes, of course, it made a difference. WILLIAMS: As a black kid, you can relate better when you see someone in the position that you're in 'cause if you're not black, you can't understand what I'm saying. You can - yeah, you can say it 'cause it's the right thing - oh, I under - no. You don't. You couldn't possibly know. 'Cause you're not black. VEDANTAM: Don has the same feeling about his football coaches. He says shared identity often led to trust. WILLIAMS: Like I said, a kid needs to see someone who's been there. It's easy for you to talk it when you got it. It's easy for a rich man to tell you to save your money. He got money. How can a rich man tell a poor man what's going on, what life is about? It's got to be someone that knows the avenues to go to that someone that's black that's been through it. You know, you got to - and then, you know, that's his ticket. That's his motivation there to show you what's - how it can be done. VEDANTAM: Giving students the feeling that they are understood by their teachers, who can say this is a bad idea? But if you zoom out, putting this idea into practice runs into all sorts of problems related to history, politics and optics. I asked Constance Lindsay about this. Let's say you're the principal of a school, and you have one black teacher in second grade, and you have, let's say, 15 black students spread across five sections of second grade. Would you assign all those 15 students to the black teacher? LINDSAY: I probably would not do that. If I had students that in that particular set of 15 that were particularly disadvantaged, I might. I might also explore ways in which teachers could co-teach so that, you know, all of those 15 students would have the opportunity to interact with that teacher. But I definitely wouldn't advocate sort of segregating them into one class. VEDANTAM: Why not? That's what your data show works. LINDSAY: That is what the data show that works. But I think we agreed that segregation is bad. VEDANTAM: But I think this is what makes the paper really, really tricky, which is it's actually suggesting that's something that we thought was a good thing might have an outcome that is not such a good thing. LINDSAY: That's right. That's right. So I guess if you held a gun to my head and you said I had to pick between segregating students and, you know, making sure that students had a black teacher, I would pick that they had a black teacher. VEDANTAM: So you actually would put the students in the same class then? LINDSAY: If you said I had to. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: No, I guess what I'm asking you is not so much whether I have to but, you know, if you looked at the data and said that you are improving the odds of students by 10, 15, maybe 20%, and you did not do that thing that could improve their odds by 10, 15, 20%, I mean, that is immoral. LINDSAY: You could say that. You could say that. I mean, if I were a parent of a black boy, and there was one black male teacher in the school, I would go tell the principal to assign my child to him. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: There is some evidence the race-matching effects we see in medicine and education also show up in other spheres. At Temple University, Derek Avery and his colleagues found that customers at a retail store who interacted with sales agents of the same race had higher levels of satisfaction. This was especially true in areas where racial minorities were a larger share of the customer base. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Columbia University's Raymond Fisman found in a study conducted in India that ethnic and religious matching between bankers and customers increased the likelihood of loans being repaid. It also lowered the cost of loans because banks perceived there was a lower risk in lending money. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Other workers observed that gender can act in similar ways to racial or religious identification. Brad Greenwood at the University of Minnesota found that more women in Florida survived a heart attack when their doctor was a woman rather than a man. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: At the University of Massachusetts, social psychologist Nilanjana Dasgupta has found that female students in calculus classes were more engaged in the subject when they had a female professor rather than a male professor. NILANJANA DASGUPTA: Just having a female professor ends up making women feel they'll do better in the class or making them feel more confident, making them feel that they care more about math than when the same course material, same exam, same syllabus is taught by a male professor. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is important because calculus is a gateway class to degrees in careers in math and science, where women are currently underrepresented. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: There are three lessons from all these examples. The first is that we really need doctors and teachers and loan officers and store clerks from different races and different backgrounds. It can have tangible and measurable outcomes. The second lesson is that if we want to be understood by people who are different from us in some way, it's going to take work. You can't just assume that your job begins and ends with teaching a course or diagnosing the patient. You have to make a connection with the human being across from you. The final lesson has to do with a seemingly contradictory effect of diversity. In an earlier episode of HIDDEN BRAIN, The Edge Effect, we talked about how diversity boosts creativity and innovation. By contrast, here we've seen how connecting with people who are like us can produce better outcomes. One explanation for this contradiction lies in what you are trying to achieve. You want novelty and creativity? Those flourish from bringing together different perspectives. But if you want trust and communication, those come easier when we have things in common.

BRUMFIEL: The telescope was a small one - Girgis uses it to show celestial objects to the observatory's guests. That night, she was trying to photograph some faint galaxies. The bright satellites created over two dozen streaks across the image. GIRGIS: My first immediate reaction was that's visually kind of cool. But my second reaction was, man, you can't see a single galaxy. BRUMFIEL: The picture was basically ruined. Now, Girgis wasn't the only one to notice this.

And believe it or not, none of them thought these satellites were going to be a problem. CHRISTIANSEN: Nobody really realized until after launch that they were going to be so bright. BRUMFIEL: But the satellites are bright. And here's the thing - SpaceX is just getting started. The company plans on launching a total of nearly 12,000 satellites to provide global Internet. Other companies, including Amazon, are planning similar constellations. Space is about to get much more crowded, and Christiansen says there's not a lot astronomers can do about it. CHRISTIANSEN: Space is still a little bit of the Wild West, right? We're still working out who owns it and who gets to make the rules. BRUMFIEL: In a statement, SpaceX says it expects the satellites to grow dimmer as they reach their final orbits. And it's looking into other ways to minimize the glare problem. That will help, Christiansen says, but she also thinks the night sky is about to undergo a very big change. CHRISTIANSEN: I think with, you know, 12,000 low-Earth orbit bright satellites, now it'll be, like, hard to find the things that stay still. You're not going to see the same sky anymore. It'll be really interesting. It'll, you know, it'll be a cultural shift. BRUMFIEL: On the bright side, we'll have good Internet. CHRISTIANSEN: We will. And, you know, honestly, there's 10,000 astronomers in the world. We shouldn't stack up against the total sum of humanity, right? There are 7 billion people in the world. And the Internet is an incredible gift. It can be used for so much good. BRUMFIEL: If SpaceX succeeds, that good will soon include cat videos anywhere on earth. Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News.

CHRISTIANSEN: I think with, you know, 12,000 low-Earth orbit bright satellites, now it'll be, like, hard to find the things that stay still. You're not going to see the same sky anymore. It'll be really interesting. It'll, you know, it'll be a cultural shift. BRUMFIEL: On the bright side, we'll have good Internet. CHRISTIANSEN: We will. And, you know, honestly, there's 10,000 astronomers in the world. We shouldn't stack up against the total sum of humanity, right? There are 7 billion people in the world. And the Internet is an incredible gift. It can be used for so much good. BRUMFIEL: If SpaceX succeeds, that good will soon include cat videos anywhere on earth.

The Great Dying was the biggest extinction ever. It happened 250 million years ago and was largely caused by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. As NPR's Christopher Joyce reports, scientists are beginning to see alarming similarities between the Great Dying and what's happening to our atmosphere now. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: You can learn about the Great Dying at the new Deep Time exhibit at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. I get a backdoor visit via a giant freight elevator that's used to haul life-sized dinosaurs up to the new hall. Workers are assembling dioramas and video monitors. It's a few weeks before opening. Curator Scott Wing shows me the exhibit's crown jewel - the museum's first real Tyrannosaurus rex. What an enormous head. SCOTT WING: It's a pretty big body, too (laughter). JOYCE: The Tyrannosaurus stands over a prone triceratops, its jaws clamped on its head. But I digress. WING: Well, the truth is it really isn't a dinosaur hall. JOYCE: Yes, there are plenty of dinosaurs in it. WING: We like to say, come for the dinosaurs. Stay for everything else. JOYCE: The theme is actually the interconnectedness of life through geologic time. Exhibits show, for example, how plants at the bottom of the food chain supported everything from insects to 20-ton apatosauruses. Wing likes that. He's a botanist. WING: I'm a photosynthesis chauvinist (laughter). The whole ecosystem is based on photosynthesis. JOYCE: And because life, from toadstools to tyrannosaurs, is connected, when something big happens to the Earth, the whole fabric can disintegrate. And that happened due to global warming. It's explained in the exhibit's Great Dying section. WING: This is it. This is the big one. JOYCE: The exhibit explains that an enormous volcanic field erupted in what is now Siberia. It spewed carbon dioxide and pollution into the atmosphere, possibly for millions of years. That warmed the planet, made the oceans acidic and robbed them of oxygen. There have been other mass extinctions like the one that wiped out the dinosaurs, but this one at the end of the Permian period was about what happens when too much carbon dioxide rises into the atmosphere. WING: Those are lessons that we can learn from studying the past. And they're also those sort of processes that are being observed by Earth scientists today. JOYCE: Earth scientists like Curtis Deutsch of the University of Washington, whose research helped inform the Smithsonian curators. CURTIS DEUTSCH: The very same things that caused the Great Dying are happening right now in our ocean today as a result of human activities - not to the same degree but in the same direction. JOYCE: So Deutsch thought, why not recreate the hothouse of the Great Dying in a computer and see how present-day life would fare? He could crank up the heat and lower the oxygen and watch as parts of the ocean started to become deadly. DEUTSCH: The first thing that happens is that you start to see a local loss of species as they begin to move in response to the climate heating up. JOYCE: But some parts of the planet were more forgiving. DEUTSCH: And we discovered something that was kind of surprising and new, I think. And that is that extinction was very strong everywhere, but it was even stronger near the cold parts of Earth in the - near the polar oceans than it was in the warmer, tropical oceans. JOYCE: It makes sense, he says. Animals that live near the equator can migrate toward the poles to find cooler water. But those that already live in cold, oxygen-rich waters near the poles have very little room to run. Deutsch says the experiment is a window on the future, even the present. Marine species are already migrating. DEUTSCH: We see responses of marine species to those changes today that look like what we think happened at the end of the Permian. JOYCE: And that, says the Smithsonian's Scott Wing, is what visitors should take away from the new exhibit. WING: We're so powerful, we are basically a geological force now as well as a human force. JOYCE: A force that's changing the conditions for life on the planet. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

NPR science correspondent Joe Palca recently went to Oak Ridge to learn more. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: There's a 40 or 50-foot-tall cottonwood tree growing right behind one of the research buildings on the national lab campus. Cottonwoods are tall, straight trees with leaves the shape of spades. Chris Schadt is an environmental microbiologist. He offered to try to demonstrate the phenomenon. He starts assembling a tool he's brought out to the tree. So hang on. Tell me what you just put together there. CHRIS SCHADT: So I put together what we call an increment borer. It's got a hollow tube and a handle. It's a T-formation. And you can just pick a spot in the tree. PALCA: Schadt picks a spot about chest-high. SCHADT: So once we get to what would be approximately the center, you take the extractor. . . PALCA: The extractor is basically a long, thin spatula that slides inside the borer. SCHADT: Insert it in here, give a couple of turns backwards, you can pull out a core of a tree. PALCA: In this case, we're not interested in the core. We're interested in what might be coming out of the hollow tube that's now stuck into the tree. SCHADT: Some of the trees produce methane in the tree. PALCA: Methane is the gas in natural gas. SCHADT: And you could actually light the methane on fire coming out of it. This one does not appear to have any trapped methane. PALCA: But many do. So what's going on here? Why is methane coming out of a tree? Well, the answer lies with a property of cottonwoods. SCHADT: The wood in this particular species sort of naturally has this condition called wetwood where it's saturated within the trunk of the tree. PALCA: And this wetwood makes for a welcoming home for all sorts of microorganisms. MELISSA CREGGER: You can't actually see a lot of the organisms because we can't grow a lot of these organisms, so we're able to identify them using their gene sequences. PALCA: Melissa Cregger is an ecologist at Oak Ridge. She says some of those organisms called archaea turned out to be known methane producers. So it's not the trees themselves producing the methane. It's the microbes living in the tree. Cregger says scientists have known for a while that these organisms existed in forests but not in the trees themselves. CREGGER: We had historically worked below ground looking at soil communities, root communities. PALCA: Cregger says because methane is a potent greenhouse gas, it's important to see how much the trees are actually producing. And that raises a surprising notion - yes, trees take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, a good thing. But they also add methane, a potentially bad thing. But University of Delaware ecologist Rodrigo Vargas says trees are most likely doing more good than harm. RODRIGO VARGAS: It's not like now trees are the bad actors, and now they're emitting methane, and now we're seeing a big source of that. It's not like that. PALCA: Vargas says that's because the amount of methane coming from the trees is small compared with other sources. Vargas is interested in getting a better understanding of the gases trees produce. He's developing an automated system because doing the measurements manually would be a giant pain. VARGAS: Because then you would need to be there in the tree and measuring (laughter) every half an hour forever, right? And if it rains, you have to be there. If it's - you actually have to be there. No, if you're uncomfortable, hungry, you have to be there. PALCA: Once his automated system is up and running, he's hoping to be able to see if the amount of methane increases from time to time, for example after a big storm or when the temperature suddenly changes. VARGAS: We have the opportunity to see these patterns that no one has seen before. PALCA: Perhaps this is one of those cases where it's more important to see the trees than the whole forest.

Do something over and over and over, and your brain eventually masters that activity. But what if your brain could be so ready to learn that you didn't have to practice something so many times to master it? Some top athletes are training with headsets that are supposed to stimulate their brain cells, make their brains more ready to learn so practice is more effective. NPR's Elise Hu has been trying it out as part of our video series on how emerging technologies may shape our future. It is called Future You With Elise Hu. And she spoke with Steve. STEVE INSKEEP, BYLINE: Hi there. ELISE HU, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning. INSKEEP: OK, so I watched your video, and you've got this thing on. And it looks like one of those old-timey, like, 1990s big, old stereo headsets. What is it really? HU: That's right. It's a headset that looks like headphones like Beats by Dre, but it's actually a brain-stimulating device that can zap you with tiny currents, so you don't feel anything. The electrical charge is super low. . . INSKEEP: But you're getting shocked. HU: Yes (laughter). You are supposed to wear it for about 20 minutes before you practice this golf swing or squats or lunges, any repetitive activity that you could get better at over time. And what it's doing is it's priming your brain before you do that activity. So to try it out here at NPR West, I decided to learn something I've never done before - vertical jump. OK, so then. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Get comfortable and then just jump straight up. Boom, there it is. NATE ROTT, BYLINE: Nice. HU: OK. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: So you're looking at 14 inches on the dot. ROTT: Wow. HU: OK, 14 inches. ROTT: That's more than a foot. HU: So I needed to actually train on jumping over four to six weeks while wearing this headset. And then NPR reporter Nate Rott did not get a headset. And we trained together. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HU: Oh, that was much longer than mine. Jeez. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Seventeen inches. ROTT: Got three inches on you. HU: Oh, my gosh. So he's already. . . So this isn't. . . INSKEEP: He's the control group, like the placebo. OK, fine. HU: This isn't exactly a perfect science experiment, but we wanted to try this to see if I could improve better than he did. So for another month after this, I used this headset before working out. Nate then worked out with me, but he didn't get a headset. INSKEEP: OK, so what's the big thing you're trying to get at by testing your vertical jump? HU: So the entire video series Future You is about exploring where new technologies are going to take us by 2050. And in this case, what we're looking at is electrical stimulation for your brain. The technical term is called transcranial direct-current stimulation. We are still waiting for more of a body of clinical data on this. We do know that one DARPA-funded study showed as much as a 40% improvement in performance in primates. INSKEEP: DARPA - that's the Pentagon science guys. HU: That's right. They are testing this on the military. The one I used actually does have a contract with the DoD. It's from a company called Halo. And I asked the founder of the company where he thinks this might lead us a few decades into the future. He's a Stanford trained MD named Dr. Dan Chao. DAN CHAO: Like, could we be more attentive and focused as a society? You know, advance ourselves, advance humanity - that's a good thing. HU: So you're expecting kind of a super cognition - right? - like advanced memory capabilities, advanced focus capabilities. CHAO: Advanced focus and - like, I would use it when I needed to get meaningful work done. If I could have had a neuro stimulator to help me with focus, I would've been a better student. HU: If humans can be upgraded this much, then are we creating different classes of humans? Or even with athletes, there's asterisks by those who used steroids. CHAO: There's legal performance enhancement that's all around us, like drinking coffee. It's been identified by the World Anti-Doping Association as performance enhancing, yet it's legal. What WADA considers illegal is things that are unsafe to the health of the athlete and against the spirit of the sport. I would argue it isn't. INSKEEP: OK, it's said for the moment it's cool for athletes to use this as they train, which brings us back to your vertical jump, Elise. How'd you do? HU: So not scientific but after about a month of training with the headset. . . (Laughter). . . . I was able to increase my vertical jump by 11%. INSKEEP: Is that good? I don't know. HU: Well, it was pretty surprising, even for me. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: You got some ups. ROTT: Serious ups. INSKEEP: How'd Nate do? - the control group. HU: Nate Rott only increased his vertical jump by 8%. So I like to think I won. INSKEEP: Well, Elise, thanks very much for the insights - really appreciate it. HU: You're welcome.

For years, scientists have been attempting to understand how far we can push the human body. Herman Pontzer of Duke University is a professor of evolutionary anthropology, and he is one of those researchers. He joins us now from Durham, N. C. Welcome to the program. HERMAN PONTZER: Thanks for having me. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So your study came out last week in the journal Science Advances. You studied athletes who basically ran a marathon a day for months. They got one day off a week to rest. First off, who are these people? (Laughter)PONTZER: Yeah, they don't seem like normal people, do they? - to (laughter). . . GARCIA-NAVARRO: No. PONTZER: . . . Jump at an opportunity like this. So it was organized by a coauthor on the study, Bryce Carlson, who's done a lot of really amazing endurance events like this. And he helped organize this - yeah, this race across the USA that went from the Pacific Ocean down to Washington, D. C. , over five months and asked if I wanted to tag along and asked if my lab wanted to measure energy expenditures of the racers. And of course we said sure. It sounded, you know, too good to pass up - this unique opportunity to get people pushing the limits. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what did you find out? PONTZER: Well, you know, it's analogous to running track and field events. So you can - you know, if you sprint for a hundred meters, you can go very fast. If you have to run a mile, it's a bit slower. If you have to run a marathon, it's even slower still. And as you push yourself for longer and longer, the limits of what you're able to do go down and down. It's this sort of curved relationship between intensity and duration. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What exactly determines our limits? PONTZER: That limit to what we can do indefinitely, forever, is determined by how quickly we can get calories back in because we have to be able to replenish the calories we burn each day if we want to keep ourselves in energy balance. That energy-balance limit, which is the limit to what we can sustain forever, is set by how fast our guts can bring calories into our bodies. GARCIA-NAVARRO: How did you collect the data? PONTZER: So we used this really cool isotope-tracking technique. People drink some isotopically enriched water. It's totally safe. But what it allows us to do is calculate how much carbon dioxide your body produces. And that gives us a really precise measure of how many calories you're burning every day. GARCIA-NAVARRO: The sample size, though, was quite small - just six people. How confident are you in the results? PONTZER: Well, if it was just this one study with these racers across North America, then that's right, it would be too small of a study to say much. But what we did is we took this study of six racers, and we compared it to all the other work that's ever been done measuring energy expenditures in triathletes, hundred-mile ultramarathon runners, Tour de France cyclists, people who have trekked across Antarctica to reach the South Pole. And, you know, if you put all these studies together, you plot out this very crisp, clear boundary that is the boundary of human ability. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And you had an interesting takeaway, and it had to do with pregnant women. PONTZER: That's right. So when you're mapping out the longest duration events you could find that are the most intense, what you find is that pregnancy is the full end of the spectrum of what humans are capable of. So nine months long. . . GARCIA-NAVARRO: Tell me about it. PONTZER: Yeah - incredible. . . GARCIA-NAVARRO: (Laughter). PONTZER: . . . Amounts of energy expenditure. I don't think any woman who's gone through pregnancy is surprised by this. It's pushing your body to the very limits of what you can do. It's the - you know, it is the ultra ultramarathon of human endurance - is pregnancy. And it plots right on that same boundary of human capability with Tour de France cyclists and Arctic trekkers and everybody else. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, that is a study that I think many women could get behind. That was Dr. Herman Pontzer, associate professor of evolutionary anthropology at Duke University. Thank you so much.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. People in romantic relationships often share things in common - a love of the same sports team, maybe the same religion, sometimes a common profession. But for some couples, the similarities go further. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: The girl that I'm dating now, we have the same birthday, which is kind of cool. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: My fiance, Israel (ph), and I have the same birthday, which is something we discovered on our second date. VEDANTAM: You could say this isn't so surprising. There are lots of people in the world, and sooner or later, some people are going to get together with others who happen to have the same birthday. But there's evidence this may be more than just a coincidence. Having a common birthday seems to actually draw people closer to one another. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: When I first went to a new hairstylist, we found out that we have the same birthday, and we call each other birthday twins, and I wound up going to that hair stylist for years, even after she switched salons, even after we moved. I would drive 40 minutes to go get my hair cut by her. VEDANTAM: Some people see so much significance in shared birthdays, or even shared numbers in two birthdays, that they select dates for important events based on those patterns. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: My birthday is August 2, and my husband Blake's (ph) birthday is August 9, and we got married on August 29. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: My wife and I share the same birthday, July 6, and we are also married on that day. JANETTA CRAVENS: My birthday is October 27, and with my first husband, his birthday was September 27, and we had the opportunity to get married on August 27. It was a no-brainer. We decided to do that. VEDANTAM: The woman you just heard, Janetta Cravens (ph) from Oklahoma City, says her love for people with the same birthday extends beyond her love life. CRAVENS: October 27 is also Teddy Roosevelt's birthday, and so I've always felt a little affinity for him and for his leadership. VEDANTAM: Shared birthdays, in fact, aren't the only thing that draw people closer to one another. Janetta also finds herself drawn to people who happen to have the same name. CRAVENS: When I meet another Janetta, there's an automatic like, oh, my gosh, I can't believe we have the same name. And then if it happens to be that we have the same spelling - and I'll tell you, I've only met two people who have the same spelling as me, but I can tell you who they are and I felt an automatic kinship. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: These unexpected connections with strangers can be lovely moments. But there's something else at work, too, something we may not be aware of, something that affects all of us. In Greek mythology, the hunter Narcissus was so enamored of his own beauty that he fell in love with a reflection of himself. Modern psychology shows that we all have a little bit of Narcissus in us. Most of us like people who remind us of ourselves, whether that's someone else with the same name or someone with the same birthday. Most of the time, such self-love is amusing and harmless, maybe even beneficial, a sign of good self-esteem. But there are times when falling in love with ourselves or with people who remind us of ourselves can be a real problem. This week on HIDDEN BRAIN - what we are calling the Narcissus Effect. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Researchers have long observed a tendency for people to be drawn to others who are like them in some way. When we hear someone else has the same birthday or the same name, we feel a little tug of kinship. Some of us might even be drawn to move to states that sound familiar. BRETT PELHAM: There's at least a modest tendency for women named Georgia to gravitate toward Georgia, women named Virginia to gravitate toward Virginia, and the more closely the name resembles a state, the bigger the effect appears to be. VEDANTAM: This is Brett Pelham. He's a professor of psychology at Montgomery College in Maryland. He studies something called implicit egotism. PELHAM: Which is the idea that many biases are unconscious. And one very well-studied bias was egotism, valuing the self favorably, protecting the self and so forth. And so we simply got the idea that there are several different things that at least to some degree reflect a preference for the self and an attraction to things that resemble the self. VEDANTAM: Like having an affinity for someone with the same birthday or someone with the same name or even going into a profession that sounds like an echo of your name. PELHAM: So we originally looked at whether people named Dennis (ph) or Denise (ph) gravitate toward dentistry. But we learned pretty quickly. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PELHAM: . . . That it's really hard to get data on those things. So you - there aren't great directories of medical professionals. There is a guy named Abel who was able to document, and I was a reviewer on his paper and I. . . VEDANTAM: So now every time you say this, I'm going to jump in and say a guy named Abel who was able to do something. PELHAM: He was able to do a lot of things. He showed that people whose last name is doctor or whose last name is the word lawyer, the name Lawyer, gravitated toward those two professions. VEDANTAM: There are lots of other examples. Brett looked at a massive database of millions of Americans, names from the recently released 1940 census, to examine if there were broad patterns, like. . . PELHAM: Carpenters working in carpentry, bakers working as bakers, butchers working as butchers, miners working as miners, masons working as masons. So we looked at every surname there is - currently, the top 2,000 surnames - that happens to be a career name, and we looked at all of them. There are 11 of them that are pretty common. I just listed a few. And for every single surname in the 1940s census with something like a - I think it was 130 million people - we were able to show that for every single surname there was at least a weak tendency for people to gravitate toward careers that perfectly matched their last names. VEDANTAM: So the obvious thing to say, of course, is that the reason you have a slightly larger number of carpenters be Carpenters is that the name Carpenter probably originated from families who were in carpentry. And so there is some kind of ancestral connection to the profession that is driving both the names and the choices. PELHAM: Quite possibly, but if you do the math, you pretty quickly see it gets to be a pretty tiny percentage of people. So if you assume that even over 10 generations, there's a 50% chance that you did what your dad did and a 50% chance that he did what his grandfather did, which is probably higher than reality, you're talking about a probability of less than 1 in 1,000 already over 10 generations. In other words, surnames are so old and they change hands, you know, when a woman named Carpenter marries a guy named Farmer, for example, that that's really - it really just can't account for an effect anywhere near this magnitude. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Brett Pelham has looked at large data sets and public records like the Social Security Death Index or state marriage records, databases with information about millions of Americans, and he and his fellow researchers have seen all kinds of funny effects. Like, for example, one listener called in to say she and her husband were both born on the 25 day of different months. This isn't as uncommon as you might think. Beyond what you might expect by mere chance. . . PELHAM: There's about a 7% bias in that direction. So if you should have a thousand people doing that, you have 1,070 people doing that. VEDANTAM: If that doesn't sound like a lot, you're right. You should think of implicit egotism as a tiny, invisible nudge. It won't shape what everyone does all the time, but it does shape what some people do some of the time. It's when you multiply these small effects over hundreds of millions of people that you start to see lots of examples. Brett says that if you really love your birthday, the effect gets even larger. PELHAM: Our operational definition of really loving your birthday was getting married on your birthday number. So if you got married on the 13 of the month, you were quite a bit more likely to marry another person who also had the number 13 as his birthday number. VEDANTAM: Again, Brett calls this an implicit bias for a reason. You may not be consciously choosing things as important as your spouse or your profession or the place you call home based on arbitrary factors like your name or your birthday. He thinks the bias comes about simply because we like our names and our birthdays and have positive associations with them. PELHAM: And so you just associate your name with all the wonderful things that come along with that. And the best bit of evidence I have that I've never bothered to publish is there's one part of people's names they don't like that much, and that's their middle names. You know, and the joke about that is the sole purpose of a child's middle name is to know when he's really in trouble. And my additional comment is to know if he might be a serial killer someday, right? VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PELHAM: So the middle name is not nearly as loved as the first or the last name. People feel very ambivalent about their middle name. VEDANTAM: There can be other reasons for ambivalence. Sometimes we dislike it when another person has the same birthday. If you were born on April 20, you might hate the fact Hitler was born on that day, too. Brett finds that if a consumer product happens to have your name on it but is poorly built, you are more likely to hate that product. People dislike seeing something inferior in the world that has their name on it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: As Brett and I were talking, I realized something a little uncomfortable - that I myself had fallen prey to implicit egotism. You know, as you're talking right now, I am realizing something about myself for the very first time. There is - there was a philosopher in India whose name was Shankara - my name - and he actually taught a philosophy that is known as Vedanta. And I've always been drawn to the fact that I find the philosophy of Vedanta to be very interesting, and the fact that Shankara taught that philosophy I thought was just charming. But now as I'm listening to you say this, I'm realizing that this could just be implicit egotism. PELHAM: I've read his work very well, and it truly is wonderful. It's brilliant. So I think in this case, you made the objectively good decision. Yeah. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) At the same time, it does make you think, though. PELHAM: Absolutely, yes. VEDANTAM: Has this ever happened to you, Brett? Do you ever think about yourself and how implicit egotism is affecting you? PELHAM: We're getting a little personal here, but I can't resist being a little bit personal. I would say that probably the most dramatic example is that my son Matthew, his last name is Polan (ph). His mother's last name was Polan. My last name is Pelham. And I entered a relationship with her before I developed this theory (laughter) not after I developed the theory to validate the theory. VEDANTAM: So you're a Pelham and you got into a relationship with a woman named Polan? PELHAM: Polan - and we are very different in most other ways. That's about as much as I'll say about that (laughter). VEDANTAM: Are you saying that the names played some kind of a role? PELHAM: I have to think it did. I have to think - and we were from different backgrounds, different religions. I mean, we're - we come from very different worlds. Yeah, and yet, I was very attracted to her. VEDANTAM: So. . . PELHAM: And worse yet, she was attracted to me, right? VEDANTAM: Yeah (laughter). So I understand why you would sort of call this charming, and I think if you do this work for a while, there is a certain smile that comes to your face as you sort of look at these connections and you sort of see - you understand sort of the choices that human beings make. But I do think there's something disturbing about it because I think there is a very strong sense that I think most of us have. I have the sense, even though I've been covering the world of the unconscious mind for the last 10 years, I have the sense that my choices are deliberate choices, that I've thought about them. I'm actually making them intentional. I'm making them intentionally. And the idea that you're coming in and telling me that there are these hidden factors that come in and change how I think about myself, it is a disturbing idea. PELHAM: It is a little bit disturbing. And of course, most people do what you and I do, which is say, well, of course, that applies to the rest of the world, but I in particular would never fall prey to implicit racial bias or implicit egotism. So most of us do tend to sort of separate ourselves from even our own findings. But I've become, in the past decade or so, comfortable enough with the study that I have to admit that I really never know for sure exactly why I did something. I mean, sometimes I have a pretty good idea, but I don't - I certainly don't kid myself anymore to say that I even usually know why I do what I do. I mean, there's just too much research - and much of which you've documented and reported on - that show that biases we're completely unaware, nudge us, sometimes powerfully drive us, in very particular directions. So I think I've just kind of let go of it. It was disturbing to me when I first began to study it - disturbing as well as delightful. And now it's become more delightful and less disturbing. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: So perhaps you're wondering, how does any of this matter? Who cares if people born on the 23 of September marry those born on the 23 of July? Who cares if someone named Betsy Carpenter gravitates towards carpentry? Why does it matter if I prefer a philosopher whose name is similar to my own? PELHAM: It at least raises tough questions about the degree to which we have free will. So I think some people who have pretty negative reactions to this work are very threatened by it in the sense that it suggests that very important decisions have at least a little nudging influence based on things that you're completely unaware of. So if people are more likely than they should be by chance to marry another person who happens to share their birthday number, that's not an objectively great reason to get married. You should get married because you share values. You're both Republicans. You're both rabid Marxists. But learning that these subtle little influences can affect what you do, apparently, to some people is - I find it delightful. But some people find it pretty threatening. I don't think that it proves that there's no such thing as free will. But it - to me, it does suggest that we don't always have free will. Sometimes we make a decision for one reason that we've told ourself when really the more powerful underlying reason is something we could have never put our fingers on. VEDANTAM: And this isn't just a matter of being drawn to someone who shares your birthday. In general, we tend to prefer things and people who have something to do with us. And that can be a big problem. PELHAM: Absolutely. I do a little bit of research on social justice, and that's one of the things that concerns me most, is that we tend to focus on people who are more like us, who speak our language, who speak our idiom, who look like us, who worship like us. And we pay much less attention, sadly, to the problems of people who don't. On the other hand, I think this finding, like any finding in psychology or behavioral economics, can be used for good or evil. And it - the way it works in the real world can be used for good or bad. And so a great example that I perceive as at least a cousin of implicit egotism is a study I think was done by Eliot Smith and colleagues about 10 years ago. He looked at implicit racial bias. And he looked at implicit racial bias as a function of whether a person from a different ethnic group - I think he had whites and African Americans, for example - had simply given you a gentle friendly touch on the shoulder. And if they had given you a friendly, gentle hello-how-are-you touch, that reduced their implicit racial bias. So to me, when another person becomes a part of you, even in a very tiny way - you play intramural basketball with this person. And you didn't like his group. But now that you meet him and he's on your team, suddenly he becomes a part of you. His group becomes a part of you. And your stereotypes get softened and diminished a little bit. VEDANTAM: When we come back, we're going to look at how the Narcissus effect shapes another important part of your life. If you can fall in love with your name or your birthday, can't you also fall in love with your own ideas, your own work? Of course you can. Researchers call this the Ikea effect. DANIEL MOCHON: We come to overvalue the things that we have created ourselves. VEDANTAM: We'll also look at the implications this can have for things much bigger and much more complicated than Swedish furniture. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. The actress Amy Poehler once said, Ikea is Swedish for argument. Researcher Daniel Mochon has one explanation for why build-it-yourself furniture can cause so much friction between partners. MOCHON: Imagine that you built a table. Maybe it came out a little bit crooked. Probably your wife or your neighbor would see it for what it is, you know, probably a shoddy piece of workmanship. But to you, that table might seem really great because you're the one who created it. It is the fruit of your labor, and that is really the idea behind the Ikea effect. It is that we come to overvalue the things that we have created ourselves. VEDANTAM: Brett Pelham's research about our preference for people and places that are associated with us made me think about a related idea. The Narcissus effect also shows up in our preference for things that we make ourselves. MOCHON: The way people usually think about Ikea is that Ikea gives you good furniture for a low cost because they offload lots of the costs onto their consumer - the assembly costs. But in fact, we're in a sense challenging that idea and saying that there's actually psychological benefit behind this, that actually people might end up liking their furniture more because they built it. And so it's not so much a cost but a benefit that they get to build their own furniture. VEDANTAM: Daniel and his co-authors did a series of experiments to test this hypothesis. They brought volunteers into the lab and gave them either a Lego car preassembled or gave them Legos and instructions and told the participants to build a car themselves. Then they asked the volunteers, how much would you pay to keep your Lego car? MOCHON: And what we find is that the people who build their own Legos not only are willing to pay more to keep their assembled Legos, but also, when we asked them how proud they are of their own creations, they tend to be prouder of their Legos. And mind you, these are Legos that are designed to 5 to 7-year-olds. But nonetheless, there seems to be some competence, some pride associated with one's creation, even for basic things as building Legos. VEDANTAM: The researchers replicated the study using other products, like Ikea furniture, and the effect was the same. People who spent time and effort building something felt proud of what they had built, fell in love with it and were willing to pay lots of money to keep the things they'd built. From the perspective of a rational economist, this doesn't make much sense. MOCHON: The students might be willing to pay twice as much money to buy the exact same Lego car if they just finished building that Lego car than if the Lego car was given to them prebuilt. VEDANTAM: So why might people value something more after building it themselves compared to buying the same product made by someone else for half the cost? MOCHON: Our hypothesis was that people tend to use products to signal valued identities to both themselves and to others. And we know that an identity that people really care about is showing that they're competent. This is sort of one of the basics of human motivation. And so we hypothesized that people use self-made products as a way to signal competence to both themselves and to others. You know, having just built a table or having just built a bookcase, that bookcase - that's completed products - acts in a sense of a badge of my own personal competence. I completed it. Therefore, I know I'm a competent person. And moreover, I can display this product and signal that identity, this competent identity, to others. And so we hypothesized that it was these feelings of competence associated with the products that led to their increasing valuation. VEDANTAM: To test the theory that people's feelings of competence was behind the Ikea effect, the researchers had some participants think about other qualities they might value in themselves besides competence - things like honesty or intelligence or humor. Basically, the idea was if we make it less important for people to demonstrate competence, do they still overvalue their own creations? MOCHON: So we found that the Ikea effect disappeared when we did that manipulation. So once competence wasn't that important to people, people, our participants, no longer seemed to get much value out of creating their own products, again, suggesting that the reason why we tend to like our own creations is because we use them as a way to signal competence, both to ourselves and to others. VEDANTAM: Here's the flip side of that coin. You can make the Ikea effect stronger by getting people to question their competence. In one experiment, Daniel and his colleagues gave participants math problems to solve before asking them to build an Ikea project. If the problems were difficult, lots of people failed to solve them. Now volunteers became much more likely to want to demonstrate their competence through the Ikea building project. MOCHON: The participants who, at least temporarily, had their sense of competence threatened, who got the very difficult math questions, tended to be more willing to build their own product. So when we surveyed them and asked them, would you prefer to have an Ikea product that comes prebuilt or the exact same product that comes unbuilt and you would build it yourself, those who got difficult math problems and were feeling somewhat incompetent at the time seemed more willing. They were much more likely to want to build the product themselves and therefore, in a sense, restore their sense of competence through this activity. VEDANTAM: I mean, give me the numbers here. I mean, was this a big effect? Was this a small effect? I mean, what happens when people feel bad compared to when they don't feel bad? MOCHON: So what we found is that about a third of the people wanted to build the Ikea bookshelf in the control condition when they weren't made to feel bad. And this number went up to about 60% when they were made to feel bad - so significantly larger number of people wanted to do this. VEDANTAM: The Ikea effect and implicit egotism might seem at first blush to be interesting and amusing but not terribly significant. But the more I thought about this, the more I saw the potential implications. Just as we can be drawn to those who have the same birthday as us or the same name as us, we might also be more inclined to help people who look like us or sound like us or live near us. Let's hear a congressperson who's drafted a particular piece of legislation. Your commitment to that bill might outweigh its importance to the public. Or let's say you're a president who starts a war. After years of investing your time and effort to prosecute that war, you may find it difficult to accept evidence that you made a mistake. It's fine to gaze lovingly in the mirror and to feel invested in our own ideas. But like Narcissus discovered himself, falling in love with our own reflection can come at great peril.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST:  This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. People in romantic relationships often share things in common - a love of the same sports team, maybe the same religion, sometimes a common profession. But for some couples, the similarities go further. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: The girl that I'm dating now, we have the same birthday, which is kind of cool. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: My fiance, Israel (ph), and I have the same birthday, which is something we discovered on our second date. VEDANTAM: You could say this isn't so surprising. There are lots of people in the world, and sooner or later, some people are going to get together with others who happen to have the same birthday. But there's evidence this may be more than just a coincidence. Having a common birthday seems to actually draw people closer to one another. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: When I first went to a new hairstylist, we found out that we have the same birthday, and we call each other birthday twins, and I wound up going to that hair stylist for years, even after she switched salons, even after we moved. I would drive 40 minutes to go get my hair cut by her. VEDANTAM: Some people see so much significance in shared birthdays, or even shared numbers in two birthdays, that they select dates for important events based on those patterns. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: My birthday is August 2, and my husband Blake's (ph) birthday is August 9, and we got married on August 29. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: My wife and I share the same birthday, July 6, and we are also married on that day. JANETTA CRAVENS: My birthday is October 27, and with my first husband, his birthday was September 27, and we had the opportunity to get married on August 27. It was a no-brainer. We decided to do that. VEDANTAM: The woman you just heard, Janetta Cravens (ph) from Oklahoma City, says her love for people with the same birthday extends beyond her love life. CRAVENS: October 27 is also Teddy Roosevelt's birthday, and so I've always felt a little affinity for him and for his leadership. VEDANTAM: Shared birthdays, in fact, aren't the only thing that draw people closer to one another. Janetta also finds herself drawn to people who happen to have the same name. CRAVENS: When I meet another Janetta, there's an automatic like, oh, my gosh, I can't believe we have the same name. And then if it happens to be that we have the same spelling - and I'll tell you, I've only met two people who have the same spelling as me, but I can tell you who they are and I felt an automatic kinship. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: These unexpected connections with strangers can be lovely moments. But there's something else at work, too, something we may not be aware of, something that affects all of us. In Greek mythology, the hunter Narcissus was so enamored of his own beauty that he fell in love with a reflection of himself. Modern psychology shows that we all have a little bit of Narcissus in us. Most of us like people who remind us of ourselves, whether that's someone else with the same name or someone with the same birthday. Most of the time, such self-love is amusing and harmless, maybe even beneficial, a sign of good self-esteem. But there are times when falling in love with ourselves or with people who remind us of ourselves can be a real problem. This week on HIDDEN BRAIN - what we are calling the Narcissus Effect. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Researchers have long observed a tendency for people to be drawn to others who are like them in some way. When we hear someone else has the same birthday or the same name, we feel a little tug of kinship. Some of us might even be drawn to move to states that sound familiar. BRETT PELHAM: There's at least a modest tendency for women named Georgia to gravitate toward Georgia, women named Virginia to gravitate toward Virginia, and the more closely the name resembles a state, the bigger the effect appears to be. VEDANTAM: This is Brett Pelham. He's a professor of psychology at Montgomery College in Maryland. He studies something called implicit egotism. PELHAM: Which is the idea that many biases are unconscious. And one very well-studied bias was egotism, valuing the self favorably, protecting the self and so forth. And so we simply got the idea that there are several different things that at least to some degree reflect a preference for the self and an attraction to things that resemble the self. VEDANTAM: Like having an affinity for someone with the same birthday or someone with the same name or even going into a profession that sounds like an echo of your name. PELHAM: So we originally looked at whether people named Dennis (ph) or Denise (ph) gravitate toward dentistry. But we learned pretty quickly. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PELHAM: . . . That it's really hard to get data on those things. So you - there aren't great directories of medical professionals. There is a guy named Abel who was able to document, and I was a reviewer on his paper and I. . . VEDANTAM: So now every time you say this, I'm going to jump in and say a guy named Abel who was able to do something. PELHAM: He was able to do a lot of things. He showed that people whose last name is doctor or whose last name is the word lawyer, the name Lawyer, gravitated toward those two professions. VEDANTAM: There are lots of other examples. Brett looked at a massive database of millions of Americans, names from the recently released 1940 census, to examine if there were broad patterns, like. . . PELHAM: Carpenters working in carpentry, bakers working as bakers, butchers working as butchers, miners working as miners, masons working as masons. So we looked at every surname there is - currently, the top 2,000 surnames - that happens to be a career name, and we looked at all of them. There are 11 of them that are pretty common. I just listed a few. And for every single surname in the 1940s census with something like a - I think it was 130 million people - we were able to show that for every single surname there was at least a weak tendency for people to gravitate toward careers that perfectly matched their last names. VEDANTAM: So the obvious thing to say, of course, is that the reason you have a slightly larger number of carpenters be Carpenters is that the name Carpenter probably originated from families who were in carpentry. And so there is some kind of ancestral connection to the profession that is driving both the names and the choices. PELHAM: Quite possibly, but if you do the math, you pretty quickly see it gets to be a pretty tiny percentage of people. So if you assume that even over 10 generations, there's a 50% chance that you did what your dad did and a 50% chance that he did what his grandfather did, which is probably higher than reality, you're talking about a probability of less than 1 in 1,000 already over 10 generations. In other words, surnames are so old and they change hands, you know, when a woman named Carpenter marries a guy named Farmer, for example, that that's really - it really just can't account for an effect anywhere near this magnitude. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Brett Pelham has looked at large data sets and public records like the Social Security Death Index or state marriage records, databases with information about millions of Americans, and he and his fellow researchers have seen all kinds of funny effects. Like, for example, one listener called in to say she and her husband were both born on the 25 day of different months. This isn't as uncommon as you might think. Beyond what you might expect by mere chance. . . PELHAM: There's about a 7% bias in that direction. So if you should have a thousand people doing that, you have 1,070 people doing that. VEDANTAM: If that doesn't sound like a lot, you're right. You should think of implicit egotism as a tiny, invisible nudge. It won't shape what everyone does all the time, but it does shape what some people do some of the time. It's when you multiply these small effects over hundreds of millions of people that you start to see lots of examples. Brett says that if you really love your birthday, the effect gets even larger. PELHAM: Our operational definition of really loving your birthday was getting married on your birthday number. So if you got married on the 13 of the month, you were quite a bit more likely to marry another person who also had the number 13 as his birthday number. VEDANTAM: Again, Brett calls this an implicit bias for a reason. You may not be consciously choosing things as important as your spouse or your profession or the place you call home based on arbitrary factors like your name or your birthday. He thinks the bias comes about simply because we like our names and our birthdays and have positive associations with them. PELHAM: And so you just associate your name with all the wonderful things that come along with that. And the best bit of evidence I have that I've never bothered to publish is there's one part of people's names they don't like that much, and that's their middle names. You know, and the joke about that is the sole purpose of a child's middle name is to know when he's really in trouble. And my additional comment is to know if he might be a serial killer someday, right? VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PELHAM: So the middle name is not nearly as loved as the first or the last name. People feel very ambivalent about their middle name. VEDANTAM: There can be other reasons for ambivalence. Sometimes we dislike it when another person has the same birthday. If you were born on April 20, you might hate the fact Hitler was born on that day, too. Brett finds that if a consumer product happens to have your name on it but is poorly built, you are more likely to hate that product. People dislike seeing something inferior in the world that has their name on it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: As Brett and I were talking, I realized something a little uncomfortable - that I myself had fallen prey to implicit egotism. You know, as you're talking right now, I am realizing something about myself for the very first time. There is - there was a philosopher in India whose name was Shankara - my name - and he actually taught a philosophy that is known as Vedanta. And I've always been drawn to the fact that I find the philosophy of Vedanta to be very interesting, and the fact that Shankara taught that philosophy I thought was just charming. But now as I'm listening to you say this, I'm realizing that this could just be implicit egotism. PELHAM: I've read his work very well, and it truly is wonderful. It's brilliant. So I think in this case, you made the objectively good decision. Yeah. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) At the same time, it does make you think, though. PELHAM: Absolutely, yes. VEDANTAM: Has this ever happened to you, Brett? Do you ever think about yourself and how implicit egotism is affecting you? PELHAM: We're getting a little personal here, but I can't resist being a little bit personal. I would say that probably the most dramatic example is that my son Matthew, his last name is Polan (ph). His mother's last name was Polan. My last name is Pelham. And I entered a relationship with her before I developed this theory (laughter) not after I developed the theory to validate the theory. VEDANTAM: So you're a Pelham and you got into a relationship with a woman named Polan? PELHAM: Polan - and we are very different in most other ways. That's about as much as I'll say about that (laughter). VEDANTAM: Are you saying that the names played some kind of a role? PELHAM: I have to think it did. I have to think - and we were from different backgrounds, different religions. I mean, we're - we come from very different worlds. Yeah, and yet, I was very attracted to her. VEDANTAM: So. . . PELHAM: And worse yet, she was attracted to me, right? VEDANTAM: Yeah (laughter). So I understand why you would sort of call this charming, and I think if you do this work for a while, there is a certain smile that comes to your face as you sort of look at these connections and you sort of see - you understand sort of the choices that human beings make. But I do think there's something disturbing about it because I think there is a very strong sense that I think most of us have. I have the sense, even though I've been covering the world of the unconscious mind for the last 10 years, I have the sense that my choices are deliberate choices, that I've thought about them. I'm actually making them intentional. I'm making them intentionally. And the idea that you're coming in and telling me that there are these hidden factors that come in and change how I think about myself, it is a disturbing idea. PELHAM: It is a little bit disturbing. And of course, most people do what you and I do, which is say, well, of course, that applies to the rest of the world, but I in particular would never fall prey to implicit racial bias or implicit egotism. So most of us do tend to sort of separate ourselves from even our own findings. But I've become, in the past decade or so, comfortable enough with the study that I have to admit that I really never know for sure exactly why I did something. I mean, sometimes I have a pretty good idea, but I don't - I certainly don't kid myself anymore to say that I even usually know why I do what I do. I mean, there's just too much research - and much of which you've documented and reported on - that show that biases we're completely unaware, nudge us, sometimes powerfully drive us, in very particular directions. So I think I've just kind of let go of it. It was disturbing to me when I first began to study it - disturbing as well as delightful. And now it's become more delightful and less disturbing. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: So perhaps you're wondering, how does any of this matter? Who cares if people born on the 23 of September marry those born on the 23 of July? Who cares if someone named Betsy Carpenter gravitates towards carpentry? Why does it matter if I prefer a philosopher whose name is similar to my own? PELHAM: It at least raises tough questions about the degree to which we have free will. So I think some people who have pretty negative reactions to this work are very threatened by it in the sense that it suggests that very important decisions have at least a little nudging influence based on things that you're completely unaware of. So if people are more likely than they should be by chance to marry another person who happens to share their birthday number, that's not an objectively great reason to get married. You should get married because you share values. You're both Republicans. You're both rabid Marxists. But learning that these subtle little influences can affect what you do, apparently, to some people is - I find it delightful. But some people find it pretty threatening. I don't think that it proves that there's no such thing as free will. But it - to me, it does suggest that we don't always have free will. Sometimes we make a decision for one reason that we've told ourself when really the more powerful underlying reason is something we could have never put our fingers on. VEDANTAM: And this isn't just a matter of being drawn to someone who shares your birthday. In general, we tend to prefer things and people who have something to do with us. And that can be a big problem. PELHAM: Absolutely. I do a little bit of research on social justice, and that's one of the things that concerns me most, is that we tend to focus on people who are more like us, who speak our language, who speak our idiom, who look like us, who worship like us. And we pay much less attention, sadly, to the problems of people who don't. On the other hand, I think this finding, like any finding in psychology or behavioral economics, can be used for good or evil. And it - the way it works in the real world can be used for good or bad. And so a great example that I perceive as at least a cousin of implicit egotism is a study I think was done by Eliot Smith and colleagues about 10 years ago. He looked at implicit racial bias. And he looked at implicit racial bias as a function of whether a person from a different ethnic group - I think he had whites and African Americans, for example - had simply given you a gentle friendly touch on the shoulder. And if they had given you a friendly, gentle hello-how-are-you touch, that reduced their implicit racial bias. So to me, when another person becomes a part of you, even in a very tiny way - you play intramural basketball with this person. And you didn't like his group. But now that you meet him and he's on your team, suddenly he becomes a part of you. His group becomes a part of you. And your stereotypes get softened and diminished a little bit. VEDANTAM: When we come back, we're going to look at how the Narcissus effect shapes another important part of your life. If you can fall in love with your name or your birthday, can't you also fall in love with your own ideas, your own work? Of course you can. Researchers call this the Ikea effect. DANIEL MOCHON: We come to overvalue the things that we have created ourselves. VEDANTAM: We'll also look at the implications this can have for things much bigger and much more complicated than Swedish furniture. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. The actress Amy Poehler once said, Ikea is Swedish for argument. Researcher Daniel Mochon has one explanation for why build-it-yourself furniture can cause so much friction between partners. MOCHON: Imagine that you built a table. Maybe it came out a little bit crooked. Probably your wife or your neighbor would see it for what it is, you know, probably a shoddy piece of workmanship. But to you, that table might seem really great because you're the one who created it. It is the fruit of your labor, and that is really the idea behind the Ikea effect. It is that we come to overvalue the things that we have created ourselves. VEDANTAM: Brett Pelham's research about our preference for people and places that are associated with us made me think about a related idea. The Narcissus effect also shows up in our preference for things that we make ourselves. MOCHON: The way people usually think about Ikea is that Ikea gives you good furniture for a low cost because they offload lots of the costs onto their consumer - the assembly costs. But in fact, we're in a sense challenging that idea and saying that there's actually psychological benefit behind this, that actually people might end up liking their furniture more because they built it. And so it's not so much a cost but a benefit that they get to build their own furniture. VEDANTAM: Daniel and his co-authors did a series of experiments to test this hypothesis. They brought volunteers into the lab and gave them either a Lego car preassembled or gave them Legos and instructions and told the participants to build a car themselves. Then they asked the volunteers, how much would you pay to keep your Lego car? MOCHON: And what we find is that the people who build their own Legos not only are willing to pay more to keep their assembled Legos, but also, when we asked them how proud they are of their own creations, they tend to be prouder of their Legos. And mind you, these are Legos that are designed to 5 to 7-year-olds. But nonetheless, there seems to be some competence, some pride associated with one's creation, even for basic things as building Legos. VEDANTAM: The researchers replicated the study using other products, like Ikea furniture, and the effect was the same. People who spent time and effort building something felt proud of what they had built, fell in love with it and were willing to pay lots of money to keep the things they'd built. From the perspective of a rational economist, this doesn't make much sense. MOCHON: The students might be willing to pay twice as much money to buy the exact same Lego car if they just finished building that Lego car than if the Lego car was given to them prebuilt. VEDANTAM: So why might people value something more after building it themselves compared to buying the same product made by someone else for half the cost? MOCHON: Our hypothesis was that people tend to use products to signal valued identities to both themselves and to others. And we know that an identity that people really care about is showing that they're competent. This is sort of one of the basics of human motivation. And so we hypothesized that people use self-made products as a way to signal competence to both themselves and to others. You know, having just built a table or having just built a bookcase, that bookcase - that's completed products - acts in a sense of a badge of my own personal competence. I completed it. Therefore, I know I'm a competent person. And moreover, I can display this product and signal that identity, this competent identity, to others. And so we hypothesized that it was these feelings of competence associated with the products that led to their increasing valuation. VEDANTAM: To test the theory that people's feelings of competence was behind the Ikea effect, the researchers had some participants think about other qualities they might value in themselves besides competence - things like honesty or intelligence or humor. Basically, the idea was if we make it less important for people to demonstrate competence, do they still overvalue their own creations? MOCHON: So we found that the Ikea effect disappeared when we did that manipulation. So once competence wasn't that important to people, people, our participants, no longer seemed to get much value out of creating their own products, again, suggesting that the reason why we tend to like our own creations is because we use them as a way to signal competence, both to ourselves and to others. VEDANTAM: Here's the flip side of that coin. You can make the Ikea effect stronger by getting people to question their competence.

And why are we doing this? NOEL KING, HOST: Because it's freezing in here. MARTIN: Yeah, maybe this happens to you. It's hot outside, and then the AC in your office gets crazy cold. A recent study from economists at the University of Southern California suggests that cold office temperatures could actually be affecting women's productivity. Stacey Vanek Smith from Planet Money's The Indicator podcast sat down with the study's co-author Tom Chang to find out why. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE: So, Tom, you decided to take a deep dive into the office thermostat. Specifically, you looked at how different temperatures affect the work of men and women. Now, how exactly did you put this study together? TOM CHANG: The thing we did is before they would show up, we would experimentally manipulate the temperature of the room to be anywhere from 61 degrees to 91 degrees, I think, is about as hot as we could get it. VANEK SMITH: And what did you find? CHANG: We found that as the temperature went up, women did substantially better, especially in math. And men did a little bit worse. VANEK SMITH: So they did - like, 91 degrees, women were just, like, killing it. They were adding like it was their job. CHANG: (Laughter) The biggest effects were if you went from, like, the 60s to 75 degrees. There's where you saw the largest effect on women. And going from 60 to 75 degrees, it was like a 10, 15% increase in the performance of women when it came to the math test. VANEK SMITH: And what about the men? CHANG: The men did slightly worse. VANEK SMITH: Oh, they did slightly worse when it got warmer. CHANG: Warmer, yes. VANEK SMITH: And what about when it got colder - in the 60s? CHANG: So that's when men did their best was when it was in the 60s. And their performance steadily dropped as the thermostat went up. So to go from the 60s to the 70s, like I said, it was around a 10, 15% increase in female performance. And it was about a 3% decrease in male performance. VANEK SMITH: Were you surprised at the degree to which people's performance was affected? Or was that what - about what you thought or. . . CHANG: Oh, no. It was much, much larger than I thought, right? So obviously, extreme temperatures will affect you, but we're not talking about extreme temperatures, right? I would think going from the 60s to the low to mid-70s is a pretty standard range for an indoor environment. And yet, we're finding large effects there. VANEK SMITH: What do you think is going on? CHANG: You know, when it's too hot or you're too cold, you just don't perform at your best. VANEK SMITH: And you made a recommendation, actually, in the paper for workplaces. CHANG: So if you have a gender-balanced office, the optimal temperature is around 75 degrees. So there's a number for you. VANEK SMITH: Seventy-five. CHANG: Seventy-five. VANEK SMITH: Oh, that's pretty warm. CHANG: That's the skin-melting temperature for me. VANEK SMITH: Oh, you hate this. You hate the conclusion of your own research. CHANG: Oh, yes. My advice to a business or any office would be, look. Temperature matters, right? So if half your workers are coming to work with - you know, keep blankets in their desks or have - illicit space heaters somewhere or, alternatively, half your workers are sweating through their T-shirts, that's something you want to take seriously. What the research says is that if as a business, you care only about profits or productivity, you should still take the comfort of your workers into account because it has the real potential to significantly affect your bottom line. VANEK SMITH: Tom, thank you so much for talking with us. CHANG: Oh, thank you. VANEK SMITH: Stacey Vanek Smith, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF AVALON EMERSON'S \"2000 SPECIES OF CACTI\") RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Wearing a blanket - and, Noel, there you are wearing a shawl. And why are we doing this? NOEL KING, HOST:  Because it's freezing in here. MARTIN: Yeah, maybe this happens to you. It's hot outside, and then the AC in your office gets crazy cold. A recent study from economists at the University of Southern California suggests that cold office temperatures could actually be affecting women's productivity. Stacey Vanek Smith from Planet Money's The Indicator podcast sat down with the study's co-author Tom Chang to find out why. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE: So, Tom, you decided to take a deep dive into the office thermostat. Specifically, you looked at how different temperatures affect the work of men and women. Now, how exactly did you put this study together? TOM CHANG: The thing we did is before they would show up, we would experimentally manipulate the temperature of the room to be anywhere from 61 degrees to 91 degrees, I think, is about as hot as we could get it. VANEK SMITH: And what did you find? CHANG: We found that as the temperature went up, women did substantially better, especially in math. And men did a little bit worse. VANEK SMITH: So they did - like, 91 degrees, women were just, like, killing it. They were adding like it was their job. CHANG: (Laughter) The biggest effects were if you went from, like, the 60s to 75 degrees. There's where you saw the largest effect on women. And going from 60 to 75 degrees, it was like a 10, 15% increase in the performance of women when it came to the math test. VANEK SMITH: And what about the men? CHANG: The men did slightly worse. VANEK SMITH: Oh, they did slightly worse when it got warmer. CHANG: Warmer, yes. VANEK SMITH: And what about when it got colder - in the 60s? CHANG: So that's when men did their best was when it was in the 60s. And their performance steadily dropped as the thermostat went up. So to go from the 60s to the 70s, like I said, it was around a 10, 15% increase in female performance. And it was about a 3% decrease in male performance. VANEK SMITH: Were you surprised at the degree to which people's performance was affected? Or was that what - about what you thought or. . . CHANG: Oh, no. It was much, much larger than I thought, right? So obviously, extreme temperatures will affect you, but we're not talking about extreme temperatures, right? I would think going from the 60s to the low to mid-70s is a pretty standard range for an indoor environment. And yet, we're finding large effects there. VANEK SMITH: What do you think is going on?

I'm Shankar Vedantam. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Many of us share our homes with animals - furry, feathered or scaly. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Hi Charles (ph). Oh, I haven't seen you in a while. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Was it a bad day? Yeah? You awake. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: They are definitely like my family members at this point. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Yeah. That's my righthand man. I got no kids, so that's my son, you know? He's my baby. VEDANTAM: Yet, as much as we love our pets, our behavior toward animals can be paradoxical. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Don't you think it's kind of weird that we're eating our cat's meat? And we, you know, have strong beliefs in not eating meat at this point. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: I think the more you love animals, the more you might consider being a vegetarian. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: The English Bulldog was made by science. You know what I'm saying? Like, I think lizards and reptiles belong with Mother Nature. I don't think English bulldog is a part of Mother Nature. So I'm a walking hypocrite, and I recognize that. And I'm OK with that. VEDANTAM: This week on HIDDEN BRAIN, we explore the contradictions and quandaries of our relationships with animals. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: When Hal Herzog's son, Adam, was young, he had a pet mouse named Willie. One day, Willie died, so Hal used this as a teaching moment. HAL HERZOG: We thought it would be a good lesson for the kids, in terms of understanding death, to have a funeral for him. After all, you know, he was a pet. The kids really liked him. And they were very upset when he died. And so we had a funeral. We got a little cardboard box and made a little casket. We took him into the backyard. We buried him. And we actually had a little headstone for him. We got some rocks and made a little headstone for him. VEDANTAM: A couple of days later, Hal's wife found some mouse droppings in the kitchen and asked him to do something about it. HERZOG: Well, my wife's a neatnik. And the idea that we would be sharing our house with, you know, with little creatures scampering around that were mice was not something that she could live with. So she asked me to kill the mouse, and I did. I went out and I bought a mousetrap. I put a little dab of peanut butter on it and put it under the kitchen. And the next morning, I got up and the mouse was dead. VEDANTAM: And, of course, you did what you always do with dead mice, which is you put it in a cardboard box and took it out of the back and gave it a funeral, right? HERZOG: No. I threw it in the bushes. VEDANTAM: Two dead mice, two very different responses. HERZOG: They were in different psychological categories. One was a pet, which a lot of people - including us - sort of considered Willie a family member. He had a name. And the other was a pest. He was freeloading by, you know, stealing our cheese and. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). HERZOG: . . . You know generally being what mice do, that is to say, a pest. So, you know, there is a completely different psychological, you know, relationship between Willie our pet and the pest. VEDANTAM: Hal Herzog is a professor of psychology at Western Carolina University. He's been studying human-animal interactions for more than 30 years. He writes about the contradictions in our attitudes toward mice and other creatures in his book \"Some We Love, Some We Hate, Some We Eat: Why It's So Hard To Think Straight About Animals. \" I asked him how the labels we place on animals - good mouse, bad mouse, pet or pest - change how we interact with them. HERZOG: Certainly one of the deepest and most important reasons that we treat animals differently is related to the categories that we put them. That's absolutely true. VEDANTAM: So here's a second story that also lays out a slightly related but different contradiction. Your family once also owned a pet snake. And a nasty rumor spread about what you were feeding the snake. What was the rumor? And what does that reveal, in some ways, about the relationship we have with animals? HERZOG: I got a call one day from a friend of mine who's an animal rights activist. And she said that she had gotten a call from one of her friends saying that I was going to our local animal shelter and getting kittens and taking them home and feeding them to our boa constrictor, who was like Willie, a pet and had a name, Sam. VEDANTAM: What does this to reveal about some of the contradictions we have about animals? You talk a little bit in the book about, you know, both sort of the abhorrence with which we receive this idea that anyone would dream of feeding kittens to snakes. But, of course, in your mind, this also produced something of a thought experiment and some questions about cats and snakes. HERZOG: It did. And actually, for the next couple of days, there was something that kept nagging me about that. And I was thinking, like, OK. You know, what Sam ate - he was a carnivore, like cats. And what he ate was mice. And so I would go, basically, to the pet shop and buy mice to feed to the snake - live mice. And I would, you know, kill the mice and give them to the snake. And I thought, well, wait a minute. There's cats being euthanized at the animal shelter that are unwanted. Wouldn't it be more ethical for me to actually go to the animal shelter and get the bodies of dead kittens as opposed to using - buying live mice? Wouldn't that be morally permissible? Wouldn't it be morally better to actually feed kittens to boa constrictors than to feed mice to boa constrictors? VEDANTAM: And of course, then, that means you went out to the animal shelter and did what the rumor was saying that you were doing. HERZOG: Of course I did not. We were - we had a pet cat at the time. We still have a pet cat. We live with cats. I love cats. I would never feed a cat to a boa constrictor. So this was a classic example of head versus heart. And I realized that moral consistency oftentimes leads us astray in our interactions with animals. And that really haunted me ever since. Like, how could I live in a world in which it was OK to feed kittens to boa constrictors? And interesting, Shankar, the original title of my book was \"Feeding Kittens To Boa Constrictors. \" But the editor and my agent immediately made me change it. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). HERZOG: . . . Because they said nobody would buy a book with that title. VEDANTAM: It sounds like the start of a bad Coen brothers movie. HERZOG: It does. And it snagged me a literary agent. But (laughter) they wouldn't - they wouldn't take the next step. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Tell me about another story that you describe in the book. This guy, Jim Thompson, he's a doctoral student you met. And he owned this very beautiful bird. And he started thinking about that bird. And then he did something unusual with this bird. Walk me through what he did. HERZOG: Yeah. He was a graduate student. And he was a very logical, rational, rational person. And he had a pet bird - it was a cockatiel, as I recall - that he really loved. And his mother had given him a copy of an animal rights magazine - I think it was Animals\u2019 Agenda at the time. And he read the magazine. It changed his life. So he became an animal rights activist, hardcore - became a vegan, quit wearing leather, made his girlfriend start doing all that stuff as well. And then one day, he looked at the bird, who lived in a cage. And he came to the conclusion - the intellectual conclusion that it was unethical to live with a bird in a cage. And so he took the bird outside and he freed it. And the bird flew out of the cage. And he said it was an amazing sight to see that bird take off. And then he told me - he looked at me, he said sheepishly, you know, I know she probably died. I know that I was doing it more for me than I was for the bird. VEDANTAM: You know, it made me think about all the ways in which we sort of relate to animals in some ways as if they were sort of fellow creatures. In other words, if you kept a fellow human being in a cage, it would seem absolutely unjust, immoral and wrong. And releasing that person from the cage would seem like the only right thing to do. And in some ways, we extend that logic when we talk about the bird. That's what he was doing. And as I was reading the story, it reminded me of another story you have in the book. This was a different story but, in some ways, it has the same subtext. Cookie was a 12-foot-long Nile crocodile at the Miami Serpentarium. A 6-year-old boy once fell into Cookie's enclosure. And the croc did what crocodiles do - he grabbed the child, pulled him underwater. What did the owner of the Serpentarium do next? HERZOG: Well, the owner of the - immediately, the owner of the Serpentarium jumped into - he heard the people watching, you know, gasp in horror. And he knew something was going on. He jumped into the cage and tried to save the kid - little David - and failed. And that night, Haast woke up in the middle of the night - I'm assuming he didn't get much sleep. He had a revolver - a Luger - in his bedroom. He put the shells in it. And he went into Cookie's cage and he put nine bullets in his brain. And by the way, he had had Cookie for many, many years. And Cookie was a favorite of his. It was an animal that he loved in a way that probably only herpetologists - somebody like me, you know, who studies reptiles and likes them, you know, can understand. I argue that, in some ways, it's the operation of a phenomenon that cognitive psychologists called heuristics. A heuristic is sort of a mental shortcut and it sometimes leads to good, you know, logical, correct answers, but sometimes it doesn't. And in this case, it seems to be the operation of a type of heuristic called the moral heuristic. And the moral heuristic is revenge. And at one point, The New York Times actually wrote an editorial about that event. And the editorial writer, I think, got it right. And the editorial writer wrote, killing Cookie made no sense intellectually, but it felt right emotionally. VEDANTAM: And the reason it didn't make sense intellectually, of course, is the idea that a crocodile would do what a crocodile does is hardly surprising. HERZOG: That's what crocodiles do. His brain is smaller than a walnut. He is a creature, largely, of instinct, particularly when it comes to food. And he was, you know, doing what crocodiles do. He was not a moral agent, you know, which I would argue is one of the biggest differences between humans and other species. We are moral agents. VEDANTAM: So the interesting thing is that Haast, the owner, in some ways related to Cookie as if Cookie was a person, that Cookie was a moral agent. And in some ways, that's a variation of what Jim Thompson was doing with the bird - wasn't it? - which is, you're assuming that the animal has agency and behaves or thinks or has human-like qualities and that you are therefore obliged or required to treat this other creature as if, in some ways, it had human-like qualities. HERZOG: I'm sure that if you interviewed Haast, he, you know, clearly would know the difference, at an intellectual level, between a crocodile and a person. But you're quite right. He's basically treated them the same way that we would a person. This similarly played out in a bizarre incident that happened in Tennessee, where an elephant named Mary killed its groom while in a circus parade in 1916. And they hung the elephant to death. And, you know, to me that was, you know, the ultimate example of where we've anthropomorphized animals - that we give it capital punishment in a sense for something that it was clearly not morally culpable. VEDANTAM: So people listening to these stories would say, wow, those are really, you know, crazy stories, but as you point out in the book, this tendency we have to anthropomorphize animals is actually really ubiquitous. You draw a contrast between the way we relate to the giant panda and the giant salamander. Tell me what the giant salamander is, what it looks like, and how our attitudes toward these different animals are shaped by the ways in some ways that we anthropomorphize them. HERZOG: Yeah, the - so the animals, in some way, are similar, the giant panda and the giant Chinese salamander, in that they're both endangered and they both live in China and they're both really special, although in quite different ways. The giant Chinese salamander is basically a 6-foot-long bag of brown slime with beady eyes. (Laughter) And, you know, to me, they're like - they're striking. I wouldn't say that they're beautiful, but they're stunning just in their size and they're - I don't know. (Laughter) To me, they're charismatic, but I don't think most people would agree with that. But you're not going to see the World Wildlife Fund putting a picture of the giant Chinese salamander on their logo. Instead, they use the panda. And the panda, you know, in some ways, looks a little bit like a human. But it's basically a faker in the sense that it has these giant circles around its eyes, which ethologists call baby releasers. So we look at that panda and it basically logs on to that - jams into that maternal instinct that we have when we see creatures with big eyes and it impose on them that in some ways it reminds us of a human infant. So, for example, researchers have shown that one of the biggest predictors of whether or not people will give money to save animals is the size of the animal's eyes. And pandas certainly have it when it comes to eye size. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: When we come back, do our pets actually improve our lives? HERZOG: Pet owners were better off in terms of their psychological and physical health than non-pet owners. But as they pointed out, so are people with Mercedes-Benzes. VEDANTAM: Stay with us. When we think about pets in the United States, we often picture cats, dogs, maybe a hamster. Hal Herzog says our relationship with animals, especially those we consider pets, is largely dictated by our communities and culture. So, for example, I've got a friend that's an anthropologist who was born and raised in Kenya. And in the village where he was raised, they kept dogs. The dogs were allowed to roam freely in the village. They really liked dogs that we would consider mean dogs because they scared away animals, and they scared away strangers. HERZOG: But they weren't considered pets. In fact, in his language, they don't even have a word for pet. And I went to ask him. I said, Nyaga, would you, like, you know, let a dog in your house when you were living in Africa? And he said, no. I said, would you let a dog eat at the table, you know, and, you know, feed him table scraps? He said, no. I said, Nyaga, would you let a dog sleep in your bed? And the look at the horror on his face, it was like if I said, hey, I've got this really cool rat I just caught down at the Hudson River. You want to sleep with it tonight? (LAUGHTER)HERZOG: And, in fact, I recently got some new data on this. So it turns out that in the United States, we have amongst the highest rate of dog ownership in the world. And there are enormous differences between countries in dog ownership. So there's about 250 dogs per thousand people in the United States. And in Egypt, there's about five dogs per thousand people. So these cultural variations in what people - you know, what's acceptable as a pet and what's not is just huge. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: I want to spend a moment talking about the relationships that we have with pets in North America. I know that people spend a lot of money on pets, but as I read your book, I was just shocked at how high that number is. How much do we spend on our pets every year, Hal? HERZOG: It's pushing about $80 billion a year right now. It's an enormous amount of money. VEDANTAM: I mean, that's a fleet of aircraft carriers. HERZOG: Yeah. Yeah, it is. And if you even adjusted for inflation, the amount of money that we spent on pets each year in the United States has more than doubled in the last 30 years per capita. VEDANTAM: Wow. HERZOG: The real increase in spending has been at the high end. Gourmet pet food for dogs - I mean, you can buy, you know, food that you would eat. In fact, you know, I tease my wife and I say, what we're going to do is, like, when we get ready for the giant decline is we're going to stock up on dog food and - you know, when the hurricane (ph) comes. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). HERZOG: But it's also things like, you know, pet day cares, pet spas. There's a hotel that has a zen room where you can get your pets a massage. And I don't know what else pets do in a zen room. We're talking about dog parks. We're talking about jeweled collars. We're talking about pet fashion weeks. We're talking about all these things. And the pet food industry, you know, calls this the humanization of pets. And it really has taken off in the last 30 years. Another factor is advertising and publicity by the pet products industry that push the idea that pets are good for people, that if you get a pet, you will be a happier and healthier person. VEDANTAM: Is this actually true, that owning a pet is good for your health and your longevity? HERZOG: We have overwhelming evidence now that for a lot of people, you know, interacting with their pet does have short-term effects on their physiology, lowers their stress, makes them feel better. The question you ask, however, was different. That was are pets really good for our health and make us live longer? And here my answer is that we don't have particularly good evidence for the long-term impact of pets on human health. I have a stack of reprints in my office, which people have found that, you know, people with pets, you know, they sleep better, that they go to the doctor less, that they have better well-being, that they're less lonely, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But I have another stack of reprints in my office that says just the opposite, that people with pets are more lonely, that they're more likely to go to the doctor, that they're more likely to drink a lot, that they're more likely to have ulcers. But you never hear about those studies, you know, in the news. They don't make the news. There's very little evidence that pets make people live longer. And one of the problems we have is which direction the causal arrow points. For example, a recent study by the RAND Corporation found that pet owners, in fact, were better off in terms of their psychological and physical health than non-pet owners. But as they pointed out, so are people with Mercedes-Benzes. People with pets tend to be wealthier. They tend to be younger. They tend to live in nicer places. In other words, the socioeconomic factors may be that it's not that pets are making people happier and healthier. It's that happier, healthier people are more likely to have pets. We have very little data to test those two different hypotheses. VEDANTAM: You present some really striking studies in the book, which talk in some ways of the downside of having pets. You say that some 85,000 Americans are injured each year according to the CDC because they trip over their pets or otherwise are injured by them. And I understand your neighbor Anne (ph) is one of those victims. HERZOG: My neighbor Anne is one of those victims. She's a classic case. She was walking her dog and the leash wrapped around her leg, and she fell over and she broke her collarbone. I recently went on Facebook, and I put a call out - I said if any of you have ever been injured by, you know, a pet by walking your dog, let's say, you know, please write me a note. And I could not believe the response - 80 people responded to me. Many of them were professionals in the field. Some of them even sent me their X-rays, which I - and I was - and some of these incidents were not trivial. Some of these incidents were life-changing. So there are downsides to pet ownership. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: So there's a new frontier in pet ownership now, and I want to play you a clip. This is from the company Sony, and they presented this account of a dog at a tech conference. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Let's start with design. First, the obvious - Aibo is adorable. He wags his tail, wiggles his ears, blinks his eyes and even does that doggy smile - you know that smile that dogs do when you scratch them just right and they kind of tilt their head and half close their eyes and they open their mouth a little and smile. Yeah, that smile. VEDANTAM: So, of course, Hal, Aibo isn't a real dog. Aibo is a robot, and it really looks like humans are completely indiscriminate when it comes to who we will consider and what we will consider to be pets. HERZOG: Yeah. The thing about Aibo - Aibo's got an interesting history. Sony originally developed Aibo and Aibo's a robotic dog, and it does all kind of things. It'll fetch. It'll signal you its emotions. It'll respond when you call its name. The problem with Aibo is that it's metal and shiny, so it doesn't have fur. So while Aibo had some real - it was expensive. It originally cost about 2,000 bucks. It didn't catch on initially. But Aibo was recently resurrected by Sony, and I've looked at the new promotional videos of Aibo, and I'm ready - I'm about ready to get one. It looks pretty good. Oh, and there have been studies where they've taken Aibo and some other types of robotic pets into things like nursing homes and - to see if they had the same impact on, you know, people living in nursing homes in terms of morale and well-being as they do a real dog. VEDANTAM: Right. HERZOG: And the results have been sort of mixed, but in some of the cases, Aibo has actually done better in some cases than an actual animal. VEDANTAM: And some of this, I'm guessing, might have to do with the fact that Aibo doesn't have some of the downsides that owning a real dog might have. Aibo is not going to bark uncontrollably at night or bark at your friends when they come over for a party. I mean, dogs and cats and pets can sometimes induce stress within families and emotional and psychological problems within households. HERZOG: Absolutely, they can. The other thing that Aibo doesn't do is raise the pesky ethical questions that come with pet ownership. You don't have to worry about the ethics of depriving Aibo of a sex life by castrating him. You don't have to worry about the ethics of leaving Aibo alone for long periods of time while you're at your office during the day. You don't have to take Aibo for a walk three times a day and then pick up poop as you walk it down the road. So I think Aibo's got some real advantages. VEDANTAM: So besides the many animals that you own that we've already talked about, you also own a cat whose name is Tilly. And you have what other cat owners might think is a rather idiosyncratic way of expressing your affection for Tilly. In the book you write, don't feel bad, Tilly. I love you even if you are a socially constructed parasite. Really, Hal? HERZOG: (Laughter) Yeah. The question is is she a parasite? And this is the view that pets are basically a form of evolutionarily what's called nest parasitism, which we see in birds. So, for example, let's take the cowbird. What a cowbird does is it lays its eggs in another bird's nest - let's say a wren's nest - and it then flies away and leaves its eggs for this wren to hatch. The wren then sits on the egg until it hatches and so that the wren winds up raising the bird up - the baby of another species. And that's what - that's how we got Tilly. What happened is, you know, this little kitten showed up one day on our doorstep. I was away. I came home and my wife had this strange grin on her face. And I thought, you know, that - you know, I've never quite seen that look. What it is that? She had this grin. And she says, come here, come here, come here. And she shows me this lovely little cat. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)HERZOG: And we were hooked. We were hooked. So what did we do? We've been raising Tilly ever since. You know, we've basically been conned by Tilly's mom to take care of her nestling, you know? We don't share any genes with Tilly, but yet the average pet owner over the life of the pet will invest roughly $10,000 in their pet. So we have $10,000 worth of nest parasite living with us. And we get our money's worth out of her. VEDANTAM: Or you think you get your money's worth because, of course, it's the parasite that's having the last laugh. HERZOG: Yeah (laughter) absolutely. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: When we come back - how the contradictions in the ways we think about animals lead to paradoxes in how we treat them. Hal Herzog is a professor of psychology at Western Carolina University. He's the author of the book \"Some We Love, Some We Hate, Some We Eat: Why It's So Hard To Think Straight About Animals. \" Hal, the contradictions in the way we think about animals lead to paradoxes and moral dilemmas in how we treat them. Let's look at the very, very simplest case. Millions of Americans like yourself own a cat. They care for their pet. They say they love animals. But you simultaneously say that loving your cat means subjecting other animals to suffering. How so? HERZOG: My cat's a serial killer. She is an indoor-outdoor cat. And so when she wants to go outside, I let her outside. And what she does some of the time is kill small animals, sometimes birds, more often it's small mice, voles, creatures like that. I am actually more conflicted by being a cat owner than I am over any other aspect of my relationships with animals. VEDANTAM: And, of course, the cat is doing what comes naturally to the cat. The cat is a predator. You can't expect the cat to be behaving any different. But the fact that millions of Americans own cats mean that in some ways they're at least indirectly sanctioning this mass murder of, for example, you know, songbirds. HERZOG: Yeah, and mass murder it is. Depending on the statistics, somewhere between 1 billion and 5 billion birds each year are killed by our pet cats. Furthermore, cats are obligate carnivores. They have to eat meat. And so I've got lots of friends that are vegetarians and vegans, and they're morally opposed to eating meat, but yet they keep cats and they have to buy animal flesh to keep their cats happy and healthy. It's a big moral problem for some people. VEDANTAM: You ran sort of the calculations on this, and you described them in the book. Mathematically, a cat consumes about two ounces of meat a day. That's about 50 pounds of meat a year. By contrast, snakes only consume maybe 5 pounds of meat a year, so the impact of having a cat - the moral impact, if you will - is 10 times greater than the moral impact of owning a snake. And yet, of course, most animal lovers will be horrified if you were to suggest replacing kittens with snakes or maybe even, as we discussed, feeding kittens to boa constrictors. HERZOG: Yeah. I actually developed this scale one time. I was interested in this issue, and I developed the scale, which I called the feeding kittens to boa constrictor scale. I was actually trying to make fun of psychological scales, but it turned out to produce some very interesting things. So, for example, most of my students that I gave this scale to said that it was OK to feed mice to boa constrictors, but it was not OK to feed mice to cats, which was interesting enough. And when I asked them, well, why - you know, why is it OK to feed mice to a boa constrictor but not a cat, one of my students put it perfectly. She said, if my cat ate mice, she wouldn't be like me. And that, to me, gets at this whole thing about what we project onto the animals that we lived with. You know, if my cats ate mice, she wouldn't be like me. Well, she's not like you, girl, you know? VEDANTAM: But in some ways, bringing sort of cat food home just like you bring your own groceries home allows that student, in some ways, to preserve that illusion, doesn't it? HERZOG: Absolutely. She's preserving the illusion. She's preserving the illusion. Now, if I were a better person, perhaps I would keep my cat indoors, which is a lot - what a lot of my friends tell me is I should make her an indoor cat. Well, I resist doing that and my reasoning is probably equally fallacious - is that, if I were a cat, I would rather be an indoor-outdoor cat than a cat that lives in a big cage and spends its day looking outside through the window at the birds floating around. Now, I know that by letting my cat go outdoors, I subject her to the tough things in the wild. In other words, she could get eaten by a coyote. She can't get hit by a car because we live on a road that doesn't have any cars go down it. But the life of an indoor-outdoor cat tends to be shorter, even though she's had a long and good life. But I can't completely justify doing that because of the toll she takes on the small animal life. But I live with it. VEDANTAM: So the more we think of animals as sort of members of our family, the more we think of them as being like us, in some ways, this raises a profound moral paradox - does it not? - which is that, if we actually think of these animals as being like us, how in the world can we, you know, in any good conscience, confine them to our homes, confine them to cages, treat them as if they were our captives to do with as we please? HERZOG: Well, I think that's a great point. It's something that I've been thinking about a lot lately. And I've really quite seriously been thinking about, is it ethical to keep animals as pets? If we really think of them as autonomous beings, what right do we have to take away all their autonomy by controlling every aspect of their life? - what they eat, where they go, when they go. And increasing, we're taking control of their genes, which created its own problems. And so I'm thinking, increasingly, that - I'm wondering about the ethics of keeping animals as pets. To me, the logic of pet keeping is not that different than the logic of meat eating. I eat meat. And I know the arguments against it are good and they're better than my argument for eating meat, which is, basically, I like the way it tastes. Well, I feel the same way about my cat. I love my cat, but she carries with her a moral burden. And it's my moral burden. It's not her moral burden. I'm the moral agent. I'm the adult in the room. And I'm the one that has to deal with thinking about this stuff. Although, most people conveniently repress it and don't think about it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: I'm wondering, Hal, in some ways - as you're pointing out - these contradictions are unresolvable. And given the contradictions that you've laid out and the paradoxes of being a pet owner, some of the moral costs that come with being a pet owner, if your current animals - you were to lose them, if they were to die, would you get replacements for them today? HERZOG: Boy, that's a great question. That is such a tough question. I've thought about it. I definitely would not get a dog. I miss having a dog, actually. My wife and I are both dog people. But we haven't had a dog for 10 years and it's because our lifestyle doesn't lend itself - I don't think a dog would be happy living in our house because we're away too much during the day. I can't stand the idea of leaving them in a kennel. Our cat's happy to live by herself. And I think the answer is yes. I think the answer is that I would get another cat. VEDANTAM: The moral dilemmas of pet ownership pale in comparison to the moral dilemmas posed by our use of animals in sport and as food. Hal explores some of the deepest contradictions we have toward animals by looking at the sport of cockfighting. HERZOG: First of all, cockfighting is more illegal now than it was when I was doing that work, but it's just as brutal now. So basically, in a cockfight, what - you have two chickens and you have two handlers and you have a referee and a pit, which is roughly 15 feet in diameter. The referee says pit them. The handlers let them go. And the two roosters try and kill each other. One rooster, almost invariably, dies because they have gaffs, which are basically knives attached to their legs. And it's basically about gambling. There's money changing hands. And so I entered this clandestine world and lived in that clandestine world for a couple of years. VEDANTAM: Now, anyone who hears what you've just described would say, all right, this is morally unconscionable. We cannot allow this to happen. We need to ban this sport. And it has been banned in all parts of the country and many parts of the world. But tell me a little bit more about what happens when you look more closely at the life of one of these roosters that's raised for cockfighting. And you contrast this, in some ways, with the life of your average broiler chicken. HERZOG: Yeah. Well, first I want to say that I do not justify cockfighting. Everything you said about it is correct. It is brutal. It is unjustified. It's now banned throughout the United States. And it should be banned throughout the United States. I'm not trying to justify to - you know, for me, as I started studying cockfighters and how they thought, I became really interested in their moral worlds. And I also began to ask myself some difficult questions. And one of the difficult questions was, if I were a chicken - if I come back in the next world as a chicken, would I rather be an east Tennessee gamecock or would I rather be a McNugget; in other words, a chicken raised in a broiler house to become a McNugget. And to me, there is no doubt in my mind I would much rather be a gamecock than a chicken destined to be served at McDonald's. VEDANTAM: Can you describe to me how you reached that conclusion? What is the life of that gamecock? And what is the life of that chicken that ends up as a McNugget? HERZOG: OK. First, let's take a gamecock. They live long lives. And they live lives that are generally - compared to a broiler chicken - pretty darn amazing. They live, on average, two years. They're not usually fought until they're two years old. For a chunk of their life, they live in free range or they have way more room than a broiler chicken. They're fed incredibly well - a varied diet. They get plenty of exercise. If they win a couple fights, they will use them as a stud rooster. And what they'll do is they'll spend their life chasing the hens around. Not a bad deal. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)HERZOG: On the other hand, the life of a broiler chicken is absolutely horrendous. Their life only lasts between six and seven weeks. They're basically meat machines, which means that they put on weight so fast that their legs can't really hold up their bodies. And so they have chronic leg pain, who's been called the world's largest animal welfare problem. They're jammed into giant broiler houses with 30,000 chicks in a broiler house, where they'll never see the sun. They'll never get to play on the grass. They'll never get to peck at bugs. Their lungs will be burned with ammonia. It's an absolutely horrendous existence. And they will die a pretty lousy death. They'll be crammed into a series of cages. They'll be hauled, for miles, in an open truck, jammed into small little cages with their feathers flying down the interstate, where they will be hung upside down by their legs, dipped into an electrified water bath to stun them. And then they'll go through a carotid artery set of blades that will, hopefully, kill them quickly - although, oftentimes, it does not. So the life of a (laughter) the life of a gamecock, oddly, is vastly better than the life of the 9 billion chickens that Americans eat each year. VEDANTAM: I mean, that is a billion with a B. HERZOG: Yeah. VEDANTAM: You write in the book, while Americans will sleep easy at night knowing cockfighting is banned in all 50 states, 35 million chickens will be stuffed into wire crates on their way to processing plants tomorrow. That makes you. . . HERZOG: Yeah. That's in one day. VEDANTAM: That makes you think, doesn't it? HERZOG: Yeah. Absolutely does. When I began doing my research on the comparative cruelty of cockfighting (laughter) versus McNuggets, I was stunned. I mean, I just - I was absolutely stunned. And I realized, you know, cockfighting should be illegal, but the casual chicken eater is committing a bigger sin in their own way than is the rooster fighter. And by the way, rooster fighters love their animals. That was one of the things I had a hard time wrapping my head around. It was like, these guys really love chickens. VEDANTAM: The comedian Chris Rock once went on David Letterman and talked about some of the contradictions in the way we think about animals. He contrasted the football player Michael Vick, who went to prison for promoting dogfighting, with the former governor of Alaska and hunting enthusiast Sarah Palin. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LATE NIGHT WITH DAVID LETTERMAN\")CHRIS ROCK: And she's shooting mooses. And she got the moose. (LAUGHTER)ROCK: Holding a dead, bloody moose. (LAUGHTER)ROCK: And Michael Vick's like, why am I in jail? (LAUGHTER)ROCK: What the hell? But you let a white lady shoot a moose. (LAUGHTER)DAVID LETTERMAN: Yeah. ROCK: Black man want to kill a dog, that's a crime. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: It does sound like a double standard, Hal. HERZOG: Yeah, it does sound like a double standard. We see the same thing in lots of areas of human-animal interactions. So for example, take cockfighting - cockfighting is a sport of lower-socioeconomic-status whites and Hispanics. And on the other hand, compare that with the sport of kings, horseracing. Horseracing is finally coming under the gun. In the last couple months, as you probably know, I think almost 30 animals were killed at the Santa Anita racetrack in California. And this has been going on for years and years and years. A number of thoroughbred horses that die, numbers in the thousands and thousands each year. But yet, very few people get bent out of shape about horseracing compared to cockfighting. VEDANTAM: So it is a class thing in some ways, isn't it? HERZOG: Very much so. Very much so. It's a class thing. VEDANTAM: We started this conversation, Hal, by talking about some stories and paradoxes and contradictions from your own life, and I want to end the conversation in the same way. When you were in grad school, you were once asked to put a number of different creatures into boiling water. Why were you asked to do this? And walk me through what happened. HERZOG: Yeah. I was working in a chemical ecology lab. And we were interested in the chemical perceptions of - in this case it was reptiles snakes - baby snakes. And we basically were interested in whether or not these animals were born with an instinctive preference for certain types of foods. And, of course, they eat live animals. So in this case, there was another researcher in Utah that was interested in doing similar research for his dissertation. And he sent our lab, basically, a menagerie. It came in a big box, which basically said, this side up. Live animals. And the box contained an array of animals. It contained worms, crickets. It contained some scorpions. It contained a lizard. It contained another snake. It contained - and then a mouse. And so I was the lowest ranking member of the lab. So they assigned me to basically convert these animals to a solution that could be dabbed on a swab and exposed to these snakes. And so the procedure involves dropping these animals into water that was not quite boiling. And I thought, OK, I'll do it. And I had dropped the first one in that I think was a cricket. And it just died instantly. And then I did the Scorpion, which was a bigger animal. And it didn't die so quickly. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)HERZOG: And then I had to do the, as I recall, it was a lizard. And, you know, I like lizards. I like reptiles. And it was not good. You know, it took much longer time for the lizard to die in the water. And I was getting upset. And then I was working my way up the phylogenetic scale. And then there was the mouse. It was a cute little mouse. It wasn't a lab mouse. It was one of these cute little woodland mice. And I took a look at the mouse and as I recall, I actually picked it up, was getting ready to drop it in the water and I just couldn't do it. And I just put the mouse back in its cage. And I went and told the lab manager, I can't do this. Somebody else is going to have to do it. That just haunted me for a very long time. And it really was the event that got me on this journey that I've been on for more than 30 years now about trying to understand why it was so easy to do the cricket and harder to do the lizard and I couldn't do the mouse. And, you know, I've never come to grips with it, but I've been chasing that down. It really is the thing that got me thinking about the psychology of human-animal interactions and why we treat some animals different than other. VEDANTAM: So one way that people justify eating meat and treating animals the way they do is that they believe that there's a status hierarchy between animals and it's along the lines of what happened in your lab. So worms are lower on the scale than scorpions. Scorpions are lower on the scale than mice. You once watched the Steven Spielberg movie \"E. T. \" with your daughter. And you came up with a thought experiment that probably ruined the movie for her. HERZOG: (Laughter) Actually, it was my twin daughters, they were both there. And probably most listeners are aware of what happens at the end of the movie. So E. T. and Elliott are running around California. They're buddies for, you know, the previous two hours. And at the end, E. T. 's mom comes back to get him in the flying saucer. And E. T. , with that great big head and big eyes, looks at Elliott and he says - he croaks, he goes. . . (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"E. T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL\")PAT WELSH: (As E. T. ) Come. HERZOG: You know, like, you know, come with me. We'll go back to Zork and we'll have a great time, you know. And Elliott says, no. I can't do it. I'm going to stay here. And E. T. takes off, you know and goes back to Zork and it's all good. And (laughter) my daughters - I don't know what I was thinking. I said, hey, girls, what if E. T. wanted Elliott to go back to Zork with him? And so he grabs Elliott. . . (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"E. T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL\")HERZOG: . . . And he drags him screaming into the flying saucer because they want to use Elliott in a research experiment. They want to use him in an experiment because there's like this AIDS-like virus invading the people of Zork. And the Zorkians are much smarter than Americans. They're much smarter than Elliott. Would it be OK for E. T. to kidnap Elliott and take him and use him in biomedical research experiment? And my kids, they're horrified. No, dad. No. No. And I thought the same thing. No, that would not be a good idea. But on the other hand, what I realized was that our use of animals in biomedical research is based on the same premise. You know, we're smarter than other creatures. We're way smarter than mice. We're way smarter than dogs. We're somewhat smarter than chimpanzees in our own ways. And that's our justification for using animals in biomedical research. And I was forced to the conclusion that, look; if we're going to use animals in research, we got to let E. T. take Elliott back to Zork and use him in a cage. Obviously, it's the same sort of thought experiment that I did when I concluded we ought to feed kittens to boa constrictors, you know? But I still can't wrap my head around that. My heart's telling me one thing, even though logic is telling me something else. And that's the gist of a lot of our inconsistencies with our interactions with animals. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Hal Herzog is a professor of psychology at Western Carolina University.

HERZOG: Oh, thanks for having me. I really enjoyed it. VEDANTAM: To learn more about Hal and his research, check out his blog, Animals And Us, from Psychology Today. This week's show was produced by Thomas Lu. It was edited by Tara Boyle and Rhaina Cohen. Our team includes Parth Shah, Laura Kwerel and Jenny Schmidt. Our unsung hero this week is Kimberly Sullivan (ph). She works in our legal department and helped us last week with drafting some paperwork for an upcoming show. Legal work is often not the stuff of TV courtroom dramas. Lawyers often labor in the dark, and Kimberly mentioned how sad it was that people regularly skip over carefully crafted legal language because they think it's all legalese.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Many of us share our homes with animals - furry, feathered or scaly. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Hi Charles (ph). Oh, I haven't seen you in a while. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Was it a bad day? Yeah? You awake. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: They are definitely like my family members at this point. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Yeah. That's my righthand man. I got no kids, so that's my son, you know? He's my baby. VEDANTAM: Yet, as much as we love our pets, our behavior toward animals can be paradoxical. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Don't you think it's kind of weird that we're eating our cat's meat? And we, you know, have strong beliefs in not eating meat at this point. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: I think the more you love animals, the more you might consider being a vegetarian. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: The English Bulldog was made by science. You know what I'm saying? Like, I think lizards and reptiles belong with Mother Nature. I don't think English bulldog is a part of Mother Nature. So I'm a walking hypocrite, and I recognize that. And I'm OK with that. VEDANTAM: This week on HIDDEN BRAIN, we explore the contradictions and quandaries of our relationships with animals. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: When Hal Herzog's son, Adam, was young, he had a pet mouse named Willie. One day, Willie died, so Hal used this as a teaching moment. HAL HERZOG: We thought it would be a good lesson for the kids, in terms of understanding death, to have a funeral for him. After all, you know, he was a pet. The kids really liked him. And they were very upset when he died. And so we had a funeral. We got a little cardboard box and made a little casket. We took him into the backyard. We buried him. And we actually had a little headstone for him. We got some rocks and made a little headstone for him. VEDANTAM: A couple of days later, Hal's wife found some mouse droppings in the kitchen and asked him to do something about it. HERZOG: Well, my wife's a neatnik. And the idea that we would be sharing our house with, you know, with little creatures scampering around that were mice was not something that she could live with. So she asked me to kill the mouse, and I did. I went out and I bought a mousetrap. I put a little dab of peanut butter on it and put it under the kitchen. And the next morning, I got up and the mouse was dead. VEDANTAM: And, of course, you did what you always do with dead mice, which is you put it in a cardboard box and took it out of the back and gave it a funeral, right? HERZOG: No. I threw it in the bushes. VEDANTAM: Two dead mice, two very different responses. HERZOG: They were in different psychological categories. One was a pet, which a lot of people - including us - sort of considered Willie a family member. He had a name. And the other was a pest. He was freeloading by, you know, stealing our cheese and. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). HERZOG: . . . You know generally being what mice do, that is to say, a pest. So, you know, there is a completely different psychological, you know, relationship between Willie our pet and the pest. VEDANTAM: Hal Herzog is a professor of psychology at Western Carolina University. He's been studying human-animal interactions for more than 30 years. He writes about the contradictions in our attitudes toward mice and other creatures in his book \"Some We Love, Some We Hate, Some We Eat: Why It's So Hard To Think Straight About Animals. \" I asked him how the labels we place on animals - good mouse, bad mouse, pet or pest - change how we interact with them. HERZOG: Certainly one of the deepest and most important reasons that we treat animals differently is related to the categories that we put them. That's absolutely true. VEDANTAM: So here's a second story that also lays out a slightly related but different contradiction. Your family once also owned a pet snake. And a nasty rumor spread about what you were feeding the snake. What was the rumor? And what does that reveal, in some ways, about the relationship we have with animals? HERZOG: I got a call one day from a friend of mine who's an animal rights activist. And she said that she had gotten a call from one of her friends saying that I was going to our local animal shelter and getting kittens and taking them home and feeding them to our boa constrictor, who was like Willie, a pet and had a name, Sam. VEDANTAM: What does this to reveal about some of the contradictions we have about animals? You talk a little bit in the book about, you know, both sort of the abhorrence with which we receive this idea that anyone would dream of feeding kittens to snakes. But, of course, in your mind, this also produced something of a thought experiment and some questions about cats and snakes. HERZOG: It did. And actually, for the next couple of days, there was something that kept nagging me about that. And I was thinking, like, OK. You know, what Sam ate - he was a carnivore, like cats. And what he ate was mice. And so I would go, basically, to the pet shop and buy mice to feed to the snake - live mice. And I would, you know, kill the mice and give them to the snake. And I thought, well, wait a minute. There's cats being euthanized at the animal shelter that are unwanted. Wouldn't it be more ethical for me to actually go to the animal shelter and get the bodies of dead kittens as opposed to using - buying live mice? Wouldn't that be morally permissible? Wouldn't it be morally better to actually feed kittens to boa constrictors than to feed mice to boa constrictors? VEDANTAM: And of course, then, that means you went out to the animal shelter and did what the rumor was saying that you were doing. HERZOG: Of course I did not. We were - we had a pet cat at the time. We still have a pet cat. We live with cats. I love cats. I would never feed a cat to a boa constrictor. So this was a classic example of head versus heart. And I realized that moral consistency oftentimes leads us astray in our interactions with animals. And that really haunted me ever since. Like, how could I live in a world in which it was OK to feed kittens to boa constrictors? And interesting, Shankar, the original title of my book was \"Feeding Kittens To Boa Constrictors. \" But the editor and my agent immediately made me change it. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). HERZOG: . . . Because they said nobody would buy a book with that title. VEDANTAM: It sounds like the start of a bad Coen brothers movie. HERZOG: It does. And it snagged me a literary agent. But (laughter) they wouldn't - they wouldn't take the next step. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Tell me about another story that you describe in the book. This guy, Jim Thompson, he's a doctoral student you met. And he owned this very beautiful bird. And he started thinking about that bird. And then he did something unusual with this bird. Walk me through what he did. HERZOG: Yeah. He was a graduate student. And he was a very logical, rational, rational person. And he had a pet bird - it was a cockatiel, as I recall - that he really loved. And his mother had given him a copy of an animal rights magazine - I think it was Animals\u2019 Agenda at the time. And he read the magazine. It changed his life. So he became an animal rights activist, hardcore - became a vegan, quit wearing leather, made his girlfriend start doing all that stuff as well. And then one day, he looked at the bird, who lived in a cage. And he came to the conclusion - the intellectual conclusion that it was unethical to live with a bird in a cage. And so he took the bird outside and he freed it. And the bird flew out of the cage. And he said it was an amazing sight to see that bird take off. And then he told me - he looked at me, he said sheepishly, you know, I know she probably died. I know that I was doing it more for me than I was for the bird. VEDANTAM: You know, it made me think about all the ways in which we sort of relate to animals in some ways as if they were sort of fellow creatures. In other words, if you kept a fellow human being in a cage, it would seem absolutely unjust, immoral and wrong. And releasing that person from the cage would seem like the only right thing to do. And in some ways, we extend that logic when we talk about the bird. That's what he was doing. And as I was reading the story, it reminded me of another story you have in the book. This was a different story but, in some ways, it has the same subtext. Cookie was a 12-foot-long Nile crocodile at the Miami Serpentarium. A 6-year-old boy once fell into Cookie's enclosure. And the croc did what crocodiles do - he grabbed the child, pulled him underwater. What did the owner of the Serpentarium do next? HERZOG: Well, the owner of the - immediately, the owner of the Serpentarium jumped into - he heard the people watching, you know, gasp in horror. And he knew something was going on. He jumped into the cage and tried to save the kid - little David - and failed. And that night, Haast woke up in the middle of the night - I'm assuming he didn't get much sleep. He had a revolver - a Luger - in his bedroom. He put the shells in it. And he went into Cookie's cage and he put nine bullets in his brain. And by the way, he had had Cookie for many, many years. And Cookie was a favorite of his. It was an animal that he loved in a way that probably only herpetologists - somebody like me, you know, who studies reptiles and likes them, you know, can understand. I argue that, in some ways, it's the operation of a phenomenon that cognitive psychologists called heuristics. A heuristic is sort of a mental shortcut and it sometimes leads to good, you know, logical, correct answers, but sometimes it doesn't. And in this case, it seems to be the operation of a type of heuristic called the moral heuristic. And the moral heuristic is revenge. And at one point, The New York Times actually wrote an editorial about that event. And the editorial writer, I think, got it right. And the editorial writer wrote, killing Cookie made no sense intellectually, but it felt right emotionally. VEDANTAM: And the reason it didn't make sense intellectually, of course, is the idea that a crocodile would do what a crocodile does is hardly surprising. HERZOG: That's what crocodiles do. His brain is smaller than a walnut. He is a creature, largely, of instinct, particularly when it comes to food. And he was, you know, doing what crocodiles do. He was not a moral agent, you know, which I would argue is one of the biggest differences between humans and other species. We are moral agents. VEDANTAM: So the interesting thing is that Haast, the owner, in some ways related to Cookie as if Cookie was a person, that Cookie was a moral agent. And in some ways, that's a variation of what Jim Thompson was doing with the bird - wasn't it? - which is, you're assuming that the animal has agency and behaves or thinks or has human-like qualities and that you are therefore obliged or required to treat this other creature as if, in some ways, it had human-like qualities. HERZOG: I'm sure that if you interviewed Haast, he, you know, clearly would know the difference, at an intellectual level, between a crocodile and a person. But you're quite right. He's basically treated them the same way that we would a person. This similarly played out in a bizarre incident that happened in Tennessee, where an elephant named Mary killed its groom while in a circus parade in 1916. And they hung the elephant to death. And, you know, to me that was, you know, the ultimate example of where we've anthropomorphized animals - that we give it capital punishment in a sense for something that it was clearly not morally culpable. VEDANTAM: So people listening to these stories would say, wow, those are really, you know, crazy stories, but as you point out in the book, this tendency we have to anthropomorphize animals is actually really ubiquitous. You draw a contrast between the way we relate to the giant panda and the giant salamander. Tell me what the giant salamander is, what it looks like, and how our attitudes toward these different animals are shaped by the ways in some ways that we anthropomorphize them. HERZOG: Yeah, the - so the animals, in some way, are similar, the giant panda and the giant Chinese salamander, in that they're both endangered and they both live in China and they're both really special, although in quite different ways. The giant Chinese salamander is basically a 6-foot-long bag of brown slime with beady eyes. (Laughter) And, you know, to me, they're like - they're striking. I wouldn't say that they're beautiful, but they're stunning just in their size and they're - I don't know. (Laughter) To me, they're charismatic, but I don't think most people would agree with that. But you're not going to see the World Wildlife Fund putting a picture of the giant Chinese salamander on their logo. Instead, they use the panda. And the panda, you know, in some ways, looks a little bit like a human. But it's basically a faker in the sense that it has these giant circles around its eyes, which ethologists call baby releasers. So we look at that panda and it basically logs on to that - jams into that maternal instinct that we have when we see creatures with big eyes and it impose on them that in some ways it reminds us of a human infant. So, for example, researchers have shown that one of the biggest predictors of whether or not people will give money to save animals is the size of the animal's eyes. And pandas certainly have it when it comes to eye size. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: When we come back, do our pets actually improve our lives? HERZOG: Pet owners were better off in terms of their psychological and physical health than non-pet owners. But as they pointed out, so are people with Mercedes-Benzes. VEDANTAM: Stay with us. When we think about pets in the United States, we often picture cats, dogs, maybe a hamster. Hal Herzog says our relationship with animals, especially those we consider pets, is largely dictated by our communities and culture. So, for example, I've got a friend that's an anthropologist who was born and raised in Kenya. And in the village where he was raised, they kept dogs. The dogs were allowed to roam freely in the village. They really liked dogs that we would consider mean dogs because they scared away animals, and they scared away strangers. HERZOG: But they weren't considered pets. In fact, in his language, they don't even have a word for pet. And I went to ask him. I said, Nyaga, would you, like, you know, let a dog in your house when you were living in Africa? And he said, no. I said, would you let a dog eat at the table, you know, and, you know, feed him table scraps? He said, no. I said, Nyaga, would you let a dog sleep in your bed? And the look at the horror on his face, it was like if I said, hey, I've got this really cool rat I just caught down at the Hudson River. You want to sleep with it tonight? (LAUGHTER) HERZOG: And, in fact, I recently got some new data on this. So it turns out that in the United States, we have amongst the highest rate of dog ownership in the world. And there are enormous differences between countries in dog ownership. So there's about 250 dogs per thousand people in the United States. And in Egypt, there's about five dogs per thousand people. So these cultural variations in what people - you know, what's acceptable as a pet and what's not is just huge. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: I want to spend a moment talking about the relationships that we have with pets in North America. I know that people spend a lot of money on pets, but as I read your book, I was just shocked at how high that number is. How much do we spend on our pets every year, Hal? HERZOG: It's pushing about $80 billion a year right now. It's an enormous amount of money. VEDANTAM: I mean, that's a fleet of aircraft carriers. HERZOG: Yeah. Yeah, it is. And if you even adjusted for inflation, the amount of money that we spent on pets each year in the United States has more than doubled in the last 30 years per capita. VEDANTAM: Wow. HERZOG: The real increase in spending has been at the high end. Gourmet pet food for dogs - I mean, you can buy, you know, food that you would eat. In fact, you know, I tease my wife and I say, what we're going to do is, like, when we get ready for the giant decline is we're going to stock up on dog food and - you know, when the hurricane (ph) comes. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). HERZOG: But it's also things like, you know, pet day cares, pet spas. There's a hotel that has a zen room where you can get your pets a massage. And I don't know what else pets do in a zen room. We're talking about dog parks. We're talking about jeweled collars. We're talking about pet fashion weeks. We're talking about all these things. And the pet food industry, you know, calls this the humanization of pets. And it really has taken off in the last 30 years. Another factor is advertising and publicity by the pet products industry that push the idea that pets are good for people, that if you get a pet, you will be a happier and healthier person. VEDANTAM: Is this actually true, that owning a pet is good for your health and your longevity? HERZOG: We have overwhelming evidence now that for a lot of people, you know, interacting with their pet does have short-term effects on their physiology, lowers their stress, makes them feel better. The question you ask, however, was different. That was are pets really good for our health and make us live longer? And here my answer is that we don't have particularly good evidence for the long-term impact of pets on human health. I have a stack of reprints in my office, which people have found that, you know, people with pets, you know, they sleep better, that they go to the doctor less, that they have better well-being, that they're less lonely, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But I have another stack of reprints in my office that says just the opposite, that people with pets are more lonely, that they're more likely to go to the doctor, that they're more likely to drink a lot, that they're more likely to have ulcers. But you never hear about those studies, you know, in the news. They don't make the news. There's very little evidence that pets make people live longer. And one of the problems we have is which direction the causal arrow points. For example, a recent study by the RAND Corporation found that pet owners, in fact, were better off in terms of their psychological and physical health than non-pet owners. But as they pointed out, so are people with Mercedes-Benzes. People with pets tend to be wealthier. They tend to be younger. They tend to live in nicer places. In other words, the socioeconomic factors may be that it's not that pets are making people happier and healthier. It's that happier, healthier people are more likely to have pets. We have very little data to test those two different hypotheses. VEDANTAM: You present some really striking studies in the book, which talk in some ways of the downside of having pets. You say that some 85,000 Americans are injured each year according to the CDC because they trip over their pets or otherwise are injured by them. And I understand your neighbor Anne (ph) is one of those victims. HERZOG: My neighbor Anne is one of those victims. She's a classic case. She was walking her dog and the leash wrapped around her leg, and she fell over and she broke her collarbone. I recently went on Facebook, and I put a call out - I said if any of you have ever been injured by, you know, a pet by walking your dog, let's say, you know, please write me a note. And I could not believe the response - 80 people responded to me. Many of them were professionals in the field. Some of them even sent me their X-rays, which I - and I was - and some of these incidents were not trivial. Some of these incidents were life-changing. So there are downsides to pet ownership. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: So there's a new frontier in pet ownership now, and I want to play you a clip. This is from the company Sony, and they presented this account of a dog at a tech conference. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Let's start with design. First, the obvious - Aibo is adorable. He wags his tail, wiggles his ears, blinks his eyes and even does that doggy smile - you know that smile that dogs do when you scratch them just right and they kind of tilt their head and half close their eyes and they open their mouth a little and smile. Yeah, that smile. VEDANTAM: So, of course, Hal, Aibo isn't a real dog. Aibo is a robot, and it really looks like humans are completely indiscriminate when it comes to who we will consider and what we will consider to be pets. HERZOG: Yeah. The thing about Aibo - Aibo's got an interesting history. Sony originally developed Aibo and Aibo's a robotic dog, and it does all kind of things. It'll fetch. It'll signal you its emotions. It'll respond when you call its name. The problem with Aibo is that it's metal and shiny, so it doesn't have fur. So while Aibo had some real - it was expensive. It originally cost about 2,000 bucks. It didn't catch on initially. But Aibo was recently resurrected by Sony, and I've looked at the new promotional videos of Aibo, and I'm ready - I'm about ready to get one. It looks pretty good. Oh, and there have been studies where they've taken Aibo and some other types of robotic pets into things like nursing homes and - to see if they had the same impact on, you know, people living in nursing homes in terms of morale and well-being as they do a real dog. VEDANTAM: Right. HERZOG: And the results have been sort of mixed, but in some of the cases, Aibo has actually done better in some cases than an actual animal. VEDANTAM: And some of this, I'm guessing, might have to do with the fact that Aibo doesn't have some of the downsides that owning a real dog might have. Aibo is not going to bark uncontrollably at night or bark at your friends when they come over for a party. I mean, dogs and cats and pets can sometimes induce stress within families and emotional and psychological problems within households. HERZOG: Absolutely, they can. The other thing that Aibo doesn't do is raise the pesky ethical questions that come with pet ownership. You don't have to worry about the ethics of depriving Aibo of a sex life by castrating him. You don't have to worry about the ethics of leaving Aibo alone for long periods of time while you're at your office during the day. You don't have to take Aibo for a walk three times a day and then pick up poop as you walk it down the road. So I think Aibo's got some real advantages. VEDANTAM: So besides the many animals that you own that we've already talked about, you also own a cat whose name is Tilly. And you have what other cat owners might think is a rather idiosyncratic way of expressing your affection for Tilly. In the book you write, don't feel bad, Tilly. I love you even if you are a socially constructed parasite. Really, Hal? HERZOG: (Laughter) Yeah. The question is is she a parasite? And this is the view that pets are basically a form of evolutionarily what's called nest parasitism, which we see in birds. So, for example, let's take the cowbird. What a cowbird does is it lays its eggs in another bird's nest - let's say a wren's nest - and it then flies away and leaves its eggs for this wren to hatch. The wren then sits on the egg until it hatches and so that the wren winds up raising the bird up - the baby of another species. And that's what - that's how we got Tilly. What happened is, you know, this little kitten showed up one day on our doorstep. I was away. I came home and my wife had this strange grin on her face. And I thought, you know, that - you know, I've never quite seen that look. What it is that? She had this grin. And she says, come here, come here, come here. And she shows me this lovely little cat. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) HERZOG: And we were hooked. We were hooked. So what did we do? We've been raising Tilly ever since. You know, we've basically been conned by Tilly's mom to take care of her nestling, you know? We don't share any genes with Tilly, but yet the average pet owner over the life of the pet will invest roughly $10,000 in their pet. So we have $10,000 worth of nest parasite living with us. And we get our money's worth out of her. VEDANTAM: Or you think you get your money's worth because, of course, it's the parasite that's having the last laugh. HERZOG: Yeah (laughter) absolutely. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: When we come back - how the contradictions in the ways we think about animals lead to paradoxes in how we treat them. Hal Herzog is a professor of psychology at Western Carolina University. He's the author of the book \"Some We Love, Some We Hate, Some We Eat: Why It's So Hard To Think Straight About Animals. \" Hal, the contradictions in the way we think about animals lead to paradoxes and moral dilemmas in how we treat them. Let's look at the very, very simplest case. Millions of Americans like yourself own a cat. They care for their pet. They say they love animals. But you simultaneously say that loving your cat means subjecting other animals to suffering. How so? HERZOG: My cat's a serial killer. She is an indoor-outdoor cat. And so when she wants to go outside, I let her outside. And what she does some of the time is kill small animals, sometimes birds, more often it's small mice, voles, creatures like that. I am actually more conflicted by being a cat owner than I am over any other aspect of my relationships with animals. VEDANTAM: And, of course, the cat is doing what comes naturally to the cat. The cat is a predator. You can't expect the cat to be behaving any different. But the fact that millions of Americans own cats mean that in some ways they're at least indirectly sanctioning this mass murder of, for example, you know, songbirds. HERZOG: Yeah, and mass murder it is. Depending on the statistics, somewhere between 1 billion and 5 billion birds each year are killed by our pet cats. Furthermore, cats are obligate carnivores. They have to eat meat. And so I've got lots of friends that are vegetarians and vegans, and they're morally opposed to eating meat, but yet they keep cats and they have to buy animal flesh to keep their cats happy and healthy. It's a big moral problem for some people. VEDANTAM: You ran sort of the calculations on this, and you described them in the book. Mathematically, a cat consumes about two ounces of meat a day. That's about 50 pounds of meat a year. By contrast, snakes only consume maybe 5 pounds of meat a year, so the impact of having a cat - the moral impact, if you will - is 10 times greater than the moral impact of owning a snake. And yet, of course, most animal lovers will be horrified if you were to suggest replacing kittens with snakes or maybe even, as we discussed, feeding kittens to boa constrictors. HERZOG: Yeah. I actually developed this scale one time. I was interested in this issue, and I developed the scale, which I called the feeding kittens to boa constrictor scale. I was actually trying to make fun of psychological scales, but it turned out to produce some very interesting things. So, for example, most of my students that I gave this scale to said that it was OK to feed mice to boa constrictors, but it was not OK to feed mice to cats, which was interesting enough. And when I asked them, well, why - you know, why is it OK to feed mice to a boa constrictor but not a cat, one of my students put it perfectly. She said, if my cat ate mice, she wouldn't be like me. And that, to me, gets at this whole thing about what we project onto the animals that we lived with. You know, if my cats ate mice, she wouldn't be like me. Well, she's not like you, girl, you know? VEDANTAM: But in some ways, bringing sort of cat food home just like you bring your own groceries home allows that student, in some ways, to preserve that illusion, doesn't it? HERZOG: Absolutely. She's preserving the illusion. She's preserving the illusion. Now, if I were a better person, perhaps I would keep my cat indoors, which is a lot - what a lot of my friends tell me is I should make her an indoor cat. Well, I resist doing that and my reasoning is probably equally fallacious - is that, if I were a cat, I would rather be an indoor-outdoor cat than a cat that lives in a big cage and spends its day looking outside through the window at the birds floating around. Now, I know that by letting my cat go outdoors, I subject her to the tough things in the wild. In other words, she could get eaten by a coyote. She can't get hit by a car because we live on a road that doesn't have any cars go down it. But the life of an indoor-outdoor cat tends to be shorter, even though she's had a long and good life. But I can't completely justify doing that because of the toll she takes on the small animal life. But I live with it. VEDANTAM: So the more we think of animals as sort of members of our family, the more we think of them as being like us, in some ways, this raises a profound moral paradox - does it not? - which is that, if we actually think of these animals as being like us, how in the world can we, you know, in any good conscience, confine them to our homes, confine them to cages, treat them as if they were our captives to do with as we please? HERZOG: Well, I think that's a great point. It's something that I've been thinking about a lot lately. And I've really quite seriously been thinking about, is it ethical to keep animals as pets? If we really think of them as autonomous beings, what right do we have to take away all their autonomy by controlling every aspect of their life? - what they eat, where they go, when they go. And increasing, we're taking control of their genes, which created its own problems. And so I'm thinking, increasingly, that - I'm wondering about the ethics of keeping animals as pets. To me, the logic of pet keeping is not that different than the logic of meat eating. I eat meat. And I know the arguments against it are good and they're better than my argument for eating meat, which is, basically, I like the way it tastes. Well, I feel the same way about my cat. I love my cat, but she carries with her a moral burden. And it's my moral burden. It's not her moral burden. I'm the moral agent. I'm the adult in the room. And I'm the one that has to deal with thinking about this stuff. Although, most people conveniently repress it and don't think about it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: I'm wondering, Hal, in some ways - as you're pointing out - these contradictions are unresolvable. And given the contradictions that you've laid out and the paradoxes of being a pet owner, some of the moral costs that come with being a pet owner, if your current animals - you were to lose them, if they were to die, would you get replacements for them today? HERZOG: Boy, that's a great question. That is such a tough question. I've thought about it. I definitely would not get a dog. I miss having a dog, actually. My wife and I are both dog people. But we haven't had a dog for 10 years and it's because our lifestyle doesn't lend itself - I don't think a dog would be happy living in our house because we're away too much during the day. I can't stand the idea of leaving them in a kennel. Our cat's happy to live by herself. And I think the answer is yes. I think the answer is that I would get another cat. VEDANTAM: The moral dilemmas of pet ownership pale in comparison to the moral dilemmas posed by our use of animals in sport and as food. Hal explores some of the deepest contradictions we have toward animals by looking at the sport of cockfighting. HERZOG: First of all, cockfighting is more illegal now than it was when I was doing that work, but it's just as brutal now. So basically, in a cockfight, what - you have two chickens and you have two handlers and you have a referee and a pit, which is roughly 15 feet in diameter. The referee says pit them. The handlers let them go. And the two roosters try and kill each other. One rooster, almost invariably, dies because they have gaffs, which are basically knives attached to their legs. And it's basically about gambling. There's money changing hands. And so I entered this clandestine world and lived in that clandestine world for a couple of years. VEDANTAM: Now, anyone who hears what you've just described would say, all right, this is morally unconscionable. We cannot allow this to happen. We need to ban this sport. And it has been banned in all parts of the country and many parts of the world. But tell me a little bit more about what happens when you look more closely at the life of one of these roosters that's raised for cockfighting. And you contrast this, in some ways, with the life of your average broiler chicken. HERZOG: Yeah. Well, first I want to say that I do not justify cockfighting. Everything you said about it is correct. It is brutal. It is unjustified. It's now banned throughout the United States. And it should be banned throughout the United States. I'm not trying to justify to - you know, for me, as I started studying cockfighters and how they thought, I became really interested in their moral worlds. And I also began to ask myself some difficult questions. And one of the difficult questions was, if I were a chicken - if I come back in the next world as a chicken, would I rather be an east Tennessee gamecock or would I rather be a McNugget; in other words, a chicken raised in a broiler house to become a McNugget. And to me, there is no doubt in my mind I would much rather be a gamecock than a chicken destined to be served at McDonald's. VEDANTAM: Can you describe to me how you reached that conclusion? What is the life of that gamecock? And what is the life of that chicken that ends up as a McNugget? HERZOG: OK. First, let's take a gamecock. They live long lives. And they live lives that are generally - compared to a broiler chicken - pretty darn amazing. They live, on average, two years. They're not usually fought until they're two years old. For a chunk of their life, they live in free range or they have way more room than a broiler chicken. They're fed incredibly well - a varied diet. They get plenty of exercise. If they win a couple fights, they will use them as a stud rooster. And what they'll do is they'll spend their life chasing the hens around. Not a bad deal. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) HERZOG: On the other hand, the life of a broiler chicken is absolutely horrendous. Their life only lasts between six and seven weeks. They're basically meat machines, which means that they put on weight so fast that their legs can't really hold up their bodies. And so they have chronic leg pain, who's been called the world's largest animal welfare problem. They're jammed into giant broiler houses with 30,000 chicks in a broiler house, where they'll never see the sun. They'll never get to play on the grass. They'll never get to peck at bugs. Their lungs will be burned with ammonia. It's an absolutely horrendous existence. And they will die a pretty lousy death. They'll be crammed into a series of cages. They'll be hauled, for miles, in an open truck, jammed into small little cages with their feathers flying down the interstate, where they will be hung upside down by their legs, dipped into an electrified water bath to stun them. And then they'll go through a carotid artery set of blades that will, hopefully, kill them quickly - although, oftentimes, it does not. So the life of a (laughter) the life of a gamecock, oddly, is vastly better than the life of the 9 billion chickens that Americans eat each year. VEDANTAM: I mean, that is a billion with a B. HERZOG: Yeah. VEDANTAM: You write in the book, while Americans will sleep easy at night knowing cockfighting is banned in all 50 states, 35 million chickens will be stuffed into wire crates on their way to processing plants tomorrow. That makes you. . . HERZOG: Yeah. That's in one day. VEDANTAM: That makes you think, doesn't it? HERZOG: Yeah. Absolutely does. When I began doing my research on the comparative cruelty of cockfighting (laughter) versus McNuggets, I was stunned. I mean, I just - I was absolutely stunned. And I realized, you know, cockfighting should be illegal, but the casual chicken eater is committing a bigger sin in their own way than is the rooster fighter. And by the way, rooster fighters love their animals. That was one of the things I had a hard time wrapping my head around. It was like, these guys really love chickens. VEDANTAM: The comedian Chris Rock once went on David Letterman and talked about some of the contradictions in the way we think about animals. He contrasted the football player Michael Vick, who went to prison for promoting dogfighting, with the former governor of Alaska and hunting enthusiast Sarah Palin. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LATE NIGHT WITH DAVID LETTERMAN\") CHRIS ROCK: And she's shooting mooses. And she got the moose. (LAUGHTER) ROCK: Holding a dead, bloody moose. (LAUGHTER) ROCK: And Michael Vick's like, why am I in jail? (LAUGHTER) ROCK: What the hell? But you let a white lady shoot a moose. (LAUGHTER) DAVID LETTERMAN: Yeah. ROCK: Black man want to kill a dog, that's a crime. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: It does sound like a double standard, Hal. HERZOG: Yeah, it does sound like a double standard. We see the same thing in lots of areas of human-animal interactions. So for example, take cockfighting - cockfighting is a sport of lower-socioeconomic-status whites and Hispanics. And on the other hand, compare that with the sport of kings, horseracing. Horseracing is finally coming under the gun. In the last couple months, as you probably know, I think almost 30 animals were killed at the Santa Anita racetrack in California. And this has been going on for years and years and years. A number of thoroughbred horses that die, numbers in the thousands and thousands each year. But yet, very few people get bent out of shape about horseracing compared to cockfighting. VEDANTAM: So it is a class thing in some ways, isn't it? HERZOG: Very much so. Very much so. It's a class thing. VEDANTAM: We started this conversation, Hal, by talking about some stories and paradoxes and contradictions from your own life, and I want to end the conversation in the same way. When you were in grad school, you were once asked to put a number of different creatures into boiling water. Why were you asked to do this? And walk me through what happened. HERZOG: Yeah. I was working in a chemical ecology lab. And we were interested in the chemical perceptions of - in this case it was reptiles snakes - baby snakes. And we basically were interested in whether or not these animals were born with an instinctive preference for certain types of foods. And, of course, they eat live animals. So in this case, there was another researcher in Utah that was interested in doing similar research for his dissertation. And he sent our lab, basically, a menagerie. It came in a big box, which basically said, this side up. Live animals. And the box contained an array of animals. It contained worms, crickets. It contained some scorpions. It contained a lizard. It contained another snake. It contained - and then a mouse. And so I was the lowest ranking member of the lab. So they assigned me to basically convert these animals to a solution that could be dabbed on a swab and exposed to these snakes. And so the procedure involves dropping these animals into water that was not quite boiling. And I thought, OK, I'll do it. And I had dropped the first one in that I think was a cricket. And it just died instantly. And then I did the Scorpion, which was a bigger animal. And it didn't die so quickly. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) HERZOG: And then I had to do the, as I recall, it was a lizard. And, you know, I like lizards. I like reptiles. And it was not good. You know, it took much longer time for the lizard to die in the water. And I was getting upset. And then I was working my way up the phylogenetic scale. And then there was the mouse. It was a cute little mouse. It wasn't a lab mouse. It was one of these cute little woodland mice. And I took a look at the mouse and as I recall, I actually picked it up, was getting ready to drop it in the water and I just couldn't do it. And I just put the mouse back in its cage. And I went and told the lab manager, I can't do this. Somebody else is going to have to do it. That just haunted me for a very long time. And it really was the event that got me on this journey that I've been on for more than 30 years now about trying to understand why it was so easy to do the cricket and harder to do the lizard and I couldn't do the mouse. And, you know, I've never come to grips with it, but I've been chasing that down. It really is the thing that got me thinking about the psychology of human-animal interactions and why we treat some animals different than other. VEDANTAM: So one way that people justify eating meat and treating animals the way they do is that they believe that there's a status hierarchy between animals and it's along the lines of what happened in your lab. So worms are lower on the scale than scorpions. Scorpions are lower on the scale than mice. You once watched the Steven Spielberg movie \"E. T. \" with your daughter. And you came up with a thought experiment that probably ruined the movie for her. HERZOG: (Laughter) Actually, it was my twin daughters, they were both there. And probably most listeners are aware of what happens at the end of the movie. So E. T. and Elliott are running around California. They're buddies for, you know, the previous two hours. And at the end, E. T. 's mom comes back to get him in the flying saucer. And E. T. , with that great big head and big eyes, looks at Elliott and he says - he croaks, he goes. . . (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"E. T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL\") PAT WELSH: (As E. T. ) Come. HERZOG: You know, like, you know, come with me. We'll go back to Zork and we'll have a great time, you know. And Elliott says, no. I can't do it. I'm going to stay here. And E. T. takes off, you know and goes back to Zork and it's all good. And (laughter) my daughters - I don't know what I was thinking. I said, hey, girls, what if E. T. wanted Elliott to go back to Zork with him? And so he grabs Elliott. . . (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"E. T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL\") HERZOG: . . . And he drags him screaming into the flying saucer because they want to use Elliott in a research experiment. They want to use him in an experiment because there's like this AIDS-like virus invading the people of Zork. And the Zorkians are much smarter than Americans. They're much smarter than Elliott. Would it be OK for E. T. to kidnap Elliott and take him and use him in biomedical research experiment? And my kids, they're horrified. No, dad. No. No. And I thought the same thing. No, that would not be a good idea. But on the other hand, what I realized was that our use of animals in biomedical research is based on the same premise. You know, we're smarter than other creatures. We're way smarter than mice. We're way smarter than dogs. We're somewhat smarter than chimpanzees in our own ways. And that's our justification for using animals in biomedical research. And I was forced to the conclusion that, look; if we're going to use animals in research, we got to let E. T. take Elliott back to Zork and use him in a cage. Obviously, it's the same sort of thought experiment that I did when I concluded we ought to feed kittens to boa constrictors, you know? But I still can't wrap my head around that. My heart's telling me one thing, even though logic is telling me something else. And that's the gist of a lot of our inconsistencies with our interactions with animals. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Hal Herzog is a professor of psychology at Western Carolina University. He is the author of the book \"Some We Love, Some We Hate, Some We Eat: Why It's So Hard To Think Straight About Animals. \" Hal, thanks for joining me today on HIDDEN BRAIN. HERZOG: Oh, thanks for having me. I really enjoyed it. VEDANTAM: To learn more about Hal and his research, check out his blog, Animals And Us, from Psychology Today. This week's show was produced by Thomas Lu. It was edited by Tara Boyle and Rhaina Cohen. Our team includes Parth Shah, Laura Kwerel and Jenny Schmidt. Our unsung hero this week is Kimberly Sullivan (ph). She works in our legal department and helped us last week with drafting some paperwork for an upcoming show. Legal work is often not the stuff of TV courtroom dramas. Lawyers often labor in the dark, and Kimberly mentioned how sad it was that people regularly skip over carefully crafted legal language because they think it's all legalese. Well, Kimberly, we read and appreciated every word you wrote. For more HIDDEN BRAIN, you can find us on Facebook and Twitter. If you liked today's show, please remember to share it with one friend. We're always looking for new people to discover HIDDEN BRAIN. One last thing before we go - have you ever been in a situation where you did something you never thought you'd do? Maybe you acted out when you were in the thrall of anger, hunger or sexual attraction. We're looking for stories about situations where what people think they do turns out to be very different from what they actually do. If you'd like to share a time when this happened to you, please record your story on your phone and email it to us at hiddenbrain@npr. org. Include your full name and phone number and use the subject line, emotions. Again, that's hiddenbrain@npr. org.

A Silicon Valley startup is trying to get the plastic out of clothing and put something else in, something that will not last centuries. NPR's Christopher Joyce reports on their experiment in, of all places, a sewage treatment plant. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Molly Morse runs a company in California that makes something called a biopolymers. They're like plastic but made in nature by living things. She calls her company Mango Materials, after her favorite fruit. She says she wanted to sound different. MOLLY MORSE: We're, if you didn't notice, not your typical Silicon Valley startup company. Like, we're manufacturing polymers at the wastewater treatment plant. We're not a bunch of guys in a garage coding. JOYCE: So how did this come to be? Well, when Molly Morse was in elementary school, she went to an aquarium and stumbled on an exhibit about plastic trash floating in the ocean. MORSE: And there was this huge, gigantic, like, fish tank-type structure full of clamshells - like Styrofoam clamshells from McDonald's. And I was floored - like, completely horrified. Like, it changed my life. And I was like, that is freaking ridiculous, and I'm going to change it. JOYCE: She followed through. Morse went to Stanford University and got a Ph. D. in environmental engineering. At a scientific conference in 2006, she met this young engineer, Anne Schauer-Gimenez. ANNE SCHAUER-GIMENEZ: I mean, I think we were up till, like, 4 in the morning or something just talking about research and how this process works. JOYCE: The process was how to make biopolymers. These are malleable materials similar to plastic, but they're made by living things, like cellulose from trees or silk from silkworms. And the bonus is biopolymers can be broken down into natural substances. The two engineers looked for ways to brew up batches of this stuff. They settled on bacteria, special kinds that make their own biopolymers, especially, says Morse, if you overfeed them. MORSE: If we were to get really fat from eating a lot of ice cream or chocolate, we accumulate fat inside our bodies. These bacteria, same thing. JOYCE: Schauer-Gimenez went for that. SCHAUER-GIMENEZ: To me, microorganisms kind of run the show on planet Earth anyway. So why not let them help us with this process? JOYCE: But the bacteria need lots of food to do that, and that's why they ended up at a sewage treatment plant in Redwood City, Calif. For the bacteria, sewage is food - or at least the methane gas from sewage. Treatment plants usually burn off the methane or just vent it into the air. Here, it's fed to bacteria. ALLISON PIEJA: So this is where the magic happens in terms of the fermentation. JOYCE: Engineer Allison Pieja is the third member of the Mango team. She's the bug expert and nurtures the bacteria in a fermenter, kind of like a big beer keg with pipes sticking in it like IV drips. PIEJA: We add the methane and oxygen continuously and kind of drip in our secret sauce based on how the bacteria are growing. JOYCE: The secret sauce is an additive that the team developed to keep the process going. Eventually, they bust open the bacteria and harvest the biopolymer. So far, they've shipped 1,700 pounds of that biopolymer to companies to test it in packaging and textiles. In a boardroom at the sewage plant, Morse shows me the results. MORSE: So this was our fiber grade. JOYCE: Brightly colored threads, plastic-y (ph) like polyester maybe. The hope is to weave the biopolymer into clothing to replace regular plastics - biodegradable clothing, which, says Schauer-Gimenez, freaks people out. SCHAUER-GIMENEZ: Oh, my gosh. You're going to make a swimsuit out of your material. I'm going to go in the ocean, and it's going to biodegrade off of my body. And I'm like no, no, no, no, no. It doesn't quite work like that. JOYCE: Biopolymers need warm temperatures and the right bacteria around to chew them up, and it takes weeks or months of constant exposure. Some kinds of biopolymers, ones made from plant materials like corn, take much longer to degrade, and that's given them a bad reputation. RAMANI NARAYAN: Making a statement - biodegradable - that is misleading, especially to the general public. JOYCE: Ramani Narayan is a chemical engineer at Michigan State University. He says the longer something takes to biodegrade, the longer it's litter. NARAYAN: In that intervening period, it is going to have impacts. And that is what needs to be carefully considered. JOYCE: Theoretically, biopolymers could be recycled. But Narayan points out that the recycling industry in the U. S. is already overwhelmed. Less than 10% of plastic currently gets recycled. Some research says even less. NARAYAN: If we don't have the right waste management infrastructure in play, then all the things we do at the top end of it is going to be useless. JOYCE: The Mango entrepreneurs say their biopolymer will break down faster than others and doesn't need to be recycled. Morse does acknowledge that there's a long way to go to get these biopolymers mainstreamed. In the meantime, she urges people to use less plastic and reuse things instead of throwing them away. But she's following her childhood dream to find something better than plastic. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

Arthur Brooks takes on that question in a new essay in The Atlantic. His research and data point to a pretty depressing conclusion that for most people in most fields, professional decline starts earlier - years earlier than we've been led to think. Arthur Brooks, welcome. ARTHUR BROOKS: Hi, Mary Louise. It's great to be with you. KELLY: Great to have you with us. Before we get to the data, is there a story for why you started digging into this? BROOKS: (Laughter) There is. You know, about four years ago, I was sort of on top of the world professionally. I was - things were going great for me. I was the president of the American Enterprise Institute, a position that I'll have for the next week and a half or so. KELLY: We'll get to that. BROOKS: Yeah. KELLY: A big think tank in Washington. . . BROOKS: Yeah, big think tank in Washington, D. C. KELLY: . . . We should say, OK. BROOKS: It's a great place. I was writing books that people read. Things couldn't have gone better. But I had an experience where I was sitting in front of a guy - an older gentleman - on a plane. And he was talking to his wife, and I was - I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but I couldn't help but hear. And he was saying he wished he were dead. And I thought it was somebody who must have been really disappointed about his life. But then at the end of the flight, he stood up, and I recognized him as somebody who's really quite prominent and who'd done a lot with his life. And I thought to myself, what's he doing wrong - maybe nothing. KELLY: Right. If this guy isn't happy. . . BROOKS: Yeah, it may be nothing, you know. . . KELLY: . . . Or feeling in his prime, what happened? BROOKS: . . . But you know, maybe there's some science that's behind it. So I decided to figure out how after 50 life can get better and more fulfilling. And I think I found the answers. KELLY: There is scientific evidence that our abilities professionally decline. . . BROOKS: Yeah. KELLY: . . . Earlier than. . . BROOKS: That's right. KELLY: . . . We all had been hoping. BROOKS: In virtually every field, we find that people decline before they think they're going to decline. There's a reason that the mandatory retirement age for air traffic controllers is 56 years old. They peak out in in their ability to do that high-concentration mental work. And it tells us something about the way that the human brain works, something that's very depressing at first. But it turns out that it can be illuminating and even really encouraging once you dig a little bit deeper. KELLY: And you also found this varies actually pretty hugely across fields. BROOKS: Yeah. KELLY: You write about the difference between something called fluid intelligence and crystallized intelligence. BROOKS: That's right. KELLY: Explain. BROOKS: So people start off their careers relying on their fluid intelligence - that analytic speed or ability to figure stuff out fast. That's fluid intelligence. But it tends to start. . . KELLY: So an example being what? What's your job? BROOKS: A lawyer, for example - if you're in any sort of business, early on, I mean, it's just like clicking, clicking fast. That's something that will distinguish you, that will set you apart, that will make it possible for you to succeed in a big way. The problem is that that fluid intelligence naturally starts to decline and precipitously so starting in one's early 30s. And that's the reason that lawyers will feel - in their 40s and 50s, they'll notice they've missed a step. Now. . . KELLY: Could accumulated wisdom - does that point us toward. . . BROOKS: Well, that's the important thing. KELLY: OK, go there. BROOKS: This is the point that you're making. Now, people will rage against the decline in their fluid intelligence. But they're missing something really big, which is that curve may be going down, but there's another curve that's going up. That's called crystallized intelligence. That's your stock of wisdom. That's the vast library that you're accumulating - all the books in your library that are your mind. And your ability to use them with wisdom - that increases through your 40s and 50s and 60s and stays high if you've got your marbles through your 70s and 80s. And that's what you need to rely on. You need to - here's the key. Here's the trick, Mary Louise. You've got to stop being an innovator and start being an instructor. KELLY: An instructor. BROOKS: An instructor is somebody who synthesizes ideas and expresses them in new and interesting ways that people can understand, that enriches other people, that you can bring other people in - you could literally be a teacher. But stop trying to achieve the Nobel Prize-winning paper, and start thinking about how others have done things and how the patterns all come together. That is truly one of the great strategies of the happiest people who've ever lived. KELLY: So how is all this shaking out for you? We mentioned you are head of a big D. C. think tank. . . BROOKS: Yeah. KELLY: . . . American Enterprise Institute, doing great. You're how old, if I may ask? BROOKS: I'm 55. I just turned 55 years old. KELLY: Congratulations. BROOKS: Thank you very much. KELLY: How are you applying this to you? BROOKS: (Laughter) I started this project because I wanted to know what I should do by about the age of 55. KELLY: And here we are. BROOKS: And I determined that it was after about 10 years in my position as the chief executive of the American Enterprise Institute, it's important to move into something else and to hand the keys over to somebody else. So a new president will be taking over starting July 1. And I'm going to go to Harvard and teach at the Kennedy School and Harvard Business School and work with students and write books. And life is sweet, and I can't wait.

What they found is interesting, but it's also interesting how they found it out. Here's NPR's Pien Huang. PIEN HUANG, BYLINE: It starts with spy satellites. SUMMER RUPPER: These satellites were, of course, put up to essentially peer over the Iron Curtain. HUANG: Summer Rupper from the University of Utah says that high-resolution spy satellites were launched during the Cold War to take pictures of hard-to-reach places on Earth. Some of that data has been declassified in the last decade, and so Rupper and her colleagues are using those images to figure out what glaciers in the Himalayas looked like back in the 1970s and '80s. Joshua Maurer of Columbia University is a lead author on their new study in Science Advances. He says that having a historical record is super useful. JOSHUA MAURER: Glaciers, they can respond to climate over time scales that are fairly long. And so the fact that we can look back further in time several decades ago really helps us pin down how they are responding to the climate. HUANG: They compared the spy satellite data with images taken in the last 20 years, and they found that the glaciers in the Himalayas have been losing 20 inches of ice a year. That means they're melting twice as fast now as they were in the '80s and '90s. The Himalayas' glaciers supply fresh water for billions of people in South Asia. More than half of those glaciers are projected to melt in the next 80 years because of climate change. Rupper says that she's glad this data is out there and available to researchers. It's a treasure trove for scientists. RUPPER: Essentially, what we're doing is capturing the changes in the terrain. So you could do this for landslides, you could do it for volcanic eruptions. We focused on glaciers, but these images are useful for any sort of land surface changes that people might be interested in over time.

It's a new rule called Affordable Clean Energy, and it replaces one of President Obama's signature efforts to address climate change. NPR's Jeff Brady joins us now with details. Hi, Jeff. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: So what's the difference between President Trump's Affordable Clean Energy, or ACE, as they are calling it, and Obama's Clean Power Plan? BRADY: Well, the Obama rule, the Clean Power Plan, it was more sweeping and more specific. It directed states to reduce emissions from power plants by nearly a third by year 2030. It let states figure out how to do that, but for many of them, that would've meant shutting down coal-fired power plants because they emit more greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, which, of course, contribute to climate change. The ACE rule is more narrowly focused and gives states more discretion. This rule looks at individual power plants and what can be done to make them more efficient. That means under the Trump administration rule, it's more likely that a coal plant currently operating could stay open longer. SHAPIRO: The Obama administration's Clean Power Plan actually never took effect because two dozen states, many of them coal-producing states, sued to block it. How are people in those states and the coal industry responding today? BRADY: Well, they're very happy about this rule change. They thought the Obama administration overstepped its authority under the Clean Air Act with its plan. At the EPA headquarters today, there were some coal workers in their gear and hard hats for the announcement. At one point, they were given a standing ovation. And among the speakers was Michelle Bloodworth. She's head of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity. She said this new rule will prevent more coal power plants from shutting down or retiring, as the industry calls it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MICHELLE BLOODWORTH: Avoiding additional retirements is so important given that 40% of the coal fleet has either retired or announced retirement. And we expect under the Clean Power Plan, there certainly would've been a lot more. BRADY: Of course, President Trump campaigned saying that he would help the coal industry, but dozens of plants have shut down since he was elected, mostly because natural gas and renewable energy are cheaper. SHAPIRO: And what are environmental groups saying about the new rule today? BRADY: They're very critical of this rule. Climate change is on a lot of people's minds now, and they think the country should be doing more to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, not less. Joining the criticism are former Obama administration officials who were involved in writing the Clean Power Plan. Janet McCabe was at the EPA back then. JANET MCCABE: I think what this rule cements in people's minds is that this administration has no intent of doing anything meaningful to address climate change, which is affecting people and communities across the country now, and that will increase. BRADY: Environmental groups and others have already said they plan to sue to challenge this plan. A key question will be how far can the EPA go in setting national policy on carbon emissions, because there's a sense that this rule change from the Trump administration could make it more difficult for future administrations to take an aggressive approach. SHAPIRO: The whole purpose of the Clean Power Plan was to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the U. S. How is the country doing on that front? BRADY: You know, not bad, actually. The country has almost reached the Clean Power Plan goal a decade early, but the reasons have very little to do with policy. It's more a function of markets favoring natural gas and renewable energy. I've talked with plant owners who say they can shut down a coal plant, build a couple gas plants, produce a lot more electricity and still have room left over to put some solar panels and industrial park because they don't have to have all that room to store coal and coal ash after it's burned. So the economics just don't favor coal power plants right now. Still, scientists say that to avoid the worst effects of climate change, we need to reduce emissions a lot more, basically down to nothing, within about three decades. And many experts say it's difficult to see how that could happen without aggressive federal policies. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Jeff Brady. Thank you. BRADY: Thank you.

You're a receptionist at, say, a hotel. Someone walks in and says they found a lost wallet, but they're in a hurry. They hand it to you. What would you do? Well, researchers have looked at that question using thousands of supposedly dropped wallets from all around the world. NPR's Merrit Kennedy has more on what they found. MERRIT KENNEDY, BYLINE: The experiment started small. A research assistant in Finland pretending to be a tourist turned in a few wallets containing different amounts of money. He'd walk up to the counter of a big public place, like a bank or a post office. ALAIN COHN: Acting as a tourist, he mentioned that he found the wallet outside around the corner. And then he asked the employees to take care of it. KENNEDY: Alain Cohn from the University of Michigan says surveys show most people think more money in the wallet would make people less likely to return it. He even thought so. But actually, what they were seeing was the exact opposite. COHN: People were more likely to return a wallet when it contained a higher amount of money. At first, we almost couldn't believe it and told him to triple the amount of money in the wallet. But yet again, we found the same puzzling finding. KENNEDY: The researchers decided to do the experiment on a much larger scale. They dropped off more than 17,000 lost wallets in 40 countries. All of the wallets looked about the same - a small clear case with a few business cards, a grocery list and a key. Some had no money, and some had the local equivalent of about $13. And around the world, they kept finding the same thing. In 38 out of 40 countries, people were more likely to return the wallets with money. And in three countries, they dropped wallets containing nearly a hundred bucks. Cohn says the results were even more dramatic. COHN: The highest reporting rate was found in the condition where the wallet included $100. KENNEDY: So what's behind all this honesty? The researchers think there are two main explanations. First, just basic altruism. COHN: Basically, if you don't return the wallet, you feel bad because you harmed another person. KENNEDY: There's some evidence for that. They ran a test where just some wallets contained a key, only valuable to the person who lost it. Those wallets were about 10% more likely to be returned. Cohn says he also thinks the results have a lot to do with how people see themselves, and most people don't want to see themselves as a thief. COHN: The more money the wallet contains, the more people say that it would feel like stealing if they do not return the wallet. KENNEDY: The rates that wallets were returned varied a lot by country, even though money in the wallet almost always increased the chances. The researchers think the country's wealth is one factor, but a lot more research is needed to explain the differences. Duke University economist Dan Ariely studies dishonesty. He says this shows material benefits are not necessarily people's only motivation. DAN ARIELY: We see that a lot of dishonesty is not about the cost-benefit analysis, not about what I stand to gain and what I stand to lose. But instead, it's about what we can rationalize. To what extent can we rationalize this particular behavior? KENNEDY: Cohn says their study, which appears in the journal Science, suggests people are too pessimistic about the moral character of others. COHN: I think it's a good reminder that other people might be more similar to you and not always assume the worst. KENNEDY: And sometimes, honesty does pay. After people reported a lost wallet, they got to keep the cash. Merrit Kennedy, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF FOUR TET'S \"TEENAGE BIRDSONG\") LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:   Picture this.

You get an electric car. You go charge it up. And then you think, wait, where's this electricity coming from? Nationwide, 60% of it comes from power plants burning coal and natural gas, which produce carbon dioxide. So can the companies that provide our electricity change that? NPR's Dan Charles went to North Carolina to find out. DAN CHARLES, BYLINE: North Carolina's governor, Roy Cooper, made a big announcement last fall. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ROY COOPER: Today, I will sign an unprecedented executive order that sets the goal for our state to achieve a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2025. CHARLES: The place where the state can do that most quickly and easily is at power plants - replace coal and gas with wind and solar, which is controversial, but it's not as much a partisan issue as it used to be. Because wind and solar are so much cheaper now, it changed the mind of John Szoka, a state legislator. JOHN SZOKA: I would describe myself as a conservative Republican who has come to believe in renewable energy based on the economic facts behind it. CHARLES: There are big companies pushing clean power now. Ivan Urlaub from the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association represents some of them. IVAN URLAUB: We've got low-cost clean energy that's like fruit that's falling off the tree, it's laying on the ground, it's been rotting for 10 years. And let's just pick it up. CHARLES: And there are people saying we've got to stop climate change, like Democratic state legislator Pricey Harrison. PRICEY HARRISON: I would like to see us move away from fossil fuel dependency completely. CHARLES: And all this pressure is aimed at one company - Duke Energy. It's the electricity provider in most of North Carolina, owned by shareholders, regulated by the state utilities commission. This is a very common arrangement across the country. So I went to meet Duke Energy in an office tower in downtown Charlotte, the second-highest building in North Carolina. I mean, look at this view - just. . . RANDY WHEELESS: Yeah, so this is the convention center there. And there's the NASCAR Hall of Fame there. CHARLES: Randy Wheeless is a spokesman for the company. WHEELESS: Duke Energy's one of the largest electric utilities in the nation. We cover six states, a little over 7 million customers. CHARLES: As for how much carbon dioxide the company releases every year. . . WHEELESS: We are 105 million tons. CHARLES: Of CO2. WHEELESS: Right. CHARLES: That's more than the total emissions of a small country, like Greece or Chile. Now, about a third of the company's electricity comes without any greenhouse emissions at all. It's from nuclear plants. And carbon emissions from its other power plants have been falling. It's been shutting down the ones that burn coal, mainly switching over to natural gas, which is cheaper and releases less carbon. It plans to keep doing this, reducing emissions by 40% over the next 15 years. But even natural gas still releases a lot of heat-trapping carbon dioxide. What would it take for Duke Energy to cut that number by 90%? WHEELESS: That's going to be tough. I think what you're looking there is you're going to have to have some sort of carbon capture, some sort of new technology that's not really on the table right now. CHARLES: I press him on this. Could they do more with the technology that's available now? Wheeless says no, going faster would make electricity more expensive. WHEELESS: You know, I think a lot of environmentalists talk about the end of the world, but there a lot of people still worried about the end of the month and how to pay bills. CHARLES: For everybody in the state who's been pushing for a big, quick shift to clean energy, this is frustrating. Dozens of North Carolinians showed up at a meeting of the state utilities commission in February, demanding that the regulators step in and reject Duke Energy's plans. Here's Karen Bearden from Raleigh. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KAREN BEARDEN: It is critical to move to a just transition to 100% renewable energy fast, y'all, with the urgency of the crisis that we are in. CHARLES: But it's not clear what regulators will do. Under North Carolina law, they're supposed to make sure that Duke Energy delivers reliable power at the lowest possible cost, and that's cost to consumers, not cost to the environment. It's a puzzle that people are trying to figure out all over the country. How do you get electric utilities to go green? States in the Northeast are forcing them to, making it steadily more expensive to burn fossil fuels. In North Carolina, some people are saying let's bring in competition, like Jim Warren, director of an environmental justice organization called NC WARN - warn as in warning. He thinks if other companies had a chance to offer Duke Energy's customers a better deal, they'd prove clean energy is cheaper. JIM WARREN: What we really would like to see is that, you know, the monopoly be restructured and we have a situation where we have competition. And then let's let the marketplace figure it out. CHARLES: Others, though, say a regulated monopoly can do a great job cutting carbon emissions. Cara Goldenberg, a senior associate at the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit energy consulting group, says it's just a matter of giving those utilities the right incentives. CARA GOLDENBERG: You don't necessarily need to use sticks all the time, but there's also carrots, right? There's also these new business model incentives that can bring the utility along in this transition. CHARLES: For instance, she says, regulators can change the rules so utilities don't just earn money selling electricity. They can get paid for cutting their greenhouse emissions. GOLDENBERG: Give the utility a goal. If you meet that goal, we're going to reward you. If you don't meet that goal, there could be a penalty. CHARLES: Regulators could also let a utility charge higher rates for upgrading its electrical grid so it's ready to handle electricity generated by solar arrays on millions of people's homes. Or you could let utilities charge customers for the costs of managing the demand for power. Conceivably, a utility could control its customer's hot water heaters or electric car chargers, turn them on and off, so the demand for electricity always matches what's being generated by the wind and the sun, hour by hour. Goldenberg says some states, like Colorado and Massachusetts, are already using these tools, and it's turning some electric utilities into partisans of clean power. Dan Charles, NPR News.

Scientists didn't put them there. They were there to begin with. NPR's Joe Palca recently went to Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, where he spoke with a scientist who's exploring those genes. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: The scientist is Wellington Muchero. Oak Ridge lab is part of the Department of Energy, so Muchero and his colleagues are primarily interested in the genes that will make plants into better bio fuels. Muchero takes me into a greenhouse filled with small trees in pots. WELLINGTON MUCHERO: So these are all poplar trichocarpa. PALCA: Poplar trichocarpa is the black cottonwood tree. There are rows of them in this climate-controlled greenhouse. MUCHERO: Exact same species grown under the exact same environmental conditions given the same amount of water, same amount of nutrients. PALCA: Since they're all growing in the same environment, the only other major factor affecting the way the trees grow is their genes. When he finds a plant that grows particularly well or has some other desirable trait, he looks to see which gene is responsible. Muchero says he has no preconceived idea of what kind of genes he'll find. MUCHERO: We have learned the hard way not to come with expectations (laughter) because we have often found we are always wrong. PALCA: (Laughter). For example, Muchero says some trees weren't developing the way he wanted. He found a gene that appeared to be involved and searched through the genetic database to see if there was any information about that gene; turns out there was. But surprisingly, it was a gene that had been studied for its role in human cancer - cancer of the testes. MUCHERO: I would have never looked at a gene that's called testes specific for anything related to plants. PALCA: But that gene was the one that allowed the trees to develop the way he wanted. MUCHERO: So highly detrimental in humans - but the exact same behavior is what we are looking for in plants. PALCA: Muchero says it's not just cancer genes humans and plants share. Plants and humans also share a gene for regulating glucose levels. When that gene is damaged in humans, diabetes can result. And that's bad. But back in the greenhouse, Muchero shows me plants where they deliberately damaged that gene. And they were growing faster than plants with the normal gene. MUCHERO: So when you induce the diabetes condition in plants, not only do you get bigger plants, but you get faster growth. PALCA: It stands to reason that plants and humans share genes. Both species are made up of cells, and all cells have to do some basic functions to stay alive. Jennifer Brophy is a bioengineer at Stanford University. She says, yes, you can find genes in plants that were first found in humans, but there are also human genes that were first found in plants. Take the genes that are responsible for setting our internal 24-hour clock, known as the circadian rhythm. JENNIFER BROPHY: So when you wake up in the morning, having a bright room will kind of help set and keep your circadian clock running well. The molecular components of that were actually first discovered in plants. PALCA: In fact, a lot of what we know about genetics comes from plants. Brophy says, remember. Gregor Mendel figured out the basis of genetic inheritance by studying peas. BROPHY: But I think it's underappreciated how important plants have been for understanding human biology. PALCA: She hopes work like Muchero's will help remind people that it's worth studying plants both for agriculture and human health. Joe Palca, NPR News.

So when you're trying to predict the weather, one of the most important things you need to know is how much moisture is in the air. That information comes from sensors on satellites. But meteorologists say those sensors could be compromised by new wireless 5G technology. Here's NPR's Rebecca Hersher. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: To understand the potential problem, first you have to understand why we use satellites in space to detect moisture in the air in the first place. William Blackwell is a physicist at MIT, and he helps the U. S. government design satellite sensors. WILLIAM BLACKWELL: Back when they were developing radar in World War II - back in 1943 and 1944 - they were developing radar frequencies around 24 gigahertz. And it was working very well in the winter. And then they tried to make measurements in the spring, and there was a big degradation of the echoes coming back. HERSHER: Like, the radar wasn't working as well because there was something in the atmosphere making a little bit of noise at that specific frequency - around 24 gigahertz. And that something was moisture. BLACKWELL: And that was really one of the eye-opening things. HERSHER: Like, was that the beginning of sort of modern weather prediction? BLACKWELL: That was certainly part of it. HERSHER: By the late 1970s, American scientists figured out how to build a sensor that could detect moisture from space by picking up that weak signal that water vapor makes at exactly 23. 8 gigahertz. And for the last 20 years, information about what's going on at 23. 8 gigahertz has been part of pretty much every weather forecast you see. But gathering that data could get harder because 5G operates really close by. BLACKWELL: Well, the sensors are extremely sensitive. We're trying to measure very small quantities on the order of a trillionth of a watt. So any emission in the band from 23. 6 to 24. 0, the sensors will measure some part of that. So the question becomes, what levels of interference are tolerable? HERSHER: Interference from 5G. The Federal Communications Commission has already auctioned off the 5G frequencies right next to 24 gigahertz. Meteorologists worry that could make it hard to detect moisture. There will just be too much 5G communication going on. At a congressional hearing in May, an official from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that if 5G is deployed as currently planned in the U. S. , it would take NOAA's forecasting ability back to where it was around 1980. The wireless industry disputes that. NICHOLAS LUDLUM: The claims that 5G would interfere with that are without any evidence whatsoever. HERSHER: Nicholas Ludlum is the chief communications officer at CTIA, the trade association for the wireless industry. He says, think about it like being in a car. LUDLUM: You know, if you're driving down the highway and there's a big line of trucks in the lane right next to you, lots of big, noisy traffic. . . HERSHER: In this analogy, moisture is your little car and 5G is the truck traffic in the next lane. LUDLUM: . . . They're not interfering with your ability to drive down the highway. BLACKWELL: There's something to that, perhaps. But, you know, you have to think about maybe a wide load bumping into you. HERSHER: Blackwell says the moisture sensors currently in orbit - and there are two of them for the U. S. - are affected by noise that's nearby. And the other concern is that 5G may not operate perfectly in its lane. Multiple scientists told me that's a relatively common problem with other telecommunications technology. Studies by NOAA and NASA, as well as groups in Europe and the World Meteorological Organization, have found that 5G could interfere with moisture sensing. European regulators intend to allow a lot less 5G signal power than the FCC says it will allow here. The wireless industry says allowing more power is important if the U. S. wants to keep up technologically with China. Meanwhile, the international group that oversees radio communications is scheduled to meet in the fall, and this topic will be front and center.

And the other concern is that 5G may not operate perfectly in its lane. Multiple scientists told me that's a relatively common problem with other telecommunications technology. Studies by NOAA and NASA, as well as groups in Europe and the World Meteorological Organization, have found that 5G could interfere with moisture sensing. European regulators intend to allow a lot less 5G signal power than the FCC says it will allow here. The wireless industry says allowing more power is important if the U. S. wants to keep up technologically with China. Meanwhile, the international group that oversees radio communications is scheduled to meet in the fall, and this topic will be front and center.

NPR's Joe Palca went to Chile to see it in its totality. And because half of the world's major telescopes are in Chile, he decided to stick around and see what researchers are studying. And Joe Palca is with us now from 17,000 feet. Hi, Joe. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Hey, Michel. How are you doing? MARTIN: OK. So where are you right now, exactly? PALCA: Well, yes. As you said, I'm at 17,000 feet in the Atacama Desert. And this place is wonderful for viewing because it's so high, so the - most of the atmosphere is - well, it's not most below us, but a lot of it is below us. And the air is very dry, and the wavelengths that people want to study, the stars and galaxies at - up here, there's very dry air, and the wavelengths are not - they're coming through clear because water vapor absorbs wavelengths that they're interested in, so they want to get as far away from water vapor as they can. So they're up high. And there's other places here besides the Atacama that are in the Andes - very high, very good viewing - or seeing, as they call it in astronomy. MARTIN: And is that why, as you told us, that half of the world's major telescopes are in Chile? Is that why they're all there? PALCA: Well, yeah. It's because it's a great location. And the one I'm at right now is not one of the major telescopes. It's a smaller one. It's called CLASS - the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor. And what it's doing is looking for signals, traces of the earliest moments of the universe that were laid down in something called gravitational waves. Those gravitational waves have a certain property known as a polarization, and it should be possible to see that polarization left behind in the wavelengths that they're studying at CLASS. That's what they're doing here. MARTIN: So where else have you been on this trip? PALCA: Yesterday, I was at a telescope which I can actually see from here. It's not a single telescope. It's actually 66 dishes - like, you know, large satellite antennas - scattered across the Atacama Desert. And it's called ALMA - the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. And that's an international collaboration involving several countries - Europe, Japan, the United States National Science Foundation. This array can image dust. Now, why do you want to look at dust? Well, it turns out that dust is what makes planets form. And so if you can observe the dust that forms around a young star, you can actually see where the planets are forming around that star. And it's kind of cool. MARTIN: It sounds pretty cool. You know, when people think of telescopes, they think of something that shows, like, a tiny part of the sky. Is there anything there that allows you to see the big-screen version (laughter)? Let's call it that. PALCA: Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's where I was a couple days ago - at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. That's where I actually watched the eclipse from. But there's a telescope going up called the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope - LSST. And that looks at the whole sky, and it looks for things that are changing from one night to the next. And so it's sort of looking for things that go bump in the night. You can see maybe some star exploded, or a planet swam into your field of view or something lit up. So it's things that are changing over the night sky, and you can see the whole sky because it takes two nights for this telescope to image the entire southern sky. MARTIN: You know what? You're just having so much fun, I'm afraid you might not come back. PALCA: (Laughter). MARTIN: So before - so just in case that happens, you were there for the eclipse. How was it? PALCA: The eclipse - you know, people say, how was the eclipse? It was fantastic. How did it compare to others? I have no idea. It was the first one I ever saw. But the scientists seemed pleased that were watching it with me both as a scientific event and as a spiritual event. So it was a really good example of a total solar eclipse. MARTIN: That is NPR's science correspondent Joe Palca reporting from Chile. Joe, come back. PALCA: I'll try, Michel. It's really nice up here.

That's the word from the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors Iran's nuclear facilities. Earlier today, Vice President Mike Pence offered this warning. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: Under President Donald Trump, America will never allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon. (CHEERING)SHAPIRO: That's Pence speaking at a conference in Washington earlier today. And joining us now to discuss Iran's nuclear activities is NPR's Geoff Brumfiel, who covers science and security for us. Hey, Geoff. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Hi there. SHAPIRO: Let's start with the vice president's comment there. Is that what Iran is trying to do - get a nuclear weapon? BRUMFIEL: Well, at the moment it looks like the answer to that question is no. So you need a little enrichment 101 here. Buckle up. SHAPIRO: OK. BRUMFIEL: Only a tiny fraction of the uranium that gets dug out of the ground can actually be used for things like nuclear power reactors and nuclear weapons. And so what the process of enrichment is doing is actually concentrating that level. If you enrich to about 5%, that's good for a reactor. Closer to 90% is what you really need for a nuclear bomb. Now, under the nuclear deal, Iran promised to keep it pretty low, at 3. 67%. Just over the weekend, Iran announced it was going to be going up to around 4 1/2%. That's still way below bomb-grade. SHAPIRO: So if they're not sprinting in that direction towards a nuclear weapon, what are they actually doing? BRUMFIEL: What they're doing is sending a message. The U. S. pulled out of this nuclear agreement last year, and they've been making Iran's life pretty miserable ever since. They've reimposed a ton of sanctions, and they've also imposed sanctions on anyone who does business with Iran. But the U. S. isn't the only party to the nuclear deal. Europe, China and Russia were also supposed to provide Iran economic benefits. And so Iran is crossing these lines in the deal to really try and ramp up the pressure on those other parties to give them some sort of economic benefit to remain at the deal. And they've said that they're going to cross another line in 60 days if they don't start seeing those benefits, although it's unclear exactly what that line would be. SHAPIRO: So some of this is signaling using uranium enrichment to send a message, but technically it does also get Iran closer to having what they need to build a nuclear weapon, right? BRUMFIEL: It does. I mean, I would call it a baby step. Most of the experts I've spoken to about this were actually concerned. We knew Iran was going to make some sort of announcement. They were concerned that it might be Iran going all the way to 20% right away or near 20% enrichment. That would be a big step toward getting a nuclear weapon. So Iran is showing restraint here. They're clearly trying to slowly ratchet up the pressure. SHAPIRO: So how would we know if Iran does decide to start racing toward a nuclear weapon? What signs would we see? BRUMFIEL: Well, the enrichment levels could go up much, much higher. The other thing to watch for is right now there are all these nuclear inspectors crawling around Iran's facilities, and they're the ones who can say, yes, they've gone over this limit; no, they haven't. Iran may decide to kick them out, and that would be a very, very serious step that would indicate that maybe their intentions were changing. SHAPIRO: NPR's Geoff Brumfiel, thank you.

That was more than two decades ago. Now they have to figure out what to do with it next. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: In November of 1998, NPR reported that a rocket had blasted off from Kazakhstan. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)BOB EDWARDS: Onboard was a 20-ton module, the first part of the International Space Station. Once completed, the space station will serve as an orbiting home for astronauts and cosmonauts for at least 15 years. GREENFIELDBOYCE: It's now been over 18 years that the station has been continuously occupied by people. The place is impressive, with more living space than a six-bedroom house, two bathrooms and a large bay window for looking down at Earth. It's also really expensive. NASA spends between $3- and $4 billion a year operating the station and flying people back and forth. That's about half the agency's budget for human exploration of space and a real financial drag when NASA is gung-ho to return to the moon. So maybe all the international partners could just say, the station's day is done. Let's deorbit it, crash it in the ocean and move on to the next thing. I put that idea to Gilles LeClerc. He's head of space exploration at the Canadian Space Agency. GILLES LECLERC: It would be a waste. We cannot ditch the International Space Station. There's just too much invested. It's quite clear. It's unanimous between the partners that we continue to need a space station in the Earth's orbit. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The U. S. and the other nations have pledged to fund the station until at least 2024. What happens after that is unclear. But NASA has floated one idea - turn all this over to the private sector. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEFF DEWIT: Today's a very remarkable day. NASA is opening the International Space Station to commercial opportunities and marketing these opportunities as we've never done before. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That's NASA's Chief Financial Officer Jeff DeWit. He was speaking at a big press event held a few weeks ago at the Nasdaq stock market's market site in New York City. He was joined by other officials and even astronaut Christina Koch, who appeared in video beamed down from space. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHRISTINA KOCH: We are so excited to be part of NASA as our home and laboratory in space, transitions into being accessible to expanded commercial and marketing opportunities as well as to private astronauts. GREENFIELDBOYCE: All this gave John Logsdon deja vu. He's a space historian with George Washington University. He says back in the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan's administration first proposed building a permanent space station, this was part of the pitch. JOHN LOGSDON: The idea that it could be a place for a wide variety of commercial activities with billions of dollars of economic payoff - so here we are in 2019 finally going to test that hypothesis. GREENFIELDBOYCE: NASA officials said opening up the station to profit making activities would free up resources to go to the moon. But when reporters asked how much revenue could come in, NASA officials wouldn't give any numbers. They said there's too much uncertainty. TOMMY SANFORD: That is the right answer because they don't know yet. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Tommy Sandford is executive director of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation. He says NASA's goal is to have a station that's commercially operated or even privately owned, and NASA would become just one of many customers. SANFORD: You need to be focused on adding as many customers as possible and hoping to reach a tipping point at some point where you retain all of them. And then that eventually lowers your costs because, again, you are one of many customers. You're not bearing the entire cost of the infrastructure and the transportation. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But some question whether any business could make a go of it unless NASA still ponied up a significant amount of money. The agency's Inspector General Paul Martin testified at a congressional hearing last year about the space station's future. (SOUNDBITE OF CONGRESSIONAL HEARING)PAUL MARTIN: Candidly, the scant commercial interests shown in the station over its nearly 20 years of operation give us pause about the agency's current plans. GREENFIELDBOYCE: As all of these discussions go on, the station keeps getting older. Space is a harsh environment. The hardware is wearing out. Major components are only certified until 2028. Dava Newman is a scientist at MIT who used to be the deputy administrator of NASA. DAVA NEWMAN: Space station really has up to, you know, say, less than 10 years of lifetime for it to be safe and in terms of to not have too high of maintenance costs. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She loves the station, has flown experiments on it. But she thinks with time running out, a strategic plan for its end is needed now. NEWMAN: There might be some elements of space station that the private sector might be able to take over - a module or two. So all that needs to be put in place, probably with government funding.

What they brought home was rocks. Nearly half a ton of moon rock was collected by the six Apollo missions to the lunar surface. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce looks at what happened to those rocks and why scientists still want to go back and get more. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: When Darby Dyar was a kid, she remembers watching the Apollo astronauts return. She'd see their capsule bobbing in the ocean as the astronauts emerged with some precious cargo. DARBY DYAR: They climbed out, and then they very carefully took the lunar samples and put them in the little rubber boat. GREENFIELDBOYCE: You remember watching that on TV? DYAR: Oh, absolutely. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The box holding the rocks looked like an Igloo cooler. She never thought that someday she would study those rocks. DYAR: I was growing up in Indiana in the 1960s. Girls didn't do science. I never saw a woman scientist. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She set out to be a journalist but ended up majoring in geology. As a college student, she started working for a researcher who'd gotten some of the newly arrived moon rocks. She remembers how he kept them under lock and key. DYAR: We all knew that the filing cabinet in his office was the safe. You know, I remember my hands shaking the first time he said, well, you know, grind this up and put it in the sample holder. And I was like, are you sure? GREENFIELDBOYCE: Dyar is still studying moon rocks. She's a researcher with the Planetary Science Institute who's also a professor at Mount Holyoke College. At her lab there, she shows me a bunch of lunar samples. Some are thin, translucent slices of rock on microscope slides. Others look like gray pebbles in tiny glass vials. A few vials look empty. DYAR: If you had the microscope, you could look at these vials that seem to be empty, and in them, you would find tiny, single crystals of lunar samples, which we carefully save because we have to return every speck of this to Johnson Space Center when we're done. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, is the chief repository for Apollo samples. The rocks and dirt are stored in special cases in vaults. Ryan Zeigler is the curator. He says the Apollo astronauts collected 842 pounds of lunar material. RYAN ZEIGLER: Eight hundred and forty-two pounds is a couple of refrigerators' worth of samples in terms of sheer volume and weight. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says a tiny fraction of all this was destroyed in analytical experiments. Some of it is on display, like in museums. But the vast majority is available for study. ZEIGLER: There were 2,200 individually numbered samples that came back, and we've looked at 2,194 of them. So we only have six unstudied samples from the moon. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Of the unstudied ones, a few are pristine. They were vacuum sealed on the moon and have never been opened. NASA was waiting for technology to advance. And now the agency says it's time to open one. ZEIGLER: It's not exactly because it's the 50th anniversary, but it sort of is. GREENFIELDBOYCE: NASA recently picked six science teams to study these precious rocks. One of the lucky scientists is Dyar. DYAR: I think we knew that there had been some samples put away for future uses. And, boy, I remember as a graduate student thinking, man, I wonder what that could be. What will we be doing in 40 years? GREENFIELDBOYCE: What she'll be doing is studying tiny glass beads that formed during ancient eruptions to learn about volcanic activity. Already, lunar samples have told scientists a lot about how the moon formed when a giant body hit the early Earth. But they've also learned about the rest of the solar system by dating rocks from lunar craters. They could tell when different-sized meteorites hit the moon, which helped them understand the history of other planets that were being similarly bombarded. DYAR: So it's really the underpinning of a huge amount of planetary science, just being able to relate the size of the crater to how old it was. GREENFIELDBOYCE: NASA is aiming to go back to the moon, maybe as soon as 2024. I asked Dyar if she could go to the moon and get any rock, what would she want? She says in the South Pole, there's a giant crater where some massive impact seems to have punctured through the moon's crust. DYAR: And it exposed rocks that we don't see anywhere else on the surface of the moon. I would love to go there. And it would be really, really important to understand, is the interior of the moon really what we think it is? GREENFIELDBOYCE: She sometimes marvels at how far the study of lunar materials has come over her lifetime. DYAR: I've also been known to get the samples out on the night of a full moon and stand there in my office when I can see the moon out my window and think, look; you know, I got part of you here. You know, we're onto you. GREENFIELDBOYCE: NASA will probably be ready to open the pristine, sealed lunar sample sometime next year. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  Fifty years ago this month, astronauts left their footprints on the moon. What they brought home was rocks. Nearly half a ton of moon rock was collected by the six Apollo missions to the lunar surface. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce looks at what happened to those rocks and why scientists still want to go back and get more. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: When Darby Dyar was a kid, she remembers watching the Apollo astronauts return. She'd see their capsule bobbing in the ocean as the astronauts emerged with some precious cargo. DARBY DYAR: They climbed out, and then they very carefully took the lunar samples and put them in the little rubber boat. GREENFIELDBOYCE: You remember watching that on TV? DYAR: Oh, absolutely. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The box holding the rocks looked like an Igloo cooler. She never thought that someday she would study those rocks. DYAR: I was growing up in Indiana in the 1960s. Girls didn't do science. I never saw a woman scientist. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She set out to be a journalist but ended up majoring in geology. As a college student, she started working for a researcher who'd gotten some of the newly arrived moon rocks. She remembers how he kept them under lock and key. DYAR: We all knew that the filing cabinet in his office was the safe. You know, I remember my hands shaking the first time he said, well, you know, grind this up and put it in the sample holder.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. We like stories about leaders who have big ideas, who defy the odds and pursue their goals with messianic purpose. Think of Winston Churchill in World War II or Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War. But what happens when a leader's vision is the wrong one? How do we think about people who dream big only to invite disaster? At such times, we might prefer a more cautious style, someone who plays the odds. Those leaders might not score historic triumphs, but they rarely cause catastrophes. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Thousands of years ago, the Greek poet Archilochus summed up this idea. He said, the fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing. PHIL TETLOCK: That parable has been the subject of much debate over the last 2,500 years - what exactly Archilochus meant. VEDANTAM: This is psychologist Phil Tetlock. TETLOCK: Various people have offered various interpretations - some people coming out on the side of the hedgehog, saying the hedgehog will trump the fox, and other people saying, no, it really means the fox is going to do better. VEDANTAM: There are different ways to think about the metaphor, but here's how I see it. If a fox wants dinner, it has many options. It can chase down a hedgehog. It can find something else to eat. It can even go without food for a day. But if you're a hedgehog being chased by a fox, you don't have multiple goals. You have one overarching idea - don't get eaten. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Phil Tetlock thinks this metaphor also describes two different cognitive styles among people. Foxes have different strategies for different problems. They're comfortable with nuance. They can live with contradictions. Hedgehogs focus on the big picture. They see every problem through the lens of a single organizing principle. TETLOCK: The hedgehogs are more parsimonious, more decisive. In most MBA programs, they'd probably be viewed as better leadership material. VEDANTAM: This week on HIDDEN BRAIN, we're listening back to our May 2017 show that tells the story of a hedgehog - a surgeon who changed the world in daring ways. His bold style made him a pioneer in what has today become the transgender movement. It also propelled him to create one of the world's first international medical missions. Like other hedgehogs, this surgeon experienced outsized success until one day, he didn't. DON LAUB: It's just a goddamned disaster, an awful thing. VEDANTAM: Greatness and tragedy, this week on HIDDEN BRAIN. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Sandy Stone was born in 1936 in the midst of the Great Depression. Her parents gave her a Hebrew name. SANDY STONE: It was Zelig Ben-Natan (ph). VEDANTAM: Zelig Ben-Natan - a boy's name. That's because her parents thought she was a boy. But from a very early age, she knew she was a girl. This was a long time ago, decades before the modern trans movement. When Sandy was a child, there were no words, no language to describe what she knew about herself. STONE: It was lonely. It was disorienting. It was puzzling, confusing, scary. It was all of those things. VEDANTAM: It stayed like that for Sandy all the way into adulthood. She went to school, became a recording engineer, moved to the Bay Area. All the while, everyone thought she was a man. She kept searching for help. In the San Francisco phone book, she found a promising lead. It was a group for gay men. When she called, they asked if she was gay. She said she wasn't, so they sent her away and told her to try another group. The outfit they recommended surprised Sandy. It was the San Francisco Police Department. STONE: It turned out that the police department was running a counseling unit of sorts, which they did for the population of transgender people that lived in the San Francisco Tenderloin, which was sort of the down-and-out skid row section of town that tended to collect people who couldn't afford to live anywhere else or who had run out of options. VEDANTAM: Trans people who ended up in the Tenderloin were at high risk for drug addiction and prostitution. They were social outcasts. When Sandy got in touch with the police to ask for help, the first thing they did was to dissuade her from acting on her feelings. STONE: And they actually tried to discourage me by taking me on a tour that reminded me of Dante being led down into the lower circles of hell. They really showed me the worst of everything, and then said, are you sure you still want to go ahead with what you were thinking of? And to be perfectly honest, I was not quite sure what I was thinking of. I was just trying to collect information. And I think it would be safe to say that that's what we were all doing at that time. VEDANTAM: Still, the referral to the police turned out to be a stroke of luck. The cops told her that a center at Stanford University had recently started performing what were then called sex change operations. STONE: They didn't refer me to Stanford as much as talk about it as the great, unattainable goal - the great, beautiful, shining star in the sky. VEDANTAM: After years of suffering and loneliness and confusion, the Stanford program felt like a beacon. Sandy felt she might finally have a chance to live a more honest, satisfying life. But first, she had to convince the gatekeeper who stood between her and the person she wanted to become. He ran what was then called the gender dysphoria program at Stanford. His name was Don Laub. The gatekeeper of Stanford's gender dysphoria program was a hedgehog. From a very early age, he had a big-picture idea. He wanted to help people. He wanted to help a lot of people. As a small child, when kids in his school were asked to donate money to a charity, his classmates contributed a dime. Don worked in a vegetable garden an entire summer to raise a whopping $10. LAUB: Now, I got a letter, a preserved letter from - that my mother wrote to some of her friends saying, Don, he's done something that nobody has ever done. VEDANTAM: Don's father feared his little boy was consumed with being a do-gooder, that he would turn out to be a failure at business. His father was right. Don Laub became a doctor. When he came to Stanford in the 1960s, he was a young, ambitious plastic surgeon very much in awe of his prize-winning colleagues. LAUB: Coming to Stanford, I was overshadowed by the hugeness of what people were doing - the importance of it. So I knew that I had to do something, like, maybe - you know, I got to do this somewhere along the line because everybody else here is doing it. VEDANTAM: Don was looking for a place to make his mark. One day, a colleague walked out of an examination room and came up to him. LAUB: And said, Don, I want you to see a patient. It's a good case. You might not like it. It's a sex change. VEDANTAM: Remember; this was 1968. LAUB: I said, Dave (ph), send that patient away. I'm a Catholic boy from the Midwest, and I'm at Stanford. We don't do those things. VEDANTAM: But Don's colleague insisted he meet the patient. To be clear, this patient was not Sandy Stone. LAUB: He said, do me a favor, and go in that room. So I went in the room and talked to the patient. And I said, now, why do you want this sex change? She said, well, I was born, and this is what I should be. I said, well, when did you decide that? She said, I didn't decide it. This is what I was born with from day one. VEDANTAM: This patient was a pioneer. No one on the West Coast had received what's come to be known today as gender reassignment surgery or gender confirmation surgery. In fact, the surgery had been rarely performed across the whole world. Don was an unlikely choice of doctor. He was, by his own account, a prim man from the Midwest. But although Don initially blanched at the idea of gender reassignment surgery, he felt a shiver of excitement. He didn't send the patient away. Instead, he went looking for information. He consulted with psychiatrists and the few surgeons around the world who'd already performed this kind of surgery. What prompted you, this sort of, you know, Catholic doctor from the Midwest, to basically take this on? It seems like an unlikely fit. LAUB: It was a wonderful opportunity to do a big thing and to help a lot of people. VEDANTAM: Altruism and ambition were always tightly woven in Don's identity. He wasn't interested in superficial cosmetic work. He wanted to change the world. He decided to take the leap. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: In November 1968, Don Laub performed California's first gender reassignment surgery. LAUB: Yeah, we were more than prepared for all of the things that might happen. And the surgery went fine. It took about 3 1/2 hours, and we did it with the skin graft method and no problem. VEDANTAM: Don soon became one of the world's leading experts on gender reassignment surgery. He started a program. His reputation grew - a reputation for being a good surgeon and a tough gatekeeper. He turned away many people because he felt they weren't good candidates for surgery. Sandy Stone vividly remembers her first appointment with him in the mid-'70s. STONE: I go in and sit down, and Don is behind his desk. And he's wearing his white coat. And he's very distinguished-looking and calm and very friendly and open. And he says, well, what can I do for you? And I say the first thing that comes into my head, which is, I think I'm a woman. Now, the scene we have is Don behind his desk and me - I'm - I have a long black beard and wild black hair. I'm wearing a blue shirt, jeans and engineer's boots. I do not exactly look like I'm thinking of myself as a stereotypical woman. And Don looks at me and says, really? And I say, what should I do? I mean, I'm totally - I'm completely open to anything. And I really don't know what I should do, what direction I should move in, what's right, what's wrong. And I'm looking to Donald to tell me. And in my memory of the thing, Donald then says, well, the first thing you should do is lose the beard. VEDANTAM: That was the beginning of Sandy's long, transformative journey. It was a tough journey. Don wanted Sandy to be sure she was making the right decision. So before he would even consider surgery, Sandy says he told her she would have to live openly and fully as a woman for one full year. It was a requirement based on the reality of the time. No one, not Sandy nor Don, knew what might come from these surgeries in the long term. These were early days. It was all a bit of an experiment, a shot in the dark. STONE: It was fraught. It was fraught for everyone. And it was fraught because, at that time, it was not clear what would happen later. We didn't have very many examples of transgender people who had had surgery who went on to have fulfilling lives and live to tell about it, which is to say, came back later and reported back to the program. VEDANTAM: They were experimenting on the fringe of what both medicine and society thought was acceptable. Don was taking risks with his professional reputation. Sandy was taking risks with her life. There was one moment, Sandy says, when she and Don clashed. The conflict boiled down to their cognitive styles. STONE: At some point, he asked me if I were 100% committed to wanting surgery. And I said, no, I'm not. I'm probably 99. 9%. I think anyone who is 100% committed to anything is probably crazy. You have to have some reservations in life. You have to have an overview of everything that you're doing and have alternative plans if what you're looking for doesn't work out. And Don said, well, in that case, you're not eligible for surgery. You have to be 100% committed. VEDANTAM: It took a mediated session with Don's assistant for the two of them to resolve the conflict. But the incident revealed something about the way a hedgehog moves through the world. Hedgehogs are decisive. Don could not understand anything less than 100% commitment, even if the . 1% of doubt was simply a way to say, I'm human, how can I be absolutely sure? Sandy tells another story of a time she came in for an appointment wearing jeans and a T-shirt. Don asked her why she wasn't dressed like a woman. He'd missed the bell-bottom-jeans-and-tie-dye revolution happening right outside his window. It was the kind of thing that could have led to a fight, except for one thing. Sandy understood where Don was coming from. She knew that underneath the tough exterior, he really wanted to help and not just in a medical sense. More than anything, Don wanted Sandy to live a life where she didn't feel like an outcast. STONE: He wanted his people to be totally unremarkable, to just fit in, to be able to live their lives, to be able to be inconspicuous and just get along. And that's a good thing to want for 99% of your waking day is just to be able to live your life, to be able to live with other people and not rub people the wrong way. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Sandy Stone successfully underwent surgery in 1977. When I interviewed Sandy, I told her that her story reminded me of another case that Don told me about. It's interesting because I - Don first came to my attention because of another case involving cleft lip surgery, and it's so striking that as you're saying this, I'm sort of hearing echoes of that other work as well, this drive that he had to just help people to essentially live what he would think of as being a normal life, a life that they're not ostracized and a life that they're not feeling like they're outcasts, that they're functioning, they are - they can get an education if they're a child or they can get a job if they're an adult, that they can be happy. And I feel there's something actually very Midwestern about that idea. STONE: That's the word. That word you said is correct. Don wanted people to be happy. Don did it professionally. His job was to help people to be happy. And for that, I owe him a lifetime debt. I would not have done anything, I think, that I did after the 1980s if it weren't for Don Laub - or the '70s rather - if it weren't for Don Laub. VEDANTAM: Sandy went on to become a prominent writer and theorist and eventually helped found the academic discipline of transgender studies. When she considers Don's influence on her life, she hones in on his willingness to pursue a big idea with single-minded purpose. STONE: Do you go for the big one, or do you accept something less? And many of us accept something less because we don't want to take the risk, and then we may go through life maybe - maybe we'll be happy with our measure or maybe we'll say, what if I had gone for what I really wanted? What would that have been like? Maybe I would have died. Yeah, maybe, I would have. But I didn't. I beat the odds, and I went on to be gloriously happy. That's something in life, and Don brought that to many people. I don't see how one could do better than that. VEDANTAM: Don's leap into the unknown, his willingness to bet his professional reputation on a big idea, his confidence in his own judgment - it had all paid off. The hedgehog had won, but pursuing a big idea with determination doesn't always pay off. And when a hedgehog fails, the fall can be painful. Don Laub knows about that part of the story, too. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: According to the ancient Greek poet Archilochus, the fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing. Psychologist Phil Tetlock says the metaphor describes two kinds of people. Small-picture tacticians are foxes. Big-picture strategists are hedgehogs. Before Don Laub became a world-renowned gender reassignment surgeon, he had another big idea. It started this way. One day, a colleague asked him if he could help with a surgery. The patient was a child from Mexico. LAUB: This was a 14-year-old boy who had no other deformity than his cleft lip and palate. VEDANTAM: But because of it, the boy was shunned. A group of priests had driven him north all the way to Stanford to get him help. Don immediately understood that the cleft lip wasn't just a medical problem. LAUB: He had not gone to school. He had no educational advancement. He had no friends. VEDANTAM: The surgery to repair the cleft lip and palate was simple and quick. It was so easy, and it gave this child a real chance in life. Don says performing the surgery made him feel really good. As someone with deep religious roots and a Catholic education that emphasized helping the poor, Don felt this was the kind of patient he wanted to serve. He turned to the priests who brought the boy from Mexico. LAUB: I asked them, are there other patients in Mexico like this? They said, the place is full of them. So we bought an airplane ticket and went down to Mexicali and asked for a clinic. VEDANTAM: Just like that, where a fox may have calculated the odds, considered the upside and the downside, the hedgehog simply picked up and went. In Mexicali, Don found a dusty border town in the desert where the people were very poor. LAUB: I mean, most of the houses were made of packing crates at that time, and there was no paving in Mexicali of 200,000 people. VEDANTAM: Mexicali's main medical facility was an old, wood home. LAUB: It had a dirt floor for part of it with the back part of the clinic was used to raise fighting cocks. VEDANTAM: A rational fox may have calculated the risks and backed down - not Don. He recruited local health officials to get word out that they would be providing free surgeries for children with cleft lips and burn scars. The clinic was quickly packed. LAUB: It was 10:30 in the morning. In that desert, there had not been rain there for three years. Hot in the morning - it was about 106 degrees already. You couldn't touch anything metal because you'd burn your hand. The first patient I saw was sitting there with a bag on his head with two little peepholes. I said, what's with the - why the bag? VEDANTAM: Behind those peepholes, the boy was hiding his face in shame. Don asked if he could take a look. LAUB: So he got the bag off, and he had a burn scar that pulled his eyelid down - a simple thing to repair. VEDANTAM: As with Sandy, Don wanted to make the little boy unremarkable. He wanted him to lead an ordinary life, unmarked by stigma and shame. That first trip was just a fact-finding mission, a way to see if there was a need. By the time Don went back to Stanford, a plan had formed in his mind. He wanted to recruit the best doctors from the United States and fly them to Mexico to perform free surgeries on children with birth defects. He recruited surgical residents to join skilled surgeons on the trips. He found pilots willing to transport medical equipment. Hedgehogs have charisma. They can see the shining city on the hill so clearly that everyone around them starts to see it, too. LAUB: Everybody jumped on it. I had to hide when I'd go in the hospital because people wanted to get in on this. VEDANTAM: In 1966, the official medical missions began. Now, it's important to remember that at this time, the idea of plastic surgeons going abroad to provide free surgery was almost unheard off. There were fewer parameters of how international aid organizations should operate. Don was flying by the seat of his pants. Every few months, the doctors would descend on Mexicali. They'd throw themselves into four marathon days of back-to-back surgeries and consultations. Over the years, they'd come back again and again, performing more than 2,000 surgeries in all. One of Don's first patients was a little boy named Eugenio (ph). He was the boy who'd worn the bag over his head. Don repaired the scarred eyelid and still remembers the boy's first reaction. LAUB: He had a very nice, huge smile. VEDANTAM: On a follow-up trip, Don tracked Eugenio down. LAUB: He shook hands and everything like that, even as a young kid. And he said, I have friends in school now. VEDANTAM: Don loved it. LAUB: It's a real happiness. It's a source of happiness is the best description. HOWARD HOLDERNESS: With - if anything, Don had a - I would describe it as a very - and I think he would accept this. I think it was a very sort of a missionary zeal. VEDANTAM: This is plastic surgeon Howard Holderness. He was part of the team of residents helping perform surgeries in Mexicali. Howard says that Don's vision drove the whole team. HOLDERNESS: I think he felt very close to trying to do things that - not only practice medicine in its - in all of its forms of science and everything, but the art of medicine and some of the spiritual aspects of being a good doctor. VEDANTAM: He was doing more than surgeries. Don was developing a program that could set an example for others to follow around the world. One day about two years into the Mexico program, a woman arrived at the clinic with her young son. His name was Salvador (ph). Compared with the other patients, Salvador had a more severe birth defect. He had bilateral clefs - two clefs rather than one. LAUB: When you have this bilateral, the muscles are cut twice. So when you smile, they pull out. If they're repaired, they pull in. See? So every time he would have a visual expression, it would be awful. You'd see these teeth on both sides. VEDANTAM: Salvador was a perfect candidate for surgery, that is, until a doctor on the team gave the boy a thorough physical and listened to his heart with a stethoscope. (SOUNDBITE OF HEARTBEAT)LAUB: His mother brought him in and the pediatrician listened and it goes whoosh, whoosh, whoosh - the heart sounds. VEDANTAM: These were not normal sounds. The boy's heart had a hole in it. The risk of proceeding with surgery was small but potentially fatal. They gave the mother the bad news. LAUB: We can't operate because we don't have the equipment in Mexicali to do the heart catheterization or anything like that or any - even get the EKG today so. . . VEDANTAM: So Don and his team turned away the mother and the little boy. I should say here that we're going only on Don's account of what happened. The medical records from that era are incomplete, and we weren't able to find the mother. A few months after sending the child away, Don and his team were back in Mexicali. The mother and her son were waiting for them again. Salvador, she told them, was shunned. He had no friends. Other children called him el monstre, the monster. LAUB: The mother said, this child has no chance in life. You've got to fix it. VEDANTAM: Don's heart went out to the little boy. He explained the danger again. The risk was small, but it did mean that things could go seriously wrong. Don held the stethoscope up to the mother's ears. (SOUNDBITE OF HEARTBEAT)LAUB: Listen. She can hear it - whoosh, whoosh, whoosh. VEDANTAM: So the answer again was no. More months passed. Don returned to the clinic. So did the mother. LAUB: Por favor, please, doctor. Can you see that this child has no life? VEDANTAM: This was a critical moment. Don could again have said no. Medical protocol said that was the right call. But Don also knew that without surgery, Salvador would always be an outcast. Could he have tried to take the boy back to Stanford where heart surgeons could have assisted with his care? Maybe but that would have been complicated, expensive and a drain on critical resources from the project in Mexico, resources that were helping hundreds of other children. So Don did what Don always did. He took a look at the child, took a deep breath and said, OK, we'll do it. LAUB: I feel like that's why I existed is for this judgment. I mean, I'm not there to take care of little pimples. I'm there to do the tough cases. So this was putting it right on a line. You've got to do it or put your tail between your legs and get out of there. VEDANTAM: It's been nearly 50 years since Don Laub performed that surgery on a 6-year-old boy in Mexicali, Mexico. He's had thousands of patients since then, but the details of that day are still vivid in his mind. The morning of the surgery, the boy went through the standard pre-surgery lab tests and check-up, an IV was started and he received extra glucose in case his blood sugar was low from stomach worms. And then the boy walked by himself into the operating room. LAUB: And he gets on the operating table himself because he trusts the whole world. VEDANTAM: The surgery began. First, the child was anesthetized. LAUB: So that went fine. It went perfect, no problem at all. VEDANTAM: Then Don and his team began the surgery. LAUB: When we were operating, everything was going perfect. VEDANTAM: And then just like that, it wasn't. LAUB: The anesthesiologist said, boys, we have no pulse. VEDANTAM: They tried everything - CPR, medicine to jumpstart the heart - nothing worked. Don suspected a blood clot. The boy was dead. They put away their surgical tools. They wheeled the body to the morgue. All the while, Don's heart was starting to race. He was working in a foreign country, and he had made a risky judgment call in violation of medical protocol. LAUB: My mind is going 1,000 miles a minute. Why am I here in Mexico? Why did I get into this? What the hell is the matter with you? Here you are in a foreign country. You're going to end up in jail. It's just a goddamn disaster, an awful thing. VEDANTAM: And, of course, there was the boy's mother waiting anxiously outside for news of her son. Don remembers stepping out of the operating room and walking up to her. He told her there'd been complications, that they had tried hard, but the boy had died. The mother began to sob. But then, Don says, she did something surprising. She asked him why he was upset. LAUB: She said, you should be happy because the child is seeing God with a complete face. VEDANTAM: Don had expected accusation and anger. Instead, he encountered a mother who leaned heavily on her faith. Don says she was comforted by the thought that her child was now repaired and beautiful and at home with God. Salvador was finally at peace. Don stared at the mother. He was speechless, not just because of what she'd said but because he was struck by another thought. The mother didn't know this, but Salvador's face was not repaired. He died before the surgery was complete. What would the mother say when she saw her son at the funeral? Again, the medical protocol was clear. Don had to turn the body over to Salvador's mother, but he felt he couldn't bring himself to do this. It would only compound the first tragedy. He conferred with his team about finishing the surgery on Salvador. LAUB: I said, it's against the law, but I think in this case, we should. VEDANTAM: The rest of the team unanimously agreed. The little boy was brought back from the morgue. LAUB: The child came back in a body bag, and we did the whole thing as if the child was awake. VEDANTAM: I interviewed Don several times for this story. I pushed hard to understand why he decided to operate on Salvador. What were you telling yourself, again, emotionally that made you change your mind, that made you say, yes, I recognize there's a risk, but I have to do this? LAUB: I thought this is what I am for. This is my purpose. . . VEDANTAM: And you said it's worth. . . LAUB: . . . I mean, I was standing there, and I couldn't say no again. I didn't. I couldn't, and I made that - when I said that, let's go ahead and do the case, I didn't have any second thoughts. I - emotionally, I figured out that this is what I should do. VEDANTAM: Don still thinks about Salvador, has thought about him thousands of times over the years. He's turned the case over in his head in every possible way. I asked him over and over whether he felt regret. LAUB: No. Well, I (laughter) - of course, I do. Of course, I do. Yes, I do. I mean, as you said just a minute ago, it was a mistake. But I don't have - I'm not whipping myself. VEDANTAM: Not whipping himself, Don says, because he was trying to do the right thing. That's the reason he decided to operate. That's the reason he completed the surgery after the child was dead. What was more important than being on the right side of the law? LAUB: Doing the right thing. VEDANTAM: By the mother and by the child? LAUB: Yes. Yeah. No, you must always do the right thing. That is the highest priority over all different laws and commandments or any of that thing. You have to do the right thing. VEDANTAM: The day after Salvador died, Don Laub was back in the operating room. There were more children waiting for surgery. He remembers looking out the windows at the sky. It was, he says, a perfect azure blue. At 10:30, the time when Salvador was to be buried, everyone on the team fell silent and paused. There was no sound except for the whoosh of the anesthesia machine. When we think of foxes and hedgehogs, it's completely understandable that we want the best of both worlds. We love bold visionaries who take big risks, except when the risks don't work. At moments like that, we prefer the visionaries to be more cautious, filled with a little self-doubt. Now, people don't always fall neatly into one camp or the other. Some of us can be both fox and hedgehog. We can think and dream big but also change course, adapt to circumstances. But it may be that we can't have our cake and eat it, too. If we want the visionary Steve Jobs who helped usher in the age of the iPhone, we might also get the tyrannical CEO who nearly ran Apple computers into the ground in the 1980s. It's odd to think of Gandhi and Napoleon and Churchill and Mao in the same breath, but they are cut from the same cloth of messianic vision. It's easy not to like the kind of people who create history's greatest failures. But it turns out they're also the people who produce our greatest triumphs.

The music in today's show was composed by Ramtin Arablouei. Our unsung hero this week is another hedgehog and another Don. Donald Drake was a colleague and friend of mine at the Philadelphia Inquirer many years ago. He taught me many things about writing and storytelling. We even wrote a play together. Don died shortly after this episode first aired. I'll never forget all that he taught me. For more HIDDEN BRAIN, please follow us on Facebook and Twitter.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST:  This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. We like stories about leaders who have big ideas, who defy the odds and pursue their goals with messianic purpose. Think of Winston Churchill in World War II or Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War. But what happens when a leader's vision is the wrong one? How do we think about people who dream big only to invite disaster? At such times, we might prefer a more cautious style, someone who plays the odds. Those leaders might not score historic triumphs, but they rarely cause catastrophes. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Thousands of years ago, the Greek poet Archilochus summed up this idea. He said, the fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing. PHIL TETLOCK: That parable has been the subject of much debate over the last 2,500 years - what exactly Archilochus meant. VEDANTAM: This is psychologist Phil Tetlock. TETLOCK: Various people have offered various interpretations - some people coming out on the side of the hedgehog, saying the hedgehog will trump the fox, and other people saying, no, it really means the fox is going to do better. VEDANTAM: There are different ways to think about the metaphor, but here's how I see it. If a fox wants dinner, it has many options. It can chase down a hedgehog. It can find something else to eat. It can even go without food for a day. But if you're a hedgehog being chased by a fox, you don't have multiple goals. You have one overarching idea - don't get eaten. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Phil Tetlock thinks this metaphor also describes two different cognitive styles among people. Foxes have different strategies for different problems. They're comfortable with nuance. They can live with contradictions. Hedgehogs focus on the big picture. They see every problem through the lens of a single organizing principle. TETLOCK: The hedgehogs are more parsimonious, more decisive. In most MBA programs, they'd probably be viewed as better leadership material. VEDANTAM: This week on HIDDEN BRAIN, we're listening back to our May 2017 show that tells the story of a hedgehog - a surgeon who changed the world in daring ways. His bold style made him a pioneer in what has today become the transgender movement. It also propelled him to create one of the world's first international medical missions. Like other hedgehogs, this surgeon experienced outsized success until one day, he didn't. DON LAUB: It's just a goddamned disaster, an awful thing. VEDANTAM: Greatness and tragedy, this week on HIDDEN BRAIN. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Sandy Stone was born in 1936 in the midst of the Great Depression. Her parents gave her a Hebrew name. SANDY STONE: It was Zelig Ben-Natan (ph). VEDANTAM: Zelig Ben-Natan - a boy's name. That's because her parents thought she was a boy. But from a very early age, she knew she was a girl. This was a long time ago, decades before the modern trans movement. When Sandy was a child, there were no words, no language to describe what she knew about herself. STONE: It was lonely. It was disorienting. It was puzzling, confusing, scary. It was all of those things. VEDANTAM: It stayed like that for Sandy all the way into adulthood. She went to school, became a recording engineer, moved to the Bay Area. All the while, everyone thought she was a man. She kept searching for help. In the San Francisco phone book, she found a promising lead. It was a group for gay men. When she called, they asked if she was gay. She said she wasn't, so they sent her away and told her to try another group. The outfit they recommended surprised Sandy. It was the San Francisco Police Department. STONE: It turned out that the police department was running a counseling unit of sorts, which they did for the population of transgender people that lived in the San Francisco Tenderloin, which was sort of the down-and-out skid row section of town that tended to collect people who couldn't afford to live anywhere else or who had run out of options. VEDANTAM: Trans people who ended up in the Tenderloin were at high risk for drug addiction and prostitution. They were social outcasts. When Sandy got in touch with the police to ask for help, the first thing they did was to dissuade her from acting on her feelings. STONE: And they actually tried to discourage me by taking me on a tour that reminded me of Dante being led down into the lower circles of hell. They really showed me the worst of everything, and then said, are you sure you still want to go ahead with what you were thinking of? And to be perfectly honest, I was not quite sure what I was thinking of. I was just trying to collect information. And I think it would be safe to say that that's what we were all doing at that time. VEDANTAM: Still, the referral to the police turned out to be a stroke of luck. The cops told her that a center at Stanford University had recently started performing what were then called sex change operations. STONE: They didn't refer me to Stanford as much as talk about it as the great, unattainable goal - the great, beautiful, shining star in the sky. VEDANTAM: After years of suffering and loneliness and confusion, the Stanford program felt like a beacon. Sandy felt she might finally have a chance to live a more honest, satisfying life. But first, she had to convince the gatekeeper who stood between her and the person she wanted to become. He ran what was then called the gender dysphoria program at Stanford. His name was Don Laub. The gatekeeper of Stanford's gender dysphoria program was a hedgehog. From a very early age, he had a big-picture idea. He wanted to help people. He wanted to help a lot of people. As a small child, when kids in his school were asked to donate money to a charity, his classmates contributed a dime. Don worked in a vegetable garden an entire summer to raise a whopping $10. LAUB: Now, I got a letter, a preserved letter from - that my mother wrote to some of her friends saying, Don, he's done something that nobody has ever done. VEDANTAM: Don's father feared his little boy was consumed with being a do-gooder, that he would turn out to be a failure at business. His father was right. Don Laub became a doctor. When he came to Stanford in the 1960s, he was a young, ambitious plastic surgeon very much in awe of his prize-winning colleagues. LAUB: Coming to Stanford, I was overshadowed by the hugeness of what people were doing - the importance of it. So I knew that I had to do something, like, maybe - you know, I got to do this somewhere along the line because everybody else here is doing it. VEDANTAM: Don was looking for a place to make his mark. One day, a colleague walked out of an examination room and came up to him. LAUB: And said, Don, I want you to see a patient. It's a good case. You might not like it. It's a sex change. VEDANTAM: Remember; this was 1968. LAUB: I said, Dave (ph), send that patient away. I'm a Catholic boy from the Midwest, and I'm at Stanford. We don't do those things. VEDANTAM: But Don's colleague insisted he meet the patient. To be clear, this patient was not Sandy Stone. LAUB: He said, do me a favor, and go in that room. So I went in the room and talked to the patient. And I said, now, why do you want this sex change? She said, well, I was born, and this is what I should be. I said, well, when did you decide that? She said, I didn't decide it. This is what I was born with from day one. VEDANTAM: This patient was a pioneer. No one on the West Coast had received what's come to be known today as gender reassignment surgery or gender confirmation surgery. In fact, the surgery had been rarely performed across the whole world. Don was an unlikely choice of doctor. He was, by his own account, a prim man from the Midwest. But although Don initially blanched at the idea of gender reassignment surgery, he felt a shiver of excitement. He didn't send the patient away. Instead, he went looking for information. He consulted with psychiatrists and the few surgeons around the world who'd already performed this kind of surgery. What prompted you, this sort of, you know, Catholic doctor from the Midwest, to basically take this on? It seems like an unlikely fit. LAUB: It was a wonderful opportunity to do a big thing and to help a lot of people. VEDANTAM: Altruism and ambition were always tightly woven in Don's identity. He wasn't interested in superficial cosmetic work. He wanted to change the world. He decided to take the leap. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: In November 1968, Don Laub performed California's first gender reassignment surgery. LAUB: Yeah, we were more than prepared for all of the things that might happen. And the surgery went fine. It took about 3 1/2 hours, and we did it with the skin graft method and no problem. VEDANTAM: Don soon became one of the world's leading experts on gender reassignment surgery. He started a program. His reputation grew - a reputation for being a good surgeon and a tough gatekeeper. He turned away many people because he felt they weren't good candidates for surgery. Sandy Stone vividly remembers her first appointment with him in the mid-'70s. STONE: I go in and sit down, and Don is behind his desk. And he's wearing his white coat. And he's very distinguished-looking and calm and very friendly and open. And he says, well, what can I do for you? And I say the first thing that comes into my head, which is, I think I'm a woman. Now, the scene we have is Don behind his desk and me - I'm - I have a long black beard and wild black hair. I'm wearing a blue shirt, jeans and engineer's boots. I do not exactly look like I'm thinking of myself as a stereotypical woman. And Don looks at me and says, really? And I say, what should I do? I mean, I'm totally - I'm completely open to anything. And I really don't know what I should do, what direction I should move in, what's right, what's wrong. And I'm looking to Donald to tell me. And in my memory of the thing, Donald then says, well, the first thing you should do is lose the beard. VEDANTAM: That was the beginning of Sandy's long, transformative journey. It was a tough journey. Don wanted Sandy to be sure she was making the right decision. So before he would even consider surgery, Sandy says he told her she would have to live openly and fully as a woman for one full year. It was a requirement based on the reality of the time. No one, not Sandy nor Don, knew what might come from these surgeries in the long term. These were early days. It was all a bit of an experiment, a shot in the dark. STONE: It was fraught. It was fraught for everyone. And it was fraught because, at that time, it was not clear what would happen later. We didn't have very many examples of transgender people who had had surgery who went on to have fulfilling lives and live to tell about it, which is to say, came back later and reported back to the program. VEDANTAM: They were experimenting on the fringe of what both medicine and society thought was acceptable. Don was taking risks with his professional reputation. Sandy was taking risks with her life. There was one moment, Sandy says, when she and Don clashed. The conflict boiled down to their cognitive styles. STONE: At some point, he asked me if I were 100% committed to wanting surgery. And I said, no, I'm not. I'm probably 99. 9%. I think anyone who is 100% committed to anything is probably crazy. You have to have some reservations in life. You have to have an overview of everything that you're doing and have alternative plans if what you're looking for doesn't work out. And Don said, well, in that case, you're not eligible for surgery. You have to be 100% committed. VEDANTAM: It took a mediated session with Don's assistant for the two of them to resolve the conflict. But the incident revealed something about the way a hedgehog moves through the world. Hedgehogs are decisive. Don could not understand anything less than 100% commitment, even if the . 1% of doubt was simply a way to say, I'm human, how can I be absolutely sure? Sandy tells another story of a time she came in for an appointment wearing jeans and a T-shirt. Don asked her why she wasn't dressed like a woman. He'd missed the bell-bottom-jeans-and-tie-dye revolution happening right outside his window. It was the kind of thing that could have led to a fight, except for one thing. Sandy understood where Don was coming from. She knew that underneath the tough exterior, he really wanted to help and not just in a medical sense. More than anything, Don wanted Sandy to live a life where she didn't feel like an outcast. STONE: He wanted his people to be totally unremarkable, to just fit in, to be able to live their lives, to be able to be inconspicuous and just get along. And that's a good thing to want for 99% of your waking day is just to be able to live your life, to be able to live with other people and not rub people the wrong way. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Sandy Stone successfully underwent surgery in 1977. When I interviewed Sandy, I told her that her story reminded me of another case that Don told me about. It's interesting because I - Don first came to my attention because of another case involving cleft lip surgery, and it's so striking that as you're saying this, I'm sort of hearing echoes of that other work as well, this drive that he had to just help people to essentially live what he would think of as being a normal life, a life that they're not ostracized and a life that they're not feeling like they're outcasts, that they're functioning, they are - they can get an education if they're a child or they can get a job if they're an adult, that they can be happy. And I feel there's something actually very Midwestern about that idea. STONE: That's the word. That word you said is correct. Don wanted people to be happy. Don did it professionally. His job was to help people to be happy. And for that, I owe him a lifetime debt. I would not have done anything, I think, that I did after the 1980s if it weren't for Don Laub - or the '70s rather - if it weren't for Don Laub. VEDANTAM: Sandy went on to become a prominent writer and theorist and eventually helped found the academic discipline of transgender studies. When she considers Don's influence on her life, she hones in on his willingness to pursue a big idea with single-minded purpose. STONE: Do you go for the big one, or do you accept something less? And many of us accept something less because we don't want to take the risk, and then we may go through life maybe - maybe we'll be happy with our measure or maybe we'll say, what if I had gone for what I really wanted? What would that have been like? Maybe I would have died. Yeah, maybe, I would have. But I didn't. I beat the odds, and I went on to be gloriously happy. That's something in life, and Don brought that to many people. I don't see how one could do better than that. VEDANTAM: Don's leap into the unknown, his willingness to bet his professional reputation on a big idea, his confidence in his own judgment - it had all paid off. The hedgehog had won, but pursuing a big idea with determination doesn't always pay off. And when a hedgehog fails, the fall can be painful. Don Laub knows about that part of the story, too. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: According to the ancient Greek poet Archilochus, the fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing. Psychologist Phil Tetlock says the metaphor describes two kinds of people. Small-picture tacticians are foxes. Big-picture strategists are hedgehogs. Before Don Laub became a world-renowned gender reassignment surgeon, he had another big idea. It started this way. One day, a colleague asked him if he could help with a surgery. The patient was a child from Mexico. LAUB: This was a 14-year-old boy who had no other deformity than his cleft lip and palate. VEDANTAM: But because of it, the boy was shunned. A group of priests had driven him north all the way to Stanford to get him help. Don immediately understood that the cleft lip wasn't just a medical problem. LAUB: He had not gone to school. He had no educational advancement. He had no friends. VEDANTAM: The surgery to repair the cleft lip and palate was simple and quick. It was so easy, and it gave this child a real chance in life. Don says performing the surgery made him feel really good. As someone with deep religious roots and a Catholic education that emphasized helping the poor, Don felt this was the kind of patient he wanted to serve. He turned to the priests who brought the boy from Mexico. LAUB: I asked them, are there other patients in Mexico like this? They said, the place is full of them. So we bought an airplane ticket and went down to Mexicali and asked for a clinic. VEDANTAM: Just like that, where a fox may have calculated the odds, considered the upside and the downside, the hedgehog simply picked up and went. In Mexicali, Don found a dusty border town in the desert where the people were very poor. LAUB: I mean, most of the houses were made of packing crates at that time, and there was no paving in Mexicali of 200,000 people. VEDANTAM: Mexicali's main medical facility was an old, wood home. LAUB: It had a dirt floor for part of it with the back part of the clinic was used to raise fighting cocks. VEDANTAM: A rational fox may have calculated the risks and backed down - not Don. He recruited local health officials to get word out that they would be providing free surgeries for children with cleft lips and burn scars. The clinic was quickly packed. LAUB: It was 10:30 in the morning. In that desert, there had not been rain there for three years. Hot in the morning - it was about 106 degrees already. You couldn't touch anything metal because you'd burn your hand. The first patient I saw was sitting there with a bag on his head with two little peepholes. I said, what's with the - why the bag? VEDANTAM: Behind those peepholes, the boy was hiding his face in shame. Don asked if he could take a look. LAUB: So he got the bag off, and he had a burn scar that pulled his eyelid down - a simple thing to repair. VEDANTAM: As with Sandy, Don wanted to make the little boy unremarkable. He wanted him to lead an ordinary life, unmarked by stigma and shame. That first trip was just a fact-finding mission, a way to see if there was a need. By the time Don went back to Stanford, a plan had formed in his mind. He wanted to recruit the best doctors from the United States and fly them to Mexico to perform free surgeries on children with birth defects. He recruited surgical residents to join skilled surgeons on the trips. He found pilots willing to transport medical equipment. Hedgehogs have charisma. They can see the shining city on the hill so clearly that everyone around them starts to see it, too. LAUB: Everybody jumped on it. I had to hide when I'd go in the hospital because people wanted to get in on this. VEDANTAM: In 1966, the official medical missions began. Now, it's important to remember that at this time, the idea of plastic surgeons going abroad to provide free surgery was almost unheard off. There were fewer parameters of how international aid organizations should operate. Don was flying by the seat of his pants. Every few months, the doctors would descend on Mexicali. They'd throw themselves into four marathon days of back-to-back surgeries and consultations. Over the years, they'd come back again and again, performing more than 2,000 surgeries in all. One of Don's first patients was a little boy named Eugenio (ph). He was the boy who'd worn the bag over his head. Don repaired the scarred eyelid and still remembers the boy's first reaction. LAUB: He had a very nice, huge smile. VEDANTAM: On a follow-up trip, Don tracked Eugenio down. LAUB: He shook hands and everything like that, even as a young kid. And he said, I have friends in school now. VEDANTAM: Don loved it. LAUB: It's a real happiness. It's a source of happiness is the best description. HOWARD HOLDERNESS: With - if anything, Don had a - I would describe it as a very - and I think he would accept this. I think it was a very sort of a missionary zeal. VEDANTAM: This is plastic surgeon Howard Holderness. He was part of the team of residents helping perform surgeries in Mexicali. Howard says that Don's vision drove the whole team. HOLDERNESS: I think he felt very close to trying to do things that - not only practice medicine in its - in all of its forms of science and everything, but the art of medicine and some of the spiritual aspects of being a good doctor. VEDANTAM: He was doing more than surgeries. Don was developing a program that could set an example for others to follow around the world. One day about two years into the Mexico program, a woman arrived at the clinic with her young son. His name was Salvador (ph). Compared with the other patients, Salvador had a more severe birth defect. He had bilateral clefs - two clefs rather than one. LAUB: When you have this bilateral, the muscles are cut twice. So when you smile, they pull out. If they're repaired, they pull in. See? So every time he would have a visual expression, it would be awful. You'd see these teeth on both sides. VEDANTAM: Salvador was a perfect candidate for surgery, that is, until a doctor on the team gave the boy a thorough physical and listened to his heart with a stethoscope. (SOUNDBITE OF HEARTBEAT) LAUB: His mother brought him in and the pediatrician listened and it goes whoosh, whoosh, whoosh - the heart sounds. VEDANTAM: These were not normal sounds. The boy's heart had a hole in it. The risk of proceeding with surgery was small but potentially fatal. They gave the mother the bad news. LAUB: We can't operate because we don't have the equipment in Mexicali to do the heart catheterization or anything like that or any - even get the EKG today so. . . VEDANTAM: So Don and his team turned away the mother and the little boy. I should say here that we're going only on Don's account of what happened. The medical records from that era are incomplete, and we weren't able to find the mother. A few months after sending the child away, Don and his team were back in Mexicali. The mother and her son were waiting for them again. Salvador, she told them, was shunned. He had no friends. Other children called him el monstre, the monster. LAUB: The mother said, this child has no chance in life. You've got to fix it. VEDANTAM: Don's heart went out to the little boy. He explained the danger again. The risk was small, but it did mean that things could go seriously wrong. Don held the stethoscope up to the mother's ears. (SOUNDBITE OF HEARTBEAT) LAUB: Listen. She can hear it - whoosh, whoosh, whoosh. VEDANTAM: So the answer again was no. More months passed. Don returned to the clinic. So did the mother. LAUB: Por favor, please, doctor. Can you see that this child has no life? VEDANTAM: This was a critical moment. Don could again have said no. Medical protocol said that was the right call. But Don also knew that without surgery, Salvador would always be an outcast. Could he have tried to take the boy back to Stanford where heart surgeons could have assisted with his care? Maybe but that would have been complicated, expensive and a drain on critical resources from the project in Mexico, resources that were helping hundreds of other children. So Don did what Don always did. He took a look at the child, took a deep breath and said, OK, we'll do it. LAUB: I feel like that's why I existed is for this judgment. I mean, I'm not there to take care of little pimples. I'm there to do the tough cases. So this was putting it right on a line. You've got to do it or put your tail between your legs and get out of there. VEDANTAM: It's been nearly 50 years since Don Laub performed that surgery on a 6-year-old boy in Mexicali, Mexico. He's had thousands of patients since then, but the details of that day are still vivid in his mind. The morning of the surgery, the boy went through the standard pre-surgery lab tests and check-up, an IV was started and he received extra glucose in case his blood sugar was low from stomach worms. And then the boy walked by himself into the operating room. LAUB: And he gets on the operating table himself because he trusts the whole world. VEDANTAM: The surgery began. First, the child was anesthetized. LAUB: So that went fine. It went perfect, no problem at all. VEDANTAM: Then Don and his team began the surgery. LAUB: When we were operating, everything was going perfect. VEDANTAM: And then just like that, it wasn't. LAUB: The anesthesiologist said, boys, we have no pulse. VEDANTAM: They tried everything - CPR, medicine to jumpstart the heart - nothing worked. Don suspected a blood clot. The boy was dead. They put away their surgical tools. They wheeled the body to the morgue. All the while, Don's heart was starting to race. He was working in a foreign country, and he had made a risky judgment call in violation of medical protocol. LAUB: My mind is going 1,000 miles a minute. Why am I here in Mexico? Why did I get into this? What the hell is the matter with you? Here you are in a foreign country. You're going to end up in jail. It's just a goddamn disaster, an awful thing. VEDANTAM: And, of course, there was the boy's mother waiting anxiously outside for news of her son. Don remembers stepping out of the operating room and walking up to her. He told her there'd been complications, that they had tried hard, but the boy had died. The mother began to sob. But then, Don says, she did something surprising. She asked him why he was upset. LAUB: She said, you should be happy because the child is seeing God with a complete face. VEDANTAM: Don had expected accusation and anger. Instead, he encountered a mother who leaned heavily on her faith. Don says she was comforted by the thought that her child was now repaired and beautiful and at home with God. Salvador was finally at peace. Don stared at the mother. He was speechless, not just because of what she'd said but because he was struck by another thought. The mother didn't know this, but Salvador's face was not repaired. He died before the surgery was complete. What would the mother say when she saw her son at the funeral? Again, the medical protocol was clear. Don had to turn the body over to Salvador's mother, but he felt he couldn't bring himself to do this. It would only compound the first tragedy. He conferred with his team about finishing the surgery on Salvador. LAUB: I said, it's against the law, but I think in this case, we should. VEDANTAM: The rest of the team unanimously agreed. The little boy was brought back from the morgue. LAUB: The child came back in a body bag, and we did the whole thing as if the child was awake. VEDANTAM: I interviewed Don several times for this story. I pushed hard to understand why he decided to operate on Salvador. What were you telling yourself, again, emotionally that made you change your mind, that made you say, yes, I recognize there's a risk, but I have to do this? LAUB: I thought this is what I am for. This is my purpose. . . VEDANTAM: And you said it's worth. . . LAUB: . . . I mean, I was standing there, and I couldn't say no again. I didn't. I couldn't, and I made that - when I said that, let's go ahead and do the case, I didn't have any second thoughts. I - emotionally, I figured out that this is what I should do. VEDANTAM: Don still thinks about Salvador, has thought about him thousands of times over the years. He's turned the case over in his head in every possible way. I asked him over and over whether he felt regret. LAUB: No. Well, I (laughter) - of course, I do. Of course, I do. Yes, I do. I mean, as you said just a minute ago, it was a mistake. But I don't have - I'm not whipping myself. VEDANTAM: Not whipping himself, Don says, because he was trying to do the right thing. That's the reason he decided to operate. That's the reason he completed the surgery after the child was dead. What was more important than being on the right side of the law? LAUB: Doing the right thing. VEDANTAM: By the mother and by the child? LAUB: Yes. Yeah. No, you must always do the right thing. That is the highest priority over all different laws and commandments or any of that thing. You have to do the right thing. VEDANTAM: The day after Salvador died, Don Laub was back in the operating room. There were more children waiting for surgery. He remembers looking out the windows at the sky. It was, he says, a perfect azure blue. At 10:30, the time when Salvador was to be buried, everyone on the team fell silent and paused. There was no sound except for the whoosh of the anesthesia machine. When we think of foxes and hedgehogs, it's completely understandable that we want the best of both worlds. We love bold visionaries who take big risks, except when the risks don't work. At moments like that, we prefer the visionaries to be more cautious, filled with a little self-doubt. Now, people don't always fall neatly into one camp or the other. Some of us can be both fox and hedgehog. We can think and dream big but also change course, adapt to circumstances. But it may be that we can't have our cake and eat it, too. If we want the visionary Steve Jobs who helped usher in the age of the iPhone, we might also get the tyrannical CEO who nearly ran Apple computers into the ground in the 1980s. It's odd to think of Gandhi and Napoleon and Churchill and Mao in the same breath, but they are cut from the same cloth of messianic vision. It's easy not to like the kind of people who create history's greatest failures. But it turns out they're also the people who produce our greatest triumphs.

The music in today's show was composed by Ramtin Arablouei. Our unsung hero this week is another hedgehog and another Don. Donald Drake was a colleague and friend of mine at the Philadelphia Inquirer many years ago. He taught me many things about writing and storytelling. We even wrote a play together. Don died shortly after this episode first aired. I'll never forget all that he taught me. For more HIDDEN BRAIN, please follow us on Facebook and Twitter.

The International Space Station is a remarkable piece of hardware. But as amazing as the space station is, excitement about it is relatively modest.

PALCA: Emily Lakdawalla works for The Planetary Society. By these robots, Lakdawalla is referring to the various probes that have flown past planets, moons and asteroids, orbiting some, landing on others. Lakdawalla says, sure, it would be inspiring to see an astronaut land on Mars, but in the meantime, inspiration is coming from NASA's Mars rovers. LAKDAWALLA: It's very easy to anthropomorphize them and imagine ourselves rolling across the surface of Mars. I think it's really not a stretch to imagine ourselves in the place of these robots exploring across the solar system. PALCA: Millions of people around the world have watched with delight as the six-wheeled rovers have trundled across the Martian surface snapping pictures and taking selfies.

MATTHEW SHINDELL: This gallery is kind of tucked into the west end of the museum. PALCA: Shindell is the museum's planetary science curator. A prominent feature of the gallery is a large glass case containing versions of all the rovers NASA sent to Mars, starting with the tiny Sojourner rover that landed in 1997, right up to the 2,000-pound Curiosity rover that arrived in 2012. SHINDELL: People love to come and see the rovers and really get a sense of what they look like up close and their actual scale. PALCA: Now, Mars has a mystique all its own so perhaps it's not surprising that people find exploring the Red Planet enticing. But the New Horizons' flyby of Pluto, the Messenger's close encounter with Mercury and Juno buzzing over Jupiter's poles have all generated great public interest. And Lindy Elkins-Tanton of Arizona State University says the public's appetite for space exploration goes beyond the familiar bits of the solar system. Elkins-Tanton is lead scientist on a mission to a weird asteroid known as Psyche. It's weird because Psyche is made entirely of metal, the only asteroid like it in our solar system. True, most people haven't heard of Psyche. But Elkins-Tanton says when they learn about it, they're hooked. LINDY ELKINS-TANTON: We're sending this probe to a place that is absolutely uninhabitable in an Earth kind of sense, and yet the engagement we're getting from the public already, two years before launch, is profound. PALCA: Elkins-Tanton says she and her team are inviting the public to explore Psyche with them. ELKINS-TANTON: We're going to be sending the images that we get out onto the Internet for everyone in the world to see within a half-hour of our receiving them. So everyone in the world is going to see this crazy world at the same time, and we can all scratch our heads together. PALCA: The idea of sharing the experience of space missions is something NASA has embraced.

She points to the day NASA decided to end the Cassini mission to Saturn by sending the probe into the planet's atmosphere, where it burned up.

Plastic particles float in the air. That's just the stuff people can see. Largely overlooked is how making plastic affects the environment. As NPR's Christopher Joyce reports, it's a big contributor to climate change, but then, so are many of the alternatives. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: The plastic water bottle or grocery bag or tray of cucumbers at the supermarket - they're made from oil or natural gas. And, says Carroll Muffett, it takes a lot of energy to make that happen. CARROLL MUFFETT: The real story of plastic's impact on the environment begins at the wellheads where it comes out of the ground, and it never, ever stops. JOYCE: Muffett runs the Center for International Environmental Law. The center has gathered global data on how much climate-warming greenhouse gas is produced in making all that plastic, from cradle to grave. First, there are gas leaks at the wellheads. Then there are leaks from the pipelines that take oil and gas to a chemical plant. Then there's the lengthy chemical process of turning oil or gas into raw plastic resin. MUFFETT: Plastics is among the most energy-intensive materials to produce. JOYCE: Factories then use more energy to fashion the plastic into packaging or car parts or textiles. Trucking it around to consumers causes more emissions. And once it's used, it often gets burned to make electricity. That's another source of greenhouse gases. All told, says Muffett. . . MUFFETT: Emissions from plastics production and incineration could account to 56 gigatons of carbon between now and 2050. JOYCE: Or about 50 times the annual emissions of all the coal power plants in the U. S. That's a big number because plastic production is expected to almost quadruple by 2050. That's according to the World Economic Forum. The American Chemistry Council says the U. S. industry plans to spend $47 billion on new capacity over the next decade. MUFFETT: The key message that people should take away is that the plastics crisis is a climate crisis hiding in plain sight. JOYCE: But one thing this analysis does not do is examine the carbon footprint of things that would replace plastic - things like paper or canvas or glass. Several research groups have, and plastic repeatedly comes out ahead. Chemical engineer Beverly Sauer of ERG, an independent research group, compared a mix of plastic packaging with a mix of substitutes. BEVERLY SAUER: The impact associated with plastics are generally much lower than the impact for the mix of substitute materials that would replace packaging. JOYCE: ERG's analysis calculated the quantity of raw materials, as well as the electricity, fuel, water and other materials needed to make paper and plastic packaging. Plastic uses less. And at the end of its life, paper in a landfill emits more greenhouse gases. One big advantage plastic has is, it's light. SAUER: The plastic packaging accomplishes its purpose with very little weight of material. JOYCE: If, for example, a paper bag weighs twice what a plastic one does. . . SAUER: Not only do you have to produce, you know, twice the weight of material; you have to transport twice the weight of material. You have twice the weight of material to manage at the end of its useful life. JOYCE: And glass bottles weigh several times more than plastic ones. The ERG analysis was done for the American Chemistry Council. Analyses by the British government and other independent researchers have also found that most plastic packaging has a lighter carbon footprint than paper. But is plastic's effect on climate all that matters? (SOUNDBITE OF WAVE CRASHING)JOYCE: Angela Howe says no. She's a surfer and an attorney with the Surfrider Foundation. It's a group started by surfers who keep beaches like this one in Southern California clean. ANGELA HOWE: So they pick up trash, and they see that it's abundantly plastic, overwhelmingly. JOYCE: Plastic litter lasts for decades, at least. It's trash that marine animals eat, and plastic breaks down into tiny pieces that contaminate rivers and oceans and our own food. HOWE: Where does our trash go, and what can we do to stop that cycle where it's ending up in the ocean in whales' stomachs? JOYCE: Environmental groups are trying to sort out the plastic versus paper problem. Susan Ruffo is a plastics expert with the Ocean Conservancy. She says plastic trash is bad for the oceans and human health, but so is climate change. SUSAN RUFFO: We see climate as one of the most serious threats to the ocean, certainly in the long term. So you can't discount climate impacts of any solution that you're going to look at. JOYCE: So if people want less plastic, they'll have to pick replacements carefully. RUFFO: You know, we have a history as a species of solving one problem with great intensity, only to figure out we've created another one.

A new report out today says that means chronic flooding in many places. NPR's Rebecca Hersher explains. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: Charleston, S. C. , is one of the dozens of coastal cities where high tides increasingly mean water in the streets. KATIE MCKAIN: Yeah, there was one two weeks ago. HERSHER: Katie McKain is the director of sustainability for the city of Charleston. She says between rising sea levels and more extreme rain - both driven by climate change - she deals with floods and the weather forecast all the time. MCKAIN: At this time of year, it can easily be once a week or more. HERSHER: It's expensive, it's time-consuming and it's only getting worse. High-tide flooding events in Charleston have more than doubled since 2000. And by 2030, the city is projected to experience 10 to 20 days a year of ocean flooding without any storm to cause it. That's according to an annual report on high-tide flooding from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Mark Wilbert is the resilience director for Charleston. MARK WILBERT: I do think we're going to have to adapt. I think everybody up and down the coast is going to have to adapt. HERSHER: Positions like Wilbert's are a relatively new part of city government. He started as resilience director a couple years ago, specifically because of flooding. He says forecasts like the one released today by NOAA are extremely important tools for local officials who are trying to plan city services. WILBERT: That's really about budgeting because as we're going to have to respond to each of these, we're going to need, you know, resources to meet what the expected demand will be. HERSHER: For example, the number of high-tide flood days affects how much money needs to be set aside for police, for sewer maintenance, for public education about how to prepare for floods. High-tide flooding can also hurt local economies. A study last year found that one sunny-day flood in Annapolis, Md. , cost businesses about $100,000. The new NOAA report finds that Annapolis and nearby Baltimore and Washington, D. C. , all set new records for high-tide flooding last year. And the trend is accelerating. The same is true to the South and Florida, along the Gulf Coast in cities like Houston and Galveston and to the North. Stephanie Kruel is an environmental planner with the Boston engineering firm VHB. She says much of the city was built on dirt that was trucked in, mostly to fill marshy areas. STEPHANIE KRUEL: At the time they were filled, sea level rise wasn't something that anybody contemplated, and so the areas that were filled were just a couple of feet above high tide. HERSHER: But as sea levels have risen, tides have gotten higher. Today, Boston has about 20 days of high-tide flooding a year in major downtown areas. KRUEL: We have a major commercial district, the downtown financial district. Even City Hall itself is very low-lying. HERSHER: And then there's planning for the future. There is still demand for new office space and homes right on the water. To protect those areas, the city plans to upgrade stormwater systems and raise roads higher. Kruel says there's also a plan to require new buildings in low-lying areas to have elevated first floors, which seems straightforward, but higher first floors actually change a normal city street a lot. For one thing, buildings still need to be accessible to strollers and people in wheelchairs. KRUEL: So now you have to deal with, you know, ramps or elevators or something like that. HERSHER: It's an example of how cities are grappling with the basics of how they're built, and they're being forced to figure it out now, with ocean water already in the basement.

HERSHER: For example, the number of high-tide flood days affects how much money needs to be set aside for police, for sewer maintenance, for public education about how to prepare for floods. High-tide flooding can also hurt local economies. A study last year found that one sunny-day flood in Annapolis, Md. , cost businesses about $100,000. The new NOAA report finds that Annapolis and nearby Baltimore and Washington, D. C. , all set new records for high-tide flooding last year. And the trend is accelerating. The same is true to the South and Florida, along the Gulf Coast in cities like Houston and Galveston and to the North. Stephanie Kruel is an environmental planner with the Boston engineering firm VHB. She says much of the city was built on dirt that was trucked in, mostly to fill marshy areas. STEPHANIE KRUEL: At the time they were filled, sea level rise wasn't something that anybody contemplated, and so the areas that were filled were just a couple of feet above high tide. HERSHER: But as sea levels have risen, tides have gotten higher. Today, Boston has about 20 days of high-tide flooding a year in major downtown areas. KRUEL: We have a major commercial district, the downtown financial district. Even City Hall itself is very low-lying. HERSHER: And then there's planning for the future. There is still demand for new office space and homes right on the water. To protect those areas, the city plans to upgrade stormwater systems and raise roads higher. Kruel says there's also a plan to require new buildings in low-lying areas to have elevated first floors, which seems straightforward, but higher first floors actually change a normal city street a lot. For one thing, buildings still need to be accessible to strollers and people in wheelchairs. KRUEL: So now you have to deal with, you know, ramps or elevators or something like that. HERSHER: It's an example of how cities are grappling with the basics of how they're built, and they're being forced to figure it out now, with ocean water already in the basement.

MERRIT KENNEDY, BYLINE: Darren Elias holds four World Poker Tour titles and has won millions of dollars playing the game. So he was a perfect person to test the skills of a poker bot called Pluribus.

ELIAS: And it was improving very rapidly, where it went from being a mediocre player to basically a world class-level poker player in a matter of days and weeks, which was pretty scary.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. At some point in our lives, many of us realize that the way we hear our own voice isn't the way others hear our voice. Shay (ph) had that realization as a child helping out at the family business, a deli in south West Virginia. SHAY: We did a lot of business with the deli, a lot of call-in orders, and I had to answer the phone with the name of the business. VEDANTAM: Often when the phone rang, the same thing happened over and over again. SHAY: I vividly remember always being confused for my mother. They would always say, hey Judy (ph), you know, and either start into their questions or whatever they were looking to speak to my mother about. VEDANTAM: This case of mistaken identity became a running joke. SHAY: You know, it was ha-ha, they thought that he was Judy. VEDANTAM: Shay didn't correct the callers. That's because Shay didn't mind being mistaken for Judy. SHAY: It was just comforting to me because it felt natural. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Shay was raised as a boy. But now, decades later, Shay identifies as a transgender woman. We're not using her legal name at her request because it's a man's name. Shay's experience at the deli became a template for the rest of her life. She listened to her voice, and she listened to the way others heard her voice. There was always a gap between the two. She first tried to sound more masculine to fit in with the way the world saw her. SHAY: So I would consciously make an effort to try to talk a little deeper. It was - you know, I practiced it. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ROADHOUSE BLUES\")THE DOORS: (Singing) And I woke up in morning, I got myself a beer. VEDANTAM: One way she practiced was to sing along with The Doors, Tool and Nine Inch Nails. SHAY: I tended to sort of go towards heavier music. You know, raspy, deep - yelling, almost - voices. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ROADHOUSE BLUES\")THE DOORS: (Singing) Let it roll all night long. VEDANTAM: Sounding more masculine became second nature. But it wore on her. SHAY: My entire life, I have been playing the role of a boy. And it is exhausting. It truly is. VEDANTAM: Years and years passed like this. A divorce, a second wife, two kids and a cancer scare later, Shay began to reconsider how she wanted to sound. Instead of trying to sound more masculine, she now started to try to sound more feminine. SHAY: Even prior to accepting that I was trans before I could put a label on what I was, I consciously made an effort to not sound as masculine, and that started in my early 30s. VEDANTAM: Once again, she used music as a way to practice. (SOUNDBITE OF BRITNEY SPEARS SONG, \"OOPS! . . . I DID IT AGAIN\")SHAY: I would always sing in the car alone. And I would attempt Britney Spears. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"OOPS! . . . I DID IT AGAIN\")BRITNEY SPEARS: (Singing) I think I did it again. I made you believe we're more than just friends. Baby. SHAY: It seems silly, but I would, when I'm singing in the car, I would sort of turn my head towards my driver's side window. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"OOPS! . . . I DID IT AGAIN\")SPEARS: (Singing) 'Cause to lose all my senses. SHAY: . . . Because it would reflect the sound back to me a little more loudly so that I could hear the pitch and tone of my voice. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"OOPS! . . . I DID IT AGAIN\")SPEARS: (Singing) Oops. I did it again. I played with your heart. SHAY: And I would try to make my voice sound at a higher pitch without it sounding like I was trying. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"OOPS! . . . I DID IT AGAIN\")SPEARS: (Singing) Love, and I'm sent from above. I'm not that innocent. VEDANTAM: What did you hear? Did you hear the voice that you wanted to hear? SHAY: No. No. I've never - I don't know that I have ever actually been able to hear the same voice that I hear come from me. VEDANTAM: Shay has spent a lifetime being dissatisfied with the way she sounds. She viscerally knows something the rest of us often forget - our voices shape who we are. They shape how other people think of us. (SOUNDBITE OF CROSSTALK)VEDANTAM: This week on HIDDEN BRAIN, we look at the relationship between our voices and our identities. RUPAL PATEL: Voice is about who you are. Our voice signals things about our personality. VEDANTAM: Plus how technology might help people with vocal impairments find voices that reflect who they are. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LONNIE BLANCHARD: Once you close your eyes and let your mind relax, it doesn't take long to escape to the beautiful beach. VEDANTAM: . . . And the ethical quandaries that arise when we can create personalized, customized voices. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #1: (As Donald Trump) This is huge. They can make us say anything now - really, anything. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Jackie Kirk (ph) used to love the sound of her voice. She spent her 20s in San Francisco. And like many young people living in the big city, she enjoyed going out with her friends. She danced to electronic music at clubs and drank at bars. She was outgoing, and she was a flirt. JACKIE KIRK: I have to admit I've always enjoyed flirting. (Laughter). And so I was quite the flirter. (Laughter). It was sort of a fun activity to help pass the day - you know, doing something mundane, you know, at work. VEDANTAM: For Jackie, flirting was also a demonstration of her confidence. KIRK: It reinforces my own identity, how I felt about myself - fun, I'm somebody that people are attracted to, not just physically or sexually, but a person who people like. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Jackie liked to be liked. She liked being someone people wanted to be around. When she thinks about who she was back then she refers to that person as Voice One Jackie. KIRK: Voice One Jackie (laughter) was really fun-loving, always joking, pretty carefree. VEDANTAM: For years, Jackie had been doing backpacking trips with her then-boyfriend. KIRK: All of our gear on our back. Fifty pounds, 60 pounds, et cetera. Even carrying bottles of wine, (laughter), you know, in the backpack. VEDANTAM: She'd been doing these backpacking trips for several years. But during a trip to a national forest in California, Jackie came up short. KIRK: I couldn't go one step further. I - you know, and being young, you think, you know, what could it be? There's nothing wrong with me. I'm 20, whatever, 20-something years old. And I notice I'm getting really short of breath, and it was a real struggle. Yeah. I finally made it, of course, but it was really slow and a real struggle to make it back. VEDANTAM: Hiking became too taxing for her so she cut back and switched to ballet. But one day during a series of releves, a more aerobically challenging dance move, Jackie felt lightheaded and dizzy. It was serious. KIRK: I had a seizure. And, you know, all of the medical follow-up led me to discover that I had a lung disease. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: She was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension. It's a rare, progressive disease where the blood vessels in the lungs shrink and oxygen is not distributed properly. KIRK: There's no cure for it except for a lung transplant. VEDANTAM: In 2008, at 32, Jackie received a double lung transplant. The surgery was successful. Within weeks, she was out of the hospital and back in the dance studio. In 2010, she left San Francisco to explore Latin America and Europe, but her body began to reject her new lungs. Before long, Jackie was back in the hospital, this time in Switzerland, waiting for another lung transplant. KIRK: I had the surgery in January of 2013, and I was asleep still for another month and a half. VEDANTAM: When she woke up, she found her surgery had been successful, except for one very important thing. KIRK: I couldn't speak. I couldn't speak. VEDANTAM: During the operation, the medical staff had used a ventilator to help her breathe. KIRK: So I was intubated. That means they basically have a tube that they put inside your mouth, and it goes down your throat. And they send that down into your lungs. And during this intubation, the tube was rigid enough to cause some damage to my vocal cords. VEDANTAM: Jackie began speech therapy, and within a few weeks she slowly regained the ability to speak. But the voice that came out of her mouth, it wasn't her voice. KIRK: My voice changed. Its raspier. It's broken a bit. VEDANTAM: Ever since, speaking has been hard work. KIRK: Yeah. I really have to push my - I feel it. It's actually a physical effort. Like, I'm actually squeezing the vocal cords as hard as I can to make the loudest sound possible to get to be heard. (Laughter). And it's very tiring. VEDANTAM: The harder it became to produce sound, the more self-conscious she became about the way she sounded. KIRK: I feel less confident. I'm aware of how people might perceive me. So I'm a little more shy. I don't approach people like I used to. VEDANTAM: Jackie believes the change in her voice has led to a dramatic change in her personality. For much of her life, her voice was a manifestation of her confidence. KIRK: I used to go to clubs quite a bit, you know? But, you know, when you have a normal voice, you can still talk to people in those environments where it's kind of loud and noisy, or bars to meet friends or to flirt, (laughter), like I like doing. But, you know, those places now, you know, I don't really go to anymore. VEDANTAM: Jackie, a woman who once described herself as carefree and outgoing who took pride in her ability to flirt, became withdrawn, reserved. KIRK: You know, I have tons of scars all over my body, and that plays on my confidence as well. But in public life, people can't see those scars. And I feel like my voice is that, you know, that scar they can hear, you know? They know something's wrong and that they know, oh, maybe she's weak, maybe she's sick, just by hearing my voice. It's this signal. VEDANTAM: Our voices communicate so much more than mere information. They communicate our feelings, our temperament, our identity. When we come back - how scientists are weaving this insight into custom-built voices. MAEVE FLACK: I can't wait for my friends to hear my new voice. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Scientists have been trying for more than two centuries to analyze the human voice, decode its components and recreate it. An early success came from a man named Homer Dudley. He developed an organ-like machine that he called the voder. It worked using special keys and a foot pedal and was capable of creating about 20 different electronic buzzes and sounds. When those sounds were combined, they formed words. The voder fascinated people at the 1939 World's Fair in New York. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Well, we've heard the voder make a word. And by combining words, of course, we got a sentence. For example, Helen, will you have the voder say, she saw me? VODER-GENERATED VOICE: She saw me. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: That sounded awfully flat. How about a little expression? Say the sentence in answer to these questions. Who saw you? VODER-GENERATED VOICE: She saw me. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Whom did she see? VODER-GENERATED VOICE: She saw me. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Well, did she see you or hear you? VODER-GENERATED VOICE: She saw me. VEDANTAM: The voder was an early example of electronic speech, but it was cumbersome to operate and required special training. Over the next 40 years, speech scientists continued studying the components of the human voice. They eventually developed methods to mathematically map the acoustic patterns and phonetic properties of natural speech - vowels, syllable constructions, consonants. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #2: Welcome to the Stockholm speech communication seminar. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #3: Hello, I (unintelligible) machine. Welcome to Mid-Manhattan Library. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #4: (Singing) A, B, C, D, E, F, G. . . COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #5: To be or not to be, that is the question. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #6: I can read stories and speak them aloud. I do not understand what the words mean when I read them. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #7: This is such a beautiful (unintelligible). You are listening to the voice of a machine. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #4: (Singing) When we know our ABC's. VEDANTAM: By the '80s, speech synthesis was no longer the stuff of science demonstrations at shows and fairs. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #8: Text-to-speech systems are beginning to be applied in many ways, including aids for the handicapped, medical aids and teaching devices. The first kind of aid to be considered as a talking aid for the vocally handicapped. VEDANTAM: The research of Dennis Klatt at MIT paved the way for the voices we might be familiar with today, many of them used in assistive communication devices. BETTY: I am beautiful Betty, the standard female voice. HARRY: I am huge Harry, a very large person with a deep voice. PAUL: I am the standard male voice, perfect Paul. VEDANTAM: This last one, by the way, became famous after Stephen Hawking adopted it. Speech technology has come a long way in the years since Homer Dudley unveiled the voder, but in many ways, synthetic voices still sounded synthetic. They didn't convey all the information that's packed into the human voice. PATEL: Voice is identity, right? Voice is about who you are. Our voice signals how old we are. Our voice signals our gender. Our voice signals, you know, things about our personality. VEDANTAM: Rupal Patel is a speech scientist at Northeastern University. Perhaps more than many people, she has thought a lot about the human voice. When she misses her mother, for instance, Rupal has a special technique to evoke her presence. PATEL: That's right. My parents now live in LA and I live here in Boston. And oftentimes, I find myself imitating my mom. You know, I'll say, oh, beti (ph) how are you today, you know, or something like that. I'll imitate her the way she might say something. I might say that the same way to my daughter or something like that. But I - what I'm evoking is my mother's voice, primarily, to feel the closeness of her here. VEDANTAM: In 2002, Rupal took these ideas with her to Denmark where she was scheduled to speak at a conference for researchers and patients. PATEL: I was presenting some of my early work showing that individuals with very severe speech disorder still have the ability to make sound, and those sounds have some communicative content in them, some information that could be used. VEDANTAM: After her presentation, she walked out to the exhibit hall, and that's where she noticed something. Lots of people were using devices that produced synthetic voices. What was odd was that many of the voices didn't seem to match the people using them. PATEL: And at that point back in 2002, we had very limited synthetic voice of options available. And so, you - I heard a little girl, or a young girl, using a device to talk with an adult male voice and and having a conversation with another person, a middle-aged man, who also was using the same voice. And so they're using different devices, but their voices were identical. VEDANTAM: She had just presented on the idea that our individual voices carry something unique about us. So why was this not reflected in these synthetic voices? PATEL: Why are we giving them the same black box to speak through? There's got to be something that we can do that we can harness the quality of the voices that they have and imprint those or use that to give them a prosthetic voice that somehow reflects who they are and not just the same voice for everyone. VEDANTAM: Could a synthetic voice capture the richness of natural human speech? Rupal launched a company to answer this question. It's called VocaliD, and it uses machine learning and other artificial intelligence technologies to create personalized voices. PATEL: So what synthetic speech is is taking recordings of anyone and then taking those recordings and building a model of the voice quality of the annunciation abilities, right? You aren't necessarily analyzing it from a top down, saying, well, this person has a high-pitched voice or this person has a low-pitched voice. You're taking the recordings as basically the raw ingredients to feed to a machine-learning algorithm or set of algorithms, really. And those are - they're learning the patterns of the clarity of the person's S, the - you know, how that sound is changed in the different phonetic environments, the voice qualities aspects of - you know, all of these are learned by the machine. It's really re-emulating the human voice by a machine. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: In other words, the idea is to build a model of how a person sounds. To do so, you use a vast range of examples of that person's speech. Then you use the model to produce spoken language that incorporates all the idiosyncrasies and texture of that person's voice. One of Rupal's early clients was a young girl, Maeve Flack. PATEL: Maeve was born with cerebral palsy. She's in a beautiful family where she has two other older sisters. VEDANTAM: Rupal's goal was to give Maeve her own unique synthetic voice, one that could express not just her words but her identity. The first step was to record her. MAEVE: (Unintelligible) (Laughter). PATEL: So those sounds were the kinds of sounds that are unique to Maeve. Those are the sounds that she makes where if - you know, when she's in a classroom with several other kids who also have communication disabilities, when she makes that sound, you know it's Maeve speaking. So we harnessed those sounds of Maeve's to create her unique voice for her. VEDANTAM: Then Rupal turned to Maeve's older sisters, Erin and Meghan, who volunteered to record their voices so they could be blended with Maeve's. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Ice cream is my guilty pleasure. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: That man ran fast. VEDANTAM: Erin and Meghan read hundreds of sentences and phrases and uploaded them to a website for Rupal. Like a painter mixing a palette, Rupal took elements of Maeve's voice and mixed them with those of her sisters and other vocal donors to create what she calls a bespoke voice. MAEVE: I can't wait for my friends to hear my new voice. My parents are really happy I'm not addicted to Fortnite. I want to meet Taylor Swift. PATEL: So we're hearing, you know, Maeve at this age in terms of her sound as well as her siblings' recordings being combined and being produced through this speech synthesis engine. VEDANTAM: It's possible that Maeve may decide as she gets older that her voice needs to age with her. She'll need a new bespoke voice at that point. The same technology can also be used to preserve a person's existing voice. Sometimes this is done when a person faces the prospect of losing his voice. PATEL: These could be individuals who are losing their voice to degenerative conditions - so slowly their voice is changing - such as ALS or Parkinson's disease and then those who the trauma is actually far more pronounced for individuals with something like head and neck cancer where they learn that they're going to have their voice box removed within a couple of weeks. VEDANTAM: Lonnie Blanchard confronted this traumatic news in 2018. Doctors had diagnosed him with cancer and said surgery was the only option. Lonnie had to have his tongue removed. Here he is speaking to the BBC. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BLANCHARD: Now that I know I'm going to lose my voice, I got to get some things down on a personal recorder to get what I would normally say to my wife and kids. But every time I go to do that, I draw a blank. VEDANTAM: By the time Lonnie started working with Rupal, he only had a few weeks to back his voice. PATEL: We helped him get set up in terms of the microphone he would need, and things like that. VEDANTAM: Rupal walked with Lonnie to build a database of sound samples before his surgery. He recorded sentences that gave Rupal and her colleagues the different kinds of sounds they would need to build a new voice. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BLANCHARD: I wish we could get acquainted. I'm going to be a teacher when I grow up. VEDANTAM: After Lonnie banked his voice, Rupal use the recordings to create a personalized voice for him. The difference between his voice and Maeve's voice is that Rupal didn't need to blend voices from donors. Lonnie was his own donor. PATEL: Those voice samples then are used, are cleaned up and annotated by machine, actually, and then used to feed into the algorithms we have to create the synthetic voice. VEDANTAM: Similar to Maeve, Lonnie uses an assistive device - in his case, an iPad. He can type out what he wants to say and hear his voice speaking to his family. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BLANCHARD: Once you close your eyes and let your mind relax, it doesn't take long to escape to the beautiful beach. PATEL: It's really empowering. It's continued to be a way that he can connect to family members and feel that part of him is not fully lost. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: While most of us will never have the experience of losing our voices and having to obtain synthetic voices as replacements, increasingly, many of us are coming into contact with these voices. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Hey, Siri. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Hey, Google. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: Alexa? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: How many ounces are in a cup? ALEXA: One cup is 8 eight fluid ounces. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: OK, Google. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Hey, Siri. Set a timer. SIRI: For how long? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Fifty-six minutes. SIRI: OK. ALEXA: Sure. SIRI: Fifty-six minutes, starting now. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: Alexa? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Hey, Google? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: Can you play music? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Play some jazz. SIRI: Here's a station you might like. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Synthetic voices are already changing our lives, and it's likely we're going to become even more reliant on them. In May 2018, Google revealed a new program it was working on. CEO Sundar Pichai presented it to an audience of software developers. The technology is called Google Duplex. It allows you to make a restaurant reservation through a voice assistant. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED RESTAURANT HOST: How may I help you? GOOGLE DUPLEX: Hi. I'd like to reserve a table for Wednesday the 7. UNIDENTIFIED RESTAURANT HOST: For seven people? GOOGLE DUPLEX: It's for four people. UNIDENTIFIED RESTAURANT HOST: Four people? When? Today? Tonight? GOOGLE DUPLEX: Wednesday at 6 p. m. UNIDENTIFIED RESTAURANT HOST: Actually, we reserve for upwards five people. For four people, you can come. GOOGLE DUPLEX: How long is the wait, usually, to be seated? UNIDENTIFIED RESTAURANT HOST: For when? Tomorrow, or a weekday, or. . . GOOGLE DUPLEX: For next Wednesday, the 7. UNIDENTIFIED RESTAURANT HOST: No. It's not too busy. You can come for four people. OK? GOOGLE DUPLEX: Oh - I gotcha. Thanks. UNIDENTIFIED RESTAURANT HOST: Bye-bye. (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)VEDANTAM: The audience is laughing and applauding because the man making the call isn't a man but a machine. PATEL: It didn't seem like it was a robotic voice. The robotic voices we're used to are the voices like when you are in a parking garage and you hear the, you know, please place your ticket with the stripe facing to the right - very, very canned sort of speech. This was far more sophisticated and much more like you and I talk, with hesitations and pauses, and ums and ahs. You think it's a human on the other end. VEDANTAM: Now, of course, one of the things about that voice that Google had is that it did seem like a convincing voice, but if you need to convince me that that voice is not just a human voice but a particular human's voice, you need to convince me now this is not just anyone calling for a restaurant reservation, but it's Barack Obama calling for a restaurant reservation. Presumably, now the bar is much, much higher. PATEL: That's right. It is. Barack Obama, though, does have a ton on his audio, (laughter), on the Internet. And there's a lot more audio to make, you know, his voice than there is my voice, for example. And so yeah. But it's absolutely possible to learn. And if you have long enough, you can learn anybody's voice. And if you have enough data. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: It's not hard to see how bad actors could misuse this, create havoc in people's lives, trouble at companies, political misinformation. PATEL: That's absolutely - I mean, we're seeing deep fakes in video. We've seen, you know, President Obama's face with - being manipulated and the audio coming out. You know, people creating these fake media in video, and you're also seeing it audio. That's exactly why the security aspects of what we're doing are trying to detect is that fake audio, or is that real? Is part of that fake audio or is part of that real, right? So it is - this isn't completely sci fi. It isn't so far away. It isn't necessarily 20 - you know, 2028. It's probably 2020. So we've got to get our defenses up in terms of questioning where that - the authenticity of audio just as we do video. VEDANTAM: In 2017, a Canadian company called Lyrebird showed how audio deepfakes might work in politics. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #1: (As Donald Trump) This is huge. They can make us say anything now - really anything. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #9: (As Barack Obama) The good news is that they will offer the technology to anyone. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #1: (As Donald Trump) This is huge. How does their technology work? COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #10: (As Hillary Clinton) Hey, guys, I think that they use deep learning and artificial neural networks. VEDANTAM: By 2019, deepfake audio technology had gotten even better. Shortly after critics panned the final season of \"Game Of Thrones,\" a YouTube channel called Eating Things With Famous People put out this tongue-in-cheek video showing the supposed remorse of the lead character, Jon Snow. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO, \"BREAKING: JON SNOW FINALLY APOLOGIZED FOR SEASON 8\")COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #11: (As Jon Snow) It's time for some apologies. I'm sorry we wasted your time. I'm sorry we didn't learn anything from the ending of \"Lost. \" I have more lines in this video than I had in the last season. I'm sorry we wrote this in, like, six days or something. Now, let us burn the script of Season 8 and just forget it forever. VEDANTAM: Spoofing a TV show is one thing, but imagine such high-quality deepfakes occurring in a more high-stakes setting. Voices are increasingly being used by financial institutions to authenticate the identities of consumers. Recently, Rupal worked with a bank to assess how vulnerable it was to vocal hacking. PATEL: We tested their authentication system by creating synthetic samples or synthetic voices of particular individuals who are enrolled in their authentication system. And we tried to test those voices against the system to see if we could get through with the synthetic voices. And we were not able to do that for every single voice, but we were able to do it for some voices. And so it just starts to show that there is a vulnerability in this technology. VEDANTAM: So how would you guard against it? PATEL: Well, there are many ways to guard against it. One is you can classify the difference between is the audio signal I'm listening to - is it synthetic or is it human? As the synthetic voices become better and better sounding, that will be a more difficult decision to make. And it is something that if we can proactively solve, I think - or at least start to address - we're going to be way ahead of the curve than if we're trying to clean up our mess after the fact. VEDANTAM: Despite the potential risks of these new technologies, Rupal is also optimistic. Voice synthesis tools have the potential to allow people to craft the voice they hear on the outside so that it matches the identity they feel on the inside. PATEL: Ideally, in the future, these decisions are made by the end user themselves. Like, oh, I actually want that to be - sound a little breathier. I'd love that to sound a little bit more confident. And, I mean, how does that translate to the acoustics? We don't quite know yet, but that's actually I think where - when we can finally give the control of what the voice sounds like to the individual, I mean, that's the Holy Grail. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)VODER-GENERATED VOICE: She saw me. She saw me. She saw me. She saw me. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #2: Hello. I am (unintelligible) machine. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #6: You are listening to the voice of a machine. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #3: (Singing) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K. . . COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #7: The first kind of aid to be considered as a talking aid for the vocally handicapped. BETTY: I am beautiful Betty, the standard female voice. PAUL: I am the standard male voice, perfect Paul. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #12: I was sad because there was no ice cream in the freezer. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #13: The sky is clear and the stars are twinkling. MAEVE: I can't wait for my friends to hear my new voice. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #3: (Singing) When we know our ABC's. ALEXA: Once cup is eight fluid ounces. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #14: You are listening to a machine. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #1: (As Donald Trump) This is huge. How does their technology work? COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #10: (As Hillary Clinton) Hey, guys, I think that they use deep learning and artificial neural networks. GOOGLE DUPLEX: Hi. I'd like to reserve a table for Wednesday the 7. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This week's show was produced by Thomas Lu. It was edited by Tara Boyle and Rhaina Cohen. Our team includes Parth Shah, Jenny Schmidt and Laura Kwerel. Special thanks to Brent Baughman, Greg Sauer and Kavon Jones (ph). (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Our unsung hero this week is Rebecca Ralph (ph). She's part of NPR's team looking at our changing interactions with smart speakers. She helped us record some of the smart devices you heard in this week's episode. Thanks, Rebecca. If you liked this episode, please share it with a friend. We're always looking for new people to discover HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam, and this is NPR. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST:  This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. At some point in our lives, many of us realize that the way we hear our own voice isn't the way others hear our voice. Shay (ph) had that realization as a child helping out at the family business, a deli in south West Virginia. SHAY: We did a lot of business with the deli, a lot of call-in orders, and I had to answer the phone with the name of the business. VEDANTAM: Often when the phone rang, the same thing happened over and over again. SHAY: I vividly remember always being confused for my mother. They would always say, hey Judy (ph), you know, and either start into their questions or whatever they were looking to speak to my mother about. VEDANTAM: This case of mistaken identity became a running joke. SHAY: You know, it was ha-ha, they thought that he was Judy. VEDANTAM: Shay didn't correct the callers. That's because Shay didn't mind being mistaken for Judy. SHAY: It was just comforting to me because it felt natural. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Shay was raised as a boy. But now, decades later, Shay identifies as a transgender woman. We're not using her legal name at her request because it's a man's name. Shay's experience at the deli became a template for the rest of her life. She listened to her voice, and she listened to the way others heard her voice. There was always a gap between the two. She first tried to sound more masculine to fit in with the way the world saw her. SHAY: So I would consciously make an effort to try to talk a little deeper. It was - you know, I practiced it. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ROADHOUSE BLUES\") THE DOORS: (Singing) And I woke up in morning, I got myself a beer. VEDANTAM: One way she practiced was to sing along with The Doors, Tool and Nine Inch Nails. SHAY: I tended to sort of go towards heavier music. You know, raspy, deep - yelling, almost - voices. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ROADHOUSE BLUES\") THE DOORS: (Singing) Let it roll all night long. VEDANTAM: Sounding more masculine became second nature. But it wore on her. SHAY: My entire life, I have been playing the role of a boy. And it is exhausting. It truly is. VEDANTAM: Years and years passed like this. A divorce, a second wife, two kids and a cancer scare later, Shay began to reconsider how she wanted to sound. Instead of trying to sound more masculine, she now started to try to sound more feminine. SHAY: Even prior to accepting that I was trans before I could put a label on what I was, I consciously made an effort to not sound as masculine, and that started in my early 30s. VEDANTAM: Once again, she used music as a way to practice. (SOUNDBITE OF BRITNEY SPEARS SONG, \"OOPS! . . . I DID IT AGAIN\") SHAY: I would always sing in the car alone. And I would attempt Britney Spears. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"OOPS! . . . I DID IT AGAIN\") BRITNEY SPEARS: (Singing) I think I did it again. I made you believe we're more than just friends. Baby. SHAY: It seems silly, but I would, when I'm singing in the car, I would sort of turn my head towards my driver's side window. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"OOPS! . . . I DID IT AGAIN\") SPEARS: (Singing) 'Cause to lose all my senses. SHAY: . . . Because it would reflect the sound back to me a little more loudly so that I could hear the pitch and tone of my voice. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"OOPS! . . . I DID IT AGAIN\") SPEARS: (Singing) Oops. I did it again. I played with your heart. SHAY: And I would try to make my voice sound at a higher pitch without it sounding like I was trying. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"OOPS! . . . I DID IT AGAIN\") SPEARS: (Singing) Love, and I'm sent from above. I'm not that innocent. VEDANTAM: What did you hear? Did you hear the voice that you wanted to hear? SHAY: No. No. I've never - I don't know that I have ever actually been able to hear the same voice that I hear come from me. VEDANTAM: Shay has spent a lifetime being dissatisfied with the way she sounds. She viscerally knows something the rest of us often forget - our voices shape who we are. They shape how other people think of us. (SOUNDBITE OF CROSSTALK) VEDANTAM: This week on HIDDEN BRAIN, we look at the relationship between our voices and our identities. RUPAL PATEL: Voice is about who you are. Our voice signals things about our personality. VEDANTAM: Plus how technology might help people with vocal impairments find voices that reflect who they are. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LONNIE BLANCHARD: Once you close your eyes and let your mind relax, it doesn't take long to escape to the beautiful beach. VEDANTAM: . . . And the ethical quandaries that arise when we can create personalized, customized voices. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #1: (As Donald Trump) This is huge. They can make us say anything now - really, anything. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Jackie Kirk (ph) used to love the sound of her voice. She spent her 20s in San Francisco. And like many young people living in the big city, she enjoyed going out with her friends. She danced to electronic music at clubs and drank at bars. She was outgoing, and she was a flirt. JACKIE KIRK: I have to admit I've always enjoyed flirting. (Laughter). And so I was quite the flirter. (Laughter). It was sort of a fun activity to help pass the day - you know, doing something mundane, you know, at work. VEDANTAM: For Jackie, flirting was also a demonstration of her confidence. KIRK: It reinforces my own identity, how I felt about myself - fun, I'm somebody that people are attracted to, not just physically or sexually, but a person who people like. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Jackie liked to be liked. She liked being someone people wanted to be around. When she thinks about who she was back then she refers to that person as Voice One Jackie. KIRK: Voice One Jackie (laughter) was really fun-loving, always joking, pretty carefree. VEDANTAM: For years, Jackie had been doing backpacking trips with her then-boyfriend. KIRK: All of our gear on our back. Fifty pounds, 60 pounds, et cetera. Even carrying bottles of wine, (laughter), you know, in the backpack. VEDANTAM: She'd been doing these backpacking trips for several years. But during a trip to a national forest in California, Jackie came up short. KIRK: I couldn't go one step further. I - you know, and being young, you think, you know, what could it be? There's nothing wrong with me. I'm 20, whatever, 20-something years old. And I notice I'm getting really short of breath, and it was a real struggle. Yeah. I finally made it, of course, but it was really slow and a real struggle to make it back. VEDANTAM: Hiking became too taxing for her so she cut back and switched to ballet. But one day during a series of releves, a more aerobically challenging dance move, Jackie felt lightheaded and dizzy. It was serious. KIRK: I had a seizure. And, you know, all of the medical follow-up led me to discover that I had a lung disease. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: She was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension. It's a rare, progressive disease where the blood vessels in the lungs shrink and oxygen is not distributed properly. KIRK: There's no cure for it except for a lung transplant. VEDANTAM: In 2008, at 32, Jackie received a double lung transplant. The surgery was successful. Within weeks, she was out of the hospital and back in the dance studio. In 2010, she left San Francisco to explore Latin America and Europe, but her body began to reject her new lungs. Before long, Jackie was back in the hospital, this time in Switzerland, waiting for another lung transplant. KIRK: I had the surgery in January of 2013, and I was asleep still for another month and a half. VEDANTAM: When she woke up, she found her surgery had been successful, except for one very important thing. KIRK: I couldn't speak. I couldn't speak. VEDANTAM: During the operation, the medical staff had used a ventilator to help her breathe. KIRK: So I was intubated. That means they basically have a tube that they put inside your mouth, and it goes down your throat. And they send that down into your lungs. And during this intubation, the tube was rigid enough to cause some damage to my vocal cords. VEDANTAM: Jackie began speech therapy, and within a few weeks she slowly regained the ability to speak. But the voice that came out of her mouth, it wasn't her voice. KIRK: My voice changed. Its raspier. It's broken a bit. VEDANTAM: Ever since, speaking has been hard work. KIRK: Yeah. I really have to push my - I feel it. It's actually a physical effort. Like, I'm actually squeezing the vocal cords as hard as I can to make the loudest sound possible to get to be heard. (Laughter). And it's very tiring. VEDANTAM: The harder it became to produce sound, the more self-conscious she became about the way she sounded. KIRK: I feel less confident. I'm aware of how people might perceive me. So I'm a little more shy. I don't approach people like I used to. VEDANTAM: Jackie believes the change in her voice has led to a dramatic change in her personality. For much of her life, her voice was a manifestation of her confidence. KIRK: I used to go to clubs quite a bit, you know? But, you know, when you have a normal voice, you can still talk to people in those environments where it's kind of loud and noisy, or bars to meet friends or to flirt, (laughter), like I like doing. But, you know, those places now, you know, I don't really go to anymore. VEDANTAM: Jackie, a woman who once described herself as carefree and outgoing who took pride in her ability to flirt, became withdrawn, reserved. KIRK: You know, I have tons of scars all over my body, and that plays on my confidence as well. But in public life, people can't see those scars. And I feel like my voice is that, you know, that scar they can hear, you know? They know something's wrong and that they know, oh, maybe she's weak, maybe she's sick, just by hearing my voice. It's this signal. VEDANTAM: Our voices communicate so much more than mere information. They communicate our feelings, our temperament, our identity. When we come back - how scientists are weaving this insight into custom-built voices. MAEVE FLACK: I can't wait for my friends to hear my new voice. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Scientists have been trying for more than two centuries to analyze the human voice, decode its components and recreate it. An early success came from a man named Homer Dudley. He developed an organ-like machine that he called the voder. It worked using special keys and a foot pedal and was capable of creating about 20 different electronic buzzes and sounds. When those sounds were combined, they formed words. The voder fascinated people at the 1939 World's Fair in New York. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Well, we've heard the voder make a word. And by combining words, of course, we got a sentence. For example, Helen, will you have the voder say, she saw me? VODER-GENERATED VOICE: She saw me. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: That sounded awfully flat. How about a little expression? Say the sentence in answer to these questions. Who saw you? VODER-GENERATED VOICE: She saw me. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Whom did she see? VODER-GENERATED VOICE: She saw me. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Well, did she see you or hear you? VODER-GENERATED VOICE: She saw me. VEDANTAM: The voder was an early example of electronic speech, but it was cumbersome to operate and required special training. Over the next 40 years, speech scientists continued studying the components of the human voice. They eventually developed methods to mathematically map the acoustic patterns and phonetic properties of natural speech - vowels, syllable constructions, consonants. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #2: Welcome to the Stockholm speech communication seminar. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #3: Hello, I (unintelligible) machine. Welcome to Mid-Manhattan Library. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #4: (Singing) A, B, C, D, E, F, G. . . COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #5: To be or not to be, that is the question. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #6: I can read stories and speak them aloud. I do not understand what the words mean when I read them. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #7: This is such a beautiful (unintelligible). You are listening to the voice of a machine. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #4: (Singing) When we know our ABC's. VEDANTAM: By the '80s, speech synthesis was no longer the stuff of science demonstrations at shows and fairs. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #8: Text-to-speech systems are beginning to be applied in many ways, including aids for the handicapped, medical aids and teaching devices. The first kind of aid to be considered as a talking aid for the vocally handicapped. VEDANTAM: The research of Dennis Klatt at MIT paved the way for the voices we might be familiar with today, many of them used in assistive communication devices. BETTY: I am beautiful Betty, the standard female voice. HARRY: I am huge Harry, a very large person with a deep voice. PAUL: I am the standard male voice, perfect Paul. VEDANTAM: This last one, by the way, became famous after Stephen Hawking adopted it. Speech technology has come a long way in the years since Homer Dudley unveiled the voder, but in many ways, synthetic voices still sounded synthetic. They didn't convey all the information that's packed into the human voice. PATEL: Voice is identity, right? Voice is about who you are. Our voice signals how old we are. Our voice signals our gender. Our voice signals, you know, things about our personality. VEDANTAM: Rupal Patel is a speech scientist at Northeastern University. Perhaps more than many people, she has thought a lot about the human voice. When she misses her mother, for instance, Rupal has a special technique to evoke her presence. PATEL: That's right. My parents now live in LA and I live here in Boston. And oftentimes, I find myself imitating my mom. You know, I'll say, oh, beti (ph) how are you today, you know, or something like that. I'll imitate her the way she might say something. I might say that the same way to my daughter or something like that. But I - what I'm evoking is my mother's voice, primarily, to feel the closeness of her here. VEDANTAM: In 2002, Rupal took these ideas with her to Denmark where she was scheduled to speak at a conference for researchers and patients. PATEL: I was presenting some of my early work showing that individuals with very severe speech disorder still have the ability to make sound, and those sounds have some communicative content in them, some information that could be used. VEDANTAM: After her presentation, she walked out to the exhibit hall, and that's where she noticed something. Lots of people were using devices that produced synthetic voices. What was odd was that many of the voices didn't seem to match the people using them. PATEL: And at that point back in 2002, we had very limited synthetic voice of options available. And so, you - I heard a little girl, or a young girl, using a device to talk with an adult male voice and and having a conversation with another person, a middle-aged man, who also was using the same voice. And so they're using different devices, but their voices were identical. VEDANTAM: She had just presented on the idea that our individual voices carry something unique about us. So why was this not reflected in these synthetic voices? PATEL: Why are we giving them the same black box to speak through? There's got to be something that we can do that we can harness the quality of the voices that they have and imprint those or use that to give them a prosthetic voice that somehow reflects who they are and not just the same voice for everyone. VEDANTAM: Could a synthetic voice capture the richness of natural human speech? Rupal launched a company to answer this question. It's called VocaliD, and it uses machine learning and other artificial intelligence technologies to create personalized voices. PATEL: So what synthetic speech is is taking recordings of anyone and then taking those recordings and building a model of the voice quality of the annunciation abilities, right? You aren't necessarily analyzing it from a top down, saying, well, this person has a high-pitched voice or this person has a low-pitched voice. You're taking the recordings as basically the raw ingredients to feed to a machine-learning algorithm or set of algorithms, really. And those are - they're learning the patterns of the clarity of the person's S, the - you know, how that sound is changed in the different phonetic environments, the voice qualities aspects of - you know, all of these are learned by the machine. It's really re-emulating the human voice by a machine. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: In other words, the idea is to build a model of how a person sounds. To do so, you use a vast range of examples of that person's speech. Then you use the model to produce spoken language that incorporates all the idiosyncrasies and texture of that person's voice. One of Rupal's early clients was a young girl, Maeve Flack. PATEL: Maeve was born with cerebral palsy. She's in a beautiful family where she has two other older sisters. VEDANTAM: Rupal's goal was to give Maeve her own unique synthetic voice, one that could express not just her words but her identity. The first step was to record her. MAEVE: (Unintelligible) (Laughter). PATEL: So those sounds were the kinds of sounds that are unique to Maeve. Those are the sounds that she makes where if - you know, when she's in a classroom with several other kids who also have communication disabilities, when she makes that sound, you know it's Maeve speaking. So we harnessed those sounds of Maeve's to create her unique voice for her. VEDANTAM: Then Rupal turned to Maeve's older sisters, Erin and Meghan, who volunteered to record their voices so they could be blended with Maeve's. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Ice cream is my guilty pleasure. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: That man ran fast. VEDANTAM: Erin and Meghan read hundreds of sentences and phrases and uploaded them to a website for Rupal. Like a painter mixing a palette, Rupal took elements of Maeve's voice and mixed them with those of her sisters and other vocal donors to create what she calls a bespoke voice. MAEVE: I can't wait for my friends to hear my new voice. My parents are really happy I'm not addicted to Fortnite. I want to meet Taylor Swift. PATEL: So we're hearing, you know, Maeve at this age in terms of her sound as well as her siblings' recordings being combined and being produced through this speech synthesis engine. VEDANTAM: It's possible that Maeve may decide as she gets older that her voice needs to age with her. She'll need a new bespoke voice at that point. The same technology can also be used to preserve a person's existing voice. Sometimes this is done when a person faces the prospect of losing his voice. PATEL: These could be individuals who are losing their voice to degenerative conditions - so slowly their voice is changing - such as ALS or Parkinson's disease and then those who the trauma is actually far more pronounced for individuals with something like head and neck cancer where they learn that they're going to have their voice box removed within a couple of weeks. VEDANTAM: Lonnie Blanchard confronted this traumatic news in 2018. Doctors had diagnosed him with cancer and said surgery was the only option. Lonnie had to have his tongue removed. Here he is speaking to the BBC. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BLANCHARD: Now that I know I'm going to lose my voice, I got to get some things down on a personal recorder to get what I would normally say to my wife and kids. But every time I go to do that, I draw a blank. VEDANTAM: By the time Lonnie started working with Rupal, he only had a few weeks to back his voice. PATEL: We helped him get set up in terms of the microphone he would need, and things like that. VEDANTAM: Rupal walked with Lonnie to build a database of sound samples before his surgery. He recorded sentences that gave Rupal and her colleagues the different kinds of sounds they would need to build a new voice. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BLANCHARD: I wish we could get acquainted. I'm going to be a teacher when I grow up. VEDANTAM: After Lonnie banked his voice, Rupal use the recordings to create a personalized voice for him. The difference between his voice and Maeve's voice is that Rupal didn't need to blend voices from donors. Lonnie was his own donor. PATEL: Those voice samples then are used, are cleaned up and annotated by machine, actually, and then used to feed into the algorithms we have to create the synthetic voice. VEDANTAM: Similar to Maeve, Lonnie uses an assistive device - in his case, an iPad. He can type out what he wants to say and hear his voice speaking to his family. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BLANCHARD: Once you close your eyes and let your mind relax, it doesn't take long to escape to the beautiful beach. PATEL: It's really empowering. It's continued to be a way that he can connect to family members and feel that part of him is not fully lost. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: While most of us will never have the experience of losing our voices and having to obtain synthetic voices as replacements, increasingly, many of us are coming into contact with these voices. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Hey, Siri. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Hey, Google. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: Alexa? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: How many ounces are in a cup? ALEXA: One cup is 8 eight fluid ounces. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: OK, Google. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Hey, Siri. Set a timer. SIRI: For how long? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Fifty-six minutes. SIRI: OK. ALEXA: Sure. SIRI: Fifty-six minutes, starting now. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: Alexa? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Hey, Google? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: Can you play music? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Play some jazz. SIRI: Here's a station you might like. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Synthetic voices are already changing our lives, and it's likely we're going to become even more reliant on them. In May 2018, Google revealed a new program it was working on. CEO Sundar Pichai presented it to an audience of software developers. The technology is called Google Duplex. It allows you to make a restaurant reservation through a voice assistant. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED RESTAURANT HOST: How may I help you? GOOGLE DUPLEX: Hi. I'd like to reserve a table for Wednesday the 7. UNIDENTIFIED RESTAURANT HOST: For seven people? GOOGLE DUPLEX: It's for four people. UNIDENTIFIED RESTAURANT HOST: Four people? When? Today? Tonight? GOOGLE DUPLEX: Wednesday at 6 p. m. UNIDENTIFIED RESTAURANT HOST: Actually, we reserve for upwards five people. For four people, you can come. GOOGLE DUPLEX: How long is the wait, usually, to be seated? UNIDENTIFIED RESTAURANT HOST: For when? Tomorrow, or a weekday, or. . . GOOGLE DUPLEX: For next Wednesday, the 7. UNIDENTIFIED RESTAURANT HOST: No. It's not too busy. You can come for four people. OK? GOOGLE DUPLEX: Oh - I gotcha. Thanks. UNIDENTIFIED RESTAURANT HOST: Bye-bye. (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE) VEDANTAM: The audience is laughing and applauding because the man making the call isn't a man but a machine. PATEL: It didn't seem like it was a robotic voice. The robotic voices we're used to are the voices like when you are in a parking garage and you hear the, you know, please place your ticket with the stripe facing to the right - very, very canned sort of speech. This was far more sophisticated and much more like you and I talk, with hesitations and pauses, and ums and ahs. You think it's a human on the other end. VEDANTAM: Now, of course, one of the things about that voice that Google had is that it did seem like a convincing voice, but if you need to convince me that that voice is not just a human voice but a particular human's voice, you need to convince me now this is not just anyone calling for a restaurant reservation, but it's Barack Obama calling for a restaurant reservation. Presumably, now the bar is much, much higher. PATEL: That's right. It is. Barack Obama, though, does have a ton on his audio, (laughter), on the Internet. And there's a lot more audio to make, you know, his voice than there is my voice, for example. And so yeah. But it's absolutely possible to learn. And if you have long enough, you can learn anybody's voice. And if you have enough data. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: It's not hard to see how bad actors could misuse this, create havoc in people's lives, trouble at companies, political misinformation. PATEL: That's absolutely - I mean, we're seeing deep fakes in video. We've seen, you know, President Obama's face with - being manipulated and the audio coming out. You know, people creating these fake media in video, and you're also seeing it audio. That's exactly why the security aspects of what we're doing are trying to detect is that fake audio, or is that real? Is part of that fake audio or is part of that real, right? So it is - this isn't completely sci fi. It isn't so far away. It isn't necessarily 20 - you know, 2028. It's probably 2020. So we've got to get our defenses up in terms of questioning where that - the authenticity of audio just as we do video. VEDANTAM: In 2017, a Canadian company called Lyrebird showed how audio deepfakes might work in politics. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #1: (As Donald Trump) This is huge. They can make us say anything now - really anything. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #9: (As Barack Obama) The good news is that they will offer the technology to anyone. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #1: (As Donald Trump) This is huge. How does their technology work? COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #10: (As Hillary Clinton) Hey, guys, I think that they use deep learning and artificial neural networks. VEDANTAM: By 2019, deepfake audio technology had gotten even better. Shortly after critics panned the final season of \"Game Of Thrones,\" a YouTube channel called Eating Things With Famous People put out this tongue-in-cheek video showing the supposed remorse of the lead character, Jon Snow. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO, \"BREAKING: JON SNOW FINALLY APOLOGIZED FOR SEASON 8\") COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #11: (As Jon Snow) It's time for some apologies. I'm sorry we wasted your time. I'm sorry we didn't learn anything from the ending of \"Lost. \" I have more lines in this video than I had in the last season. I'm sorry we wrote this in, like, six days or something. Now, let us burn the script of Season 8 and just forget it forever. VEDANTAM: Spoofing a TV show is one thing, but imagine such high-quality deepfakes occurring in a more high-stakes setting. Voices are increasingly being used by financial institutions to authenticate the identities of consumers. Recently, Rupal worked with a bank to assess how vulnerable it was to vocal hacking. PATEL: We tested their authentication system by creating synthetic samples or synthetic voices of particular individuals who are enrolled in their authentication system. And we tried to test those voices against the system to see if we could get through with the synthetic voices. And we were not able to do that for every single voice, but we were able to do it for some voices. And so it just starts to show that there is a vulnerability in this technology. VEDANTAM: So how would you guard against it? PATEL: Well, there are many ways to guard against it. One is you can classify the difference between is the audio signal I'm listening to - is it synthetic or is it human? As the synthetic voices become better and better sounding, that will be a more difficult decision to make. And it is something that if we can proactively solve, I think - or at least start to address - we're going to be way ahead of the curve than if we're trying to clean up our mess after the fact. VEDANTAM: Despite the potential risks of these new technologies, Rupal is also optimistic. Voice synthesis tools have the potential to allow people to craft the voice they hear on the outside so that it matches the identity they feel on the inside. PATEL: Ideally, in the future, these decisions are made by the end user themselves. Like, oh, I actually want that to be - sound a little breathier. I'd love that to sound a little bit more confident. And, I mean, how does that translate to the acoustics? We don't quite know yet, but that's actually I think where - when we can finally give the control of what the voice sounds like to the individual, I mean, that's the Holy Grail. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) VODER-GENERATED VOICE: She saw me. She saw me. She saw me. She saw me. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #2: Hello. I am (unintelligible) machine. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #6: You are listening to the voice of a machine. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #3: (Singing) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K. . . COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #7: The first kind of aid to be considered as a talking aid for the vocally handicapped. BETTY: I am beautiful Betty, the standard female voice. PAUL: I am the standard male voice, perfect Paul. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #12: I was sad because there was no ice cream in the freezer. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #13: The sky is clear and the stars are twinkling. MAEVE: I can't wait for my friends to hear my new voice. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #3: (Singing) When we know our ABC's.

And today we are considering how technology could make shipping cleaner. The vast majority of the things we buy in the U. S. come here on ships, often from countries oceans away. These ships run on a particularly dirty kind of fuel called heavy fuel oil, or bunker fuel. As NPR's Rebecca Hersher reports, that may be changing. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: The inside of a modern ship smells like oil, and everything is enormous. ALEKSEI BUZLOV: So let's go down. HERSHER: Aleksei Buzlov (ph) is the chief engineer on a coal-carrying ship that I visited when it stopped in Baltimore earlier this year. Its engine room was a cavern four or five stories tall. Wow. There were layers of catwalks around an engine with pistons as long as station wagons. And built into the walls were rows and rows of bulbous storage tanks. BUZLOV: Fuel tanks - this one, 60 tons; another one, 80 tons - small tanks. HERSHER: Small because, in all, the ship carries about 300 tons of heavy fuel. The fuel is darker and thicker than diesel or gasoline. It looks kind of like the engine oil for a car. Aleksei spends a lot of his time down here cleaning gunk out of engine parts. BUZLOV: This is slop. HERSHER: Slop, the dark grease that heavy fuel leaves behind on basically everything it touches. Oh, it's like frosting - or poop. BUZLOV: Don't touch. HERSHER: Keeping the ship's engine clean enough to run efficiently is a never-ending job. This ship burns an average of 50 tons of heavy fuel every day when it's on the ocean. And in addition to the slop, as it burns fuel, the engine emits CO2, carbon dioxide, and soot into the atmosphere. Add that up across all the thousands of ships crisscrossing the Earth every day, and it's a lot of pollution. NERIJUS POSKUS: If shipping was a country, it would be the sixth-largest polluter in the world. About 3% of global emissions are released by ocean freight shipping today. HERSHER: Nerijus Poskus is an analyst at the company Flexport. He says the shipping industry is growing so fast, it's projected to emit more than 15% of greenhouse gases by midcentury if ships keep burning heavy fuel oil, which is untenable if humans hope to avoid the worst effects of climate change. And the shipping industry appears to know that. POSKUS: Things are changing, and they are changing actually quite fast, finally. HERSHER: International regulators have tightened emissions standards for when ships are in port. And one big company, Maersk, has said they intend to make their entire fleet zero emission by 2050 - no greenhouse gases, which will require a new type of fuel. POSKUS: My personal opinion, hydrogen looks like the most promising way to power ships. HERSHER: Poskus thinks it will take at least a decade, partly because ships are designed to last about 30 years. But the first hydrogen-powered prototypes are being built now in just a few places on Earth. Norway is one of them. The other is Oakland, Calif. JOE PRATT: OK. So down here where he's working, you have the two holes. Right? HERSHER: Joe Pratt looks down at the shiny aluminum skeleton of a ship. It's on its way to being a passenger ferry, so you can see the outlines of what will be two catamaran hulls. PRATT: This is the floor. HERSHER: His company, Golden Gate Zero Emission Marine, is building it with money from the state of California. When it's finished in the fall, it will be the first hydrogen-powered vessel to operate in the U. S. Pratt says the technology is not particularly new. They're just proving that it can be used to power a boat. PRATT: Yeah, everything is off the shelf. HERSHER: One issue his team has had to figure out was how to make sure there was enough room for the hydrogen tanks and for the fuel cells. As big as internal combustion engines are, hydrogen fuel cells and their fuel will require even more space. One thing they don't have to worry about anymore, though - smelly exhaust. PRATT: It has an exhaust duct, which will have warm, humid air coming out. HERSHER: The moisture from the exhaust will be collected and used as drinking water onboard. Pratt says his company is already fielding questions from boat tour companies and others who are interested in either building new hydrogen-powered vessels or retrofitting their current ships. There is one more challenge, though, to achieve the goal of zero emissions. The hydrogen fuel that powers a vessel like this isn't necessarily clean. Lennie Klebanoff studies hydrogen fuel cells at Sandia National Lab. LENNIE KLEBANOFF: In the U. S. , about 90% of our hydrogen is made from methane. HERSHER: When you make hydrogen from methane, the process emits some CO2. So even though the hydrogen itself is clean burning, it's not really zero emissions. There are other ways to make hydrogen, though - from biomass, for example, or - cleanest of all - from water. KLEBANOFF: So water is H2O. You get the H's off of the H2O, and you're left with O, which is oxygen. HERSHER: The hope is if even a few companies start buying hydrogen-powered ships in the coming decade, the demand for clean hydrogen will go up, and fossil fuels will stop being the go-to for global shipping.

The only part of the actual spacecraft to make it to the moon and back was the tiny, gumdrop-shaped capsule perched right at the tip. It carried the astronauts with all of their life support and scientific resources crammed inside. It's called the Columbia Command Module. KPCC's Jacob Margolis spoke with two people who dedicated a decade to working on the capsule. JACOB MARGOLIS, BYLINE: The module was born at North American Aviation in Downey, Calif. , what used to be farmland just south of Los Angeles. John F. Kennedy's 1961 decree that we'd reach the moon by the end of the decade meant that an awful lot of people uprooted their lives and flooded in from across the country. CHUCK LOWRY: When I first arrived in California and reported for work, there was a lot of chaos. MARGOLIS: Chuck Lowry was an engineer whose job was in part to make sure the parachutes worked. He moved his pregnant wife and two young kids away from a good life with family and friends in Ohio to a motel in Downey so he could get started right away. LOWRY: Many people came in, and there was just no room for them. We had people in the halls. We had people that needed a drafting table, and we ran out of them. And I know people that took doors off the offices and put them on sawhorses, and that became their drafting table. But after a while, we began to get things put together. MARGOLIS: The command module had to have everything, from life support systems to seating to navigation to those parachutes to keep it from slamming into the ocean and killing the astronauts. While some designs would come from NASA, it was the folks on the ground in Downey who were working out the details. Gerald Blackburn was from nearby. He was 19 when he started on the project as a lab technician. GERALD BLACKBURN: Think of the Volkswagen Beetle. That's about the size of the command module interior with the seats out and everything, OK? MARGOLIS: He says he was crawling in and out of it, testing things and installing nuts and bolts and tubing that had to be put in exactly the right place, sometimes with five other people doing their jobs in there, too. The capsule had to be as fine-tuned as a Swiss watch but as robust as a tank. And if a bolt needed to be moved half an inch, Jerry says, there'd be endless meetings about it, and production could be delayed. BLACKBURN: You got to the point where you began to realize that this thing was so complex, it was so big that there was no way that you could fathom the whole program. So you had to rely on that everybody is doing their job and taking care of what they need to take care of. MARGOLIS: Apollo was their lives, working 10 to 15 hour days, never seeing their families. In the beginning, there seemed to be this almost naive optimism, this gung-ho we're going to the moon, this is our mission sort of stuff. And then, on January 27, 1967, everything changed. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE WALLACE: America's first three Apollo astronauts were trapped and killed by a flash fire that swept their moon ship early tonight during a launch pad test at Cape Kennedy in Florida. MARGOLIS: A spark set off a huge fire the 100% oxygen environment in the capsule. The door couldn't be opened fast enough. The astronauts didn't have any sort of fireproofing on their suits. Jerry says it was terrible. BLACKBURN: Everybody that was working here are asking themselves the same question - did I do something wrong? MARGOLIS: There was an investigation. BLACKBURN: The whole tone had changed. MARGOLIS: Division president Harrison Storms was removed. They redesigned the capsule. New safety procedures were put into place. After a break, Chuck says, the ruthless pace of the program picked back up. LOWRY: As John F. Kennedy said, we're going to land and return men safely in the 1960s, in that decade. And we held that goal very sacred, and it was important because you've got Congress, you've got people, you've got the world watching. And we'd just have to meet our goal on that. MARGOLIS: Chuck says that another turning point - this a majorly positive one - was in 1968, when Apollo 7, the first crewed mission, made its way to space. Then Apollo 8 circled the moon. Nine, 10 - all good. The whole time, they're building more capsules, refining their designs, until, finally, 11. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NEIL ARMSTRONG: Houston, the Eagle has landed. MARGOLIS: Michael Collins flew the capsule around the moon while Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong did their thing. Chuck recalls the joy and the fear. LOWRY: On my shift, we would sit there in that control room and listen to the voice between the astronaut and ground control. And you always listened, like, is there anything in the conversation going on that might indicate something is wrong in anywhere or in your system? So it's kind of intense. MARGOLIS: On their way back, the astronauts sent one final transmission from space. Collins had this to say. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MICHAEL COLLINS: This operation is somewhat like the periscope of a submarine. All you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others. And to all those, I would like to say, thank you very much. MARGOLIS: Upon re-entry Chuck Lowry's parachutes deployed and inflated. All of Gerald Blackburn's quality testing paid off. The capsule floated down, and the astronauts returned to Earth safely. By the end of it, more than 400,000 people had worked on the Apollo program. LOWRY: John F. Kennedy had said we're going to the moon not because it's easy but because it's hard. And he was right on that. It took a lot of years, and we worked a lot of weekends and holidays. And we worked hard. Our families suffered. There were a lot of heart attacks and broken homes and strokes. And Apollo took a toll. MARGOLIS: Chuck basically didn't see his family for a decade. Jerry, who ended up as management eventually, actually lost an eye in an accident. Still, he says. . . BLACKBURN: I refer to what I call this place and that time as our cosmic Camelot - a time when people in a country came together with a commitment to do something and to achieve a goal that was incredible. MARGOLIS: For NPR News, I'm Jacob Margolis. SARAH MCCAMMON, HOST:  Thousands of people contributed to the effort to get Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins to the moon, which happened 50 years ago today. The only part of the actual spacecraft to make it to the moon and back was the tiny, gumdrop-shaped capsule perched right at the tip. It carried the astronauts with all of their life support and scientific resources crammed inside. It's called the Columbia Command Module. KPCC's Jacob Margolis spoke with two people who dedicated a decade to working on the capsule. JACOB MARGOLIS, BYLINE: The module was born at North American Aviation in Downey, Calif. , what used to be farmland just south of Los Angeles. John F. Kennedy's 1961 decree that we'd reach the moon by the end of the decade meant that an awful lot of people uprooted their lives and flooded in from across the country. CHUCK LOWRY: When I first arrived in California and reported for work, there was a lot of chaos. MARGOLIS: Chuck Lowry was an engineer whose job was in part to make sure the parachutes worked. He moved his pregnant wife and two young kids away from a good life with family and friends in Ohio to a motel in Downey so he could get started right away. LOWRY: Many people came in, and there was just no room for them. We had people in the halls. We had people that needed a drafting table, and we ran out of them. And I know people that took doors off the offices and put them on sawhorses, and that became their drafting table. But after a while, we began to get things put together. MARGOLIS: The command module had to have everything, from life support systems to seating to navigation to those parachutes to keep it from slamming into the ocean and killing the astronauts. While some designs would come from NASA, it was the folks on the ground in Downey who were working out the details. Gerald Blackburn was from nearby. He was 19 when he started on the project as a lab technician. GERALD BLACKBURN: Think of the Volkswagen Beetle. That's about the size of the command module interior with the seats out and everything, OK? MARGOLIS: He says he was crawling in and out of it, testing things and installing nuts and bolts and tubing that had to be put in exactly the right place, sometimes with five other people doing their jobs in there, too. The capsule had to be as fine-tuned as a Swiss watch but as robust as a tank. And if a bolt needed to be moved half an inch, Jerry says, there'd be endless meetings about it, and production could be delayed. BLACKBURN: You got to the point where you began to realize that this thing was so complex, it was so big that there was no way that you could fathom the whole program. So you had to rely on that everybody is doing their job and taking care of what they need to take care of. MARGOLIS: Apollo was their lives, working 10 to 15 hour days, never seeing their families.

There are some scientists and computer programmers out there who are developing digital technology so that you can do that. This is the subject of the latest episode of our video series Future You, and Elise Hu has been trying it out. Hi there, Elise. ELISE HU, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: How would it be possible in the real world to make things move just by thinking about them moving? HU: By reading the nerve impulses from your arm. So I went to the offices of a company called CTRL-labs, where they've developed an armband. It's the size of a wristwatch. And that can read the nerve impulses in your arm. And when you put it on, just by moving your hand or flicking a finger, you can make things happen on a screen or even in real life with physical objects. INSKEEP: In real life - like what? HU: OK. First, let's take the screen example. Picture a video game on the screen where there's images of objects, a whole world on there. And with this armband on, I could make a motion with my hand. . . JESSLYN TANNADY: You pull like this, kind of like, I want this to, like, come towards me. . . HU: . . . Like I was grabbing something and picking it up or even pushing it away. And, on the screen, the object would respond. The engineer there, Jesslyn Tannady, taught me how to do this. TANNADY: Try pushing something far away using open hand. HU: Hold on. Oh. Oh. . . TANNADY: You got it. You got it. HU: OK. TANNADY: All right. Try - oh. Oh. . . HU: What am I - oh. TANNADY: Towards sky. Towards sky. Towards sky (laughter). INSKEEP: People will be a little familiar with the concept because they've seen video games like Xbox, where the device somehow reads your motion. But here, it's reading your thoughts? HU: That's correct. So this is a lot more sophisticated. And the other thing, Steve, is they've taken this beyond the digital world. They've devised ways that this armband will let you actually move physical objects - for instance, a robot. So this guy - this y'all call the hexapod? TANNADY: This is our little hexapod. HU: They have this little robot that looks like a mechanical spider, about the size of a football. And each of its legs represented one of my fingers. So I could open my hand to make it walk. Or if I held that robot behind my back and lined its legs kind of near my back there, I could scratch my own back. TANNADY: Give yourself back scratches. HU: OK. Hold on. Oh, whoa (laughter). INSKEEP: So assuming this works on a larger and larger scale, what does it mean for human beings? HU: The founder of this company says he wants this nerve impulse reading to fundamentally change the way we actually interface with our devices and machines. His name is Thomas Reardon. THOMAS REARDON: So, yes, an extension of you where interacting with a computer and a machine no longer feels like something you're doing mechanically, but instead is just a fluid extension of your thoughts and subtle movements. HU: So what he's saying there, Steve, is no more typing, no more swiping on your phone or even voice control. REARDON: All these things that we think of as the internet of things that all have their perverse little interfaces, like the Nest thermostat on the wall. . . HU: Right. Right. REARDON: . . . There's no reason for me to go up and touch it and move it. I ought to be able to just look at it and change the temperature. INSKEEP: Sounds powerful and amazing. But in this series, Future You, Elise, you always ask what the downsides of things are. HU: Right. And privacy is a huge concern here because your neural identity is so specific to you. So the signals that we generate neurologically are the most unique identifiers of ourselves. Reardon puts it this way. REARDON: Give us 30 seconds of recordings from a person, and we can identify that person for the rest of their lives. And we have to make sure that people who might have the opportunity to exploit it, to track you and otherwise pervert your superpowers don't have an easy way to go do that. INSKEEP: It's like a fingerprint, only it's a neuro-print? HU: Exactly. And as with a lot of technology, we're making our lives a lot more fluid this way, and it would enhance what we can do. But it's opening up a lot of questions as we go forward too. INSKEEP: What can I do with this technology right now? HU: CTRL-labs is going to release a developer's kit. Other tech designers can make their device work with the armband. So maybe an auto engineer would be able to make a car that responds to your arm movements. And you'll be able to summon that car, or you could change your thermostat, like Reardon says. INSKEEP: Thanks, Elise. HU: You bet.

Finding these signals would be key to explaining how the universe began. NPR's Joe Palca has just returned from a visit to the telescope, and he has this report on a remarkable facility in a remarkable location. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: The telescope is called CLASS. It's located on top of Cerro Toco in the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on Earth. And at 17,000 feet, it's one of the highest telescopes in the world. Ready? JULLIANNA COUTO: I'm ready. PALCA: OK. Shall we start outside? COUTO: Yeah, let's go outside. PALCA: Jullianna Couto is the site manager for the telescope. We've emerged from a warm control room into the chilly, thin air outside. It's winter in the Southern Hemisphere, but today is a balmy 40 degrees. But you don't come up here every day. COUTO: We come here usually from Monday through Saturday. PALCA: The Atacama Desert is covered with red soil and rocks stretching far into the distance. COUTO: We could be on Mars. It's definitely an unique place on Earth (laughter). PALCA: Across a small compound from the control room are two boxy structures about 30 feet high that house the actual telescopes. They're radio telescopes, and they can study the sky even during the day. Couto's colleague Deniz Valle positions a lift so we can climb into one of the structures. DENIZ VALLE: So here we are. We're inside the CLASS telescope. PALCA: It's a bit cramped in here. Mostly it's dominated by large disks that make up the telescope's mirrors. That squeaking is the cryogenic pump that chills the detectors. VALLE: Here we can see where the light comes in - primary mirror, secondary mirror and our receiver here. PALCA: The data collected here are sent first to the base station CLASS maintains in the town of San Pedro, about a 45-minute drive down the mountain. TOBY MARRIAGE: The No. 1 science goal of CLASS is to detect evidence for these quantum gravitational waves. PALCA: Toby Marriage is an astronomer at Johns Hopkins University and one of the principal scientists on CLASS. Theories say quantum gravitational waves were generated as the universe blinked into being. Finding them is key to explaining why the universe expanded the way it has. CLASS won't see the waves themselves but the traces of the waves left behind in what's called the cosmic microwave background. MARRIAGE: It's like looking at the sand at the edge of the beach when a wave comes in and the wave goes out and you can see in the sand that a wave was there. PALCA: Now, these traces are very faint and hard to separate from the background noise of the universe. But CLASS's designers have invented something called the variable-delay polarization modulator. It works like this. Let's say this is the signal you're trying to detect. MARRIAGE: The cosmic microwave background. PALCA: But that signal is buried in noise. (SOUNDBITE OF STATIC)PALCA: The modulator raises the frequency of the signal so it can be detected against the background noise. MODULATED VOICE: The cosmic microwave background. PALCA: So here's what you get - still kind of hard to hear, but it's there. (SOUNDBITE OF STATIC)MODULATED VOICE: The cosmic microwave background. PALCA: Toby Marriage says even with this frequency-shifting invention, finding the faint signals they're interested in won't be easy. MARRIAGE: It's going to take many, many years.

And NPR's Rebecca Hersher reports the top scientific integrity official from the Environmental Protection Agency was not allowed to testify. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: Since Donald Trump took office, there have been a lot of complaints from scientists that scientists who work for the federal government can't express themselves freely. The proposed legislation would make it harder for the White House or political appointees at federal agencies to withhold data from scientific studies or bar scientists from discussing their findings. It would give legal teeth to less binding agency rules, like those of the National Institutes of Health and the Interior Department. In fact, one of the things that came up over and over at today's hearing is how there's one agency that's setting a particularly good example with its rules - the EPA. PAUL TONKO: They are usually highlighted as one of the best agencies, if not the best, with their scientific integrity panel. HERSHER: That's New York Democrat Paul Tonko, one of the bill's co-sponsors. The EPA's pretty good track record - at least compared to other agencies - clearly made it all the more frustrating to Democrats leading the hearing that the top EPA official who works on these issues, Francesca Grifo, wasn't there. As Michigan Democrat Haley Stevens put it. . . HALEY STEVENS: Her perspective would've been invaluable here today. Unfortunately, the EPA refused to allow Ms. Grifo to testify. HERSHER: The EPA did offer Grifo's boss, who the committee had not invited. In a statement, EPA spokesperson Michael Abboud wrote to NPR, the House Democrats' assertions on this matter are inaccurate. The EPA was invited to this hearing, and we immediately offered the agency's top career science official within the Office of Research and Development. He accused House committee members of, quote, \"dictating to the agency who they believe was qualified to speak. \" Those who did testify at the hearing discussed, among other things, the importance of allowing federal scientists and other employees decide for themselves when to talk about their research and expertise without worrying about political fallout.

It would give legal teeth to less binding agency rules, like those of the National Institutes of Health and the Interior Department. In fact, one of the things that came up over and over at today's hearing is how there's one agency that's setting a particularly good example with its rules - the EPA. PAUL TONKO: They are usually highlighted as one of the best agencies, if not the best, with their scientific integrity panel. HERSHER: That's New York Democrat Paul Tonko, one of the bill's co-sponsors. The EPA's pretty good track record - at least compared to other agencies - clearly made it all the more frustrating to Democrats leading the hearing that the top EPA official who works on these issues, Francesca Grifo, wasn't there. As Michigan Democrat Haley Stevens put it. . . HALEY STEVENS: Her perspective would've been invaluable here today. Unfortunately, the EPA refused to allow Ms. Grifo to testify. HERSHER: The EPA did offer Grifo's boss, who the committee had not invited. In a statement, EPA spokesperson Michael Abboud wrote to NPR, the House Democrats' assertions on this matter are inaccurate. The EPA was invited to this hearing, and we immediately offered the agency's top career science official within the Office of Research and Development. He accused House committee members of, quote, \"dictating to the agency who they believe was qualified to speak. \" Those who did testify at the hearing discussed, among other things, the importance of allowing federal scientists and other employees decide for themselves when to talk about their research and expertise without worrying about political fallout.

GREENFIELDBOYCE: David Sims is with the Marine Biological Association in the United Kingdom. He says even though sharks can travel miles each day, they sometimes like to stay in one spot. To see exactly where they stay and go, over 150 shark scientists from around the world recently decided to collaborate. SIMS: We wanted to really take this big-scale sort of global view of where sharks were hanging out. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The team tracked almost two dozen shark species using satellite tags on over 1,500 individual sharks. They also looked at the movements of thousands of fishing vessels using data from a safety system that ships use to avoid collisions. It turns out that in any given month, about a quarter of the space used by sharks in the ocean overlapped with the space used by industrial fishing.

That's not 1979. That's just 79. They lay there preserved for 1,500 years. And as they've been slowly uncovered, Pompeii especially has proven to be an archeological gold mine. SOPHIE HAY: Pompeii has got so much to offer the study of the Romans because so much has survived. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Sophie Hay is an archaeologist working with Cambridge University. HAY: Here, in Pompeii, you have from the sort of the elite members of society right down to the people who were baking bread, making that horrendous fish sauce that they would use in their food. You just get this kind of complete picture of what Roman life was like. GARCIA-NAVARRO: But all that ash and pumice that preserved Pompeii had to come from somewhere. And that somewhere is Mount Vesuvius, a still active volcano that's very much of interest to a different set of scientists who also want to be digging in Pompeii and Herculaneum. CHRISTOPHER KILBURN: These sites are unique, not only because of their archaeology but also because they allow us to understand in detail just how the volcano killed people and damaged and destroyed the towns. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's volcanologist Christopher Kilburn. He's with the Hazard Centre at University College London. Kilburn is part of an international group of volcanologists who want more access to Pompeii. So he helped write an open letter published in the journal Nature. KILBURN: Pointing out the fact that access to the new excavations at Pompeii were being restricted to the volcanological community. The difficulty is perhaps the value of volcanology has been underestimated compared with the value that the archaeologists see in the excavations. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Roberto Scandone is a researcher at the Vesuvius Observatory and another author of that letter in Nature. He points to the obvious - that to see the frescoes and intricately tiled floors, the courtyards and fountains ancient Romans passed by 2,000 years ago, archaeologists removed stuff the volcanologists want to get their hands and instruments on. Even removing the ash and pumice hole and taking it to a lab has an effect on the deposits. And it can destroy them. ROBERTO SCANDONE: If you destroy the deposit, you will not ever have these possibility. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And as in so many things, there's an element of class in this. KILBURN: Archaeology is a classical and well-established discipline. And I think by comparison, volcanology is seen a bit as an upstart or as an intruder. And I have to say, there has been history of a teeny weeny bit of snobbery that sort of the archaeology is sort of the aristocracy. But volcanology is rather for the more common people. But we're starting to learn that by combining resources we get a much greater understanding of what happened, for example, during the eruption. The volcanology explains how the people died, and the archaeology explains how the people lived beforehand. GARCIA-NAVARRO: The feud doesn't look permanent. There are signs of some thawing between the two fields. Archaeologist Sophie Hay of Cambridge. HAY: Well, I know - I mean, you can't really understand Pompeii and everything that survives there without understanding the geology of how it was preserved and the nature of the eruption. KILBURN: I think your attitudes are changing. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's Christopher Kilburn. KILBURN: And we would hope to be able to forge much closer links in the future for everybody's benefit, to be honest. We will all gain by talking to each other more often. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So here's hoping archaeologists and volcanologists can learn to dig deep and find common ground. And here's also hoping they realize at some point that history has lessons for anyone who spends lots of time in Pompeii. It's a dangerous place. Keep your eye on that volcano.

ROBERTO SCANDONE: If you destroy the deposit, you will not ever have these possibility. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And as in so many things, there's an element of class in this. KILBURN: Archaeology is a classical and well-established discipline. And I think by comparison, volcanology is seen a bit as an upstart or as an intruder. And I have to say, there has been history of a teeny weeny bit of snobbery that sort of the archaeology is sort of the aristocracy. But volcanology is rather for the more common people. But we're starting to learn that by combining resources we get a much greater understanding of what happened, for example, during the eruption. The volcanology explains how the people died, and the archaeology explains how the people lived beforehand. GARCIA-NAVARRO: The feud doesn't look permanent. There are signs of some thawing between the two fields. Archaeologist Sophie Hay of Cambridge. HAY: Well, I know - I mean, you can't really understand Pompeii and everything that survives there without understanding the geology of how it was preserved and the nature of the eruption. KILBURN: I think your attitudes are changing. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's Christopher Kilburn. KILBURN: And we would hope to be able to forge much closer links in the future for everybody's benefit, to be honest. We will all gain by talking to each other more often. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So here's hoping archaeologists and volcanologists can learn to dig deep and find common ground. And here's also hoping they realize at some point that history has lessons for anyone who spends lots of time in Pompeii. It's a dangerous place.

On this week's All Tech Considered, we're talking about the potential for electric planes. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SHAPIRO: Air travel accounts for about 2% of global carbon emissions. And people see clean air travel as a key part of slowing global warming. To explain why and what is being done about it, we are joined by Umair Irfan. He writes about climate change energy and the environment for Vox. Welcome to the studio. UMAIR IRFAN: Thanks for having me. SHAPIRO: Why focus on air travel when it accounts for just 2%, I mean, a much smaller share of carbon emissions than cars? IRFAN: Well, air travel is going to grow in the coming century. We're expecting to see massive growth. The International Civil Aviation Organization projects upward of 700% growth by the middle of the century. So while it is small, it is going to be a larger and larger share. And the other side of the problem is that air travel is really hard to decarbonize. SHAPIRO: You've written that we need electric airplanes. Why? IRFAN: Well, with that growth, we need to be able to counteract that somehow. Electrifying air travel is one key option, particularly for shorter flights. And we're already seeing at least a couple airlines experimenting with it. There's one in the Pacific Northwest that aims to electrify its whole fleet, but it only flies routes smaller than 100 miles. And so right now that's where the technology is. It can basically support small aircraft going short distances. But you absolutely need something that's going to decarbonize air travel to some extent because it is going to be a large and growing share of the problem. SHAPIRO: Are any of the small airlines in the air carrying passengers already? IRFAN: Not right now. One of the big issues is that the Federal Aviation Administration hasn't approved electric aircraft for passenger air travel. The regulations are actually a big hangup right now because much of the rules are structured around conventional aircraft. And now they need a new set of rules to deal with battery electric aircraft. That's also going to be challenged in the coming years. SHAPIRO: When you look at where the technology stands today, how far are we from having an electric airplane that could cross the Atlantic Ocean? IRFAN: Well, the key problem right now is that jet fuel is extremely energy dense and batteries are not. And in an airplane, space, as you may have noticed, is at a premium, and so is weight. And so you want to pack as much power into as small a space as possible. Batteries are improving but not fast enough right now. They need to be able to store much more energy in a much smaller space. SHAPIRO: I think some airlines are experimenting with biofuels. Is that helpful? IRFAN: Yeah. Biofuels are a big part of it as well. The idea is that if you use a crop that takes CO2 from the air and you burn that instead, effectively it's carbon neutral. That's a little bit tricky to pull off, though, because you want to make sure you get more energy out of the fuel than you expend to grow it in the first place. Biofuels are also a little bit more expensive than conventional fuels. And so you have to make sort of an economic argument. Right now, airlines are experimenting with it, but it's more expensive than conventional fuels. And so we need a really substantial price drop in order to make inroads. SHAPIRO: For people who want to do something about their flight-related carbon emissions now, is buying carbon offsets really the only option? IRFAN: Well, the biggest option - the biggest impact option would be just to fly less. And there's a global movement that's kind of sprung up to try to encourage people to do that. I think the estimate is that each leg of a journey on a roundtrip flight across the Atlantic emits about a ton of CO2. So that's 2 tons of CO2. And that's roughly enough to melt about 30 square feet of Arctic ice. So that's a very direct relationship between your actions and your impact on the environment, and for some, people that's been a pretty startling revelation. SHAPIRO: Do you think the airlines feel the urgency? Is there really a race to get an electric plane up in the air? IRFAN: There is some pressure on the airlines right now because of this global flying shame movement that's kind of taken off. There are - there is some pressure. . . SHAPIRO: Global flying shame, meaning make people feel guilty for the fact that their flights are causing all of these carbon emissions? IRFAN: That's right. The Swedes have even coined a word for it. They call it flygskam. For some reason, Sweden is the epicenter for this movement. SHAPIRO: That's flying shame. IRFAN: Flying shame, right. And yeah, their customers are now increasing pressure on the airlines. They want to sort of assuage their guilt for flying. Many people see it as necessary, but they want to see more heavy lifting coming from the airlines themselves in terms of getting more fuel efficient or coming up with better offsetting schemes or mitigating greenhouse gas emissions in other ways.

Should we replace plastic with natural materials that degrade over time? Or should we just stop throwing away so much stuff? NPR's Christopher Joyce reports. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Stephen Mayfield is a chemist who figured out how to turn algae into raw plastic - polyurethane plastic. At his lab, he turns it into stuff people want. STEPHEN MAYFIELD: What are the most important polyurethane products on the planet? Well, if you're from UC San Diego, those are surfboards. JOYCE: Mayfield works out of what looks like a machine shop on the University of California campus. He started with surfboards, and they got him some attention. But it was a surfing trip to the Maldives Islands in the Indian Ocean that persuaded him to make something else. One day, he asked his local hosts to take him to their most remote island. They said sure. MAYFIELD: And when I got to the windward side of the island, it was covered with dead flip-flops. JOYCE: Flip-flops - footwear for much of the world's population. Made of rubber or plastic, they had floated there on ocean currents from, presumably, all over the world. MAYFIELD: And it was so sad to get there and think, this - really? This is what we've done to the planet. JOYCE: So Mayfield now makes flip-flops from algae. What makes them special is that they degrade if left out in the environment. Chemist and fellow surfer Suri Sherman is the polyurethane chef in Mayfield's lab. He shows me how it's done. SURI SHERMAN: I, basically, mix up a bunch of chemicals and say, oh, a little bit of this, little bit of that - just kind of, like, cooking. JOYCE: He swirls some syrupy liquid in a can. SHERMAN: Right now I'm adding in a polyal. JOYCE: GooeySHERMAN: Gooey - this comes from algae. JOYCE: Sherman adds another chemical. It's a two-step process, like mixing epoxy - adds a catalyst and blends it all in the mechanical spinner. The final step - pour the stuff into a mold and bake it for 20 minutes or so. Then pry it out, and you've got a flip-flop sole. Mayfield says there's some traditional petroleum-based polymer in there as well, but all of the shoe will biodegrade into harmless materials. It just needs the right bacteria and moisture to break it down. MAYFIELD: You throw them in your compost pile, and they will disappear at about 3 1/2- or 4% per month, meaning that within two years, that shoe will completely be gone. JOYCE: Two years potentially as trash isn't perfect, but Mayfield says it's better than decades or even longer. But the real problem, he says, is that new technology is a tough sell. Manufacturers are reluctant to take a risk on a new, unfamiliar product. So what about changing people instead of the product - changing their behavior, that is? TOM SZAKY: I think the evil isn't plastic. It's using something once. JOYCE: Tom Szaky is founder and CEO of TerraCycle in Trenton, N. J. SZAKY: I mean, there was advertisements in 1950 that talk about, you don't have to wash your dishes anymore. Simply take the whole thing - the cutlery, the dishes, the tablecloth itself - and throw it all out. JOYCE: Szaky wants consumers to abandon the throw-away mentality and learn to reuse things, in particular packaging - the largest source of plastic waste. TerraCycle is running a pilot project called Loop. Here's how it works. A company puts its products, say, shampoo or toothpaste, into custom-made sturdy containers - glass, metal or plastic. Loop packs them into a picnic basket-sized tote bag and ships it to you. You use up the stuff, then UPS picks up the tote bag full of empties and ships it back to TerraCycle. The containers get washed, refilled and sent out again. Szaky calls it unconscious behavior change. SZAKY: In Loop, we're trying say it feels like throw-away. But instead of throwing it away into a landfill or throwing it away into a recycling center, it's going into a reuse facility. JOYCE: That facility is in a warehouse in Trenton. Boxes of consumer products line the walls. Marketing director Heather Crawford pulls out a few. HEATHER CRAWFORD: Snacks, trail mixes, raw nuts, etc. JOYCE: But not in the usual plastic pouch - instead packed into a cylindrical, metal container. And this is dark balsamic vinegar. CRAWFORD: Yes. JOYCE: There's shampoo, hand lotion, juice. CRAWFORD: This is an interesting one. This is a REN prestige skin care in glass bottles. JOYCE: There's even ice cream in special, insulated, metal containers, frozen down to -41 degrees. CRAWFORD: The very last thing to go into the tote. JOYCE: Loop says the ice cream will stay frozen for up to 30 hours while it's being shipped. Big companies like Procter and Gamble, Nestle and Unilever are participating in this experiment. They refill the containers. Loop handles the transport and cleaning. Crawford says Loop has tens of thousands of customers signed up. They pay a deposit on each container, which they get back when they turn in. CRAWFORD: Consumers are so well-aware of the waste crisis. And they're genuinely looking for a solution and something that they can actively participate in. JOYCE: So far, Loop is a boutique operation. And Szaky acknowledges they're challenging huge, well-established industries. SZAKY: Who are the losers in Loop, right? It's the waste management industry because less stuff will end up in their bins, which will make it - their income go down. JOYCE: And also, the oil, gas and chemical industries that now manufacture billions of dollars' worth of plastic stuff from food packaging to flip-flops. Szaky says, ultimately, it will be the customers who will decide the future of plastic. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

Noah Glick from member station KUNR in Reno visited the country's newest and largest Dark Sky Sanctuary. NOAH GLICK, BYLINE: Jen Rovanpera is an archaeologist with the Bureau of Land Management. Today, she's driving through remote and rough parts of northwestern Nevada, just six miles from the Oregon border. She pulls over to a vista point where in the distance, you can see a giant plateau. This is Massacre Rim, a recently designated Dark Sky Sanctuary. JEN ROVANPERA: It's an immense area of darkness. The sanctuary is just a small fraction of that area. GLICK: Rovanpera recently worked to get this large area designated with the International Dark Sky Association. The title doesn't come with any legal protections, per se, but land managers like the BLM do have to adopt a lighting policy that preserves the night sky. And only those areas that are unlikely to be developed are selected as sanctuaries. ROVANPERA: I think it promotes recognition of what an amazing resource it is and also awareness that parts of the country, we're losing this opportunity to really enjoy the natural night sky. GLICK: Only 10 Dark Sky Sanctuaries exist in the world, with four of them here in the U. S. At more than 100,000 acres, Massacre Rim is the largest one in the country. It's surrounded by thousands of acres of sagebrush and grass perfect for cattle. . . (SOUNDBITE OF COWS MOOING)GLICK: . . . And perfect for camping. I finish setting up camp as dusk turns to night. When I step outside my tent, it's around midnight. Wow. You can see the dust from the Milky Way stretching across the entire horizon. It doesn't even look real. The nearest city to this remote area is Cedarville, Calif. , a town of just 500 people. Janet Irene is the owner of the Country Hearth restaurant in town where she spends her mornings making fresh breads and jams from scratch. She's happy about the designation and says the dark skies in her community aren't always appreciated. JANET IRENE: It's something that's always there and we've always taken for granted. GLICK: Last year, Irene hosted a stargazing party in her rose garden and says kids and adults alike were amazed at what they saw. IRENE: From here, you can see so many things in the sky that I'd never seen other places I've lived before. GLICK: Irene has been in Cedarville since 1970. She says the night sky is something that continues to amaze her, even after nearly 50 years. IRENE: It's so exciting to know that there's something else up there other than what we see every day here. And you can actually see some small part of it. It's an insight into what might be. GLICK: And it's an experience more people can see for themselves if they're willing to travel to this remote area of Northwest Nevada.

And dry is good for radio telescopes because it lets them see the heavens more clearly. NPR science correspondent Joe Palca reports on an array of some five dozen radio telescopes that provide a unique view of the universe. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: The telescopes look like large, steerable satellite dishes. They're in a part of the desert that's 16,000 feet above sea level. This is just such a strange place because you're sort of standing in the middle of a high plateau. There's some rolling ridges off around the side, and dotting all over the landscape are these radio telescopes. Dotting is the word because these radio dishes aren't all packed together. Any two of them can be as much as 10 miles apart. The thin air makes it hard for humans to work at 16,000 feet, so ALMA's main control room is at a lower altitude - a mere 9,500 feet above sea level. The day I visited, Ignacio Toledo was the astronomer on duty. IGNACIO TOLEDO: In the control room, what we do is to operate the telescope, the ALMA observatory. PALCA: Operating the telescope means deciding what the dishes are pointing at and monitoring atmospheric conditions, especially the amount of water vapor. ALMA can see radiation coming from things like dust and gas, but water vapor acts like a cloud, blocking the signal. TOLEDO: The lower the value, the better the observations, and right now, it's pretty good. PALCA: ALMA is very popular with astronomers. Toledo says more want to use it than the facility can accommodate. TOLEDO: In total, they were requesting around 16,000 hours. And we can only give 4,000, so they do a selection based on the scientific merits of the project. PALCA: On the day I visited, the telescope was pointing at an object an astronomer named David Principe wanted to study. Toledo told me Principe would receive an email letting him know his turn had come up. So when I got back to my desk at NPR HQ, I checked in with Principe. DAVID PRINCIPE: I was sitting on a beach in Nantucket, and I got the email. And I was surprised because my cell phone had very little reception. PALCA: He was at the beach because his observing time happened to fall on the Fourth of July. Principe uses ALMA to study star formation. PRINCIPE: The earliest stages of a star's life. PALCA: In those early stages, the star is surrounded by a thick ring of dust, something that ALMA is particularly good at seeing. PRINCIPE: And this ring is ultimately where planets are forming. PALCA: You can't actually see the planet, but you can see a gap in the ring where the planet's gravity has cleared away the material. Like almost all of ALMA's users, Principe didn't travel to the observatory when his measurements were being made. At some point, he'll receive a large data file containing his results that he can study in a computer in his office. ALMA astronomer Ignacio Toledo says this remote capability takes some of the magic out of observing with a telescope. TOLEDO: It's less romantic, yes. But at least for me, and I think for most of the people here, they work in this feeling that what we're doing is something awesome. PALCA: Learning how the universe is put together does have an awesome component to it. Joe Palca, NPR News.

Before turtles hatch, when they're just tiny embryos inside their eggs, environmental changes may influence whether they become male or female. NPR's Merrit Kennedy reports this could protect turtles from climate change. MERRIT KENNEDY, BYLINE: For a lot of reptiles, their sex depends on their surroundings. RICK SHINE: It's a strange and wonderful aspect of reptile biology that in many turtles, all crocodiles and quite a few lizards, the sex that an animal develops into is determined by the temperature that it experiences within the nest. KENNEDY: Rick Shine is a biologist at Macquarie University in Australia. He says that for some turtle species, eggs that incubate at lower temperatures produce all males and slightly higher temperatures produce all females. This could cause problems because temperatures are rising due to climate change. In parts of the world, virtually no male sea turtles are hatching because it's too hot for them to develop. So populations might have trouble reproducing and therefore surviving. But what if turtle embryos could do something that keeps the male-female ratio more even? SHINE: Perhaps the embryos of reptiles could move around within the egg because it might be a little bit warmer at one end of the egg than the other. KENNEDY: Shine worked with Chinese researchers to study the Chinese three-keeled pond turtle. He says its eggs can have hotter zones and cooler zones. The team wondered if an embryo could influence its sex simply by moving to find the sweet spot. To test that theory, they painted some eggs with a chemical so that the embryos couldn't sense heat. SHINE: Just have to paint it on the eggshell, and you have an embryo inside that's no longer aware of the temperature differences within the egg. KENNEDY: These embryos didn't move around much, and the turtles wound up being nearly all male or all female depending on whether the eggs were warm or cool. Embryos and eggs that weren't treated behaved very differently. They were more active and hatched with a much more even male-to-female ratio. SHINE: It does seem as if the embryo has a lot more control over its destiny than we ever expected. KENNEDY: That idea is controversial. Biologist Boris Tezak from Florida Atlantic University has a few questions, like whether an embryo would have the muscle strength to reposition itself at that point in its development. BORIS TEZAK: I would like to see a little bit more of that data to be fully convinced, I think. KENNEDY: Shine says the team's study in the journal Current Biology took Tezak's concerns into account. And he doesn't think the embryos are making a conscious choice about what sex to become. Moving around in the egg is more likely an unconscious behavior that the turtles evolved to shield against temperature shifts. It might act as a buffer against small temperature changes, but it's no defense against major swings. SHINE: These organisms are far more sophisticated than we might think. They're capable of dealing with all kinds of unpredictable challenges that get thrown at them by the outside world. KENNEDY: Shine says the danger is that humans are throwing so many challenges at these animals so quickly that in the future, they might not be able to cope. Merrit Kennedy, NPR News.

They say the gunman was exploring violent ideologies, though he left no manifesto. However, the man responsible for the El Paso shooting does seem to have posted a lengthy manifesto online. Turns out, that's typical for mass shooters. And often, these so-called manifestos use similar racist language. And they're posted to the same Internet communities. I talked with Patrick Blanchfield of the Brooklyn Institute for Social Research and asked him what we can learn from these. PATRICK BLANCHFIELD: There is a point at which what these acts are speak for themselves. The body count, the people who were targeted, that is in many ways far more expressive and politically (ph) urgent, just as a transaction of power, than things people write and do. MARTIN: Then why do they write them? Then why do these mass murderers feel compelled to leave a statement? BLANCHFIELD: It's definitely the case that many of these people are seeking a sort of ephemeral notoriety and longer term memorialization in fetid subcultures on the Internet. But another thing - and this is, I think, the thing we have to keep in mind when we talk about these acts and the speech that's sort of attached to them - is that our discourse has a way of laundering away the obviousness of what these things are. We try to ask these ultimately unknowable questions, right? What was this person's ultimate intentions? Where did they go wrong, right? And that has a way of centering not just their own individual, unknowable black box interiority but our own position as spectators and consumers of information. And again, that is understandable. Believe me, I read these all the time. And you feel the existential tug where you want to know, how could someone do this? MARTIN: And there must be something. If we only read between the lines, if we only more closely examined these statements that we could somehow find answers. BLANCHFIELD: Precisely. But I keep on coming back to how - in the case of the El Paso mass shooting in particular - right? - where the alleged manifesto's extremely clear about how the shooter wanted to target Latinx people - right? - in the wake of that, there are consistent reports that the count of the wounded may actually be much higher because a lot of people who were hurt are afraid to seek medical care because of their undocumented status. And I want to stress, they got the message. MARTIN: So do you believe the media is making a mistake by even reporting the content of these statements? BLANCHFIELD: No, I want to be clear here - right? - that I think we need, obviously, to talk in sophisticated and intelligent ways about what is clearly a decentralized, long-standing movement of what you could call political terror. At the same time, the fact that these things keep happening and the fact that we find ourselves asking the same questions suggests that there're probably some other questions we should be asking that we don't want to be asking. MARTIN: Like what? BLANCHFIELD: Well, what's the point of interface between what these people say their reasons are and also what their actions do and what we accept more broadly as normative, acceptable expressions and differences of, quote-unquote, \"opinion in the public sphere? \" And once you get very granularly into what these manifestos say - right? - and there's a whole repertoire of tropes involving ethnic replacement, involving a fixation on birth rates, white birth rates - right? - involving a fixation on invaders coming through our southern borders. . . MARTIN: Statements we have heard from our political leaders, in particular this president in some cases. BLANCHFIELD: Precisely. But also, when you read this person talk about how elites support, quote, \"open borders, free health care for illegals, citizenship and more to enact a political coup\" - yeah, I hear Trump there, but the moment he also starts talking about real Americans, about the future of the West, about American birth rates, I also hear a lot of stuff that I read better written, more sophisticated, more, quote-unquote, \"intellectual\" in the op-ed pages of The New York Times, in The Wall Street Journal. There's a tremendous overlap here. To be clear, I'm not assigning unicausal, moral responsibility of point A to point B to the president, to columnists, et cetera. But there is a way in which what these people do and what they say underscore things that we have normalized and made acceptable. And they give it back to us. And the people who are targets hear the message. They're killed, and they flee. And meanwhile, the rest of us will adopt this almost naive, kind of childlike wonder - where could this possibly have come from? MARTIN: You're saying there is danger in treating these manifestos as fringe exceptionalism. BLANCHFIELD: There are a lot of features to these manifestos. Like, they all think they're smarter than they are, right? They're written at, basically, at the levels like a poor, undergraduate, first-year freshmen comp essay, right? But there's something about the very clunkiness and cheapness and tawdriness and generic character of it that once you see it and you look back, you're like, oh, people get paid six figures to say the exact same things. But, you know, they'll more abstractly talk about the future of the West or generational decline or reinvigorating America. It's a question of how we normalize, frankly, toxic expressions of American identity and how normal that is. And that's the flip side of how abnormal these events seem. MARTIN: Right. The bottom line being these statements tell us far less about the individuals who carry out these crimes and write these screeds than they do about the culture that bred these individuals in the first place. BLANCHFIELD: That's absolutely right. And I think until we're willing to talk about how systematically there is an interface between those two things, we're just going to develop an evermore sophisticated, fundamentally navel-gazing repertoire of gestures of deferral and disavowal and specious false distinctions. And that's not going to stop this. MARTIN: Patrick Blanchfield of the Brooklyn Institute for Social Research, thank you so much for your time. BLANCHFIELD: Absolutely.

BLANCHFIELD: No, I want to be clear here - right? - that I think we need, obviously, to talk in sophisticated and intelligent ways about what is clearly a decentralized, long-standing movement of what you could call political terror. At the same time, the fact that these things keep happening and the fact that we find ourselves asking the same questions suggests that there're probably some other questions we should be asking that we don't want to be asking. MARTIN: Like what? BLANCHFIELD: Well, what's the point of interface between what these people say their reasons are and also what their actions do and what we accept more broadly as normative, acceptable expressions and differences of, quote-unquote, \"opinion in the public sphere? \" And once you get very granularly into what these manifestos say - right? - and there's a whole repertoire of tropes involving ethnic replacement, involving a fixation on birth rates, white birth rates - right? - involving a fixation on invaders coming through our southern borders. . . MARTIN: Statements we have heard from our political leaders, in particular this president in some cases. BLANCHFIELD: Precisely. But also, when you read this person talk about how elites support, quote, \"open borders, free health care for illegals, citizenship and more to enact a political coup\" - yeah, I hear Trump there, but the moment he also starts talking about real Americans, about the future of the West, about American birth rates, I also hear a lot of stuff that I read better written, more sophisticated, more, quote-unquote, \"intellectual\" in the op-ed pages of The New York Times, in The Wall Street Journal. There's a tremendous overlap here. To be clear, I'm not assigning unicausal, moral responsibility of point A to point B to the president, to columnists, et cetera. But there is a way in which what these people do and what they say underscore things that we have normalized and made acceptable. And they give it back to us. And the people who are targets hear the message. They're killed, and they flee. And meanwhile, the rest of us will adopt this almost naive, kind of childlike wonder - where could this possibly have come from? MARTIN: You're saying there is danger in treating these manifestos as fringe exceptionalism. BLANCHFIELD: There are a lot of features to these manifestos. Like, they all think they're smarter than they are, right? They're written at, basically, at the levels like a poor, undergraduate, first-year freshmen comp essay, right? But there's something about the very clunkiness and cheapness and tawdriness and generic character of it that once you see it and you look back, you're like, oh, people get paid six figures to say the exact same things. But, you know, they'll more abstractly talk about the future of the West or generational decline or reinvigorating America. It's a question of how we normalize, frankly, toxic expressions of American identity and how normal that is. And that's the flip side of how abnormal these events seem. MARTIN: Right. The bottom line being these statements tell us far less about the individuals who carry out these crimes and write these screeds than they do about the culture that bred these individuals in the first place. BLANCHFIELD: That's absolutely right. And I think until we're willing to talk about how systematically there is an interface between those two things, we're just going to develop an evermore sophisticated, fundamentally navel-gazing repertoire of gestures of deferral and disavowal and specious false distinctions. And that's not going to stop this. MARTIN: Patrick Blanchfield of the Brooklyn Institute for Social Research, thank you so much for your time.

That is the warning in a new U. N. report examining food production and global warming. The window to address the problem is closing. Dan Charles from NPR's Science Desk joins us now to talk about this. Hi, Dan. DAN CHARLES, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: So the U. N. report says we're on our way to a global food crisis. How? CHARLES: Well, the first point to make is that climate change itself can make it harder to grow a lot of food across much of the world. You have shifting rainfall. You have increasing heat, which itself stresses crops. You have shifting production from one place to another - could be a lot of dislocation. In some areas, there will be more food production, in far northern latitudes. But on balance, in much of the world - in most of the world, the projections are that increasing heat will make it harder to grow enough food. MARTIN: And we should say the way most food is grown right now can itself mean higher emissions, right? CHARLES: Well, that is the other really big part of this report. I mean, I should also say, the report assumes that there will be more people with higher incomes wanting more food. MARTIN: Right. CHARLES: So actually, food production has to expand. And the way the - you know, we've expanded food production historically in the world is we've claimed more land. We've cut down forests. We've plowed up grasslands, like the entire Great Plains of the U. S. MARTIN: Right. You need land for cattle. You need land for farms, industrial farms. CHARLES: And that releases huge amounts of carbon dioxide. It's like mining the soil the same way you would, like, mine coal and burn it. And there are other sources as well. The - sort of the production of nitrogen fertilizer is incredibly intensive releaser of greenhouse gases. And methane from cattle as they - you know, sort of they convert grass into meat, they release methane. That's also a source of greenhouse gases. So on balance, all of those things - mining the soil, cattle, fertilizer - it's estimated that food production by itself accounts for close to a quarter of all greenhouse emissions in the world. MARTIN: Are any of those things biofuels? Because the report specifically calls out biofuels. CHARLES: Biofuels is an interesting question. Biofuels have been presented as a solution to climate change because you're getting fuel basically from the sun and from the Earth instead of burning coal or natural gas. The thing about biofuels is you need land. And remember, land is scarce, especially if you're trying to increase food production. And so that increases the demand for agricultural land. And it - if you do it on a large scale, it means cutting down more forests, you know, plowing up more grasslands. Maybe the land would be better just as it is growing grass and putting carbon back in the soil. MARTIN: So these are all the problems, which are big and dire and overwhelming, to be frank. What about solutions? I mean, if the U. N. report is issuing yet another warning linking climate change and our inability to address it with a global food crisis, what do scientists right now say needs to be done? CHARLES: So there are actually solutions. This doesn't have to be, you know, all gloom and doom and dire. OK, so let's start with stopping the cutting-down of more forests. That's, like, point one. And so you continue to grow more food on the same amount of land, ideally less land. MARTIN: How do you do that, though? (Laughter). CHARLES: Well, productivity has been increasing. And there is plenty of technological scope for increasing production more. Another side of this is shifting diets. We have a vast amount of land that is devoted, for instance, to feeding animals for meat. Shifts in diet away from meat could also free up more land, either for growing trees, putting carbon back in the soil, or for growing more fruits and vegetables to feed more people. MARTIN: All right. NPR's Dan Charles, helping us understand this new warning being issued by the U. N. We appreciate it, Dan. Thank you. CHARLES: Glad to be here.

It's that yellow flower you often see growing along highways. A scientist was recently studying goldenrods and discovered something phenomenal. As NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports, it's a small creature that has no arms, legs or wings but nonetheless performs a remarkable feat. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Plants defend themselves from hungry insects, and Mike Wise studies that at Roanoke College in Virginia. A few years ago, he was dissecting tumor-like swelling on goldenrod. These growths form around little maggot-like things that are the larvae of developing flies. MIKE WISE: And the larvae get as big, when they're full grown, as a small grain of rice. GREENFIELDBOYCE: They look like bright orange tiny worms. WISE: And generally I take the larvae out and put them in a little dish next to my microscope, and they barely move. They may wiggle around just a little bit. GREENFIELDBOYCE: On this day, he'd spend about an hour removing a dozen or so. But then he looked in the dish, and they were gone. WISE: I was wondering what was going on. And then I caught out of the corner of my eye a little bit of motion, a little orange larva jumping across my table. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The larvae were leaping. WISE: I looked on the floor, and there had been some that had jumped all the way to the wall. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But how? They don't have anything critters normally use to jump. To understand this, he brought bouquets of goldenrod to Sheila Patek. She's a biologist at Duke University who studies small extremely fast things like the deadly strike of the mantis shrimp or the snapping bite of trap-jaw ants. SHEILA PATEK: I know that sounds super quirky, but it turns out that this arena of biology is a very interesting one. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Because these creatures do stuff that engineers can only dream of. Her lab filmed Wise's leaping larvae with some of the world's best high-speed cameras. PATEK: You know, he'd get one out and put it in a tray. And I'd be like, oh, OK, yeah, well, there it is. And the next thing you know, this tiny little thing is curling up into a loop. And the next thing you know, it's gone. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Curling up into a loop turns out to be critical. Patek says, if you were one of these little guys, you'd first curl up so that a special patch of hair on your head sticks to a patch of hair on your rear end. Then you'd need to squeeze fluid through your soft body to stiffen up the part that's against the ground. PATEK: And you keep doing that, and you keep doing that, and you keep doing that until suddenly you've generated enough force that it unsticks the hairs between your head and the tail, and you are suddenly airborne. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The findings in the Journal of Experimental Biology have impressed Sarah Bergbreiter. She's a mechanical engineer at Carnegie Mellon University who says there's a lot of interest these days in robots that are soft instead of rigid and clanky (ph). SARAH BERGBREITER: One of the really cool things about it is that these are soft-bodied jumpers. That means they're squishy, and they can jump over 30 body lengths. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says that's comparable to fleas, which we think of as great jumpers. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  This is the time of year when goldenrod blooms.

Its name is One World. But you won't find it being spritzed around the perfume department at Macy's. This fragrance was designed to be pumped into the observatory space at One World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan. According to a recent story in The New York Times, not everyone likes the idea of a scented public space. One tourist described the smell as sickly. That's not what the observatory's managing director intended. He says he wanted it to elicit a, quote, \"positive thought\" about One World. Dr. Alan Hirsch is neurological director of the Smell and Taste Treatment and Research Foundation in Chicago, and he joins us to talk about the psychology of pumped-in fragrances. Dr. Hirsch, welcome to the program. ALAN HIRSCH: Well, thank you for having me. PFEIFFER: How can smells affect the mood of people in public places? HIRSCH: Well, the quickest way to change somebody's mood or behavior is with smell because a part of the brain that we think smell - the olfactory lobe is actually part of the limbic system or the emotional brain. So when you smell a smell, you immediately decide, I like it, or, I don't like it, and then you figure out what it is, which is totally different than all the other sensory spheres. So for instance, you see a picture of a cow or a tree or a horse, you identify it, and then you'll decide if you like it or not. It's totally different with smell. With smell, it's a purely emotional sense. PFEIFFER: And a bad aroma can put us in a bad mood. HIRSCH: Exactly. Not only will pleasant odors induce people to be in a happier state, but an unpleasant or irritating aroma can make somebody be more aggressive and angry. If it happens to be an aroma that your ex-wife wore, or ex-boyfriend, and you have a negative feeling towards them, you develop the same emotions when you're exposed to those aromas. PFEIFFER: Right, it's very subjective. I'm thinking about different stores I've walked into that had intentional smells, like the smell of cinnamon at Yankee Candle or Subway sandwich chain piping out the smell of bread. How common is it for buildings or building managers to inject fragrances or odors to enhance a visit? HIRSCH: Well, far less than 1% of stores - probably closer to 0. 1%, partially because we're such a heterogeneous society. So for instance, not only do different individuals have different perceptions of whether they like or dislike the aroma, but also, they have different abilities to smell. So women have a far better ability to smell than men do. As you get older, your sense of smell drops down. So about half of those over the age of 65 and three-quarters of those over the age of 80 have a reduced ability to smell. On top of that, in the morning time, one's sense of smell is far greater than later in the day. And if you've just eaten, your sense of smell is even - it reduced even more. So what happens is all of us are walking around with different abilities to smell and with a different perception of what's pleasant and what's unpleasant. PFEIFFER: Does that mean that many stores are reluctant to try to impose a certain scent on us? HIRSCH: Well, that's right. Part of it is that what happens is as we've experimented with different aromas, we find that the odors that people like - say they like are not necessarily what they actually do like. So when you come into a store, and let's say you're selling leather goods, when we experimented and tried to put a leather smell there, people disliked it. We finally put a combination of leather, baby powder and citrus. They found it in a more positive way and, hence, stayed in the store longer. Similarly, certain odors are incongruent with what one is looking at. So for instance, when the smell of fish was present in a store that sold clothing, people left the area because they didn't like the smell of fish. It was not contextually appropriate for what was being sold. So you have to make sure the odor is appropriate. On top of that, people want to see where the odor is coming from. They don't like the idea that they're being manipulated by an aroma in the environment. So if there's flowers there, having a floral aroma would be appropriate. Having a smell of bread baking, on the other hand, would not be. PFEIFFER: There is research that suggests that music in stores can affect people's buying habits or, for example, how quickly they eat in a restaurant. Do smells have similar effects? HIRSCH: Absolutely. For instance, we found a mixed floral smell increased speed of learning by 84% compared to a no-odor condition. Also can impact upon, for instance, perception of room size. We found that a smell of cucumber and green apple made people perceive a room as larger, whereas the smell of barbecued, roasted meat - they'll perceive it as smaller. PFEIFFER: Dr. Hirsch, I'm wondering if you personally have any environments where the smell puts you in a good mood. HIRSCH: Oh, well, I always like to smell chocolate chip cookies. That doesn't necessarily mean I want chocolate chip cookie smell around when I'm buying a suit. But still, a pleasant aroma that makes us happy, that makes us nostalgic for our childhood tends to induce a positive state, and, thus, we view everything around us in a more positive way. PFEIFFER: Dr. Alan Hirsch is neurological director of the Smell and Taste Treatment and Research Foundation in Chicago. Dr. Hirsch, thanks for talking with us. HIRSCH: Thank you.

So when you smell a smell, you immediately decide, I like it, or, I don't like it, and then you figure out what it is, which is totally different than all the other sensory spheres. So for instance, you see a picture of a cow or a tree or a horse, you identify it, and then you'll decide if you like it or not. It's totally different with smell. With smell, it's a purely emotional sense. PFEIFFER: And a bad aroma can put us in a bad mood. HIRSCH: Exactly. Not only will pleasant odors induce people to be in a happier state, but an unpleasant or irritating aroma can make somebody be more aggressive and angry. If it happens to be an aroma that your ex-wife wore, or ex-boyfriend, and you have a negative feeling towards them, you develop the same emotions when you're exposed to those aromas. PFEIFFER: Right, it's very subjective. I'm thinking about different stores I've walked into that had intentional smells, like the smell of cinnamon at Yankee Candle or Subway sandwich chain piping out the smell of bread. How common is it for buildings or building managers to inject fragrances or odors to enhance a visit? HIRSCH: Well, far less than 1% of stores - probably closer to 0. 1%, partially because we're such a heterogeneous society. So for instance, not only do different individuals have different perceptions of whether they like or dislike the aroma, but also, they have different abilities to smell. So women have a far better ability to smell than men do. As you get older, your sense of smell drops down. So about half of those over the age of 65 and three-quarters of those over the age of 80 have a reduced ability to smell. On top of that, in the morning time, one's sense of smell is far greater than later in the day. And if you've just eaten, your sense of smell is even - it reduced even more. So what happens is all of us are walking around with different abilities to smell and with a different perception of what's pleasant and what's unpleasant. PFEIFFER: Does that mean that many stores are reluctant to try to impose a certain scent on us? HIRSCH: Well, that's right. Part of it is that what happens is as we've experimented with different aromas, we find that the odors that people like - say they like are not necessarily what they actually do like. So when you come into a store, and let's say you're selling leather goods, when we experimented and tried to put a leather smell there, people disliked it. We finally put a combination of leather, baby powder and citrus. They found it in a more positive way and, hence, stayed in the store longer. Similarly, certain odors are incongruent with what one is looking at. So for instance, when the smell of fish was present in a store that sold clothing, people left the area because they didn't like the smell of fish. It was not contextually appropriate for what was being sold. So you have to make sure the odor is appropriate. On top of that, people want to see where the odor is coming from. They don't like the idea that they're being manipulated by an aroma in the environment. So if there's flowers there, having a floral aroma would be appropriate. Having a smell of bread baking, on the other hand, would not be. PFEIFFER: There is research that suggests that music in stores can affect people's buying habits or, for example, how quickly they eat in a restaurant. Do smells have similar effects? HIRSCH: Absolutely. For instance, we found a mixed floral smell increased speed of learning by 84% compared to a no-odor condition. Also can impact upon, for instance, perception of room size. We found that a smell of cucumber and green apple made people perceive a room as larger, whereas the smell of barbecued, roasted meat - they'll perceive it as smaller. PFEIFFER: Dr. Hirsch, I'm wondering if you personally have any environments where the smell puts you in a good mood. HIRSCH: Oh, well, I always like to smell chocolate chip cookies. That doesn't necessarily mean I want chocolate chip cookie smell around when I'm buying a suit. But still, a pleasant aroma that makes us happy, that makes us nostalgic for our childhood tends to induce a positive state, and, thus, we view everything around us in a more positive way. PFEIFFER: Dr. Alan Hirsch is neurological director of the Smell and Taste Treatment and Research Foundation in Chicago. Dr. Hirsch, thanks for talking with us. HIRSCH: Thank you.

As I was hanging out at the Smithsonian National Zoo's naked mole rat exhibit in Washington, D. C. , I heard a lot of those two reactions. First, the ew.

KENTON KERNS: I always feel like, no, come back. Let us tell you what you're running away from. But I get it. It's like - it's deep. When you see a naked mole rat, for some people, it's like a - it hits you really deep that that's not something I want to look at anymore (laughter). HUANG: Naked mole rats are pink rodents about the size of small sweet potatoes. They're mostly hairless and wrinkled and blind. They're cute to me, but a lot of people think they're gross. They're on full display at the zoo through tons of windows and a big wall that looks like red clay dirt. KERNS: So that's definitely the queen right there. HUANG: You can see all the different chambers the naked mole rats use for eating, sleeping and digging and all the tunnels that connect them. KERNS: And that's their toilet chambers. So she's going to the bathroom right now. So this is prime viewing right here at the Small Mammal House. HUANG: They're eusocial, which means they live all crowded together in a colony with a queen who has babies and a bunch of workers who do everything else. That's like how ants and termites live, except mole rats are a lot bigger, and they're mammals. As for the oh, or why naked mole rats are so amazing, that eusocial community structure evolved to help them gut it out in harsh environments and raise their babies, says researcher Stan Braude. STAN BRAUDE: I mean, if you think about being, you know, the size of a cocktail hot dog and everybody out there on the African plains wants a snack, it's not an easy life. HUANG: Braude studies naked mole rats in the wild. He's a biologist at Washington University in St. Louis, and he's tracked colonies of them in East Africa for 30 years. He says naked mole rats were the very first eusocial mammals that scientists discovered. They live underground in tunnels they dig with their long front teeth. They don't drink water, and they don't get much oxygen. BRAUDE: It was this weird environment that led to this solution to surviving and reproducing as a helpless tiny, little rodent. HUANG: Living underground allows naked mole rats to divide up the labor, so they can stay safe and find enough food. Eileen Lacey is a biology professor and curator of mammals at UC, Berkeley. She says these days, researchers are studying naked mole rats for their super survival traits. EILEEN LACEY: They live forever, you know, whatever their physiology is that they don't age. You know, they're cancer resistant. I mean, it just seems like now they do everything (laughter). HUANG: Naked mole rats are the longest-living rodent that we know of. Some are over 30 years old. They don't feel pain from stinging ants. And they slow down with age, but they rarely get cancer. Back at the zoo, the naked mole rats are living their best lives. KERNS: Right now, they're just kind of hanging out. They're moving around, looking for food, seeing what everybody else is up to, moving around shavings, going to the bathroom - normal mole rat things.

NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam looks at the relationship between our voices and our identities. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: In 2013, surgeons gave Jacki Kirk a new set of lungs. It was her second lung transplant. She had been diagnosed with a condition that made it hard for her body to distribute oxygen. JACKI KIRK: I had the surgery in January of 2013, and I was asleep still for another month and a half. VEDANTAM: When she woke up, her surgery was successful - except for one important thing. KIRK: I couldn't speak (laughter). I couldn't speak. VEDANTAM: During the operation, a ventilator tube damaged her vocal cords. Kirk slowly regained the ability to speak, but the voice that emerged from her didn't feel like her voice. That led to a change in her personality. KIRK: I feel less confident. I'm aware of how people might perceive me. You know, I have tons of scars all over my body, and that that plays on my confidence as well. But in public life, people can't see those scars. And I feel like my voice is that, you know, that scar they can hear, you know. It's this signal. VEDANTAM: Voices convey so much more than information. They communicate feelings, temperament, personality. For more than two centuries, scientists have been trying to incorporate the psychological insight into their work to recreate the human voice. All the way back in 1939, Homer Dudley unveiled an organ-like machine he called a Voder. It worked using special keys and a foot pedal, and it fascinated people at the World's Fair in New York. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Helen (ph), would you have the Voder say, she saw me? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: She saw me. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: That sounded awfully flat. How about a little expression? Say the sentence and answer to these questions. Who saw you? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: She saw me. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Whom did she see? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: She saw me. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Well, did she see you or hear you? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: She saw me. VEDANTAM: Over the next 40 years, speech scientists continued to study the human voice. Research by MIT's Dennis Klatt in the 1980s paved the way for some of the synthetic voices we are familiar with today, many of them used in assistive communication devices. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)BEAUTIFUL BETTY: I am Beautiful Betty, the standard female voice. HUGE HARRY: I am Huge Harry, a very large. . . KIT THE KID: My name is Kit the Kid, and I am about. . . PERFECT PAUL: I am the standard male voice, Perfect Paul. VEDANTAM: Speech technology has come a long way over the years, but in many ways, synthetic voices still sound synthetic. They don't convey all the emotional information that's packed into the human voice. RUPAL PATEL: Voice is identity, right? Voice is about who you are. Our voice signals how old we are. Our voice signals our gender. Our voice signals, you know, things about our personality. VEDANTAM: This is Northeastern University speech scientist Rupal Patel. In 2014, she launched a company called VocaliD. Her goal was to build synthetic speech that captured the richness and personality of natural speech. Patel uses machine learning and other artificial intelligence technologies to create personalized voices. Sometimes these are developed for people whose voices are impaired by disorders. Other times, the technology can be used to preserve a person's existing voice. PATEL: These could be individuals who are losing their voice to degenerative conditions. So slowly their voice is changing, such as ALS or Parkinson's disease. And then those who - the trauma is actually far more pronounced for individuals with something like head and neck cancer, where they learn that they're going to have their voice box removed within a couple of weeks. VEDANTAM: Lonnie Blanchard confronted this traumatic news in 2018. Doctors diagnosed him with cancer and said they had to remove his tongue. Before his surgery, Patel worked with him to build a database of sound samples. He recorded sentences that gave Patel and her colleagues raw material for a new custom-built synthetic voice. LONNIE BLANCHARD: I wish we could get acquainted. I'm going to be a teacher when I grow up. VEDANTAM: Blanchard now uses his personalized voice through an iPad. BLANCHARD: Once you close your eyes and let your mind relax, it doesn't take long to escape to the beautiful beach. VEDANTAM: Patel says, even though voice synthesis technology has made major strides in recent years, there's still a long way to go. PATEL: Ideally, in the future, these decisions are made by the end user themselves - like, oh, I actually want that to be - sound a little breathier. I'd love that to sound a little bit more confident. And, I mean, how does that translate to the acoustics? We don't quite know yet. But that's actually, I think, where - when we can finally give the control of what the voice sounds like to the individual, I mean, that's the Holy Grail. VEDANTAM: Shankar Vedantam, NPR News.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, Anthropomorphic - ideas about how we interact with animals and how those interactions help us understand the world and our place in it. And for our next Ted speaker. . . DENISE HERZING: So I'm Denise Herzing. RAZ: Animal interactions have been her life's work. HERZING: I'm the research director of the Wild Dolphin Project, and we work in the Bahamas. RAZ: I've seen lots of pictures of you underwater, holding a camera. When you're down there. . . (SOUNDBITE OF WATER RUSHING)RAZ: Does it feel like it's almost like - I don't know - like, just a better place to be? I don't - do you ever get that feeling? HERZING: Well, you know, it's an immersion into a three-dimensional world. You know, the tides and the currents and the salt and the waves and - I mean, that all feeds into your understanding of what their world is like. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)HERZING: But, usually, when I'm down there, I'm, like, trying to follow behavior and making sure my camera's on. RAZ: Right. HERZING: It's actually mostly work, really. RAZ: Right. Denise Herzing has been doing that work every summer with the same group of dolphins in the Bahamas. . . HERZING: Let's see. I just calculated it recently. RAZ: . . . For 35 years. HERZING: Yeah, like, 3,000 encounters in the water with the dolphins, and then each of those encounters is about 20 minutes long, so. . . RAZ: Over 1,000 hours of footage and observational data. HERZING: So, yeah, it's a lot of data, certainly, for dolphins. RAZ: And the point of all that data, of all that work, is to help Denise answer one question. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HERZING: Do they have a language? And if so, what are they talking about? RAZ: Here's Denise Herzing on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HERZING: Now, I'm interested in dolphins because of their large brains, and we know they use some of that brainpower for just living complicated lives. But what do we really know about dolphin intelligence? Well, we know a few things. We know that their brain-to-body ratio, which is a physical measure of intelligence, is second only to humans. Cognitively, they can understand artificially created languages, and they pass self-awareness tests in mirrors. And in some parts of the world, they use tools like sponges to hunt fish. Now, dolphins are natural acousticians. They make sounds 10 times as high and hear sounds 10 times as high as we do, but they have other communication signals they use. They have good vision, so they use body postures to communicate. They have taste not smell, and they have touch. And sound can actually be felt in the water because the acoustic impedance of tissue in water is about the same, so dolphins can buzz and tickle each other at a distance. So decades ago - not years ago - I set out to find a place in the world where I could observe dolphins underwater to try to crack the code of their communication system. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Well, first of all, how do dolphins communicate to each other? HERZING: Well, you know, we can actually hear a fair amount. Their whistles are fairly audible to us. (SOUNDBITE OF DOLPHIN WHISTLING)HERZING: They have clicks. (SOUNDBITE OF DOLPHIN CLICKING)HERZING: They have burst pulses, which are also. . . (SOUNDBITE OF DOLPHIN CLICKING)HERZING: . . . Packets of clicks. (SOUNDBITE OF DOLPHIN CLICKING)HERZING: So they have all these different cues, and they, you know, use body postures in combination with sounds that will basically communicate certain things to each other. RAZ: You know, this is total anthropomorphization (ph), but, like, when you think of - like, when you see a dolphin animated or drawn in a kid's book, they seem to be smiling. But I - we should not interpolate that that means that they're happy all the time, right? HERZING: Oh, definitely not, yeah. That is just a physical thing that they have going, yeah. RAZ: How do you respond when other researchers say - you know, push back and say, hey, like, let's not do that; let's not anthropomorphize these creatures? HERZING: You know, you just keep doing your work, I think. I don't even think it's a discussion anymore, honestly. Most of us that work with social mammals, I think, have kind of moved beyond that and just say, well, it's a valuable tool for thinking about how they might think. And let's do the work. RAZ: Is it even weird to talk about dolphin language? Or is it - should we be talking about dolphin communication? HERZING: Yeah, we don't really usually talk about language because we don't know if they have it yet. But thinking out of the box is - you know, it's like intelligence. You know, are there different kinds and types of intelligence? Are there different kinds and types of language? I mean, we know there's tons of kinds of language with humans, right? RAZ: Yeah. HERZING: But one of the big things about language is that you can communicate about a different time and space, right? Are they talking about the food they're chasing? Are they eating? Or are they talking about - hey, let's go to the reef in a couple days and meet up with this other group? You know, we don't know. And that's where, you know, anthropomorphism can be a tool for thinking about how animals might be thinking. RAZ: Which brings us back to the Bahamas and a pivotal moment in Denise Herzing's years of work with Atlantic spotted dolphins there. It happened one summer. . . HERZING: I guess in the mid-'90s. . . RAZ: The dolphins did something they had never done with Denise before. HERZING: We just started noticing the dolphins would just start doing things - and this is completely wild, right? But we knew the individuals, and they would start doing things like mimicking our body posture; in some cases, mimicking, like, the rhythm of our sounds in the water if we were doing anything vocally. And we just kind of thought, man, wouldn't it be cool to see if we empowered them to communicate back to us? RAZ: And the key to unlocking that communication turned out to be play. Dolphins, just like humans, love to play games, mostly with toys - a piece of rope, a bit of seaweed, anything they can pull around in the water. HERZING: Correct. RAZ: So what kind of games do they like to play? HERZING: Well, it's mostly called keep-away. That is, if they get the toy, then the idea is - they like to be chased. They like to let you get almost close enough to grab the toy, but then they speed off. And that's the game. That's how they play with each other, actually. RAZ: The only question was how to use that play to crack the code - the code that would unlock the meaning behind the dolphins' noises. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HERZING: Now, one way to crack the code is to interpret these signals and figure out what they mean. But it's a difficult job, and we actually don't have a Rosetta stone yet. But a second way to crack the code is to develop some technology, an interface to do two-way communication. And that's what we've been trying to do in the Bahamas and in real time. So we built a portable keyboard that we'd push through the water, and we labeled four objects they'd like to play with - the scarf, rope, Sargassum and also had a bow ride, which is a fun activity for a dolphin. (SOUNDBITE OF DOLPHIN WHISTLING)HERZING: And that's the scarf whistle, and these are artificially created whistles. They're outside the dolphins' normal repertoire, but they're easily mimicked by the dolphins. And I spent four years with my colleagues Adam Pack and Fabienne Delfour working out in the field with this keyboard, using it with each other to do requests for toys while the dolphins were watching. And the dolphins could get in on the game. They could point at the visual object, or they could mimic the whistle. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Another way to imagine this experiment, Denise says, is think of how you try to teach words to a baby. HERZING: And you're trying to get them to understand the word milk. So you have a glass of milk, and you're going. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HERZING: Here's some milk. Or, do you want the milk? Or would you like some milk? So we're not really teaching them commands. We're exposing them to the communication system with the hopes that they'll learn to use it to communicate back to us what they want. RAZ: OK, so an underwater keyboard - four buttons, each with a different whistle sound for a different toy. HERZING: So the dolphins were actually doing really cool things like - we would play a computer whistle, say, like (imitating dolphin whistle) for Sargassum, which is a piece of seaweed they play with. (Imitating dolphin whistle). And the dolphins would immediately tag on another whistle to the end of the computer whistle. RAZ: So yeah. The answer to the question - do dolphins have a language? - is maybe, kind of. They certainly have a desire to communicate. So now Denise and her fellow researchers are teaming up with a group of computer scientists to use machine learning to try to parse and analyze those extra whistles and figure out what they might mean. HERZING: So that's actually what we're going to be doing late this summer. RAZ: Well, like, when an anthropologist stumbles on a discovery and some ancient tablet - right? - they can spend a lifetime trying to decipher it and then figure out what the symbols meant. But that's a physical thing that you can look at, right? I mean. . . HERZING: Right. RAZ: . . . You can imagine that this is a version of that. But with increasing computing power, I mean, you could potentially imagine a scenario where the hieroglyphics, so to speak, in dolphin communication could be decoded. HERZING: Yeah, well, that's what we're working on. I mean, remember, you know, hieroglyphs is a written language. . . RAZ: Sure. HERZING: . . . And that's something that dolphins will never have. At least I can't imagine it. But, you know, maybe they have an oral history that they produce like humans did - right? - before we even had writing. But yeah, I have no doubt that machine learning's really going to help us parse out the information. RAZ: So if you or I went to Europe 20 years ago, we would have a little phrase book, and that might be all we had. And now you can just speak into Google Translate, and then it will - and then you can play it, and it will play it for someone. You can imagine, in 20 or 30 years from now, traveling to Asia and speaking in real time and having, like, a headset around your head that was a simultaneous translator, an AI translator that would enable you to have a really serious and deep conversation with somebody in their language. HERZING: Yeah, sure. I mean, that's probably coming in shorter than 20 years, I would bet. RAZ: Yeah. Right. HERZING: And, you know, what's really interesting is if you look at how other animals communicate with each other - and they do, right? We're way behind the times because we don't have to communicate with animals, right? But there are a lot of birds that really know the alarm calls of their neighboring species because it helps them survive. So nature already communicates in many ways just without us in the loop. So we probably should get in the loop. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: That's Denise Herzing. She's the research director of the Wild Dolphin Project. Her full talk is at ted. com.

I'm Guy Raz. So about a year ago, something really remarkable happened, and you might remember hearing about this. It was a story about a pod of orcas and one whale in particular. Is it Tahluquah (ph)? BARBARA KING: Tahlequah. RAZ: Tahlequah, right. KING: Tahlequah, yeah. RAZ: This is Barbara King. Barbara's a biological anthropologist. KING: For 28 years, I taught at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg. RAZ: And a year ago, Barbara was paying close attention to Tahlequah. KING: Yeah, so Tahlequah was with her pod, which is the J pod in the Salish Sea, and that's off of British Columbia and Washington state. And we do know that this pod is suffering. RAZ: Actually, orcas in the entire region are endangered. KING: There's a lot of problems with pollution in the area, and there'd been no baby that had survived in three whole years. RAZ: So it was a big deal that Tahlequah was about to give birth. KING: And so everybody cheered when this daughter was born. RAZ: But pretty soon after that birth. . . KING: I'm not sure anybody knows why, but within hours, the baby died. And then Tahlequah has the body of her baby on her back. And, you know, in the beginning, it was sort of expected. Oh, you know, the mom will carry the baby for a day or two. This is common. And what became profoundly different about this was the length and the extremity of what she did. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: That is the sound of a female orca carrying her dead calf in the water, keeping it afloat since her baby died a week ago. KING: She carried that baby for a thousand miles. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Tahlequah has carried her calf, and the world has been captivated by this vigil. KING: If the baby slipped off into the water, she would retrieve the baby. If she needed to be away from her pod because they were going faster than she could go, she would stay by herself. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: A mother orca whose calf died after birth is still carrying her baby 17 days later. KING: So the question, of course, became, what is she doing? And why is she doing it? RAZ: So what do you think? KING: As I think of it, this fits a pattern in a certain way or a mother or some other animal simply doesn't walk away - or swim away, in this case - from the body. And some people just want to say it's because they're stressed, and I would really want to go a different way and say I think we're seeing grief here. RAZ: So you look at this, and you say, to me, this is an expression of grief. This is a parent mourning the loss of its child. KING: Yes, I would say that because we're never going to know to 100% certainty in any given case what an animal is feeling. But I am looking at the visible cues that animals give us, and I think Tahlequah gave us lots of cues that she was very distressed, that this connection was the important thing for her with this individual animal who was no longer breathing. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KING: So today, Tahlequah swims on with the J pod, but her grief still moves me. RAZ: Barbara King picks up the idea from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KING: And I do believe that grief is the right word to use. I believe that grief is the right word to use for numerous animals who mourn the dead. They may be friends or mates or relatives. Now, for the last seven years, I've been working to document examples of animal grief in birds, in mammals, in domesticated animals and in wild animals. And I believe in the reality of animal grief. Now, I say it this way because I need to acknowledge to you right up front that not all scientists agree with me. And part of the reason, I think, is because of what I call the A word. The A word is anthropomorphism. And historically, it's been a big deterrent to recognizing animal emotions. So anthropomorphism is when we project onto other animals our capacities or our emotions, and we can all probably think of examples of this. Let's say we have a friend who tells us, my cat understands everything I say, or, my dog, he's so sweet. He ran right across the yard this morning towards a squirrel, and I know he just wants to play. Well, maybe or maybe not. I'm skeptical about claims like those. But animal grief is different because we're not trying to read an animal's mind. We're looking at visible cues of behavior and trying to interpret them with some meaning. Now, it's true. Scientists often push back at me. And they'll say, ah, look. The animal might be stressed or maybe the animal is just confused because his or her routine has been disrupted. But I think that this over-worry about anthropomorphism misses a fundamental point because these visible cues, these behavioral cues, tell us something about an animal's emotional state. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: We evaluate human grief through language, right? Obviously, with animals, they can't do that. And you can understand why some people might be skeptical of this research. KING: I do understand the pushback that we get, and I think that it's very important to get that pushback and to get that criticism. It's exactly what science is good at. When I get a comment from someone saying, tell me the difference between stress and grief in case X or case Y, or why do you really think that this isn't an example of anthropomorphism, I learned from that process of really going over the alternative possibilities. But behind all of these questions really lurks the concept of human exceptionalism because still, a lot of scientists would like to think that we are exceptional in our emotional abilities. And I am trying to push back against that and not start from a starting point where certain emotions are uniquely human. If that's your starting point, you're never going to see them in other animals, whether they're present or not. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Animals can act in ways that are pretty familiar to us. And for a long time, scientists resisted the urge to anthropomorphize or to look for human qualities in animals. But now some of the world's most pre-eminent biologists and researchers are asking questions like, do animals grieve in ways we can recognize? Do they have consciousness or a comprehensive language or the ability to empathize like us? So today on the show, we're rethinking anthropomorphism and looking at ways that animals may be more like humans than we ever thought before and how those similarities might help us better understand our own place in the world. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: And for Barbara King, her own thinking about animals and grief changed when she started researching elephants. KING: Pretty quickly as I started reading, I was convinced that elephant grief is real. So we know that these are big-brained, highly social mammals. They live in family groups. Elephants are the touchstone species in a certain sense in that we have peer-reviewed science publications showing that elephants respond around a body with a vigil, with distressed body movement - all sorts of things that fit my definition of grief. Cynthia Moss is a tremendous long-term elephant researcher in Kenya, and she has described elephants crossing a plain or a savannah and diverting towards bones - dried, bleached elephant bones sitting there in the sun - and a particular elephant spending more time caressing a particular skull. RAZ: Wow. KING: And she knows from her long-term records who had died there, and she knows that the animal caressing those bones is a relative of that dead individual. That just blows my mind. RAZ: That's amazing. KING: And I just kept going. I started to expand and broaden the question and say, if elephants grieve, how about our closest living relative, monkeys and apes? That was pretty clearly a yes, but I started asking about animals as wide as farmed animals and companion animals like bunnies and cats and rabbits. And I kept coming up with more and more yeses. So once I started asking and started looking, it became clear to me that there was a whole just - the elephants are the tip of the iceberg, and there's so much more to talk about here. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KING: So will science tell us someday about bereaved bees? Will we hear about frogs who mourn? I don't think so, and I think the reason is because animals really need one-to-one close relationships for that to happen. I also know that circumstance matters and personality matters. In any case, animals are not going to grieve exactly like we do. We have human creativity. We paint our grief, dance our grief, write our grief. We also can grieve for people we've never met across space and time. Animals don't grieve exactly like we do, but this doesn't mean that their grief isn't real. It is real, and it's searing. And we can see it if we choose. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: If it's true that certain species of animals that we are very familiar with experience grief, as this - as our knowledge of these experiences becomes better and clearer, it becomes more challenging to kind of confront the decisions we make as humans. KING: It certainly does. This has become, in recent years, the driving impetus for what I'm doing because what does this mean for animal-human relationships? What does this mean for the ethics of how we understand these fellow travelers, you know, on our planet and how we treat animals, including questions of who we eat? I wrote a whole book about who we eat, and the extension of my work to farm animals changed my thinking just revolutionarily so and changed what I eat to quite a bit as well. It's been very convenient for all of us, and I do include myself, to think of farmed animals, ranging from chickens and pigs and cows and ducks, as being not so smart and certainly not capable of profound emotion. It's convenient because we want them on our plates, so plant-based eating has become just superbly important to me. RAZ: I mean, I think, to me, what's weird about the pushback against anthropomorphism is that if we identify with animals in the same way we identify with other humans, it's inevitably going to create more empathy for animals and other human animals. KING: That is such a wonderful point because sometimes, I'm asked, you know, why are you agitating for animals when there's so much human suffering in the world? But you're absolutely right because empathy begets empathy. And when we raise our children to care and empathize with animals and to see their cues of how these animals are thinking and feeling in the world, I think it's only going to multiply upon itself. And isn't that what it's all about? We really want to see each other for who we are, and what I'm suggesting is that the part of empathy that's so important is to see that their lives matter to them profoundly. They spend their days thinking and feeling, and it's up to us to see that and to take some action when we realize it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: That's Barbara King. She's a professor of biological anthropology. You can see her entire talk at ted. com. On the show today, Anthropomorphic - how we relate to animals. Stay with us. I'm Guy Raz, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. So about a year ago, something really remarkable happened, and you might remember hearing about this. It was a story about a pod of orcas and one whale in particular. Is it Tahluquah (ph)? BARBARA KING: Tahlequah. RAZ: Tahlequah, right. KING: Tahlequah, yeah. RAZ: This is Barbara King. Barbara's a biological anthropologist. KING: For 28 years, I taught at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg. RAZ: And a year ago, Barbara was paying close attention to Tahlequah. KING: Yeah, so Tahlequah was with her pod, which is the J pod in the Salish Sea, and that's off of British Columbia and Washington state. And we do know that this pod is suffering. RAZ: Actually, orcas in the entire region are endangered. KING: There's a lot of problems with pollution in the area, and there'd been no baby that had survived in three whole years. RAZ: So it was a big deal that Tahlequah was about to give birth. KING: And so everybody cheered when this daughter was born. RAZ: But pretty soon after that birth. . . KING: I'm not sure anybody knows why, but within hours, the baby died. And then Tahlequah has the body of her baby on her back. And, you know, in the beginning, it was sort of expected. Oh, you know, the mom will carry the baby for a day or two. This is common. And what became profoundly different about this was the length and the extremity of what she did. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: That is the sound of a female orca carrying her dead calf in the water, keeping it afloat since her baby died a week ago. KING: She carried that baby for a thousand miles. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Tahlequah has carried her calf, and the world has been captivated by this vigil. KING: If the baby slipped off into the water, she would retrieve the baby. If she needed to be away from her pod because they were going faster than she could go, she would stay by herself. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: A mother orca whose calf died after birth is still carrying her baby 17 days later. KING: So the question, of course, became, what is she doing? And why is she doing it? RAZ: So what do you think? KING: As I think of it, this fits a pattern in a certain way or a mother or some other animal simply doesn't walk away - or swim away, in this case - from the body. And some people just want to say it's because they're stressed, and I would really want to go a different way and say I think we're seeing grief here. RAZ: So you look at this, and you say, to me, this is an expression of grief. This is a parent mourning the loss of its child. KING: Yes, I would say that because we're never going to know to 100% certainty in any given case what an animal is feeling. But I am looking at the visible cues that animals give us, and I think Tahlequah gave us lots of cues that she was very distressed, that this connection was the important thing for her with this individual animal who was no longer breathing. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) KING: So today, Tahlequah swims on with the J pod, but her grief still moves me. RAZ: Barbara King picks up the idea from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) KING: And I do believe that grief is the right word to use. I believe that grief is the right word to use for numerous animals who mourn the dead. They may be friends or mates or relatives. Now, for the last seven years, I've been working to document examples of animal grief in birds, in mammals, in domesticated animals and in wild animals. And I believe in the reality of animal grief. Now, I say it this way because I need to acknowledge to you right up front that not all scientists agree with me. And part of the reason, I think, is because of what I call the A word. The A word is anthropomorphism. And historically, it's been a big deterrent to recognizing animal emotions. So anthropomorphism is when we project onto other animals our capacities or our emotions, and we can all probably think of examples of this. Let's say we have a friend who tells us, my cat understands everything I say, or, my dog, he's so sweet. He ran right across the yard this morning towards a squirrel, and I know he just wants to play. Well, maybe or maybe not. I'm skeptical about claims like those. But animal grief is different because we're not trying to read an animal's mind. We're looking at visible cues of behavior and trying to interpret them with some meaning. Now, it's true. Scientists often push back at me. And they'll say, ah, look. The animal might be stressed or maybe the animal is just confused because his or her routine has been disrupted. But I think that this over-worry about anthropomorphism misses a fundamental point because these visible cues, these behavioral cues, tell us something about an animal's emotional state. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: We evaluate human grief through language, right? Obviously, with animals, they can't do that. And you can understand why some people might be skeptical of this research. KING: I do understand the pushback that we get, and I think that it's very important to get that pushback and to get that criticism. It's exactly what science is good at. When I get a comment from someone saying, tell me the difference between stress and grief in case X or case Y, or why do you really think that this isn't an example of anthropomorphism, I learned from that process of really going over the alternative possibilities. But behind all of these questions really lurks the concept of human exceptionalism because still, a lot of scientists would like to think that we are exceptional in our emotional abilities. And I am trying to push back against that and not start from a starting point where certain emotions are uniquely human. If that's your starting point, you're never going to see them in other animals, whether they're present or not. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: Animals can act in ways that are pretty familiar to us. And for a long time, scientists resisted the urge to anthropomorphize or to look for human qualities in animals. But now some of the world's most pre-eminent biologists and researchers are asking questions like, do animals grieve in ways we can recognize? Do they have consciousness or a comprehensive language or the ability to empathize like us? So today on the show, we're rethinking anthropomorphism and looking at ways that animals may be more like humans than we ever thought before and how those similarities might help us better understand our own place in the world. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: And for Barbara King, her own thinking about animals and grief changed when she started researching elephants. KING: Pretty quickly as I started reading, I was convinced that elephant grief is real. So we know that these are big-brained, highly social mammals. They live in family groups. Elephants are the touchstone species in a certain sense in that we have peer-reviewed science publications showing that elephants respond around a body with a vigil, with distressed body movement - all sorts of things that fit my definition of grief. Cynthia Moss is a tremendous long-term elephant researcher in Kenya, and she has described elephants crossing a plain or a savannah and diverting towards bones - dried, bleached elephant bones sitting there in the sun - and a particular elephant spending more time caressing a particular skull. RAZ: Wow. KING: And she knows from her long-term records who had died there, and she knows that the animal caressing those bones is a relative of that dead individual. That just blows my mind. RAZ: That's amazing. KING: And I just kept going. I started to expand and broaden the question and say, if elephants grieve, how about our closest living relative, monkeys and apes? That was pretty clearly a yes, but I started asking about animals as wide as farmed animals and companion animals like bunnies and cats and rabbits. And I kept coming up with more and more yeses. So once I started asking and started looking, it became clear to me that there was a whole just - the elephants are the tip of the iceberg, and there's so much more to talk about here. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) KING: So will science tell us someday about bereaved bees? Will we hear about frogs who mourn? I don't think so, and I think the reason is because animals really need one-to-one close relationships for that to happen. I also know that circumstance matters and personality matters. In any case, animals are not going to grieve exactly like we do. We have human creativity. We paint our grief, dance our grief, write our grief. We also can grieve for people we've never met across space and time. Animals don't grieve exactly like we do, but this doesn't mean that their grief isn't real. It is real, and it's searing. And we can see it if we choose. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: If it's true that certain species of animals that we are very familiar with experience grief, as this - as our knowledge of these experiences becomes better and clearer, it becomes more challenging to kind of confront the decisions we make as humans. KING: It certainly does. This has become, in recent years, the driving impetus for what I'm doing because what does this mean for animal-human relationships? What does this mean for the ethics of how we understand these fellow travelers, you know, on our planet and how we treat animals, including questions of who we eat?

I'm Shankar Vedantam. A few years ago, social scientist Francesca Gino was browsing the shelves at her local bookstore. She came across an unusual-looking book in the cooking section. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)FRANCESCA GINO: This recipe book that looked a little bit different. And the title said \"Never Trust A Skinny Italian Chef. \"VEDANTAM: (Laughter). GINO: And being Italian, it was very intrigued. And as I flipped through the pages, it became clear that this was not your typical recipe book. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: The dishes were playful, quirky, improbable. Snails were paired with coffee sauce, veal tongue with charcoal powder. The recipes had titles like how to burn a sardine. GINO: And, oops, I dropped the lemon tart. There were pictures of beautiful dishes. Who could resist a dish called the crunchy part of the lasagna? Now, if you know anything about Italians, first of all, we have lots of rules when it comes to cooking. And second, we really cherish our traditional dishes, especially because they've been passed on for generations. VEDANTAM: But this chef, one of the most successful in the world, couldn't resist circling back to one big existential question. GINO: Why is it that we cook the dish in this way? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Why is it that we cook the dish in this way? It's the kind of question Francesca loved. As a professor at Harvard Business School, she has spent most of her career studying nonconformists - specifically, people who break the rules and end up in trouble. But now, standing at the bookstore, she wondered, when can defying norms lead to innovation? Can letting go of tradition lead to the most sublime examples of creative thinking? To find out, she got in touch with the man behind the cookbook, the so-called Jimi Hendrix of Italian cooking, Massimo Bottura. GINO: After a few conversation, he said, look; if you really want to understand the business, you've got to come to Modena. And I was like, of course. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). GINO: Why say no to an invitation to a three-Michelin-star restaurant? I'm on my way. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This week, we'll follow Francesca on her mission to understand the minds of successful nonconformists. Her book about this quest is called \"Rebel Talent: Why It Pays To Break The Rules At Work And In Life. \" It continues our annual summer series. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)CAL NEWPORT: Think deeply. VEDANTAM: . . . You 2. 0. . . GINO: Authenticity is contagious. MING KUO: (Laughter) I have been dragged into this all the way kicking and screaming. VEDANTAM: . . . Ideas and advice about how you can respond to life\u2019s chaos. . . NEWPORT: Let me just do a - just check to my inbox. . . Just check. . . Just check. . . Just check to my phone real quick. VEDANTAM: . . . With wisdom. GINO: I think we really need to shift our thinking. Rebels are not troublemakers. They're not outcasts. Rebels are people who break rules that should be broken. They break rules that hold them and others back, and their way of rule-breaking is constructive rather than destructive. It creates positive change. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GINO: So I showed up at the restaurant for my first day with my notebook and basically was given an apron. For the entire day, I was put to work in the front of the house as a server. And again, it was an amazing experience because I had no qualification. I clearly didn't know what I was doing. I made a lot of mistakes. But that was just an example of doing things a little bit differently. VEDANTAM: So, of course, if you're a smart chef, the one thing you don't do is bring an amateur into your three-Michelin-star restaurant and ask her to start serving the dishes. I can just imagine all the ways that that could go wrong. Did it? GINO: That is exactly what was going through my head as I was making mistakes from putting the very carefully arranged dishes down onto the table. There are very specific ways in which the dish gets arranged so that you get the right anticipation of what the dish is going to be about as you eat it. And throughout the day, the team members who were working with me in the front of the house were just helping me. And when I was making mistakes, they were very subtly trying to correct, so they were adjusting the plate, or if I brought to a table the wrong utensils, they would show up. . . (LAUGHTER)GINO: . . . And somehow bring another set that was the right set for the type of dish that was being served. VEDANTAM: So I understand that if I were to visit the restaurant, I might sometimes see Massimo Bottura outside, unloading produce from the trucks or sweeping the pavement. He doesn't seem like someone who stands on airs. GINO: He's very much into the trenches. One of the first thing that he does when he shows up at the restaurant in the morning is to put his white chef's coat on, and then he does go outside with a broom and sweep the streets. And you're there looking at him, and the sous chef and the people working in the restaurants are there looking at him, and you ask the question, why is it that he's doing that? But the second question that you ask yourself is, why is it that I'm not doing it? And so you're feeling motivated to take on roles and activities that are roles that are not scripted because of where you sit or where you work in the restaurant. It's very refreshing. VEDANTAM: And, of course, he actually tries to bring this approach to the food that he's making, as well. I want you to listen to this clip of music because you say the chef actually asked his staff to build a dish based on this song. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WALK ON THE WILD SIDE\")LOU REED: (Singing) Holly came from Miami, Fla. , hitchhiked her way across the USA, plucked her eyebrows on the way, shaved her legs and then he was a she. She says, hey, babe, take a walk on the wild side, said, hey, honey, take a walk on the wild side. VEDANTAM: So what was going on, Francesca? How do you make a dish based on a song? GINO: It was a one of the many ways that Massimo Bottura inspires the people working in the kitchen and really asks them to bring out their own contribution and their own voices. So you would see him walk into the kitchen and say, Lou Reed - walk through the outside - or a different name of a song or a different poem or the name of a phrase of something that he was reading recently or the name of a piece of art that he saw at an art show. And what he's trying to do is asking people to think about how that song or how that piece of art inspired them to come up with their own dish. And what he's trying to do at the very core is making sure that people don't show up at work and somehow they leave their identity at the door, but rather, they show up, and they're being who they are; they're bringing their ideas forward, their contributions forward, independent of their background, their nationalities or how much training they have. VEDANTAM: And when you spoke to the staff at the restaurant, what did they say the role of the chef was in inspiring them? Did they actually agree that these techniques were actually bringing out the best in them? GINO: What the staff said, which is really interesting, is that Massimo is the type of leader who never says, I, I, I. It's always about the we. He describes the restaurant as a crew or as a ship as - in fact, he often talks about being on a pirate ship. And sometimes, the waters out there are going to be turbulent but for the very fact that we are going to bring out our individual contributions, but we're going to do so being aware that we are part of a team. No matter how turbulent the sea is, we're going to succeed. And people do feel very inspired by the way he leads the restaurant. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Here's another thing that makes Massimo a rebel. He asks a lot of questions about why things are the way they are. For Francesca, a fearless curiosity is at the heart of rebel talent. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GINO: Bottura opened up a restaurant by asking the question, why not? He had no experience in running a restaurant, let alone cooking, because he didn't go to culinary school. He was in law school. He was there for two years as a way to stick to what his father wanted. And then he didn't enjoy it. And when his brother - one of his brothers told him about this restaurant that was up for sale, he really asked himself the question, why not? That's curiosity. We are so often focused on efficiency and getting things done. We have a very long to-do list. But what that often comes at the cost of is allowing us to explore the way we used to when we were a very little kid, and that came very naturally to us. So I see too many leaders who focus so much on efficiency that curiosity shut down in people. And that's too bad because curiosity leads to all sorts of great results and great outcomes. VEDANTAM: There's a tension that runs through much of the book, and the tension is the tension between expertise and experimentation. And I want to come back and talk about this over and over again, but I also want to do it through the lens of another story that you explore. You've looked at the story of Captain Chesley Sullenberger, better known as Captain Sully. He was at the controls of U. S. Airways flight 1549. The plane had just taken off from LaGuardia Airport in New York. A flock of birds flies into the plane. I want to play you a bit of tape from the cockpit recorder. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Cactus 1549, turn left plane 270. CHESLEY SULLENBERGER: This is Cactus 1539. Hit birds. We've lost thrust on both engines. We're turning back towards LaGuardia. VEDANTAM: Captain Sully radios air traffic controllers in New York, using the call sign Cactus 1539. The plane is descending at a terrifying rate. The controller's try to figure out what to do. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Sorry to stop your departure. It's got an emergency returning. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: What is it? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: 1529 - he - bird strike. He lost all engine. He lost the thrust in the engine, so he's returning immediately. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Cactus 1529 - which engines? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: He lost thrust in both engines, he said. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Got it. VEDANTAM: Captain Sully asked for landing options, but he quickly decides none of them will work. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Cactus 1529, turn right 280. You can land runway one at Teterboro. SULLENBERGER: We can't do it. VEDANTAM: And then. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SULLENBERGER: We're going to be in the Hudson. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: I'm sorry, say it again, Cactus. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: 212 4718 - I don't know. I think he said he was going to the Hudson. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Landing a plane in the Hudson River - Francesca, you describe this incident as a striking example of rebel talent. Why? GINO: If you think about the situation that Captain Sully was under, most of us would go to the obvious answer. We are under a lot of (laughter) pressure. We have no time. We are really stressed. And what our mind would do very naturally is to narrow our way of thinking. But if you read the accident reports or if you were to talk to Sully, you would understand that what he did instead was to consider options. He kept asking himself what it is that I could be doing. And in a place where most people would close their mind, he kept his mind open. Rather than going to the obvious answer of landing to the nearest airport, he thought creatively about the problem and came up with this idea of landing in the Hudson River. So that's what rebels are all about - people who rather than just following the script or just following what they've learned in their training, they stay open-minded. They look at the problem from a very different perspective no matter how much time they have to think about it, and then they creatively solve the problem. Captain Sully had 208 seconds by the time he discovered that he had no thrust in the engine and the time he ditched the plane in the Hudson River. That's true rebel talent. VEDANTAM: One of the things, again, the story reveals to me is this tension between expertise and experimentation. So if you have expertise but you're not willing to experiment, you become predictable. You become boring. But if you experiment without having expertise, you know, that can be amateurish. If you asked me to land a plane in the Hudson River, it's going to end in disaster. So there's something that happens when you combine expertise with experimentation. That's where the magic is. GINO: Exactly. One of the things that many people might not know about Captain Sully that I learned when I had the opportunity to interview him is that by the time the accident happened, he had experience flying all sorts of planes. He also served as a volunteer in teams that look at prior accidents and try to understand what it is that had happened. So he had so much experience once he was in that dire situation. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GINO: And, yeah, one of the things that is true about him is that every time he walked on a plane, he asked himself the question, what it is that I could learn? How is it that this could be different? He had that type of intellectual humility that kept him open-minded despite the fact that he was accumulating throughout his career a lot of experience. That's what often we miss out on. We gain experience. And by gaining experience and knowledge, we believe that we all have the right answer. And we don't stay humble. We don't have that type of intellectual humility that keep us focused on what's left to learn rather than what it is that we know already. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Captain Sully and Massimo Bottura tried daring things and achieved extraordinary results. It's easy to admire them, but why is it so hard to be like them? It turns out a curious psychological roadblock often gets in the way. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: We're talking about successful rebels, people who defy the status quo and produce creative breakthroughs. We've seen how this worked with Captain Sully and chef Bottura. So why are people like this so rare? Why do so many of us find it hard to channel our inner Bottura? You might think the problem is we're not experts. We're not skilled chefs or great pilots. But in fact the problem is often the opposite. We know too much. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GINO: My colleagues and I were fascinated by this idea that experience could be costly because in a lot of our classes, we're actually - they're (laughter) telling our students that they should gain knowledge, that information is power, that experience is important. And so we explored this in a dataset of millions of data points on how cardiologists behave in their surgery when they do open-heart surgeries. And what was interesting is that we could explore what happened to these cardiologists and their behavior after the Food and Drug Administration put out an announcement that, if I were to simplify, basically told them that the way they were using the technology in their surgery was not good for patients. And what we found in the data that was striking is that the more experience the surgeon had, the less likely they were to change their behavior. That means that, as you were suggesting, when we gain experience, often we feel like the expert, and we think that we know better, even when we hear information or when we see evidence that speaks to the fact that we're wrong. And so having that learning mindset as we're gaining experience is so, so important. VEDANTAM: And, of course, that's difficult to do precisely because once you know something, you ask yourself, why should I go back to becoming a beginner? You describe a very interesting study that was done out of Columbia University looking at guitar players and one way that expert guitarists could learn to once again think like beginners. Tell me about that study. GINO: This is a study by Ting Zhang. And she was fascinated by this idea that once you are an expert, it's very difficult to look at problems with the eyes of a novice. And so one way she thought she could address this very issue is by asking expert to relive the experience of being a novice. So in one of her studies, she recruited experienced people who played guitar. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: She asked some of them, the control group, to play as they would on a typical day. Of course, they sounded great. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: She asked the others to play a song with their non-dominant hand. Lefties played with their right hand. Right-handed people played with their left hand. It instantly made them feel like beginners again. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GINO: The experience is very humbling because you're sort of reminded of what it is that you knew and didn't know as you started. And when she compared the advice that these people were giving to others who were interested in learning how to play the guitar, the advice was much more helpful when it came to the second group of people rather than the group of people who played the guitar as you would usually do. VEDANTAM: As I'm hearing you tell me about the guitar study, it reminds me of something else you have in the book, this insight that in many fields, the people who are the innovators are often not the people who've been in those fields for extended periods of time, that it's often the newcomers to a field who have just about enough information to have mastered the rules but have not spent so much time in the culture that they've become hidebound. These are the people who are actually able to take the culture and move it in new directions. You talk about the role of how this works in science. There have been people who've tried to solve scientific problems by inviting people who are not necessarily science experts but people who are outsiders. GINO: It's quite interesting to think about the fact that probably all of us have had at some point in our lives or another a moment in which we were trying to tackle a problem where we felt we were the expert, but we were stuck, and we were not able to come up with a solution. And what is interesting is that when we in fact bring in people who might not have the right expertise, they're going to look at the problem from a very different perspective. And that type of difference in perspective, in opinions, in the way you're looking at and analyzing the problem can be quite powerful in helping you find a solution. And there are companies out there that in fact have used this insight and created businesses - like, Eli Lilly would be one of them - where when there are very difficult challenges, they put them out there such that not only the people with the right expertise might want to tackle the problem, but all others - the people who might not have the right expertise - can chime in. And often the solutions come exactly from those people. It's a good reminder that expertise, while wonderful, creates potential problems if we use it as a way of saying, I know the answer; I'm the expert. You look at the problem too narrowly, usually only from one perspective (laughter), and it's our own perspective. And instead having this learning mindset, bringing in novices into the problem allows us to now look at the situation from many different angles and viewpoints. VEDANTAM: Of course, this speaks to the idea of the value of diversity. I think that's one of the insights that I'm getting from what you just said. Having a mix of people in the room who look at things from different perspectives could just be inherently valuable. GINO: Having people who look at the problem from very a different perspective is, in fact, a key to solving tough problems. But the reality is that many of us don't want to be challenged. It's so much easier to go through life, whether at work or at home, for that matter, with people that just nod their heads and say, yep, I agree with you. But rebel leaders and rebel employees are people who really try to surround themselves with people who think differently and with people who do challenge them. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: I asked Francesca about another rebel she mentions in her book. You might be familiar with her work in movies such as \"Selma,\" an account of a series of famous civil rights marches led by Martin Luther King Jr. in 1965. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"SELMA\")DAVID OYELOWO: (As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. ) That means protest. That means march. (APPLAUSE)OYELOWO: (As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. ) That means disturb the peace. That means jail. That means risk. And that is hard. VEDANTAM: And you say that her story reveals another really important idea when it comes to rebel talent, which is the importance of being vigilant to stereotypes, to recognize that stereotypes can actually serve as a kind of straitjacket that prevents us from thinking creatively. GINO: In all sorts of spheres of life, we are affected by stereotypes. Or more generally, we accept social roles that others have passed on to us. And the story of Ava DuVernay is a beautiful one because she just doesn't do that. And this comes from a person who decided to go to filmmaking later in her career. She was doing a different job, and then she said, I'm going to switch and enter this job. And in the advice that she was receiving from others, everybody was talking about the importance of really being supported by others, reaching out to networks. She didn't have that. And she just started picking up the camera and working on her own movies. And in fact, the first films she created were supported by her own savings. And then she became known for the work that she was doing, for the fact that she was not accepting the rules of the business, but in a sense she was working and fighting against them. And it's quite amazing and inspiring as a story. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)AVA DUVERNAY: And so for me, I made my first film, my first feature film, when I was 38. So it's never too late. That I. . . (APPLAUSE)DUVERNAY: . . . I just started from the outside. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: We've seen how rebels constructively break the rules. They push ahead even when they don't have the support of powerbrokers. And once they achieve success, they continue to think like beginners and go out of their way to learn from those who disagree with them. So how can you activate your inner nonconformist? Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Today we're talking about rebels, people who break free of social norms and achieve incredible feats of imagination. Why is this something so few of us do? One problem is that we know too much. We become experts in our fields and then fall back on familiar routines. We forget how to see the world with fresh eyes. But it doesn't have to be this way. Francesca Gino says that being a rebel is a skill that all of us can cultivate. Sometimes, it takes only small steps. A few years ago, she wondered if getting people to feel comfortable about being uncomfortable could be the first step in activating their inner rebel. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: (Singing) Up and down the boulevard, their shadows. . . VEDANTAM: She asked students to stand before their friends and classmates and sing \"Don't Stop Believing\" by Journey. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: (Singing) Streetlights, people living just to find emotion. VEDANTAM: Can you set up the experiment for me, Francesca? GINO: I'm putting my hand in my hair as I was reminded when I was running this study. This was a study that was inspired by the notion that when we break rules, when we break away from what others - peoples expect of us, we feel a sense of confidence. And so to test that, I brought undergraduates to the lab, and I asked them to engage in the task that you just heard (laughter) - stand up in front of a video with a microphone and in front of other participants watching you singing \"Don't Stop Believing. \" That was one the songs. And some of the participants did just that. But some others were asked to wear a bandana as they were singing, something that they told me made them uncomfortable. And then I was interested in seeing whether the anxiety and stress that they experienced during the task and their level of confidence in addition to their performance was going to be different in these two different conditions. And it was, both looking at physiological measure of stress but also their self-reported measures in answering the question of how confident they felt. People who were wearing the bandana while they were singing in front of their peers felt more confident, felt less stress. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"DON'T STOP BELIEVING\")JOURNEY: (Singing) Don't stop believing. Hold onto that feeling. Streetlights, people. . . GINO: So despite the fact that they thought they would feel more uncomfortable and that it would be harder for them, the fact that they were wearing their bandana, something that the peers didn't expect, was actually helpful to them. And this is not just their feelings and their physiology. When you look at the performance in terms of how much they stay on tune, since the karaoke was recording that objectively, they did better. VEDANTAM: So there's a paradox here because in the one case, you're asking one set of students to sing the song, which is clearly difficult, and especially before your friends in a classroom, it's difficult to do. But the second group is being asked to do something even more difficult. You're asking them to sing the song and also wear this nonconforming, you know, headdress. And you would think that the second group would do worse, but you found exactly the opposite. GINO: Exactly. Oftentimes, we think that breaking rules is going to lead to worse outcomes and is going to make us feel uncomfortable. And it does to a certain extent, but it then turns into confidence. And that confidence translates in better performance. It is paradoxical, but it's one of the big lessons in being rebelliousness. It does pay off. VEDANTAM: I understand that you've discovered this about yourself, as well. You've run experiments of a sort where you try on the effects of different kinds of footwear and the effects this has on your audiences. GINO: One time, I was asked to teach two classes - the same class - back to back. And in each class, I had 110 executives. And since I was teaching the same content across the two classes, what I thought I could do is change my shoes in between the two classes, and that's exactly what I did. So picture this professor dress upped (ph) in a really nice suit. And for the first class, I was wearing formal leather shoes, probably what the students expected from a HBS professor or a professor in general teaching an exec ed. But for the second class, I changed out my leather shoes for a pair of red sneakers. And it was interesting to walk to class. My colleagues were giving me this strange look, thinking, what it is that she's doing? And I was going to teach my second class. And at the end of each of the two classes, I gave the executives a little survey. And in the survey, I was asking them question like, how much do you think I charge for my consulting? How much influence do you think I have at HBS as a professor? How often do you think I publish in a practitioner-oriented magazine like Harvard Business Review? And what was interesting is that these are measures that capture how much influence the student thought I had. And what the survey results showed is that they had higher respect - they thought of me as a more influential person when I taught them the same content just wearing red sneakers. VEDANTAM: So, of course, people listening to this are going to go out and get red sneakers and wear bandanas to work tomorrow because that's what you're saying is going to get them taken more seriously. GINO: I recently did a training for a company around the issues of rebel talent, and the people who invited me out were all in a team wearing red sneakers, and they got a lot of compliments and questions throughout the day. So yes, that could be one of the lessons learned out of this research. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Another way we can all get better at breaking the rules is to stay mindful of the things happening around us. Sometimes we're so focused on the job at hand that we fail to see how the situation might afford us opportunities to demonstrate leadership and authenticity. Maurice Cheeks had such an opportunity on April 25, 2003, during the NBA playoffs. Maurice was coach of the Portland Trail Blazers, and his team was down 2-0 in the series. It was a high-stakes moment. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: And now to honor America and salute the men and women serving our country with our national anthem. . . VEDANTAM: Twenty thousand excited basketball fans are in the Rose Garden in Portland. The crowd falls silent as a nervous-looking 13-year-old girl walks towards the microphone. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: Please welcome, as voted by you, the fans, our winner of the Toyota Get the Feeling of a Star (ph) promotion, Natalie Gilbert. (APPLAUSE)NATALIE GILBERT: (Singing) Oh, say, can you see. . . VEDANTAM: At first, things go well. Natalie looks confident, relaxed. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NATALIE: (Singing) . . . What so proudly we hailed at the star's light. . . GINO: And as you can hear. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NATALIE: (Singing) Stars. . . GINO: She is making a mistake. She's looking for her father to get some support. And then somebody shows up to help her. VEDANTAM: It's Maurice Cheeks. At a moment when you might think that all his attention would be focused on his team and their chances in the game, Maurice has the presence of mind to realize that a child is in trouble. He has a daughter about Natalie's age. He rushes up to stand beside her. He drapes an arm around her and says, come on, come on. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MAURICE CHEEKS: Come on, come on, come on. (Singing) Starlight's last dream. . . NATALIE: (Singing) Star's light. . . CHEEKS: (Singing) Last dreaming. NATALIE: (Singing) . . . Last gleaming. VEDANTAM: Natalie hesitates. She doesn't know this stranger in the gray suit who has come up to stand by her side. But Maurice Cheeks is now singing, and Natalie is lifted along. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NATALIE GILBERT AND MAURICE CHEEKS: (Singing) . . . We watched were so gallantly streaming. And the rockets' red glare. . . VEDANTAM: Natalie looks confident again. Her voice soars. And then something happens in the stadium. Thousands of fans, the players, they see what Maurice has done, and now everyone is singing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Singing) . . . Does that star-spangled banner. . . VEDANTAM: It is triumphant. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Singing) . . . Wave over the land of the free and the home of the brave. (CHEERING)GINO: I often use the video clip in class. And then the question that I ask after the clip is, does this guy have a good voice? And he doesn't. And what is interesting is that it took him no time to walk in and help. He made himself vulnerable in front of 20,000 fans and millions of viewers from home. That's what rebels do. They are not worried about what others are thinking, but they make themselves vulnerable in a way that gain them respect from those around them. VEDANTAM: There's something infectious about authenticity. GINO: There is. Authenticity is contagious. Once we see people making themselves vulnerable, rather than judging them negatively, we actually respect them, and we ask ourselves questions about what is it that we're covering up? We should be more willing to be authentic, as well, and bring ourselves forwards as we interact with others. VEDANTAM: One of the things that makes this book so interesting, Francesca, is that you've spent so much of your career exploring the pitfalls of breaking the rules. And, of course, this is standard fare for many academics. We've had, you know, co-authors of yours like Dacher Keltner and Dan Ariely on the show talking about unethical behavior, the risks of power. You know, powerful people often feel they can break the rules, act with impunity. In some ways, it makes sense that many of us are nervous about rule-breaking because we've seen the consequences of rule breakers. And lots of times, breaking the rules doesn't lead to good consequences. GINO: Fundamentally, breaking rules and being rebellious means leaving what's comfortable and known and familiar. And so people perceive it as risky business. But what the book hopefully teaches us, or at least in looking at the story of these rebels, what I've learned is that you might feel uncomfortable at first, but really, it does pay off. We are more confident when we're breaking rules. We also are much more engaged in the activities that we are working on, and we also end up with better, more trusting relationships. So there is a lot of goodness that comes from rule-breaking. But we do need to shift our thinking. It is rule-breaking that is constructive, not rule-breaking that is destructive. So when I think about a lot of the years that I spent looking at cheating and why is it that people steal and what organizations could do about it, that's rule-breaking that is destructive. But the type of rule-breaking that we are talking about now, though risky or uncomfortable, it's rule-breaking that leads to positive change. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: I'm wondering if the distinction is as simple as that, though. Isn't it possible that, in some ways, people who break the rules can, in fact, go over the edge? I remember visiting Facebook many years ago, and there were posters on the walls saying, you know, move fast and break things. And Facebook, of course, was an enormous rebel success story in Silicon Valley. But increasingly, a lot of people feel the company has gone too far, that it's broken too many rules, that it's actually run afoul of what we think a company should be doing, even on questions of national security and democracy. And I understand the point you're making - it would be nice if we could easily demarcate the rule breakers who are constructive from the rule breakers who are destructive. But isn't it possible that there is actually a pretty thin line between the two? GINO: When I think about the various businesses and organizations that I studied as I was working on the book, I've noticed a couple of things that seems to be really important when we think about this thin line. First is the fact that in businesses where people are encouraged to break the rules, the leaders are very clear on the rules that should not be broken, context in which you absolutely need to follow the guidelines or the rules. So one example that comes to mind is Ariel Investment (ph), a Chicago-based money management firm. If you were to visit the firm, what you would see is that the leaders are really trying to make sure that people are staying open-minded, that they're using all the talents that I talk about in the book. But if you go to certain places, everybody in the firm is going to tell you, there, you got to follow the rules. So for example, if a letter goes out to a client, everybody knows that the three different people need to look at the letter to make sure that it's clear, that there are no typos, that is - the language is appropriate because otherwise, you would affect the reputation of the firm negatively. That's a rule that everybody knows should not be broken. So as these examples suggest, there is much clarity around rules that, really, you don't want people to break. And second - and other things that I noticed in businesses that encourage rebelliousness - is the fact that once you trust people to break rules, they seem to have very good judgment. They sort of decide on their feet the situations where you really should be putting your head down and follow the script, rather than using your mind in a creative way to come up with a different solution. So that type of good judgment is something that I've seen in so many different rebels and in so many organizations where people are encouraged to be rebellious. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: You sometimes describe this as a positive deviance in the book. But, of course, in many companies and organizations, someone who comes along and says, let's do things differently, the way we've been doing things all this time has been wrong - I mean, that person is often seen as a troublemaker. GINO: Oftentimes, what's different between a troublemaker and a rebel, in the way I think of rebels, is the delivery. Many people, after I was working on the book and they heard about it, asked me to go and watch them in their work because they said, I'm clearly a rebel, but it's not paying off for me. And so in a couple of cases, I did go, and I was watching them as they were interacting with their colleagues. And the elements of rebelliousness were there, but the delivery was wrong. So they were coming across as arrogant. If they were in a discussion and they thought that the discussion needed to go in a different direction, rather than saying, I see the value in your idea, and I think we can also bring to bear a different perspective, they were more shutting down the idea, letting the person know how wrong the idea was prior to bringing forward their ideas. There are the troublemakers - maybe people are breaking rules just for the sake of breaking rules. Rebels, instead, are really being constructive in their approach in a way that creates positive change. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering how writing and researching this book has changed your own life. How have you tried to internalize these lessons at home, as a parent, as a partner, as a friend, as a colleague and as a professional? GINO: In all spheres of life, I've changed my behavior quite a bit, or at least, I find myself pausing and trying to learn how to be an effective rebel. There is a story that I tell in the book about my son, who, at the time, was about 4 1/2 year old. This is a time where curiosity is as its best, so you keep asking why and what-if type of questions. And it's early in the morning. And Alex - is my son name - is having his breakfast - so a bowl of milk with some cereal. And as he's sitting at the counter, stirring his milk, he looks at my husband and says, Daddy, do we still have the coloring bottles that we used to use when we color eggs at Easter? So my husband is sort of looking confused. But he says, yes. And he walks to the cabinet. He opens it up and gets the bottle to Alex and said, Alex, what are you going to do with it? And Alex smiled and said, I'm going to color my breakfast. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). GINO: And you should have seen the face of my husband. He was confused and sort of disappointed. And he looked back at Alex and said, Alex, we don't do that. And Alex, being a 4-1/2-year-old boy, said, why not? Very reasonable question. And then my husband, even more confused with Alex's answer, looked at me and said, we don't do that, right? And that was a beautiful moment for me. As we were trying to struggle through this question on whether we do it or we don't do it, Alex opened up the bottle and started to put red coloring in his milk. And all of a sudden, the cereals were happily swimming in pink milk. And it's a perfect example of how often we go through life, and there are rules that we put out there that maybe should be questions. Why is it that milk needs to be white for breakfast? I actually tried it. So I now had pink milk, yellow milk, green milk, and it tastes just the same to me. If anything, you're really smiling (laughter) as you start off your day.

Next week, our You 2. 0 episode is filled with strategies for how you can work more deeply. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)NEWPORT: I plan out the day like a chess player moving the pieces around. This is what I'm going to work on when. I don't let my mood dictate how my day unfolds. VEDANTAM: I'm Shankar Vedantam, and this is NPR. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST:  From NPR, this is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. A few years ago, social scientist Francesca Gino was browsing the shelves at her local bookstore. She came across an unusual-looking book in the cooking section. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) FRANCESCA GINO: This recipe book that looked a little bit different. And the title said \"Never Trust A Skinny Italian Chef. \" VEDANTAM: (Laughter). GINO: And being Italian, it was very intrigued. And as I flipped through the pages, it became clear that this was not your typical recipe book. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: The dishes were playful, quirky, improbable. Snails were paired with coffee sauce, veal tongue with charcoal powder. The recipes had titles like how to burn a sardine. GINO: And, oops, I dropped the lemon tart. There were pictures of beautiful dishes. Who could resist a dish called the crunchy part of the lasagna? Now, if you know anything about Italians, first of all, we have lots of rules when it comes to cooking. And second, we really cherish our traditional dishes, especially because they've been passed on for generations. VEDANTAM: But this chef, one of the most successful in the world, couldn't resist circling back to one big existential question. GINO: Why is it that we cook the dish in this way? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Why is it that we cook the dish in this way? It's the kind of question Francesca loved. As a professor at Harvard Business School, she has spent most of her career studying nonconformists - specifically, people who break the rules and end up in trouble. But now, standing at the bookstore, she wondered, when can defying norms lead to innovation? Can letting go of tradition lead to the most sublime examples of creative thinking? To find out, she got in touch with the man behind the cookbook, the so-called Jimi Hendrix of Italian cooking, Massimo Bottura. GINO: After a few conversation, he said, look; if you really want to understand the business, you've got to come to Modena. And I was like, of course. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). GINO: Why say no to an invitation to a three-Michelin-star restaurant? I'm on my way. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This week, we'll follow Francesca on her mission to understand the minds of successful nonconformists. Her book about this quest is called \"Rebel Talent: Why It Pays To Break The Rules At Work And In Life. \" It continues our annual summer series. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) CAL NEWPORT: Think deeply. VEDANTAM: . . . You 2. 0. . . GINO: Authenticity is contagious. MING KUO: (Laughter) I have been dragged into this all the way kicking and screaming. VEDANTAM: . . . Ideas and advice about how you can respond to life\u2019s chaos. . . NEWPORT: Let me just do a - just check to my inbox. . . Just check. . . Just check. . . Just check to my phone real quick. VEDANTAM: . . . With wisdom. GINO: I think we really need to shift our thinking. Rebels are not troublemakers. They're not outcasts. Rebels are people who break rules that should be broken. They break rules that hold them and others back, and their way of rule-breaking is constructive rather than destructive. It creates positive change. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GINO: So I showed up at the restaurant for my first day with my notebook and basically was given an apron. For the entire day, I was put to work in the front of the house as a server. And again, it was an amazing experience because I had no qualification. I clearly didn't know what I was doing. I made a lot of mistakes. But that was just an example of doing things a little bit differently. VEDANTAM: So, of course, if you're a smart chef, the one thing you don't do is bring an amateur into your three-Michelin-star restaurant and ask her to start serving the dishes. I can just imagine all the ways that that could go wrong. Did it? GINO: That is exactly what was going through my head as I was making mistakes from putting the very carefully arranged dishes down onto the table. There are very specific ways in which the dish gets arranged so that you get the right anticipation of what the dish is going to be about as you eat it. And throughout the day, the team members who were working with me in the front of the house were just helping me. And when I was making mistakes, they were very subtly trying to correct, so they were adjusting the plate, or if I brought to a table the wrong utensils, they would show up. . . (LAUGHTER) GINO: . . . And somehow bring another set that was the right set for the type of dish that was being served. VEDANTAM: So I understand that if I were to visit the restaurant, I might sometimes see Massimo Bottura outside, unloading produce from the trucks or sweeping the pavement. He doesn't seem like someone who stands on airs. GINO: He's very much into the trenches. One of the first thing that he does when he shows up at the restaurant in the morning is to put his white chef's coat on, and then he does go outside with a broom and sweep the streets. And you're there looking at him, and the sous chef and the people working in the restaurants are there looking at him, and you ask the question, why is it that he's doing that? But the second question that you ask yourself is, why is it that I'm not doing it? And so you're feeling motivated to take on roles and activities that are roles that are not scripted because of where you sit or where you work in the restaurant. It's very refreshing. VEDANTAM: And, of course, he actually tries to bring this approach to the food that he's making, as well. I want you to listen to this clip of music because you say the chef actually asked his staff to build a dish based on this song. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WALK ON THE WILD SIDE\") LOU REED: (Singing) Holly came from Miami, Fla. , hitchhiked her way across the USA, plucked her eyebrows on the way, shaved her legs and then he was a she. She says, hey, babe, take a walk on the wild side, said, hey, honey, take a walk on the wild side. VEDANTAM: So what was going on, Francesca? How do you make a dish based on a song? GINO: It was a one of the many ways that Massimo Bottura inspires the people working in the kitchen and really asks them to bring out their own contribution and their own voices. So you would see him walk into the kitchen and say, Lou Reed - walk through the outside - or a different name of a song or a different poem or the name of a phrase of something that he was reading recently or the name of a piece of art that he saw at an art show. And what he's trying to do is asking people to think about how that song or how that piece of art inspired them to come up with their own dish. And what he's trying to do at the very core is making sure that people don't show up at work and somehow they leave their identity at the door, but rather, they show up, and they're being who they are; they're bringing their ideas forward, their contributions forward, independent of their background, their nationalities or how much training they have. VEDANTAM: And when you spoke to the staff at the restaurant, what did they say the role of the chef was in inspiring them? Did they actually agree that these techniques were actually bringing out the best in them? GINO: What the staff said, which is really interesting, is that Massimo is the type of leader who never says, I, I, I. It's always about the we. He describes the restaurant as a crew or as a ship as - in fact, he often talks about being on a pirate ship. And sometimes, the waters out there are going to be turbulent but for the very fact that we are going to bring out our individual contributions, but we're going to do so being aware that we are part of a team. No matter how turbulent the sea is, we're going to succeed. And people do feel very inspired by the way he leads the restaurant. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Here's another thing that makes Massimo a rebel. He asks a lot of questions about why things are the way they are. For Francesca, a fearless curiosity is at the heart of rebel talent. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GINO: Bottura opened up a restaurant by asking the question, why not? He had no experience in running a restaurant, let alone cooking, because he didn't go to culinary school. He was in law school. He was there for two years as a way to stick to what his father wanted. And then he didn't enjoy it. And when his brother - one of his brothers told him about this restaurant that was up for sale, he really asked himself the question, why not? That's curiosity. We are so often focused on efficiency and getting things done. We have a very long to-do list. But what that often comes at the cost of is allowing us to explore the way we used to when we were a very little kid, and that came very naturally to us. So I see too many leaders who focus so much on efficiency that curiosity shut down in people. And that's too bad because curiosity leads to all sorts of great results and great outcomes. VEDANTAM: There's a tension that runs through much of the book, and the tension is the tension between expertise and experimentation. And I want to come back and talk about this over and over again, but I also want to do it through the lens of another story that you explore. You've looked at the story of Captain Chesley Sullenberger, better known as Captain Sully. He was at the controls of U. S. Airways flight 1549. The plane had just taken off from LaGuardia Airport in New York. A flock of birds flies into the plane. I want to play you a bit of tape from the cockpit recorder. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Cactus 1549, turn left plane 270. CHESLEY SULLENBERGER: This is Cactus 1539. Hit birds. We've lost thrust on both engines. We're turning back towards LaGuardia. VEDANTAM: Captain Sully radios air traffic controllers in New York, using the call sign Cactus 1539. The plane is descending at a terrifying rate. The controller's try to figure out what to do. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Sorry to stop your departure. It's got an emergency returning. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: What is it? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: 1529 - he - bird strike. He lost all engine. He lost the thrust in the engine, so he's returning immediately. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Cactus 1529 - which engines? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: He lost thrust in both engines, he said. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Got it. VEDANTAM: Captain Sully asked for landing options, but he quickly decides none of them will work. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Cactus 1529, turn right 280. You can land runway one at Teterboro. SULLENBERGER: We can't do it. VEDANTAM: And then. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SULLENBERGER: We're going to be in the Hudson. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: I'm sorry, say it again, Cactus. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: 212 4718 - I don't know. I think he said he was going to the Hudson. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Landing a plane in the Hudson River - Francesca, you describe this incident as a striking example of rebel talent. Why? GINO: If you think about the situation that Captain Sully was under, most of us would go to the obvious answer. We are under a lot of (laughter) pressure. We have no time. We are really stressed. And what our mind would do very naturally is to narrow our way of thinking. But if you read the accident reports or if you were to talk to Sully, you would understand that what he did instead was to consider options. He kept asking himself what it is that I could be doing. And in a place where most people would close their mind, he kept his mind open. Rather than going to the obvious answer of landing to the nearest airport, he thought creatively about the problem and came up with this idea of landing in the Hudson River. So that's what rebels are all about - people who rather than just following the script or just following what they've learned in their training, they stay open-minded. They look at the problem from a very different perspective no matter how much time they have to think about it, and then they creatively solve the problem. Captain Sully had 208 seconds by the time he discovered that he had no thrust in the engine and the time he ditched the plane in the Hudson River. That's true rebel talent. VEDANTAM: One of the things, again, the story reveals to me is this tension between expertise and experimentation. So if you have expertise but you're not willing to experiment, you become predictable. You become boring. But if you experiment without having expertise, you know, that can be amateurish. If you asked me to land a plane in the Hudson River, it's going to end in disaster. So there's something that happens when you combine expertise with experimentation. That's where the magic is. GINO: Exactly. One of the things that many people might not know about Captain Sully that I learned when I had the opportunity to interview him is that by the time the accident happened, he had experience flying all sorts of planes. He also served as a volunteer in teams that look at prior accidents and try to understand what it is that had happened. So he had so much experience once he was in that dire situation. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GINO: And, yeah, one of the things that is true about him is that every time he walked on a plane, he asked himself the question, what it is that I could learn? How is it that this could be different? He had that type of intellectual humility that kept him open-minded despite the fact that he was accumulating throughout his career a lot of experience. That's what often we miss out on. We gain experience. And by gaining experience and knowledge, we believe that we all have the right answer. And we don't stay humble. We don't have that type of intellectual humility that keep us focused on what's left to learn rather than what it is that we know already. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Captain Sully and Massimo Bottura tried daring things and achieved extraordinary results. It's easy to admire them, but why is it so hard to be like them? It turns out a curious psychological roadblock often gets in the way. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: We're talking about successful rebels, people who defy the status quo and produce creative breakthroughs. We've seen how this worked with Captain Sully and chef Bottura. So why are people like this so rare? Why do so many of us find it hard to channel our inner Bottura? You might think the problem is we're not experts. We're not skilled chefs or great pilots. But in fact the problem is often the opposite. We know too much. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GINO: My colleagues and I were fascinated by this idea that experience could be costly because in a lot of our classes, we're actually - they're (laughter) telling our students that they should gain knowledge, that information is power, that experience is important. And so we explored this in a dataset of millions of data points on how cardiologists behave in their surgery when they do open-heart surgeries. And what was interesting is that we could explore what happened to these cardiologists and their behavior after the Food and Drug Administration put out an announcement that, if I were to simplify, basically told them that the way they were using the technology in their surgery was not good for patients. And what we found in the data that was striking is that the more experience the surgeon had, the less likely they were to change their behavior. That means that, as you were suggesting, when we gain experience, often we feel like the expert, and we think that we know better, even when we hear information or when we see evidence that speaks to the fact that we're wrong. And so having that learning mindset as we're gaining experience is so, so important. VEDANTAM: And, of course, that's difficult to do precisely because once you know something, you ask yourself, why should I go back to becoming a beginner? You describe a very interesting study that was done out of Columbia University looking at guitar players and one way that expert guitarists could learn to once again think like beginners. Tell me about that study. GINO: This is a study by Ting Zhang. And she was fascinated by this idea that once you are an expert, it's very difficult to look at problems with the eyes of a novice. And so one way she thought she could address this very issue is by asking expert to relive the experience of being a novice. So in one of her studies, she recruited experienced people who played guitar. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: She asked some of them, the control group, to play as they would on a typical day. Of course, they sounded great. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: She asked the others to play a song with their non-dominant hand. Lefties played with their right hand. Right-handed people played with their left hand. It instantly made them feel like beginners again. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GINO: The experience is very humbling because you're sort of reminded of what it is that you knew and didn't know as you started. And when she compared the advice that these people were giving to others who were interested in learning how to play the guitar, the advice was much more helpful when it came to the second group of people rather than the group of people who played the guitar as you would usually do. VEDANTAM: As I'm hearing you tell me about the guitar study, it reminds me of something else you have in the book, this insight that in many fields, the people who are the innovators are often not the people who've been in those fields for extended periods of time, that it's often the newcomers to a field who have just about enough information to have mastered the rules but have not spent so much time in the culture that they've become hidebound. These are the people who are actually able to take the culture and move it in new directions. You talk about the role of how this works in science. There have been people who've tried to solve scientific problems by inviting people who are not necessarily science experts but people who are outsiders. GINO: It's quite interesting to think about the fact that probably all of us have had at some point in our lives or another a moment in which we were trying to tackle a problem where we felt we were the expert, but we were stuck, and we were not able to come up with a solution. And what is interesting is that when we in fact bring in people who might not have the right expertise, they're going to look at the problem from a very different perspective. And that type of difference in perspective, in opinions, in the way you're looking at and analyzing the problem can be quite powerful in helping you find a solution. And there are companies out there that in fact have used this insight and created businesses - like, Eli Lilly would be one of them - where when there are very difficult challenges, they put them out there such that not only the people with the right expertise might want to tackle the problem, but all others - the people who might not have the right expertise - can chime in. And often the solutions come exactly from those people. It's a good reminder that expertise, while wonderful, creates potential problems if we use it as a way of saying, I know the answer; I'm the expert. You look at the problem too narrowly, usually only from one perspective (laughter), and it's our own perspective. And instead having this learning mindset, bringing in novices into the problem allows us to now look at the situation from many different angles and viewpoints. VEDANTAM: Of course, this speaks to the idea of the value of diversity. I think that's one of the insights that I'm getting from what you just said. Having a mix of people in the room who look at things from different perspectives could just be inherently valuable. GINO: Having people who look at the problem from very a different perspective is, in fact, a key to solving tough problems. But the reality is that many of us don't want to be challenged. It's so much easier to go through life, whether at work or at home, for that matter, with people that just nod their heads and say, yep, I agree with you. But rebel leaders and rebel employees are people who really try to surround themselves with people who think differently and with people who do challenge them. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: I asked Francesca about another rebel she mentions in her book. You might be familiar with her work in movies such as \"Selma,\" an account of a series of famous civil rights marches led by Martin Luther King Jr. in 1965. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"SELMA\") DAVID OYELOWO: (As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. ) That means protest. That means march. (APPLAUSE) OYELOWO: (As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. ) That means disturb the peace. That means jail. That means risk. And that is hard. VEDANTAM: And you say that her story reveals another really important idea when it comes to rebel talent, which is the importance of being vigilant to stereotypes, to recognize that stereotypes can actually serve as a kind of straitjacket that prevents us from thinking creatively. GINO: In all sorts of spheres of life, we are affected by stereotypes. Or more generally, we accept social roles that others have passed on to us. And the story of Ava DuVernay is a beautiful one because she just doesn't do that. And this comes from a person who decided to go to filmmaking later in her career. She was doing a different job, and then she said, I'm going to switch and enter this job. And in the advice that she was receiving from others, everybody was talking about the importance of really being supported by others, reaching out to networks. She didn't have that. And she just started picking up the camera and working on her own movies. And in fact, the first films she created were supported by her own savings. And then she became known for the work that she was doing, for the fact that she was not accepting the rules of the business, but in a sense she was working and fighting against them. And it's quite amazing and inspiring as a story. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) AVA DUVERNAY: And so for me, I made my first film, my first feature film, when I was 38. So it's never too late. That I. . . (APPLAUSE) DUVERNAY: . . . I just started from the outside. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: We've seen how rebels constructively break the rules. They push ahead even when they don't have the support of powerbrokers. And once they achieve success, they continue to think like beginners and go out of their way to learn from those who disagree with them. So how can you activate your inner nonconformist? Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Today we're talking about rebels, people who break free of social norms and achieve incredible feats of imagination. Why is this something so few of us do? One problem is that we know too much. We become experts in our fields and then fall back on familiar routines. We forget how to see the world with fresh eyes. But it doesn't have to be this way. Francesca Gino says that being a rebel is a skill that all of us can cultivate. Sometimes, it takes only small steps. A few years ago, she wondered if getting people to feel comfortable about being uncomfortable could be the first step in activating their inner rebel. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: (Singing) Up and down the boulevard, their shadows. . . VEDANTAM: She asked students to stand before their friends and classmates and sing \"Don't Stop Believing\" by Journey. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: (Singing) Streetlights, people living just to find emotion. VEDANTAM: Can you set up the experiment for me, Francesca? GINO: I'm putting my hand in my hair as I was reminded when I was running this study. This was a study that was inspired by the notion that when we break rules, when we break away from what others - peoples expect of us, we feel a sense of confidence. And so to test that, I brought undergraduates to the lab, and I asked them to engage in the task that you just heard (laughter) - stand up in front of a video with a microphone and in front of other participants watching you singing \"Don't Stop Believing. \" That was one the songs. And some of the participants did just that. But some others were asked to wear a bandana as they were singing, something that they told me made them uncomfortable. And then I was interested in seeing whether the anxiety and stress that they experienced during the task and their level of confidence in addition to their performance was going to be different in these two different conditions. And it was, both looking at physiological measure of stress but also their self-reported measures in answering the question of how confident they felt. People who were wearing the bandana while they were singing in front of their peers felt more confident, felt less stress. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"DON'T STOP BELIEVING\") JOURNEY: (Singing) Don't stop believing. Hold onto that feeling. Streetlights, people. . . GINO: So despite the fact that they thought they would feel more uncomfortable and that it would be harder for them, the fact that they were wearing their bandana, something that the peers didn't expect, was actually helpful to them. And this is not just their feelings and their physiology. When you look at the performance in terms of how much they stay on tune, since the karaoke was recording that objectively, they did better. VEDANTAM: So there's a paradox here because in the one case, you're asking one set of students to sing the song, which is clearly difficult, and especially before your friends in a classroom, it's difficult to do. But the second group is being asked to do something even more difficult. You're asking them to sing the song and also wear this nonconforming, you know, headdress. And you would think that the second group would do worse, but you found exactly the opposite. GINO: Exactly. Oftentimes, we think that breaking rules is going to lead to worse outcomes and is going to make us feel uncomfortable. And it does to a certain extent, but it then turns into confidence. And that confidence translates in better performance. It is paradoxical, but it's one of the big lessons in being rebelliousness. It does pay off. VEDANTAM: I understand that you've discovered this about yourself, as well. You've run experiments of a sort where you try on the effects of different kinds of footwear and the effects this has on your audiences. GINO: One time, I was asked to teach two classes - the same class - back to back. And in each class, I had 110 executives. And since I was teaching the same content across the two classes, what I thought I could do is change my shoes in between the two classes, and that's exactly what I did. So picture this professor dress upped (ph) in a really nice suit. And for the first class, I was wearing formal leather shoes, probably what the students expected from a HBS professor or a professor in general teaching an exec ed. But for the second class, I changed out my leather shoes for a pair of red sneakers. And it was interesting to walk to class. My colleagues were giving me this strange look, thinking, what it is that she's doing? And I was going to teach my second class. And at the end of each of the two classes, I gave the executives a little survey. And in the survey, I was asking them question like, how much do you think I charge for my consulting? How much influence do you think I have at HBS as a professor? How often do you think I publish in a practitioner-oriented magazine like Harvard Business Review? And what was interesting is that these are measures that capture how much influence the student thought I had. And what the survey results showed is that they had higher respect - they thought of me as a more influential person when I taught them the same content just wearing red sneakers. VEDANTAM: So, of course, people listening to this are going to go out and get red sneakers and wear bandanas to work tomorrow because that's what you're saying is going to get them taken more seriously. GINO: I recently did a training for a company around the issues of rebel talent, and the people who invited me out were all in a team wearing red sneakers, and they got a lot of compliments and questions throughout the day. So yes, that could be one of the lessons learned out of this research. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Another way we can all get better at breaking the rules is to stay mindful of the things happening around us. Sometimes we're so focused on the job at hand that we fail to see how the situation might afford us opportunities to demonstrate leadership and authenticity. Maurice Cheeks had such an opportunity on April 25, 2003, during the NBA playoffs. Maurice was coach of the Portland Trail Blazers, and his team was down 2-0 in the series. It was a high-stakes moment. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: And now to honor America and salute the men and women serving our country with our national anthem. . . VEDANTAM: Twenty thousand excited basketball fans are in the Rose Garden in Portland. The crowd falls silent as a nervous-looking 13-year-old girl walks towards the microphone. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: Please welcome, as voted by you, the fans, our winner of the Toyota Get the Feeling of a Star (ph) promotion, Natalie Gilbert. (APPLAUSE) NATALIE GILBERT: (Singing) Oh, say, can you see. . . VEDANTAM: At first, things go well. Natalie looks confident, relaxed. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NATALIE: (Singing) . . . What so proudly we hailed at the star's light. . . GINO: And as you can hear. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NATALIE: (Singing) Stars. . . GINO: She is making a mistake. She's looking for her father to get some support. And then somebody shows up to help her. VEDANTAM: It's Maurice Cheeks. At a moment when you might think that all his attention would be focused on his team and their chances in the game, Maurice has the presence of mind to realize that a child is in trouble. He has a daughter about Natalie's age. He rushes up to stand beside her. He drapes an arm around her and says, come on, come on. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MAURICE CHEEKS: Come on, come on, come on. (Singing) Starlight's last dream. . . NATALIE: (Singing) Star's light. . . CHEEKS: (Singing) Last dreaming. NATALIE: (Singing) . . . Last gleaming. VEDANTAM: Natalie hesitates. She doesn't know this stranger in the gray suit who has come up to stand by her side. But Maurice Cheeks is now singing, and Natalie is lifted along. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NATALIE GILBERT AND MAURICE CHEEKS: (Singing) . . . We watched were so gallantly streaming. And the rockets' red glare. . . VEDANTAM: Natalie looks confident again. Her voice soars. And then something happens in the stadium. Thousands of fans, the players, they see what Maurice has done, and now everyone is singing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Singing) . . . Does that star-spangled banner. . . VEDANTAM: It is triumphant. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Singing) . . . Wave over the land of the free and the home of the brave. (CHEERING) GINO: I often use the video clip in class. And then the question that I ask after the clip is, does this guy have a good voice? And he doesn't. And what is interesting is that it took him no time to walk in and help. He made himself vulnerable in front of 20,000 fans and millions of viewers from home. That's what rebels do. They are not worried about what others are thinking, but they make themselves vulnerable in a way that gain them respect from those around them. VEDANTAM: There's something infectious about authenticity. GINO: There is. Authenticity is contagious. Once we see people making themselves vulnerable, rather than judging them negatively, we actually respect them, and we ask ourselves questions about what is it that we're covering up? We should be more willing to be authentic, as well, and bring ourselves forwards as we interact with others. VEDANTAM: One of the things that makes this book so interesting, Francesca, is that you've spent so much of your career exploring the pitfalls of breaking the rules. And, of course, this is standard fare for many academics. We've had, you know, co-authors of yours like Dacher Keltner and Dan Ariely on the show talking about unethical behavior, the risks of power. You know, powerful people often feel they can break the rules, act with impunity. In some ways, it makes sense that many of us are nervous about rule-breaking because we've seen the consequences of rule breakers. And lots of times, breaking the rules doesn't lead to good consequences. GINO: Fundamentally, breaking rules and being rebellious means leaving what's comfortable and known and familiar. And so people perceive it as risky business. But what the book hopefully teaches us, or at least in looking at the story of these rebels, what I've learned is that you might feel uncomfortable at first, but really, it does pay off. We are more confident when we're breaking rules. We also are much more engaged in the activities that we are working on, and we also end up with better, more trusting relationships. So there is a lot of goodness that comes from rule-breaking. But we do need to shift our thinking. It is rule-breaking that is constructive, not rule-breaking that is destructive. So when I think about a lot of the years that I spent looking at cheating and why is it that people steal and what organizations could do about it, that's rule-breaking that is destructive. But the type of rule-breaking that we are talking about now, though risky or uncomfortable, it's rule-breaking that leads to positive change. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: I'm wondering if the distinction is as simple as that, though. Isn't it possible that, in some ways, people who break the rules can, in fact, go over the edge? I remember visiting Facebook many years ago, and there were posters on the walls saying, you know, move fast and break things. And Facebook, of course, was an enormous rebel success story in Silicon Valley. But increasingly, a lot of people feel the company has gone too far, that it's broken too many rules, that it's actually run afoul of what we think a company should be doing, even on questions of national security and democracy. And I understand the point you're making - it would be nice if we could easily demarcate the rule breakers who are constructive from the rule breakers who are destructive. But isn't it possible that there is actually a pretty thin line between the two? GINO: When I think about the various businesses and organizations that I studied as I was working on the book, I've noticed a couple of things that seems to be really important when we think about this thin line. First is the fact that in businesses where people are encouraged to break the rules, the leaders are very clear on the rules that should not be broken, context in which you absolutely need to follow the guidelines or the rules. So one example that comes to mind is Ariel Investment (ph), a Chicago-based money management firm. If you were to visit the firm, what you would see is that the leaders are really trying to make sure that people are staying open-minded, that they're using all the talents that I talk about in the book. But if you go to certain places, everybody in the firm is going to tell you, there, you got to follow the rules. So for example, if a letter goes out to a client, everybody knows that the three different people need to look at the letter to make sure that it's clear, that there are no typos, that is - the language is appropriate because otherwise, you would affect the reputation of the firm negatively. That's a rule that everybody knows should not be broken. So as these examples suggest, there is much clarity around rules that, really, you don't want people to break. And second - and other things that I noticed in businesses that encourage rebelliousness - is the fact that once you trust people to break rules, they seem to have very good judgment. They sort of decide on their feet the situations where you really should be putting your head down and follow the script, rather than using your mind in a creative way to come up with a different solution. So that type of good judgment is something that I've seen in so many different rebels and in so many organizations where people are encouraged to be rebellious. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: You sometimes describe this as a positive deviance in the book. But, of course, in many companies and organizations, someone who comes along and says, let's do things differently, the way we've been doing things all this time has been wrong - I mean, that person is often seen as a troublemaker. GINO: Oftentimes, what's different between a troublemaker and a rebel, in the way I think of rebels, is the delivery. Many people, after I was working on the book and they heard about it, asked me to go and watch them in their work because they said, I'm clearly a rebel, but it's not paying off for me. And so in a couple of cases, I did go, and I was watching them as they were interacting with their colleagues. And the elements of rebelliousness were there, but the delivery was wrong. So they were coming across as arrogant. If they were in a discussion and they thought that the discussion needed to go in a different direction, rather than saying, I see the value in your idea, and I think we can also bring to bear a different perspective, they were more shutting down the idea, letting the person know how wrong the idea was prior to bringing forward their ideas. There are the troublemakers - maybe people are breaking rules just for the sake of breaking rules. Rebels, instead, are really being constructive in their approach in a way that creates positive change. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering how writing and researching this book has changed your own life. How have you tried to internalize these lessons at home, as a parent, as a partner, as a friend, as a colleague and as a professional? GINO: In all spheres of life, I've changed my behavior quite a bit, or at least, I find myself pausing and trying to learn how to be an effective rebel. There is a story that I tell in the book about my son, who, at the time, was about 4 1/2 year old. This is a time where curiosity is as its best, so you keep asking why and what-if type of questions. And it's early in the morning. And Alex - is my son name - is having his breakfast - so a bowl of milk with some cereal. And as he's sitting at the counter, stirring his milk, he looks at my husband and says, Daddy, do we still have the coloring bottles that we used to use when we color eggs at Easter? So my husband is sort of looking confused. But he says, yes. And he walks to the cabinet. He opens it up and gets the bottle to Alex and said, Alex, what are you going to do with it? And Alex smiled and said, I'm going to color my breakfast. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). GINO: And you should have seen the face of my husband. He was confused and sort of disappointed. And he looked back at Alex and said, Alex, we don't do that. And Alex, being a 4-1/2-year-old boy, said, why not? Very reasonable question. And then my husband, even more confused with Alex's answer, looked at me and said, we don't do that, right? And that was a beautiful moment for me. As we were trying to struggle through this question on whether we do it or we don't do it, Alex opened up the bottle and started to put red coloring in his milk. And all of a sudden, the cereals were happily swimming in pink milk. And it's a perfect example of how often we go through life, and there are rules that we put out there that maybe should be questions. Why is it that milk needs to be white for breakfast? I actually tried it. So I now had pink milk, yellow milk, green milk, and it tastes just the same to me. If anything, you're really smiling (laughter) as you start off your day.

Scientists today need to figure out how much hotter the oceans are now than in the past, but the old measurements are unreliable. And figuring them out is more difficult than it might seem. Here's NPR's Rebecca Hersher. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: If you want to know how much hotter the oceans are today than they were, say, in the 1800s, you need two things - information about how hot the oceans are now and information about how hot the oceans were then. And it's that second part, the historical measurements, that graduate student Duo Chan was interested in. DUO CHAN: I sometimes joke with my friends - like, oh, I'm not only a climate scientist, I'm a detective. HERSHER: His detective work started with a tome that sent him down a crazy rabbit hole. The book listed all the ocean temperature measurements taken by sailors going back to the 1800s. CHAN: Yes. You'll see that there are, like, more than 100 different data sources. HERSHER: Whoa. CHAN: So what we. . . HERSHER: Wait. Can I read a couple of them? CHAN: Sure. HERSHER: So a Japanese whaling fleet. . . CHAN: Right. HERSHER: . . . Norwegian Antarctic whaling factory ships, Netherlands marine. CHAN: Yes. And here you have, like, the Japanese Kobe collection. HERSHER: In all, there are millions of measurements from all over the world. And most of them, up until World War II, were collected using buckets. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR: First, the sea temperature is taken. The movement of warm and cold currents affect the weather a good deal. HERSHER: This newsreel is from 1947. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR: The met assistant heaves a canvas bucket over the side and collects a sample of seawater and then takes its temperature. HERSHER: The temperature got written in a logbook. But sailors generally didn't write down other information, like how big the bucket was or what it was made of or how long they waited before putting the thermometer in - all things that could change a temperature reading. Peter Huybers is the lead scientist on the project. PETER HUYBERS: This is like if someone left you all their receipts that they had ever spent during their lives and you were trying to piece together what they had been doing. HERSHER: Duo Chan, the grad student, was undeterred. He had an idea. He took all the measurements and looked for ships that had passed near each other. So they had both measured the temperature of the same piece of ocean at the same time about. He found nearly 18 million pairs of measurements like that and looked for patterns and found one big one. The measurements from Japan in the 1930s seemed to be a little bit too cold - but why? Duo thought maybe Japanese ships were getting taller, so the water cooled off as it was hoisted all the way up to higher decks. So he found records about Japanese ship sizes. And in order to read them. . . CHAN: I learned Japanese. HERSHER: You did? CHAN: I did. HERSHER: Turned out, ships had gotten slightly bigger. But all that work ended up being for nothing because ship size actually had nothing to do with the cold measurements. It was something much more mundane - rounding. A colleague in the U. K. happened to send them some vital information, an old Air Force document. After World War II, the U. S. military had taken all the ocean temperature measurements from Japanese ships and digitized them. And when they did that, they dropped the decimal place. So if the water was 15. 1 degrees on one day and 15. 9 degrees on another, both temperatures were recorded as just 15 degrees. Overall, that made the measurements artificially cold by about half a degree. CHAN: It's amazing. Like, people keep a record of what they did. HERSHER: The team published their research this spring and it's made waves - because of their work, we now know that the Pacific Ocean used to be slightly warmer than we thought, which will help make climate models more accurate and potentially help avoid catastrophic climate change. Rebecca Hersher, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF . . . OF SINKING SHIPS' \"IT'S EASIER WITH NO DESTINATION\") DAVID GREENE, HOST:   Now we have the story of a strange and elaborate quest that all hinged on a couple decimal points. Scientists today need to figure out how much hotter the oceans are now than in the past, but the old measurements are unreliable. And figuring them out is more difficult than it might seem. Here's NPR's Rebecca Hersher. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: If you want to know how much hotter the oceans are today than they were, say, in the 1800s, you need two things - information about how hot the oceans are now and information about how hot the oceans were then. And it's that second part, the historical measurements, that graduate student Duo Chan was interested in. DUO CHAN: I sometimes joke with my friends - like, oh, I'm not only a climate scientist, I'm a detective. HERSHER: His detective work started with a tome that sent him down a crazy rabbit hole. The book listed all the ocean temperature measurements taken by sailors going back to the 1800s. CHAN: Yes. You'll see that there are, like, more than 100 different data sources. HERSHER: Whoa. CHAN: So what we. . . HERSHER: Wait. Can I read a couple of them? CHAN: Sure. HERSHER: So a Japanese whaling fleet. . . CHAN: Right. HERSHER: . . .

Right? You put trash in your bin. It gets emptied once a week. It's taken care of - except when it's not. A lot of the plastic in those bins ends up in the ocean. It's in whales' stomachs, on beaches, in rivers. NPR's Christopher Joyce has a story on what recycling can and can't do with all that plastic waste. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: At best, about 10% of America's plastic waste gets recycled - and a lot of it in China. But last year, China said, we don't want all that waste anymore. They called their decision National Sword, and it freaked people out in the U. S. What, they asked, are we going to do with all that waste? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: So welcome to our session, Life After National Sword - great panelists here. JOYCE: Last March, executives from companies that package their goods in plastic or who recycle plastic met in Washington, D. C. It was a time of reckoning. John Caturano is recycling manager for Nestle Waters. They sell water in plastic bottles. JOHN CATURANO: The water bottle has, in some way, become the mink coat or the pack of cigarettes. It's socially not very acceptable to the young folks, and that scares me. JOYCE: Sunil Bagaria runs a recycling company, GDB International. SUNIL BAGARIA: For long - forever, we have depended upon shipping our scrap overseas. Let's stop that. JOYCE: After a couple of days of this, a woman named Kara Pochiro stood up and said, OK. Don't panic. KARA POCHIRO: Plastic recycling isn't dead. It works. And it's important to protecting our environment. And it's essential to the circular economy. JOYCE: Pochiro is a vice president of the Association of Plastic Recyclers. The circular economy she refers to is, potentially, a way out of this plastic mess. The idea is essentially this. We need plastic, but we should try to recycle a lot more of it and use it again and again and again. That will eliminate a lot of waste and the need for more brand-new plastic. So why aren't we doing that? I visited the recycler that's trying - TerraCycle - in Trenton, N. J. ERNIE SIMPSON: I'm Ernie Simpson. I'm the global vice president of R&D for TerraCycle. JOYCE: Simpson turns plastic waste collected from beaches into new products. Inside his lab, he's got an array of sophisticated and expensive equipment. What goes into it is junk. SIMPSON: This is the famous beach plastic from the ocean. JOYCE: Wrappers, caps, bottles - Simpson must first figure out what kind of plastic each piece is made of. Some has to be melted, some shredded, some chemically treated. I ask him how many kinds there are. SIMPSON: Oh - indefinite, just about. I mean, there are about 20 different categories of material. But there are blends, and there are hybrids. JOYCE: The beach plastic project is a collaboration with Procter & Gamble, the big consumer brands company. TerraCycle turns the waste into plastic pellets. P&G turns the pellets into brand-new containers. SIMPSON: And so that's how the famous Head & Shoulders shampoo bottle was created. JOYCE: That bottle is being touted as an example of circularity. But there's a catch. Recycled beach plastic costs a heck of a lot. SIMPSON: This particular one is probably about three times as expensive as virgin. JOYCE: Virgin being new plastic made straight from oil and gas out of the ground. Another problem - there aren't enough recyclers in the U. S. to handle all the plastic waste out there. Even if there were, it's hard to compete with cheap virgin plastic pouring out of petrochemical plants. KEEFE HARRISON: Recycling is the underdog. JOYCE: Keefe Harrison runs The Recycling Partnership, a group trying to boost the industry. HARRISON: We're fighting an uphill battle of making it cost competitive from day one. JOYCE: Harrison says domestic recycling stalled because, for years, the U. S. outsourced so much of it to China. Meanwhile, plastic waste just keeps coming and coming. HARRISON: So we've got these companies producing these new packagings (ph) and new materials or new plastics in such a scientifically and business-driven way. And then it relies on the disjointed network that is recycling to get it back, and it is not robust. HARRISON: Petrochemical companies like Shell and consumer brands like Procter & Gamble have pledged to make more plastic recyclable. But it won't actually get recycled if recyclers can't make money doing that. Kara Pochiro of the Association of Plastic Recyclers, the woman at the Washington conference who said recycling is not dead, is more optimistic. She says the industry just needs some help. POCHIRO: We're trying to make consumers understand that recycling isn't just about putting your container in the bin. You also need to buy recycled. And if the companies understand that they want recycled plastics, then hopefully that will happen. JOYCE: But even if circularity catches on, there's a mismatch between recyclers and the petrochemical industry. If packagers really use more recycled plastic, they won't need so much new, virgin plastic. But the petrochemical industry says it will likely double its plastic manufacturing capacity from 2016 to 2024. According to industry documents, they'll spend $25 billion by 2025 to make more plastic. So where is all that new plastic going to go in a world that increasingly wants less of it?

It happened at The Florida Aquarium. And scientist Keri O'Neil leads the team there. She joins us now from Apollo Beach, Fla. Welcome. KERI O'NEIL: Thank you very much for having me - excited to be here. FADEL: So what does this breakthrough mean? Why is it such a big deal? O'NEIL: Corals are notoriously complex in their annual spawning cycle. It takes lots of different environmental cues to make this sort of mystical event happen once a year. And this species that we're working with is highly endangered. It's on the U. S. threatened species list and is really facing possible local extinction here in Florida. So we're hoping that this will actually prevent that from happening. FADEL: So it could save the reef. O'NEIL: Well, It definitely could save this species and many other species. Our coral reefs are facing a lot of problems right now. And I don't think anybody would be as boastful to claim that any one thing is going to save all of the world's coral reefs. But we certainly can't save them unless we can save the species. So being able to prevent some of these rare and highly threatened species from going extinct by keeping them in a laboratory and being able to still reproduce them in a managed breeding type situation really just gives us an option for the future. It's going to take a lot of time to get our oceans back to a healthy environment that can support really healthy reefs. But now we have this option and this tool where we can keep the corals safe in a well-designed aquarium setting and then reproduce them for many years to come to restore the reefs when they're ready. FADEL: So how do coral reproduce exactly? O'NEIL: Yeah (laughter). So coral 101 is that coral is an animal. They produce sperm and eggs. And they do this once a year. Just over a few nights in August, all the corals release their gametes out into the water at the same time. FADEL: So how do you get coral in the mood to reproduce - lighting, music? O'NEIL: Yeah. We do actually sometimes play music. But I think that's more for us because we do have to sit and monitor these corals for hours at a time and sometimes many days in a row. But when it comes down to that final month, it's all about when sunset is and then when moonrise is. So our lights are programmed to come on at sunrise. And then they get gradually brighter throughout the day. And then they fade down again. And they actually go off right around sunset. And then we have a little warm white LED covered in a Ping-Pong ball that simulates our moon. And then that will actually turn on at moonrise. So it's really those two key things that appear to be the final cues for the corals to release all of their gametes right around - within 20, 30 minutes of one another. FADEL: And so you really do play Barry White. O'NEIL: Yeah. We do. So we actually have our coral spawning playlist. That was put together by one of my staff members, Rachel Serafin. So she's more of the DJ of coral spawning. So she put together the spawning playlist, which has all sorts of songs to get everybody in the mood. FADEL: The DJ of coral spawning - I like that.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. For many people, this is what work sounds like nowadays. (SOUNDBITE OF NOTIFICATION BELLS AND VIBRATIONS)VEDANTAM: A constant thrum of notifications, tweets and messages. Every time we respond to an email or a text or Google a question that's just popped into our head, we pay a small price. In the moment, this price is imperceptible, but over time, it adds up. And we haven't quite come to terms with the cost of constant distraction. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)CAL NEWPORT: We treat it, I think, in this more general sense of, eh, I probably should be less distracted. And I think it's more urgent than people realize. VEDANTAM: This week on HIDDEN BRAIN, we continue our annual summer series, You 2. 0. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)FRANCESCA GINO: Authenticity is contagious. MING KUO: (Laughter) I have been dragged into this all the way kicking and screaming. VEDANTAM: . . . Ideas and advice about how you can respond to life\u2019s chaos. . . NEWPORT: Let me just do a just-check to my inbox. . . Just-check. . . Just-check. . . Just-check to my phone real quick. VEDANTAM: . . . With wisdom. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This episode, we explore ways to immerse ourselves in meaningful work. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Today, we look at the challenge of cultivating deep attention and what we gain by immersing ourselves in meaningful work. I spoke to someone who might seem like an unlikely advocate for technological restrain - a computer scientist. Cal Newport is a computer science professor at Georgetown University. He's deliberately tried to break away from the distractions of modern technology, and he's trying to get the rest of us to follow his lead. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)VEDANTAM: Cal is the author of \"Deep Work: Rules For Focused Success In A Distracted World. \" Cal, welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. NEWPORT: Well, thanks for having me on. VEDANTAM: You talk in your book about several highly influential thinkers, people like the psychiatrist Carl Jung, the writers Mark Twain, J. K. Rowling. And you say they all have a set of habits that are quite striking in terms of how they're able to get great work done. NEWPORT: This was something I noticed was very common to influential thinkers, is that they all seem to have this drive to, on a regular basis, cut themselves off from their lives of busyness and communication and distraction and isolate themselves to think deeply. VEDANTAM: What do they do specifically? NEWPORT: Well, what you'll notice is that they often will have a location, a separate location they go to when they want to think deeply that's often cut off from the rest of their life. So Carl Jung would go out to the Bollingen Tower, a stone house without electricity or running water he built by the lakeside outside of a small village in the countryside beyond Zurich. And J. K. Rowling, when she was struggling to finish \"The Deathly Hallows,\" rented out this big suite at the Balmoral Hotel next to the big castle in downtown Edinburgh where she'd go and just think \"Harry Potter\"-style thoughts. Mark Twain had a cabin for a long period of his life he would go to on the property of their house that was so far from the house that his family had to blow a horn to try to catch his attention. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). NEWPORT: . . . And let him know that dinner was ready. They'd go somewhere physically isolated and different where they can, without distraction, think deeply. VEDANTAM: What does work look like for the rest of us? When you look at the average American worker, for example, are most of us doing this kind of deep, sustained work? NEWPORT: The type of deep work I talk about is almost nonexistent, as far as I can tell, in most knowledge work positions. Even when people think that they're single-tasking, they say, I've learned a lesson that I'm not supposed to multitask. I'm not supposed to be on the phone and do email while I write. I'm just working on one thing at a time. What they're still doing is every five or 10 minutes, a just-check. Let me just do a just-check to my inbox. Let me just do a just-check to my phone real quick and then back to my work. And it feels like single-tasking. And it feels like you're predominantly working on one thing. But even those very brief checks that switch your context even briefly can have this massive negative impact on your cognitive performance. It's the switch itself that hurts, not how long you actually switch. So I actually think even very conscientious knowledge workers, who think they're pretty good at focusing on one thing at a time, are actually still working far from the sort of high-performance, deep work ideal. VEDANTAM: What is the evidence that the switching causes harm to the quality of your thinking? NEWPORT: Well, we've seen this show up in different types of scientific studies and from different types of perspectives. I think one angle that makes it pretty clear is the work that professor Sophie Leroy has done on an effect called attention residue. This is actually something that's pretty easy to isolate in the laboratory. You essentially give a subject something cognitively demanding to do that you can measure, like trying to solve hard puzzles. And then at some point, you distract them briefly as the experimenter, have them look at something else, change their context very briefly. When they then turn back to the original cognitively demanding task, you see their performance drops, and it drops for a while. It takes a while for this attention residue to clear out. And this is essentially what we're doing to ourselves when we do that quick glance at the inbox or to the phone. VEDANTAM: Cal, I'm wondering, do you think most of us are aware of the cost of distraction in our lives? NEWPORT: People I think intuit that they're too distracted, and it's making them feel fragmented and exhausted and anxious. But we treat it, I think, in this more general sense of, eh, I probably should be less distracted. And I think it's more urgent than people realize, that if your brain is how you make a living, then you really have to worry about this cognitive fitness. I mean, how are you getting performance out of your brain? Are you taking care to get good performance out of your brain or not? And people would probably be surprised, the more they think about it, you know, how much they're leaving on the table by the way they're currently working right now. VEDANTAM: I understand that folks at Atlantic Media once tried to quantify the financial cost of email, the amount of time people spend reading and responding to email. NEWPORT: Yeah, it was the CTO of Atlantic Media at the time did this study, where they actually went through and calculated how many emails people were receiving, how long the average email was, what their average reading speed was, so he could contemplate or calculate how many hours were being spent collectively. Then he cross-tabulated that with their salary, which he could then calculate what's their effective hourly rate and figured out that basically they were spending about the price of a Learjet every year paying people to send and receive emails. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) Well, most of us, I think, when we think about email, we actually imagine that, you know, addressing, handling, responding to 25 emails, 30 emails, maybe a hundred emails every day, that's just part of our job. We actually think of it as actually being part of our productivity. You're making the argument that, potentially, this is a cost that we're paying that actually impedes our productivity. NEWPORT: No one's ever made a fortune by being really good at sending and receiving emails. I think right now, we're - the early stages of digital knowledge work, we've adopted this workflow that's very convenient and very simple, which is let's just give an email address to every person and let work unfold in this sort of ad hoc, ongoing conversation that happens with this - messages going back and forth and back and forth. And it's very easy, and it's very convenient, but it's also drastically reducing the human brains that are the main resource of these organizations. So my way of thinking about this is that we've built up a culture of convenience and simplicity in knowledge work at the cost of effectiveness and true productivity. And this is something that we need to change. VEDANTAM: Does it matter that most of us are not trying to win a Nobel Prize or a, you know, a Pulitzer Prize, that we're not necessarily geniuses? Does it actually matter for most of us that we don't regularly put ourselves in a state of deep work? NEWPORT: Well, this is a big shift that I think has happened in our economy because it's an increasing portion of our economy that are essentially making a living by using their brain to process information and produce new information. And even if you're not trying to write great literature or solve a great theorem, if you're using your brain primarily to produce value, be it writing marketing copy or putting together a new plan for your business startup, these type of things matter. The human brain has become one of the main capital resources in our economy. It's what, in the knowledge economy, we spend most of our money on, is supporting human brains to process things and produce value. So we should care. I think the ability to do deep work would be relevant to the professional success of almost everyone in the knowledge work field, which is a huge part of our economy. VEDANTAM: I'd like to run a little thought experiment. Imagine we're following a doctor as she's making the rounds of a hospital. And she's looking at many patients. And presumably, the patients all present with different problems and complications and so forth. And I think what we would expect is for this doctor to very quickly flit from one subject, one topic, one patient to the next, that if the doctor were to say, you know, I can only do my best work if I can focus on one patient, deeply understand that case, spend a lot of time with it, yes, that might be true. But it's going to come at a cost, which is all the other patients that the doctor is not going to see. What are the costs of deep work? NEWPORT: Well, where I'd want to get with the doctor is just the ability, even if you're relatively briefly staying with each patient, to actually be able to stay just with that patient. So a case study I uncovered actually after the book came out was of two different groups at the same elite-level residency. One group had a culture of email. So hey, I need something. Here's a question. What about this patient? And they're expected to constantly be available by email. The other group consolidated that type of administrative or logistical conversations to set meetings. And what the doctor from that hospital told me is that they had a real hard time keeping people in that first group, where in the second group, people were much happier. So deep work doesn't necessarily mean I can sit, you know, half a day and just think about this one patient. But just the ability to walk into a room and just think about that patient and not have to see 16 emails as you walk into the next room and have that eating away at your attention, that can really make a big difference. VEDANTAM: You said that the people who were engaged in deep work ended up being happier. So it's not just a question of being more productive, but you're making the case that deep work produces a kind of intrinsic reward that doesn't come from being distracted. NEWPORT: It seems to. And in fact, this caught me off guard when I was researching my book. I ended up adding a chapter to the book, that was not in the original proposal, that was all about these findings I kept coming across and these stories I kept coming across about deep living also just being good living. People who spend a larger proportion of their professional time concentrating intensely on a single high-skill or high-craft target tend to enjoy their work a lot more. And there's a lot of different factors about why that might be true. But I, you know, ended by saying a deep life is a good life, and that's something I really believe in. It can take a knowledge work career and make it much more satisfying than being in a persistent state of putting out fires and busy distraction. VEDANTAM: Can you cite any professions where deep work is probably not called for and might even be a problem? NEWPORT: Sure. There's plenty of examples I think where deep work is probably not that relevant. A couple of the common examples I give is actually I think being a CEO of a large company. You're probably going to better serve your company or your stockholders by being a decision engine for other people who are doing deep work, someone who people can come to. OK, what about this? What should we do here? You can be a consistent source of the vision and push these decisions in a consistent way. Another example is let's say you're in what they would call here in D. C. government relations, where really most of what you do is contacts and connections and connecting the right people to the right other people and keeping up with what's going on in people's lives. That's another example of a place where long, solitary concentration is not going to make a difference. I think there's plenty of jobs, in other words, in which deep work doesn't make a difference. But I've also found, in my experience, that the number of jobs for which this is true is smaller than people expect. VEDANTAM: It seems to me there are connections here with ideas related to mindfulness or ideas related to flow, that you should be in the moment, focused on what you are doing. It seems to me that those ideas are intimately connected with deep work. NEWPORT: They are connected. So deep work can induce flow states, which is one of the reasons why people find a career pushed more towards deep work is more satisfying. It's not entirely synonymous with flow. We know there's other types of states that also count as deep work that would not fall under most definitions of flow. So for example, being in a state of deliberate practice where you're systematically pushing your skills past where you're comfortable so that you can improve, that's different than a flow state. It doesn't feel pleasurable. You don't lose yourself in the time. When you're practicing like that, you feel every single second because it's very difficult. But that also falls under the umbrella of deep work. VEDANTAM: And what about mindfulness, the idea that we should just be immersed in what we're doing, paying attention to what's going on in the moment? NEWPORT: There are deep connections to mindfulness. And one of the more important connections is that we know from the study and practice of mindfulness, such as mindfulness meditation, that getting better at that type of presence is something that requires practice and training. And we see this exactly happening with deep work in a professional setting. It's something that you train and get better at, just like you can get better at certain types of meditation, that it's something you have to work at systematically. It's a skill to be practiced, not a habit that you already know how to do and just try to make more time for. VEDANTAM: When we come back, we'll talk about how you can retrain your mind to focus, to sit with a single idea for a long period of time. And we'll talk about whether creating a deep work culture for some people means that others will inevitably have to pick up the slack. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: I'm speaking to Cal Newport, a Georgetown University computer science professor who's the author of the book \"Deep Work. \" It's about how we can cultivate the ability to focus on work free of all distraction. Cal leads an enormously disciplined life with a lot of rules and rituals. I asked him to explain how he structures his day to allow plenty of time for focused work. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)NEWPORT: There's a few things I do. One is I've never had a social media account, and that's on purpose. It's not that I think I'm better than social media. But to quote George Packer's essay on this, it's because I'm afraid I'd let my kids go hungry if I exposed myself to that. So that's one thing I do. Two - I'm very organized with my time. I work during very set hours during the day, and I plan out the day like a chess player moving the pieces around. This is what I'm going to work on when. I don't let my mood dictate how my day unfolds. And then three, I've made myself very comfortable with annoying people. I'm bad at email. I have just set the expectations that I'm just not available a lot. I'm not someone that you can expect a quick answer from. And that also causes some trouble, of course. But all this adds up to allowing me to regularly have long portions of many of my days focused on deeper thinking. VEDANTAM: I understand you actually keep a tally of how much deep work you've done, how many hours you've spent being uninterrupted. And you actually have targets that you must meet at the end of the day or the end of the week. NEWPORT: Yeah, that's right. This is something until recently I was doing. I was tallying, you know, how many deep work hours, so I had to confront that. I had to confront the reality. So if I was really avoiding deep work, I would see it. I've since added a new habit to my arsenal here, where I now block out my deep work on my calendar up to four weeks in advance so I have that time protected so far out in the future that I can be sure it'll stay protected. So now I have a record on my calendar of exactly what deep work I'm doing. VEDANTAM: Do people call you obsessive or basically say, you know, you're wedded too much to your calendar? NEWPORT: People do. People also seem, which surprises me, worried that that would somehow diminish creativity, that somehow having structure in your schedule means you're not going to be able to do unstructured thinking. Well, what I've found is actually quite the opposite. Being able to protect my time and to have long periods of undistracted time allows me to be a lot more creative. So I often push back a bit on that particular critique, that if I was just sort of ad hoc checking emails and social media and in a state of semi-distraction all day, I would probably be much less creative than my more structured approach. VEDANTAM: I understand you have a fairly structured approach to shutting down at the end of the day, of making sure that the tasks that remain unfinished don't bleed into your evening and your family life. NEWPORT: I have an actual ritual I do at the end of each workday where, pretty systematically, I'll look at my weekly plan. I'll look at my task list. I'll look at my calendar, make sure that nothing is left hanging, and then I'll do a little shutdown mantra. You'll say an actual phrase that means I'm now done work for the day. VEDANTAM: What's the phrase that you tell yourself at the end of the day? NEWPORT: I used to be embarrassed to admit the phrase was schedule shutdown complete, but I now have this small but strong fan group that use that exact same phrase proudly. So now I'm willing to admit it's schedule shutdown complete. VEDANTAM: Do you say this with others around? NEWPORT: No (laughter). It doesn't really matter what the phrase is. You know, I invented that phrase when I was a graduate student working on my dissertation and was really having a hard time with coming home from the office and having all these concerns. Hey, what if this proof never fixes? Or what if this proof breaks? What if I'm - my dissertation falls apart? And I needed something to allow me to definitively shut down. And so I was younger then. I came up with this phrase. But now it became habit, so I stuck with it. VEDANTAM: Cal, what would you say to people who would say, you're asking us to turn into computers, you're asking us to behave like robots? NEWPORT: Well, see, I would argue that that's what people are doing right now. We've turned ourselves into sort of human network routers. We just sit here and process messages and sort through task lists and have this sense of busyness that treats our mind like a digital computer processor, something that you just feed instructions to and it executes one after another. I think what I'm doing is actually way more human - this idea that our brain is not like a computer. It's not like any other machine we know. It's something that you have a personal connection to. And it's something that you really have to take care of, something that you have to coax high performance out of. So to have a structured day, for example, to protect your mind from distraction, I actually think makes you more human and less robotic than what most people do, which is to sit there like a human network router and just sort of process messages and tasks all day like a blind computer processor. VEDANTAM: There seems to be a paradox here because I think what I'm hearing you say is that scheduling yourself, or even overscheduling yourself, is the way to actually gain control over your life. Whereas people would sort of say, if you're actually scheduling every second and sort of deciding four weeks ahead of time when you're going to stop work on a certain Wednesday, you've actually turned yourself into a robot. NEWPORT: It's a paradox that shows up a lot. It confuses people. But I think you're right to point it out - is that if you study, especially really creative people, professional creatives, they are surprisingly structured in how they approach their day. I took a quote, at one point, from David Brooks, the columnist, and I might be paraphrasing here. But basically, he pointed out this observation that great creative thinkers approach their time like accountants, that this is this great disconnect, is that they're very structured and systematic about their time and produce the most unstructured, brilliant, creative insights. So it's a key paradox to point out because I really want to emphasize it. Adding structure and control to your time really can be the key to getting the biggest insights and most interesting work produced. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering if part of the tension comes about because we actually think of inspiration as being the thing that strikes us unexpectedly. And I think the case that you're making is that inspiration actually can be scheduled to arrive on command. NEWPORT: Well, as, you know, Chuck Close said - the artist - inspiration is for amateurs. I think we overfocus on the inspiration piece. If you're systematically pushing yourself and your knowledge and your craft, you will have inspiration. It'll happen in the shower. It'll happen while you walk to work. What's important is, you know, setting yourself up to have that inspiration and then giving yourself the time and structure you need to act on it, to actually produce something of value out of it. So I downplay the importance of inspiration, and I emphasize the importance of creating a life where inspiration is possible, and you're well-suited to act on it. VEDANTAM: I want to ask you a couple of questions that push back against this idea from a practical standpoint. What if people are in workplaces where they have managers and bosses who aren't enlightened enough to say, yes, you should spend several hours engaged in deep work? People can't always choose for themselves what kind of work they pursue. NEWPORT: Something that has seemed to be effective is, in that type of situation, having a conversation with whoever your boss is, whoever supervises you, and say, I want to talk about deep work. Here's what deep work is. And I want to talk about, you know, nondeep work or shallow work, and here's what that is. And both are important to my job. And I want to have a conversation and decide, what should my ratio be? That is, in a typical work week, what ratio of my hours should be deep work versus shallow work and actually nailing down a number, an aspirational target, that everyone agrees, yeah, this is right for your position in our company. It's not saying hey, boss, stop emailing me so much; you annoy me. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). NEWPORT: It's instead saying, hey, let's try to optimize myself. So what should I be going for here? Let me get your feedback on this. And people are reporting back to me, you know, tales of drastic changes to work cultures that they thought, there's no way. There's no way I'm going to get away with this, that I'm supposed to be on Slack all the time, or I'm supposed to be answering my emails all the time. They have this conversation. In the next week, they're spending 50% of their hours undistracted. So I've been pushing that particular managerial hack as a good, positive way forward to trying to fix some of these issues. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering if some people might say your advice is really advice for people who, in some ways, are at the top of their food chains. So if you have an author who basically is able to say, I'm going to disconnect from the world for 18 months - I'm just going to focus on writing this book - you know, someone else is probably picking up after this person in all kinds of different ways. If Cal Newport says, you know, I'm going to close the door in my office, I'm not going to answer my phone, I'm not going to check my email, but someone needs to get in touch with you in an emergency, that person is probably going to reach an assistant of yours. And that assistant doesn't have the same luxury of deep work as you do because he or she needs to be available to hear what the emergency is or to hear what the request is. Does having a group of people who are engaged in deep work necessarily mean there must be essentially a second tier of workers who are engaged in shallow work to allow the deep thinkers to do their deep thinking? NEWPORT: It doesn't require that, but it usually requires some type of reconfiguration of communication channels and expectations. So when I work, for example, with people maybe in a small consultancy that is client-facing, where they're used to this idea that clients need to reach us, issues pop up, what's important there is just to actually change the communication expectations. That maybe instead of having a client just have individual people's email addresses, the company sets up an email address for that client. And the company has set up some agreement on their end that there'll always be someone monitoring that, and here's the expectation of when you can get a response. Or maybe setting up a - it's sometimes called the bat phone or emergency phone idea, where you say, OK, here's a number you can call me at if there's an emergency when I'm in one of these deep work sessions. People set these up and say they get called maybe once a year. So I don't think you need actual extra people involved to make space for deep work. But I do think it almost always requires some effort, some sort of reconfiguration of people's expectations on how and when they can reach you. VEDANTAM: So I'm going to ask you a question now that's part serious and part teasing. You and I were scheduled to talk last week, and you didn't get the appointment down in your calendar, and I was sitting here waiting for you. And, of course, this kind of thing happens all the time. But in your case, I couldn't help but wonder, did he miss this because he actually hadn't spent the time doing the shallow work to get this in his calendar? And is it possible that when we engage in deep work, we are essentially, you know, getting the benefit of all of that deep work - we're getting the deep thinking, we're getting the accomplishments - but some of the cost is borne by other people, and they might actually be the people who are getting mad at you when they can't reach you? NEWPORT: Well, it's a good point. And I think that's actually - was what happened. Because I spend a lot of time working away from my computer, these type of problems happen to me more often. In this case - and, you know, I'm embarrassed it happened, but my vague memory was I saw this communication on my phone because I had to be on there to send something to someone, but I was far away from a computer. And so I wasn't able to easily add it to a calendar. And I was like, OK, I'll remember to do this when I get back to my office next, and I forgot. And it did cause problems. And I - so I'm embarrassed about it. And that type of thing does happen. And I think this hits on a big point, which is deep work, or a professional life focused on deep work, is less convenient for most people involved. But on the other hand, I want to put out there this notion that that might not be so bad, that it's possible that in this age of digital communication, we are focusing too much on convenience over effectiveness. VEDANTAM: I think, in some ways, what you're saying is also the tension between the short term and the long term. If I don't respond to a colleague's request or a manager's, you know, instructions to do something right away, it's irritating for the person at the other end of the line. And so I think most of us actually conform to the social norm of saying, yes, I'm just going to be responsive. I'm going to be available. I'm going to answer the question as soon as it's asked. The point that you're making, though, is that there might be long-term goals, deeper institutional goals, that are essentially - we're not thinking about. And, of course, when those goals are not met because they're not articulated, no one notices their absence. So people will notice it if you don't show up at an interview. People are not going to notice it if you don't write that bestseller or the next great idea. And so there's really a cultural bias in favor of the trivial over protecting what actually is most important. NEWPORT: I really agree with that point. And I would add to it that I think a big part of it is lack of metrics. So if we look at two parallel case studies, two different industries, let's look at the Industrial Revolution and the rise of mass industrial production. This was a world where the metrics for productivity were very clear. How many cars per hour is our factory producing? And what we saw in that world where bottom-line value was very easy to measure is that, very quickly, the structure of work moved away from what was convenient for the workers and towards what produced more value. It moved away from the old system in factories, where you had people work in teams at one spot in the floor to assemble the car, towards things like the assembly line, which are incredibly inconvenient. It's very hard to manage an assembly line. It's very hard to get it right. It causes lots of issues. It's annoying, but it produces a lot more value. You move to digital knowledge work. We don't have those metrics. It's much harder to measure, OK, what's the cost to our bottom line if you're more distracted or less distracted? And so my conjecture is that without those metrics, we are going to fall back on these interpersonal or cultural biases. We're wired to be social. We don't want to upset someone. These type of biases take over because it's much harder to measure, in this new world, the impact of different behaviors. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering if there's also a psychological explanation for the phenomenon you're describing. You know, I took a vacation a couple of weeks ago. And for the first time in a long time, I actually decided to unplug. So I didn't have Internet access. I wasn't checking my email. I literally was cut off from things going on at work. And when I got back, there were a number of things that had happened in my absence, some of which I wish I'd had the chance to weigh in on. But when I looked at the aggregate, the overall conclusion I got was really that the world did just fine in my absence. Things went fine. I actually wasn't as indispensable as I thought I was. I'm wondering if that might be a psychological driver in people being unwilling to actually cut themselves off - because not only might they discover that they are more productive, but they might also discover the world does just fine, thank you very much, without you. NEWPORT: You know, I think that's one of three big psychological drivers that have led us to this world we're in now with the sort of constant connectivity business. So that's certainly one, I think - this notion of - we get a sense a meaning and usefulness out of constantly being involved in interaction. I think the other two psychological drivers - one is just we're wired to be tribal. And it's very difficult for us, psychologically, to know there's an email waiting that we're not answering. And even if we know for a fact that the person who sent that message does not need a fast response, it still feels like we're at the tribal fire. And there's a tribe member standing there tapping you on the shoulder, and you're ignoring them. We just have a very hard time with that. And I think the third driver is knowledge work is much less structured. And so how do you prove to your organization or to your boss that you're valuable? And busyness, as a proxy for productivity, is something that a lot of people have defaulted to. Well, at the very least, if you see I'm sending lots of messages, you know I'm working. And so I think those three different factors are all intertwining to get us to this place where we find ourselves just constantly sending messages as opposed to thinking hard thoughts or producing new things.

SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST:  From NPR, this is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. For many people, this is what work sounds like nowadays. (SOUNDBITE OF NOTIFICATION BELLS AND VIBRATIONS) VEDANTAM: A constant thrum of notifications, tweets and messages. Every time we respond to an email or a text or Google a question that's just popped into our head, we pay a small price. In the moment, this price is imperceptible, but over time, it adds up. And we haven't quite come to terms with the cost of constant distraction. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) CAL NEWPORT: We treat it, I think, in this more general sense of, eh, I probably should be less distracted. And I think it's more urgent than people realize. VEDANTAM: This week on HIDDEN BRAIN, we continue our annual summer series, You 2. 0. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) FRANCESCA GINO: Authenticity is contagious. MING KUO: (Laughter) I have been dragged into this all the way kicking and screaming. VEDANTAM: . . . Ideas and advice about how you can respond to life\u2019s chaos. . .

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This episode, we explore ways to immerse ourselves in meaningful work. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Today, we look at the challenge of cultivating deep attention and what we gain by immersing ourselves in meaningful work. I spoke to someone who might seem like an unlikely advocate for technological restrain - a computer scientist. Cal Newport is a computer science professor at Georgetown University. He's deliberately tried to break away from the distractions of modern technology, and he's trying to get the rest of us to follow his lead. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) VEDANTAM: Cal is the author of \"Deep Work: Rules For Focused Success In A Distracted World. \" Cal, welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. NEWPORT: Well, thanks for having me on. VEDANTAM: You talk in your book about several highly influential thinkers, people like the psychiatrist Carl Jung, the writers Mark Twain, J. K. Rowling. And you say they all have a set of habits that are quite striking in terms of how they're able to get great work done. NEWPORT: This was something I noticed was very common to influential thinkers, is that they all seem to have this drive to, on a regular basis, cut themselves off from their lives of busyness and communication and distraction and isolate themselves to think deeply. VEDANTAM: What do they do specifically? NEWPORT: Well, what you'll notice is that they often will have a location, a separate location they go to when they want to think deeply that's often cut off from the rest of their life. So Carl Jung would go out to the Bollingen Tower, a stone house without electricity or running water he built by the lakeside outside of a small village in the countryside beyond Zurich. And J. K. Rowling, when she was struggling to finish \"The Deathly Hallows,\" rented out this big suite at the Balmoral Hotel next to the big castle in downtown Edinburgh where she'd go and just think \"Harry Potter\"-style thoughts. Mark Twain had a cabin for a long period of his life he would go to on the property of their house that was so far from the house that his family had to blow a horn to try to catch his attention. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). NEWPORT: . . . And let him know that dinner was ready. They'd go somewhere physically isolated and different where they can, without distraction, think deeply. VEDANTAM: What does work look like for the rest of us? When you look at the average American worker, for example, are most of us doing this kind of deep, sustained work? NEWPORT: The type of deep work I talk about is almost nonexistent, as far as I can tell, in most knowledge work positions. Even when people think that they're single-tasking, they say, I've learned a lesson that I'm not supposed to multitask. I'm not supposed to be on the phone and do email while I write. I'm just working on one thing at a time. What they're still doing is every five or 10 minutes, a just-check. Let me just do a just-check to my inbox. Let me just do a just-check to my phone real quick and then back to my work. And it feels like single-tasking. And it feels like you're predominantly working on one thing. But even those very brief checks that switch your context even briefly can have this massive negative impact on your cognitive performance. It's the switch itself that hurts, not how long you actually switch. So I actually think even very conscientious knowledge workers, who think they're pretty good at focusing on one thing at a time, are actually still working far from the sort of high-performance, deep work ideal. VEDANTAM: What is the evidence that the switching causes harm to the quality of your thinking? NEWPORT: Well, we've seen this show up in different types of scientific studies and from different types of perspectives. I think one angle that makes it pretty clear is the work that professor Sophie Leroy has done on an effect called attention residue. This is actually something that's pretty easy to isolate in the laboratory. You essentially give a subject something cognitively demanding to do that you can measure, like trying to solve hard puzzles. And then at some point, you distract them briefly as the experimenter, have them look at something else, change their context very briefly. When they then turn back to the original cognitively demanding task, you see their performance drops, and it drops for a while. It takes a while for this attention residue to clear out. And this is essentially what we're doing to ourselves when we do that quick glance at the inbox or to the phone. VEDANTAM: Cal, I'm wondering, do you think most of us are aware of the cost of distraction in our lives? NEWPORT: People I think intuit that they're too distracted, and it's making them feel fragmented and exhausted and anxious. But we treat it, I think, in this more general sense of, eh, I probably should be less distracted. And I think it's more urgent than people realize, that if your brain is how you make a living, then you really have to worry about this cognitive fitness. I mean, how are you getting performance out of your brain? Are you taking care to get good performance out of your brain or not? And people would probably be surprised, the more they think about it, you know, how much they're leaving on the table by the way they're currently working right now. VEDANTAM: I understand that folks at Atlantic Media once tried to quantify the financial cost of email, the amount of time people spend reading and responding to email. NEWPORT: Yeah, it was the CTO of Atlantic Media at the time did this study, where they actually went through and calculated how many emails people were receiving, how long the average email was, what their average reading speed was, so he could contemplate or calculate how many hours were being spent collectively. Then he cross-tabulated that with their salary, which he could then calculate what's their effective hourly rate and figured out that basically they were spending about the price of a Learjet every year paying people to send and receive emails. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) Well, most of us, I think, when we think about email, we actually imagine that, you know, addressing, handling, responding to 25 emails, 30 emails, maybe a hundred emails every day, that's just part of our job. We actually think of it as actually being part of our productivity. You're making the argument that, potentially, this is a cost that we're paying that actually impedes our productivity. NEWPORT: No one's ever made a fortune by being really good at sending and receiving emails. I think right now, we're - the early stages of digital knowledge work, we've adopted this workflow that's very convenient and very simple, which is let's just give an email address to every person and let work unfold in this sort of ad hoc, ongoing conversation that happens with this - messages going back and forth and back and forth. And it's very easy, and it's very convenient, but it's also drastically reducing the human brains that are the main resource of these organizations. So my way of thinking about this is that we've built up a culture of convenience and simplicity in knowledge work at the cost of effectiveness and true productivity. And this is something that we need to change. VEDANTAM: Does it matter that most of us are not trying to win a Nobel Prize or a, you know, a Pulitzer Prize, that we're not necessarily geniuses? Does it actually matter for most of us that we don't regularly put ourselves in a state of deep work? NEWPORT: Well, this is a big shift that I think has happened in our economy because it's an increasing portion of our economy that are essentially making a living by using their brain to process information and produce new information. And even if you're not trying to write great literature or solve a great theorem, if you're using your brain primarily to produce value, be it writing marketing copy or putting together a new plan for your business startup, these type of things matter. The human brain has become one of the main capital resources in our economy. It's what, in the knowledge economy, we spend most of our money on, is supporting human brains to process things and produce value. So we should care. I think the ability to do deep work would be relevant to the professional success of almost everyone in the knowledge work field, which is a huge part of our economy. VEDANTAM: I'd like to run a little thought experiment. Imagine we're following a doctor as she's making the rounds of a hospital. And she's looking at many patients. And presumably, the patients all present with different problems and complications and so forth. And I think what we would expect is for this doctor to very quickly flit from one subject, one topic, one patient to the next, that if the doctor were to say, you know, I can only do my best work if I can focus on one patient, deeply understand that case, spend a lot of time with it, yes, that might be true. But it's going to come at a cost, which is all the other patients that the doctor is not going to see. What are the costs of deep work? NEWPORT: Well, where I'd want to get with the doctor is just the ability, even if you're relatively briefly staying with each patient, to actually be able to stay just with that patient. So a case study I uncovered actually after the book came out was of two different groups at the same elite-level residency. One group had a culture of email. So hey, I need something. Here's a question. What about this patient? And they're expected to constantly be available by email. The other group consolidated that type of administrative or logistical conversations to set meetings. And what the doctor from that hospital told me is that they had a real hard time keeping people in that first group, where in the second group, people were much happier. So deep work doesn't necessarily mean I can sit, you know, half a day and just think about this one patient. But just the ability to walk into a room and just think about that patient and not have to see 16 emails as you walk into the next room and have that eating away at your attention, that can really make a big difference. VEDANTAM: You said that the people who were engaged in deep work ended up being happier. So it's not just a question of being more productive, but you're making the case that deep work produces a kind of intrinsic reward that doesn't come from being distracted. NEWPORT: It seems to. And in fact, this caught me off guard when I was researching my book. I ended up adding a chapter to the book, that was not in the original proposal, that was all about these findings I kept coming across and these stories I kept coming across about deep living also just being good living. People who spend a larger proportion of their professional time concentrating intensely on a single high-skill or high-craft target tend to enjoy their work a lot more. And there's a lot of different factors about why that might be true. But I, you know, ended by saying a deep life is a good life, and that's something I really believe in. It can take a knowledge work career and make it much more satisfying than being in a persistent state of putting out fires and busy distraction. VEDANTAM: Can you cite any professions where deep work is probably not called for and might even be a problem? NEWPORT: Sure. There's plenty of examples I think where deep work is probably not that relevant. A couple of the common examples I give is actually I think being a CEO of a large company. You're probably going to better serve your company or your stockholders by being a decision engine for other people who are doing deep work, someone who people can come to. OK, what about this? What should we do here? You can be a consistent source of the vision and push these decisions in a consistent way. Another example is let's say you're in what they would call here in D. C. government relations, where really most of what you do is contacts and connections and connecting the right people to the right other people and keeping up with what's going on in people's lives. That's another example of a place where long, solitary concentration is not going to make a difference. I think there's plenty of jobs, in other words, in which deep work doesn't make a difference. But I've also found, in my experience, that the number of jobs for which this is true is smaller than people expect. VEDANTAM: It seems to me there are connections here with ideas related to mindfulness or ideas related to flow, that you should be in the moment, focused on what you are doing. It seems to me that those ideas are intimately connected with deep work. NEWPORT: They are connected. So deep work can induce flow states, which is one of the reasons why people find a career pushed more towards deep work is more satisfying. It's not entirely synonymous with flow. We know there's other types of states that also count as deep work that would not fall under most definitions of flow. So for example, being in a state of deliberate practice where you're systematically pushing your skills past where you're comfortable so that you can improve, that's different than a flow state. It doesn't feel pleasurable. You don't lose yourself in the time. When you're practicing like that, you feel every single second because it's very difficult. But that also falls under the umbrella of deep work. VEDANTAM: And what about mindfulness, the idea that we should just be immersed in what we're doing, paying attention to what's going on in the moment? NEWPORT: There are deep connections to mindfulness. And one of the more important connections is that we know from the study and practice of mindfulness, such as mindfulness meditation, that getting better at that type of presence is something that requires practice and training. And we see this exactly happening with deep work in a professional setting. It's something that you train and get better at, just like you can get better at certain types of meditation, that it's something you have to work at systematically. It's a skill to be practiced, not a habit that you already know how to do and just try to make more time for. VEDANTAM: When we come back, we'll talk about how you can retrain your mind to focus, to sit with a single idea for a long period of time. And we'll talk about whether creating a deep work culture for some people means that others will inevitably have to pick up the slack. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: I'm speaking to Cal Newport, a Georgetown University computer science professor who's the author of the book \"Deep Work. \" It's about how we can cultivate the ability to focus on work free of all distraction. Cal leads an enormously disciplined life with a lot of rules and rituals. I asked him to explain how he structures his day to allow plenty of time for focused work. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) NEWPORT: There's a few things I do. One is I've never had a social media account, and that's on purpose. It's not that I think I'm better than social media. But to quote George Packer's essay on this, it's because I'm afraid I'd let my kids go hungry if I exposed myself to that. So that's one thing I do. Two - I'm very organized with my time. I work during very set hours during the day, and I plan out the day like a chess player moving the pieces around. This is what I'm going to work on when. I don't let my mood dictate how my day unfolds. And then three, I've made myself very comfortable with annoying people. I'm bad at email. I have just set the expectations that I'm just not available a lot. I'm not someone that you can expect a quick answer from. And that also causes some trouble, of course. But all this adds up to allowing me to regularly have long portions of many of my days focused on deeper thinking. VEDANTAM: I understand you actually keep a tally of how much deep work you've done, how many hours you've spent being uninterrupted. And you actually have targets that you must meet at the end of the day or the end of the week. NEWPORT: Yeah, that's right. This is something until recently I was doing. I was tallying, you know, how many deep work hours, so I had to confront that. I had to confront the reality. So if I was really avoiding deep work, I would see it. I've since added a new habit to my arsenal here, where I now block out my deep work on my calendar up to four weeks in advance so I have that time protected so far out in the future that I can be sure it'll stay protected. So now I have a record on my calendar of exactly what deep work I'm doing. VEDANTAM: Do people call you obsessive or basically say, you know, you're wedded too much to your calendar? NEWPORT: People do. People also seem, which surprises me, worried that that would somehow diminish creativity, that somehow having structure in your schedule means you're not going to be able to do unstructured thinking. Well, what I've found is actually quite the opposite. Being able to protect my time and to have long periods of undistracted time allows me to be a lot more creative. So I often push back a bit on that particular critique, that if I was just sort of ad hoc checking emails and social media and in a state of semi-distraction all day, I would probably be much less creative than my more structured approach. VEDANTAM: I understand you have a fairly structured approach to shutting down at the end of the day, of making sure that the tasks that remain unfinished don't bleed into your evening and your family life. NEWPORT: I have an actual ritual I do at the end of each workday where, pretty systematically, I'll look at my weekly plan. I'll look at my task list. I'll look at my calendar, make sure that nothing is left hanging, and then I'll do a little shutdown mantra. You'll say an actual phrase that means I'm now done work for the day. VEDANTAM: What's the phrase that you tell yourself at the end of the day? NEWPORT: I used to be embarrassed to admit the phrase was schedule shutdown complete, but I now have this small but strong fan group that use that exact same phrase proudly. So now I'm willing to admit it's schedule shutdown complete. VEDANTAM: Do you say this with others around? NEWPORT: No (laughter). It doesn't really matter what the phrase is. You know, I invented that phrase when I was a graduate student working on my dissertation and was really having a hard time with coming home from the office and having all these concerns. Hey, what if this proof never fixes? Or what if this proof breaks? What if I'm - my dissertation falls apart? And I needed something to allow me to definitively shut down. And so I was younger then. I came up with this phrase. But now it became habit, so I stuck with it. VEDANTAM: Cal, what would you say to people who would say, you're asking us to turn into computers, you're asking us to behave like robots? NEWPORT: Well, see, I would argue that that's what people are doing right now. We've turned ourselves into sort of human network routers. We just sit here and process messages and sort through task lists and have this sense of busyness that treats our mind like a digital computer processor, something that you just feed instructions to and it executes one after another. I think what I'm doing is actually way more human - this idea that our brain is not like a computer. It's not like any other machine we know. It's something that you have a personal connection to. And it's something that you really have to take care of, something that you have to coax high performance out of. So to have a structured day, for example, to protect your mind from distraction, I actually think makes you more human and less robotic than what most people do, which is to sit there like a human network router and just sort of process messages and tasks all day like a blind computer processor. VEDANTAM: There seems to be a paradox here because I think what I'm hearing you say is that scheduling yourself, or even overscheduling yourself, is the way to actually gain control over your life. Whereas people would sort of say, if you're actually scheduling every second and sort of deciding four weeks ahead of time when you're going to stop work on a certain Wednesday, you've actually turned yourself into a robot. NEWPORT: It's a paradox that shows up a lot. It confuses people. But I think you're right to point it out - is that if you study, especially really creative people, professional creatives, they are surprisingly structured in how they approach their day. I took a quote, at one point, from David Brooks, the columnist, and I might be paraphrasing here. But basically, he pointed out this observation that great creative thinkers approach their time like accountants, that this is this great disconnect, is that they're very structured and systematic about their time and produce the most unstructured, brilliant, creative insights. So it's a key paradox to point out because I really want to emphasize it. Adding structure and control to your time really can be the key to getting the biggest insights and most interesting work produced. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering if part of the tension comes about because we actually think of inspiration as being the thing that strikes us unexpectedly. And I think the case that you're making is that inspiration actually can be scheduled to arrive on command. NEWPORT: Well, as, you know, Chuck Close said - the artist - inspiration is for amateurs. I think we overfocus on the inspiration piece. If you're systematically pushing yourself and your knowledge and your craft, you will have inspiration. It'll happen in the shower. It'll happen while you walk to work. What's important is, you know, setting yourself up to have that inspiration and then giving yourself the time and structure you need to act on it, to actually produce something of value out of it. So I downplay the importance of inspiration, and I emphasize the importance of creating a life where inspiration is possible, and you're well-suited to act on it. VEDANTAM: I want to ask you a couple of questions that push back against this idea from a practical standpoint. What if people are in workplaces where they have managers and bosses who aren't enlightened enough to say, yes, you should spend several hours engaged in deep work? People can't always choose for themselves what kind of work they pursue. NEWPORT: Something that has seemed to be effective is, in that type of situation, having a conversation with whoever your boss is, whoever supervises you, and say, I want to talk about deep work. Here's what deep work is. And I want to talk about, you know, nondeep work or shallow work, and here's what that is. And both are important to my job. And I want to have a conversation and decide, what should my ratio be? That is, in a typical work week, what ratio of my hours should be deep work versus shallow work and actually nailing down a number, an aspirational target, that everyone agrees, yeah, this is right for your position in our company. It's not saying hey, boss, stop emailing me so much; you annoy me. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). NEWPORT: It's instead saying, hey, let's try to optimize myself. So what should I be going for here? Let me get your feedback on this. And people are reporting back to me, you know, tales of drastic changes to work cultures that they thought, there's no way. There's no way I'm going to get away with this, that I'm supposed to be on Slack all the time, or I'm supposed to be answering my emails all the time. They have this conversation. In the next week, they're spending 50% of their hours undistracted. So I've been pushing that particular managerial hack as a good, positive way forward to trying to fix some of these issues. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering if some people might say your advice is really advice for people who, in some ways, are at the top of their food chains. So if you have an author who basically is able to say, I'm going to disconnect from the world for 18 months - I'm just going to focus on writing this book - you know, someone else is probably picking up after this person in all kinds of different ways. If Cal Newport says, you know, I'm going to close the door in my office, I'm not going to answer my phone, I'm not going to check my email, but someone needs to get in touch with you in an emergency, that person is probably going to reach an assistant of yours. And that assistant doesn't have the same luxury of deep work as you do because he or she needs to be available to hear what the emergency is or to hear what the request is. Does having a group of people who are engaged in deep work necessarily mean there must be essentially a second tier of workers who are engaged in shallow work to allow the deep thinkers to do their deep thinking? NEWPORT: It doesn't require that, but it usually requires some type of reconfiguration of communication channels and expectations. So when I work, for example, with people maybe in a small consultancy that is client-facing, where they're used to this idea that clients need to reach us, issues pop up, what's important there is just to actually change the communication expectations. That maybe instead of having a client just have individual people's email addresses, the company sets up an email address for that client. And the company has set up some agreement on their end that there'll always be someone monitoring that, and here's the expectation of when you can get a response. Or maybe setting up a - it's sometimes called the bat phone or emergency phone idea, where you say, OK, here's a number you can call me at if there's an emergency when I'm in one of these deep work sessions. People set these up and say they get called maybe once a year. So I don't think you need actual extra people involved to make space for deep work. But I do think it almost always requires some effort, some sort of reconfiguration of people's expectations on how and when they can reach you. VEDANTAM: So I'm going to ask you a question now that's part serious and part teasing. You and I were scheduled to talk last week, and you didn't get the appointment down in your calendar, and I was sitting here waiting for you. And, of course, this kind of thing happens all the time. But in your case, I couldn't help but wonder, did he miss this because he actually hadn't spent the time doing the shallow work to get this in his calendar? And is it possible that when we engage in deep work, we are essentially, you know, getting the benefit of all of that deep work - we're getting the deep thinking, we're getting the accomplishments - but some of the cost is borne by other people, and they might actually be the people who are getting mad at you when they can't reach you? NEWPORT: Well, it's a good point. And I think that's actually - was what happened. Because I spend a lot of time working away from my computer, these type of problems happen to me more often. In this case - and, you know, I'm embarrassed it happened, but my vague memory was I saw this communication on my phone because I had to be on there to send something to someone, but I was far away from a computer. And so I wasn't able to easily add it to a calendar. And I was like, OK, I'll remember to do this when I get back to my office next, and I forgot. And it did cause problems. And I - so I'm embarrassed about it. And that type of thing does happen. And I think this hits on a big point, which is deep work, or a professional life focused on deep work, is less convenient for most people involved. But on the other hand, I want to put out there this notion that that might not be so bad, that it's possible that in this age of digital communication, we are focusing too much on convenience over effectiveness. VEDANTAM: I think, in some ways, what you're saying is also the tension between the short term and the long term. If I don't respond to a colleague's request or a manager's, you know, instructions to do something right away, it's irritating for the person at the other end of the line. And so I think most of us actually conform to the social norm of saying, yes, I'm just going to be responsive. I'm going to be available. I'm going to answer the question as soon as it's asked. The point that you're making, though, is that there might be long-term goals, deeper institutional goals, that are essentially - we're not thinking about. And, of course, when those goals are not met because they're not articulated, no one notices their absence. So people will notice it if you don't show up at an interview. People are not going to notice it if you don't write that bestseller or the next great idea. And so there's really a cultural bias in favor of the trivial over protecting what actually is most important. NEWPORT: I really agree with that point. And I would add to it that I think a big part of it is lack of metrics. So if we look at two parallel case studies, two different industries, let's look at the Industrial Revolution and the rise of mass industrial production. This was a world where the metrics for productivity were very clear. How many cars per hour is our factory producing? And what we saw in that world where bottom-line value was very easy to measure is that, very quickly, the structure of work moved away from what was convenient for the workers and towards what produced more value. It moved away from the old system in factories, where you had people work in teams at one spot in the floor to assemble the car, towards things like the assembly line, which are incredibly inconvenient. It's very hard to manage an assembly line. It's very hard to get it right. It causes lots of issues. It's annoying, but it produces a lot more value. You move to digital knowledge work. We don't have those metrics. It's much harder to measure, OK, what's the cost to our bottom line if you're more distracted or less distracted? And so my conjecture is that without those metrics, we are going to fall back on these interpersonal or cultural biases. We're wired to be social. We don't want to upset someone. These type of biases take over because it's much harder to measure, in this new world, the impact of different behaviors. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering if there's also a psychological explanation for the phenomenon you're describing. You know, I took a vacation a couple of weeks ago. And for the first time in a long time, I actually decided to unplug. So I didn't have Internet access. I wasn't checking my email. I literally was cut off from things going on at work. And when I got back, there were a number of things that had happened in my absence, some of which I wish I'd had the chance to weigh in on. But when I looked at the aggregate, the overall conclusion I got was really that the world did just fine in my absence. Things went fine. I actually wasn't as indispensable as I thought I was. I'm wondering if that might be a psychological driver in people being unwilling to actually cut themselves off - because not only might they discover that they are more productive, but they might also discover the world does just fine, thank you very much, without you. NEWPORT: You know, I think that's one of three big psychological drivers that have led us to this world we're in now with the sort of constant connectivity business. So that's certainly one, I think - this notion of - we get a sense a meaning and usefulness out of constantly being involved in interaction. I think the other two psychological drivers - one is just we're wired to be tribal. And it's very difficult for us, psychologically, to know there's an email waiting that we're not answering. And even if we know for a fact that the person who sent that message does not need a fast response, it still feels like we're at the tribal fire. And there's a tribe member standing there tapping you on the shoulder, and you're ignoring them. We just have a very hard time with that. And I think the third driver is knowledge work is much less structured. And so how do you prove to your organization or to your boss that you're valuable? And busyness, as a proxy for productivity, is something that a lot of people have defaulted to. Well, at the very least, if you see I'm sending lots of messages, you know I'm working. And so I think those three different factors are all intertwining to get us to this place where we find ourselves just constantly sending messages as opposed to thinking hard thoughts or producing new things.

That's because nearly a year ago, a young man was killed by a great white shark, the first such death there in more than 80 years. There's been an influx of sharks since a rebound in the seal population. And now, as Sarah Mizes-Tan of member station WCAI reports, some Cape Cod beach towns are taking new steps to keep people safe. SARAH MIZES-TAN, BYLINE: The sun is just starting to peek out from behind morning clouds at Newcomb Hollow Beach in Wellfleet, and Olivia Gattuso is sitting on the sand with her family. Normally, she'd be out in the water, but she's being more cautious this summer. OLIVIA GATTUSO: I mean, yesterday was a really, really good swimming day, and I wouldn't let myself go, like, anywhere above my waist because I was too afraid. But normally, like even last year, I would go out swimming for, like, an hour at a time. MIZES-TAN: After last year's deadly shark attack, Outer Cape towns are making changes. They've purchased taller lifeguard chairs, so lifeguards can see further offshore. There are now large signs warning about the risk of great whites in the area. And for this beach, there's also a new high-tech buoy in water that will alert lifeguards when it detects a tagged shark. JODY CRAVEN: We actually are just coming off a closing right now. We had to close for an hour because the buoy pinged at 10:15. MIZES-TAN: That's head lifeguard Jody Craven. The buoy sends an alert and a shark description to the lifeguards who will then call everyone out of the water. This year, these sightings have happened a lot, sometimes twice a day. CRAVEN: It was a shark named Ben, and he's about 13. 9 feet long. That's a pretty mature shark. MIZES-TAN: The buoy was set up by state shark researcher Greg Skomal, who began tagging white sharks off Cape Cod four years ago. He says the tagged sharks are just a small slice of the population that exists in these waters. GREG SKOMAL: We know at least 300 individuals, 350 individuals are visiting Cape Cod, but we'll, you know, definitely be able to tell you that that's not the actual estimate. It's going to be much more than that. MIZES-TAN: He's also working on a study about shark behavior to help advise towns. SKOMAL: You know, we talk a lot about seeing more and more white sharks from year to year to year. Now we'll be able to actually tell you, well, is it increasing? And what are the numbers looking like? And then get a sense of where the population trajectory is going. (SOUNDBITE OF ATV ENGINE)MIZES-TAN: On a nearby beach, EMT Henry Rex is riding an all-terrain vehicle. He's part of the town's new initiative to increase emergency response times in case of another shark attack. HENRY REX: So what we do is we kind of monitor all the sections of the beach, and then we work with the lifeguards, and we patrol around looking for stuff, make sure everybody is doing good. MIZES-TAN: The vehicles they're driving are equipped with a large plastic box and a duffel bag that contains all kinds of first aid equipment, including new items specifically for treating shark bites. REX: We've upgraded our equipment a little bit. We have a lot more trauma dressings and hemostatic dressings and stuff like that. MIZES-TAN: But some people say these measures are reactive, and they want towns to do more to prevent shark attacks. In the town of Chatham, select board member Shareen Davis acknowledges that she's heard of things like buoys that could detect not just tagged sharks but any shark movement in the water. SHAREEN DAVIS: There'd been calls for putting shark barriers up and pingers, and I think that would be great if we could. Those are costly, and I don't know if the technology is even there yet. MIZES-TAN: For now, she says towns haven't heard of any proven prevention tools. Officials think the most effective thing they can do is to make people aware of the new risk. For NPR News, I'm Sarah Mizes-Tan in Wellfleet, Mass. (SOUNDBITE OF TRENTEMOLLER'S \"MISS YOU\") AILSA CHANG, HOST:  It's been a bit tense on some of the beaches of Cape Cod this summer. That's because nearly a year ago, a young man was killed by a great white shark, the first such death there in more than 80 years. There's been an influx of sharks since a rebound in the seal population. And now, as Sarah Mizes-Tan of member station WCAI reports, some Cape Cod beach towns are taking new steps to keep people safe. SARAH MIZES-TAN, BYLINE: The sun is just starting to peek out from behind morning clouds at Newcomb Hollow Beach in Wellfleet, and Olivia Gattuso is sitting on the sand with her family. Normally, she'd be out in the water, but she's being more cautious this summer.

The sub's pilots were helping cash-strapped researchers - helping them explore the depths of Flathead Lake for free and study the lake's ecosystem. Aaron Bolton with Montana Public Radio explains. AARON BOLTON, BYLINE: It can be hard for research divers to see what's at the bottom of deep bodies of water, like Flathead Lake, unless, of course, they have a submarine. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: You're not claustrophobic, are you? BOLTON: Well, this will be a good test, right? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: That's right. Hank, we have a screamer. BOLTON: This summer, a group of submarine hobbyists - guys who build subs themselves - spent a week on Flathead Lake as volunteers. One of them is Hank Pronk, who lives in nearby British Columbia. On a recent Tuesday morning, we get into his two-man submarine, smaller than a compact car, already bobbing on the lake's crystal-clear surface. HANK PRONK: That's bang on 40 feet there. You want me to go down? OK. All right. We're going to dive. BOLTON: Pronk came to northwest Montana to help researchers explore the bottom of Flathead Lake, which is 380 feet at its deepest point. PRONK: So we're 14 feet from the bottom right now. We're on a slope, I see. BOLTON: Pronk's sub is capable of going much deeper than the bio station's research divers' limit of 100 feet. One of the station's research scientists is Jim Craft. He says deep-water research is expensive. JIM CRAFT: Unless you're going to do a lot with them, to put out, you know, $20,000 or so for a rover or - shoot. I don't know how much a submarine costs. BOLTON: But he does know they don't do enough research that deep to justify the cost. But the sediment and algae samples collected on this expedition might lead to more deep-water research. Video will also help researchers examine invasive mysis shrimp. CRAFT: So understanding their habits and what they're doing is really nice. BOLTON: This scientific reconnaissance wouldn't have been financially feasible for the bio station without Pronk. The sub hobbyists are members of Innerspace Science, a collective that connects researchers with private submarine owners. ALEC SMYTH: I mean, we started it two years ago. BOLTON: Alec Smyth is the site's founder. SMYTH: And it seems to be working out. BOLTON: The group's seven members solicit expedition ideas from researchers through their website. And because they're not commercial operators, no money exchanges hands. They're just in it for the experience. SMYTH: It's much more rewarding to use your sub that way than to just putter around and (laughter) - and then just come home with a family video or something. BOLTON: Smyth hopes the resulting research will bring in more expedition requests. PRONK: Now, I don't know what is all this stuff in the water. BOLTON: Back on the bottom of Flathead Lake, sub owner Hank Pronk and a fellow Innerspace Science member have found some of those invasive mysis shrimp beginning their daily migration to feed on the surface. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: If there's a current, that thing's moving. PRONK: Yep. So there they are. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: They're so tiny. PRONK: Yeah. BOLTON: The mysis population has fueled an explosion of invasive lake trout since the 1980s, significantly reducing numbers of native trout species. The resulting data from the partnership between the hobbyist sub owners and researchers could help lake managers understand what's happening with trout populations and how they might restore the ecosystem.

S. , low-income neighborhoods are hotter than wealthier ones. That's the finding of a joint investigation by NPR and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland. As NPR's Meg Anderson reports, that heat can be deadly. MEG ANDERSON, BYLINE: In a vacant lot in her West Baltimore neighborhood, Shakira Franklin is describing the first asthma attack she's had in nearly five years. It happened a few days earlier when temperatures hit 100 degrees. SHAKIRA FRANKLIN: In this neighborhood, that feels like 110. ANDERSON: For Franklin, that's a big deal. Her asthma is triggered by heat. FRANKLIN: You know, I didn't really come outside, but I had to go to work. And before I know it, I was gasping for air. ANDERSON: Breathing felt like trying to drink water through a pinched straw. FRANKLIN: You're gasping at this point. You're trying to bring your air through as much as you can. ANDERSON: She says when she drives out of her neighborhood to her job by the city's harbor, she can actually feel the breeze get cooler. FRANKLIN: Like, I can actually feel me riding out of heat. Like, when I get to a certain place when I'm on my way, I'll turn off my air, and I'll roll my windows down to save gas. ANDERSON: And so people know that. FRANKLIN: Yeah. When you from this area, yeah, you know it. ANDERSON: Franklin isn't imagining that change in temperature. Her neighborhood, Franklin Square - no relation to her name - is hotter than about two-thirds of the neighborhoods in Baltimore. It's also in one of the city's poorer areas. That's according to an analysis by NPR and the Howard Center. Citywide in Baltimore, the hottest neighborhoods can differ by as much as 10 degrees from the coolest, and the hottest parts of the city also have higher rates of poverty. We wanted to see just how common that pattern is across the country. We mapped 97 major U. S. cities by heat and income. The vast majority have that same pattern, to varying degrees. And more than two-thirds had an even stronger link between heat and income than Baltimore did. That matters because heat can have potentially fatal consequences. And, our analysis shows, the people exposed to that extra heat in the hottest parts of town are often the city's poorest and disproportionately people of color. On top of that, cities already tend to be hotter than their rural surroundings. BRIAN STONE: If you have less green cover, you will almost always have higher temperatures and greater exposures to heat. ANDERSON: Brian Stone, director of the Urban Climate Lab at the Georgia Institute of Technology, says trees and green space cool the air and provide shade. Pavement, on the other hand, absorbs heat and holds it in. At night, a large city can be as much as 22 degrees warmer than its surroundings. Plus, common features of cities, like major roadways, create even more heat. STONE: So all of the pollution that comes out of the tailpipe of our vehicles - there's also a lot of waste heat. ANDERSON: Stone says it makes sense that low-income neighborhoods often suffer more because compared to wealthier areas, they tend to have even fewer trees, even more concrete and even more waste heat from nearby factories or highways. That means as the planet warms, the urban poor will actually experience more heat simply by virtue of where they live. We went to the places in Baltimore where our data said it was the hottest, and residents there described oppressive summer heat. LEE LEWIS: It's like the sun just comes in and sit right here. HANNAH TRENT: It was so hot that you could smell the heat. JOE BOSTON: When it's hot like it is now, most of the time, I stay in. IANTHIA DARDEN: I can feel the wheezing coming and I need to go someplace where I know I need to get cool. ANDERSON: That was Ianthia Darden, Joe Boston, Hannah Trent and Lee Lewis. Living day after day in the heat isn't just uncomfortable; it can be deadly. The Howard Center obtained EMS and hospital data in Baltimore and compared it to the city's heat patterns. When the heat index reached dangerous levels last summer, EMS calls increased citywide for heat stroke. But calls also increased for chronic conditions, including several cardiovascular and respiratory conditions. And even when controlling for income, there were differences across the city. From 2013 to 2018, Medicaid patients in Baltimore's hottest areas visited the hospital with those conditions at higher rates than Medicaid patients in the cooler areas, according to the Howard Center analysis. AMIT CHANDRA: A lot of times, the heat played a factor in making a chronic condition acutely worse. ANDERSON: Dr. Amit Chandra runs the emergency room at an inner-city University of Maryland hospital. He says that's especially true for heart conditions because the body has to work harder to cool off. Respiratory conditions can increase, too, because heat can actually worsen air quality. Chandra says even looking at a patient's medical records won't necessarily tell you how heat could be harming their health. CHANDRA: We wouldn't diagnose them at the end of the day with heat exhaustion or heat stroke, necessarily, unless their temperature went up. So there's probably quite a few folks that are affected by the heat, and we're not really tracking or measuring. ANDERSON: In the ER at Bon Secours Hospital in West Baltimore, James Batson is wheezing and unable to catch his breath. REGINALD BROWN: How you feeling, sir? ANDERSON: The heat index, which factors in humidity, is nearly 90 degrees. BROWN: Mind if I take another listen to your. . . JAMES BATSON: Yeah. BROWN: . . . To your chest here? ANDERSON: Dr. Reginald Brown examines him. BROWN: Deep breath. ANDERSON: Batson has asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, or COPD. He's wearing an oxygen mask over his nose and mouth. Do you feel like your asthma and COPD gets worse in the summertime? BATSON: Only when the humidity's high. ANDERSON: What does that feel like? BATSON: It just - you can't breathe. Just feel like it - chest going to bust open. ANDERSON: He says when it's humid, he can't breathe, and it feels like his chest is going to bust open. Most patients who come to Bon Secours Hospital are low-income, and many are underinsured. People in poverty are more vulnerable to many chronic conditions, including some that are made worse by heat. And having less money can make it harder to cool off in the first place. Air conditioning, for instance, might be a pricey luxury for a family struggling to buy groceries. GEORGES BENJAMIN: People with money, of course, can do that a lot better than people with less money. ANDERSON: Dr. Georges Benjamin is executive director of the American public health association. BENJAMIN: Folks with less money - they're going to be in their one home, and they're going to have to deal with the conditions in their one home. And if they're going to be in an area where it's real hot, they're going to have to find other ways to adapt, but they can't escape it. ANDERSON: The urban poor, already often in hotter environments and already at higher risk for health problems, will have a harder time escaping climate change. BENJAMIN: It is the most significant public health problem that we have. It's going to be here for a long time, and it's getting worse. ANDERSON: There are ways to cool down a city - investing in public transit, designing roofs that reflect sunlight, planting trees. In Baltimore, city officials are working on planting trees in the city's low-income neighborhoods. The neighborhood where Shakira Franklin lives has increased its tree canopy over time, but in recent years, it's still been among the city's lowest. FRANKLIN: The city has a lot of responsibility, and I think that we would be close to the bottom of the list, to be honest. ANDERSON: So she's not waiting. Franklin and the organization where she works as a landscaping crew supervisor are planning to build a splash park in a lot near her house. FRANKLIN: Our kids - they deserve it. And I just feel like it's a long time coming to just have something to say that we built this here for us. This is ours. ANDERSON: On a hot Saturday this summer, they threw a party there, complete with a pop-up water fountain for kids to cool off. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Look what I can do. ANDERSON: But worldwide heat waves are getting hotter and more frequent, and the last five years have been the hottest ever recorded. Meg Anderson, NPR News. SHAPIRO: You can see the 97 U. S. cities NPR mapped as part of our investigation into heat, health and income at npr. org. And our City Heat series continues tomorrow with a look at why one of the best ways to combat urban heat is also one of the most challenging to maintain - tree cover.

So there's probably quite a few folks that are affected by the heat, and we're not really tracking or measuring. ANDERSON: In the ER at Bon Secours Hospital in West Baltimore, James Batson is wheezing and unable to catch his breath. REGINALD BROWN: How you feeling, sir? ANDERSON: The heat index, which factors in humidity, is nearly 90 degrees. BROWN: Mind if I take another listen to your. . . JAMES BATSON: Yeah. BROWN: . . . To your chest here? ANDERSON: Dr. Reginald Brown examines him. BROWN: Deep breath. ANDERSON: Batson has asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, or COPD. He's wearing an oxygen mask over his nose and mouth. Do you feel like your asthma and COPD gets worse in the summertime? BATSON: Only when the humidity's high. ANDERSON: What does that feel like? BATSON: It just - you can't breathe. Just feel like it - chest going to bust open. ANDERSON: He says when it's humid, he can't breathe, and it feels like his chest is going to bust open. Most patients who come to Bon Secours Hospital are low-income, and many are underinsured. People in poverty are more vulnerable to many chronic conditions, including some that are made worse by heat. And having less money can make it harder to cool off in the first place. Air conditioning, for instance, might be a pricey luxury for a family struggling to buy groceries. GEORGES BENJAMIN: People with money, of course, can do that a lot better than people with less money. ANDERSON: Dr. Georges Benjamin is executive director of the American public health association. BENJAMIN: Folks with less money - they're going to be in their one home, and they're going to have to deal with the conditions in their one home. And if they're going to be in an area where it's real hot, they're going to have to find other ways to adapt, but they can't escape it. ANDERSON: The urban poor, already often in hotter environments and already at higher risk for health problems, will have a harder time escaping climate change. BENJAMIN: It is the most significant public health problem that we have. It's going to be here for a long time, and it's getting worse. ANDERSON: There are ways to cool down a city - investing in public transit, designing roofs that reflect sunlight, planting trees. In Baltimore, city officials are working on planting trees in the city's low-income neighborhoods. The neighborhood where Shakira Franklin lives has increased its tree canopy over time, but in recent years, it's still been among the city's lowest. FRANKLIN: The city has a lot of responsibility, and I think that we would be close to the bottom of the list, to be honest. ANDERSON: So she's not waiting. Franklin and the organization where she works as a landscaping crew supervisor are planning to build a splash park in a lot near her house. FRANKLIN: Our kids - they deserve it. And I just feel like it's a long time coming to just have something to say that we built this here for us. This is ours. ANDERSON: On a hot Saturday this summer, they threw a party there, complete with a pop-up water fountain for kids to cool off. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Look what I can do. ANDERSON: But worldwide heat waves are getting hotter and more frequent, and the last five years have been the hottest ever recorded. Meg Anderson, NPR News. SHAPIRO: You can see the 97 U.

GREENFIELDBOYCE: Keith Tarvin is a behavioral ecologist at Oberlin College in Ohio. He says it's been known that squirrels pay attention to the alarm calls birds make when they spot a predator, and that's not so unusual. TARVIN: Lots of animals listen in on the alarm calls of other species. This has been found in a variety of squirrels - ground squirrels, tree squirrels. It's been found in monkeys, even in lizards. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He wondered if the squirrels also listen for other kinds of bird calls, ones that might mean safety. So he and a couple of students came up with an experiment. Marie Lilly did the fieldwork one cold January. She says she loaded some audio equipment into two repurposed cat litter boxes.

This investigation is from NPR and the University of Maryland's Howard Center for Investigative Journalism. And it shows that the heat impacts physical health but also that it might have an effect on mental health. Here's NPR's Nora Eckert. NORA ECKERT, BYLINE: In Jeanetta Churchill's Baltimore row house, the air conditioning is blasting. She relied on it more than usual when a blistering heat wave swept through Baltimore this summer. JEANETTA CHURCHILL: I don't even want to see what my power bill is this coming month. ECKERT: But keeping cool isn't just a matter of comfort for her. It's a way to manage her bipolar disorder. CHURCHILL: Heat is a challenge for me when it comes to my mental health. When I get too hot, it's hard for me to sleep, and when I don't get enough sleep, that can trip me over into mania. ECKERT: There are a few signs she's entering a manic episode - rapid speech, irrational purchases or bouts of anger. Sometimes, her episodes spiral more seriously. CHURCHILL: I have at times had suicidal ideation - not attempt but just my mind was racing so fast, it was out of control. ECKERT: Heat can be a stressor for most people, but Ken Duckworth, medical director for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, says people with severe mental illnesses are hit harder than most. KEN DUCKWORTH: In the summertime, heat waves are a risk for people with serious mental illnesses like schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and bipolar. ECKERT: One of the main reasons is medication. Drugs used to manage severe mental illnesses can have dangerous side effects in the heat, like dehydration or heat stroke. DUCKWORTH: They reduce your body's ability to modulate temperature. ECKERT: For Andrea Landry-Brown, these side effects hit hard. When she was living in California, on one particularly hot summer day, she says it got up to 110 degrees. She was driving with her kids in the backseat when she started hallucinating. ANDREA LANDRY-BROWN: I'm driving down the street, and I literally saw people walking in front of my car. ECKERT: It was a side effect of the medications she took for PTSD, anxiety and bipolar disorder. She'd been sensitive to medications in the past, but she thinks the heat sent her over the edge. LANDRY-BROWN: The heat would just make it worse. Whatever the side effects were, it was just that much worse. ECKERT: NPR and the University of Maryland's Howard Center looked at connections between heat and health in Baltimore. The Howard Center analyzed emergency response data from the summer of 2018 and found that calls for psychiatric conditions increased by nearly 40% when the heat index spiked over 103. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)ECKERT: Baltimore Crisis Response, Inc. receives hundreds of calls every day. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Any psychotic symptoms? Are you currently hallucinating, hearing voices? ECKERT: Their founding executive director, Edgar Wiggins, says although many of their patients experience mental illness, that's usually not the only health condition they're dealing with. EDGAR WIGGINS: If you've got a chronic behavioral health condition, chances are you're not taking care of or managing your diabetes or your hypertension. So if you want to add to that temperatures of over 100 degrees with this vulnerable population, it really puts them at risk. ECKERT: Wiggins says 3 out of 4 of their mental health patients also abuse substances. And according to the Howard Center, calls relating to substance abuse more than doubled in extreme heat. Dr. Duckworth from the National Alliance on Mental Illness says the risks of heat are only getting more urgent. DUCKWORTH: These are risks that you need to be mindful of as you contend with, you know, what is likely to be an increasing run of extremely hot days.

S. cities are often hotter than wealthy neighborhoods. It's the finding of an investigation from NPR and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland. Today we look at one of the best ways to beat the urban heat - trees. American cities are losing nearly 29 million trees every year. Many are struggling to reverse that trend. That includes Louisville, Ky. , which, compared to its surroundings, has been getting hotter faster than any other U. S. city. NPR's Meg Anderson reports. MEG ANDERSON, BYLINE: Annie Haigler is walking down her block in Park DuValle, a lower-income neighborhood on Louisville's west side. It's lined with single-family homes and well-kept, tidy yards. ANNIE HAIGLER: First of all, this is my neighborhood, and I love it, even without the things that I would want to have here. ANDERSON: Things like trees. She points to a small, scraggly one in the grassy patch running down her street. HAIGLER: That's the median right there. They've got a tree in there, but it's one tree. ANDERSON: There's another small tree behind it, and there are parts of this neighborhood with more trees. But overall, data shows the canopy here is about half the city average. Haigler says she thinks trees were just not a priority. Park DuValle used to be the site of a massive public housing complex. That was demolished, and construction started here in the late 90s. HAIGLER: So after 20 years, if we had thought differently about the design, we might have put more trees here. ANDERSON: Across Louisville, wealthier neighborhoods have as much as twice the tree coverage as low-income areas, many of which are communities of color. Jad Daley is president and CEO of the nonprofit American Forests. He says that pattern is often the case nationwide. JAD DALEY: If we show you a map of a tree canopy in virtually any city in America, we're also showing you a map of income. And in many cases, we're showing you a map of race and ethnicity in ways that transcend income. ANDERSON: Trees aren't just pleasant; they're key to fighting heat. DALEY: If you live in an area in cities that's seeing more extreme heat days but you don't have tree cover to cool down your neighborhood, that can literally be a life-or-death issue. ANDERSON: According to an analysis by NPR and the Howard Center, low-income areas of cities across the country tend to be hotter than their wealthier counterparts. Those areas are hotter, in part, because they often have fewer trees. And that heat can take a toll on health. Here's Daley. DALEY: The folks who are least likely to have air conditioning to weather heat waves, the folks who are most likely to have preexisting health conditions that put them at greater risk from those heat waves aren't getting the benefits of trees. ANDERSON: Between 2009 and 2014, 44 states lost tree cover in urban areas, according to the U. S. Forest Service. And when it comes to trees, many low-income areas are already starting at a deficit. Ked Stanfield, executive director of Louisville Grows, a nonprofit that plants trees, says it doesn't have to be that way. He took me to St. James Court in Old Louisville. It's a boulevard famous for its stately Victorian homes and an annual art fair. But we were there to see the huge, lush canopy towering over us. KED STANFIELD: If you were to look at an aerial view of this, it wouldn't look too dissimilar from a forest. ANDERSON: The trees shade us almost completely. Stanfield says it's a reminder of what's possible if trees are part of the plan from the beginning. STANFIELD: For anybody that plants trees in a city, this is the goal. This is the dream. This is what you hope to create in these cities. ANDERSON: But even if trees are in the plan, maintaining them takes money - a lot of money. This year, tree maintenance on this street, which is about a quarter-mile-long, will cost around $20,000, according to the neighborhood association. The city has planted and donated roughly 5,000 trees annually since 2013, but it loses about 54,000 every year, according to its own assessment, to invasive species, natural disasters and urban development. And Louisville is facing a $35 million budget deficit. They've cut funding to emergency police and fire services. Mayor Greg Fischer says he'd like to plant more trees. . . GREG FISCHER: But we've got to wrestle with this great American challenge, right? People want everything, but they don't want to pay for anything. ANDERSON: When it comes to planting tens of thousands more, he says. . . FISCHER: City government's not going to be able to do all that by itself. ANDERSON: He's counting on nonprofits and other institutions to fill in the gaps. At the University of Louisville's Envirome Institute, researchers are trying to make the case that trees are a must-have in city budgets. They're starting a study called the Green Heart Project and will plant full-grown trees as tall as 30 feet in a 3-square-mile area in Louisville. The five-year study will measure how the health of hundreds of participants changes and compare them to a nearby control group. In short, they're testing trees the same way you test a new drug. ARUNI BHATNAGAR: The idea was to run this whole project as a clinical trial, but instead of giving pills, we plant trees. ANDERSON: Aruni Bhatnagar is director of the institute. And he says, beyond cooling a city down, studies have linked trees to much more - better air quality, better stormwater management, lower energy costs, lower levels of stress, even a longer life. But Bhatnagar says you can't always isolate trees as the reason those things happen. BHATNAGAR: Everything remaining the same - now they put trees in it. What happens? ANDERSON: He says cities have divorced themselves from nature, and now he wants to show what happens when you put nature back in. Meg Anderson, NPR News.

They did what millions of us do as we chat with other people. They put down their smartphones on the table next to them. The host of NPR's Hidden Brain podcast Shankar Vedantam is here to explain what happened next. Shankar, welcome. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: I am dying with suspense. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). MARTIN: Tell me what happened. Did the phones start ringing? VEDANTAM: No. Just the opposite, Rachel. This is like that \"Sherlock Holmes\" story about the dog that didn't bark. The phones were silent, but the two psychologists noticed something about themselves. Here's Adrian Ward. He works at the University of Texas, Austin. ADRIAN WARD: We almost felt, like, this gravitational pull towards our phones even though they weren't ringing. We felt this pull. Our phones were sort of calling out to us even though they were silent. MARTIN: I mean, this happens to me all the time, right? You put your phone down. You think, it's cool. But you're drawn to the thing. You can't help yourself, almost. VEDANTAM: Exactly. And now, this got Ward and the other researcher, Maarten Bos, thinking. If their brains were occupied, at least a little, by feeling the phones were calling out to them, what effect might this have on their mental abilities? So along with co-authors Kristen Duke and Ayelet Gneezy, they conducted a series of experiments. They had volunteers come in to take cognitive tests, but there was a catch. Some volunteers were told to leave their smartphones in another room. Some were told to leave the phones in a bag or a pocket. And others were told to leave their phones on the desk next to them as they took the test. Now, all the phones were on silent. But big differences emerged between the volunteers as they took the test, especially when it came to understanding and solving novel problems. WARD: What we found is that people did better on these tasks the farther their phones were from them. So those who had their phones in another room did significantly better than those who had their phones on the desk right in front of them. And then those who had their phones in their pockets or their bags were sort of in the middle, between those two groups. MARTIN: I mean, that is amazing, right? So proximity matters. . . VEDANTAM: Exactly. MARTIN: . . . With these devices that we're so tethered to. VEDANTAM: Precisely, Rachel. Now, Ward and his colleagues are not saying that our minds turn to Jell-O just because our phones are sitting silently next to us. They're saying the devices have a small but persistent effect. WARD: It's something that we seem to be doing to ourselves all the time, right? I mean, so a small effect that billions and billions of people are experiencing almost every minute of the day seems like a pretty big effect when you think about the fact that we take our phones with us everywhere. VEDANTAM: The bottom line, Rachel, is that the devices we carry around with us are really powerful. They are seductive. But the fact they're so useful and so fun also means they can have unintended effects on us, and we would be wise to guard against those effects. MARTIN: NPR's Shankar Vedantam.

I'm Terry Gross. You may have heard stories about the CIA's secret experiments with LSD, through which '60s counterculture luminaries like Ken Kesey and Allen Ginsberg were first introduced to the drug. There's a lot more to the CIA's experiments with LSD, and some of it is pretty horrifying. My guest, journalist Stephen Kinzer, has spent several years investigating the CIA's mind control program, which was known as MK-Ultra. LSD was just one of the mind-altering drugs that were tested in the program to see if and how they could be weaponized to control human behavior. Many of the unwitting subjects of these experiments were subjected to what amounts to psychological torture. The MK-Ultra program was created by Sidney Gottlieb in 1953. He ran it until it was shut down in the early '60s. Gottlieb was also the CIA's chief chemist, creating poisons and innovative ways of surreptitiously administering them. He also became head of the CIA program that creates high-tech gadgets for spies to use. Stephen Kinzer's new book is called \"Poisoner In Chief: Sidney Gottlieb And The CIA Search For Mind Control. \" One of Kinzer's previous books was about the Dulles brothers, Allen and John Foster Dulles. Allen Dulles was the CIA director during most of the years MK-Ultra was in operation. Stephen Kinzer, welcome back to FRESH AIR. Let's start with, what was the mission of MK-Ultra? STEPHEN KINZER: During the early period of the Cold War, in the late '40s and early 1950s, the CIA became paralyzed with a fear that communists had perfected some kind of a drug or a potion or a technique that would allow them to control human minds. This was actually a greatly exaggerated fear, but it played on something cultural that affected everybody that grew up in the early 20th century. We were fed a lot of books and movies about the idea of mind control, that you could hypnotize someone or give someone a drug that would make them do something that otherwise they would never do. And seized by this myth, the CIA not only believed that communists had approached or reached this Holy Grail, but that the CIA should also find out a way to do it. So MK-Ultra was a project lasting up to 10 years in which the CIA sought to find ways to control the human mind. They wanted to be able to have a truth serum that would make prisoners say everything they knew, also an amnesiac that would make people forget what they had done and, most important, a technique or a drug that would allow the CIA to direct agents to carry out acts like sabotage or assassination and then forget who had ordered them to do it, or even that they'd carried out the actions at all. So MK-Ultra was the most sustained search in history for techniques of mind control. GROSS: So LSD was created in 1943 by Dr. Albert Hoffman at the Sandoz Laboratories in Basel, Switzerland. How did the CIA find out about LSD? KINZER: As part of the search for drugs that would allow people to control the human mind, CIA scientists became aware of the existence of LSD, and this became an obsession for the early directors of MK-Ultra. Actually, the MK-Ultra director, Sidney Gottlieb, can now be seen as the man who brought LSD to America. He was the unwitting godfather of the entire LSD counterculture. In the early 1950s, he arranged for the CIA to pay $240,000 to buy the world's entire supply of LSD. He brought this to the United States, and he began spreading it around to hospitals, clinics, prisons and other institutions, asking them, through bogus foundations, to carry out research projects and find out what LSD was, how people reacted to it and how it might be able to be used as a tool for mind control. Now, the people who volunteered for these experiments and began taking LSD, in many cases, found it very pleasurable. They told their friends about it. Who were those people? Ken Kesey, the author of \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,\" got his LSD in an experiment sponsored by the CIA, by MK-Ultra, by Sidney Gottlieb. So did Robert Hunter, the lyricist for the Grateful Dead, which went on to become a great purveyor of LSD culture. Allen Ginsberg, the poet who preached the value of the great personal adventure of using LSD, got his first LSD from Sidney Gottlieb, although of course he never knew that name. So CIA brought LSD to America unwittingly. And actually, it's a tremendous irony that the drug that the CIA hoped would be its key to controlling humanity actually wound up fueling a generational rebellion that was dedicated to destroying everything that the CIA held dear and defended. GROSS: Even Timothy Leary, who turned a lot of people onto LSD and helped guide them through trips, he found out about LSD because of Sidney Gottlieb. He wasn't part of one of the experiments, but what's the connection? KINZER: You're absolutely right. Tim Leary, who became the great guru of LSD, first came across psychedelics through Sidney Gottlieb, although like all these other people, he had never heard Gottlieb's name because Gottlieb lived in complete invisibility. So Tim Leary's interest in psychedelic drugs was sparked by an article that appeared in Life magazine in 1957. It was about a couple of Americans who had gone to Mexico and found the magic mushroom that produces hallucinations. Leary was fascinated by this. He later went to Mexico, and before he ever tried LSD, he was using those magic mushrooms. What he did not know and had no way of knowing is that that expedition to Mexico that produced the Life magazine article was paid for by Sidney Gottlieb and the CIA. It was part of his effort to test all kinds of substances, including naturally occurring ones like shrubs and trees and barks and mushrooms and fish parts and animal pieces, as possible tools for mind control. So it's not surprising that later on in life Tim Leary said the entire LSD movement was started by the CIA. If he had known better, he would have said it was founded by the CIA and, in particular, Sidney Gottlieb. GROSS: So just so I understand this correctly - so the CIA basically set up phony philanthropic foundations which then funded university and college research, and it's through those research experiments that people like Ginsberg and Kesey and Robert Hunter got introduced to LSD. And the university researchers had no idea that their research was actually being funded by the CIA. KINZER: I think that's largely correct. So Stanford University was running a program in which they asked for volunteers to come in and try this new substance. Allen Ginsberg was one of the volunteers; so was Robert Hunter. A similar set of experiments was going on at the Menlo Park Veterans Administration Hospital. That's where Ken Kesey took LSD for the first time. He was so excited about it he took a job in the hospital and began stealing the LSD to give it to his friends. That became the basis for \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. \" So all of these original strands that came together in the '60s to produce this great countercultural revolt based around LSD can be traced back through these bogus foundations to the CIA and, ultimately, the director of MK-Ultra, Sidney Gottlieb. GROSS: Now, there's a much darker side to this program because a lot of people who were being experimented on, they were prisoners. I mean, they had no idea what they were being given. One of those prisoners was the famous gangster Whitey Bulger, who was serving time then for hijacking a truck, and he was in the Atlanta Penitentiary. So he actually wrote something describing his experience. Can you give us a summary of what he said? KINZER: Whitey Bulger was one of the prisoners who volunteered for what he was told was an experiment aimed at finding a cure for schizophrenia. As part of this experiment, he was given LSD every day for more than a year. He later realized that this had nothing to do with schizophrenia, and he was a guinea pig in a government experiment aimed at seeing what people's long-term reactions to LSD was; essentially, could we make a person lose his mind by feeding him LSD every day over such a long period? Bulger wrote afterword about his experiences, which he described as quite horrific. He thought he was going insane. He wrote, I was in prison for committing a crime, but they committed a greater crime on me. And towards the end of his life, Bulger came to realize the truth of what had happened to him, and he actually told his friends that he was going to find that doctor in Atlanta who was the head of that experiment program in the penitentiary and go kill him. Now, that doctor later died a natural death, so Bulger didn't get to carry out his wish. But Bulger was one of many prisoners across America who unwittingly were fed huge doses of LSD, and the reason for this was very simple. Gottlieb wanted to create a way to seize control of people's minds, and he realized it was a two-part process. First, you had to blast away the existing mind. Second, you had to find a way to insert a new mind into that resulting void. Well, he didn't get too far on No. 2, but he did a lot of work on No. 1 - trying to find out how to destroy the mind of a human being, and that was the purpose of experiments that he carried out in prisons in the United States and at secret detention centers in Europe and East Asia. GROSS: And he worked with some pretty high-class torturers, too, from one of the Nazi doctors and the chief poisoner from Japan during World War II. How did they end up in his program? KINZER: One of the most remarkable discoveries that I made in the research for this book is that the CIA mind control project, MK-Ultra, was essentially a continuation of work that began in Japanese and Nazi concentration camps. Not only was it roughly based on those experiments, but the CIA actually hired the vivisectionists and the torturers who had worked in Japan and in Nazi concentration camps to come and explain what they had found out so that we could build on their research. For example, Nazi doctors had conducted extensive experiments with mescaline at the Dachau concentration camp, and the CIA was very interested in figuring out whether mescaline could be the key to mind control. That was one of their big avenues of investigation. So they hired the Nazi doctors who had been involved in that project to advise them. Another thing the Nazis provided was information about poison gases like sarin, which is still being used. Nazi doctors came to America to Fort Dietrich in Maryland, which was the center of this project, to lecture to CIA officers to tell them how long it took for people to die from sarin and was there a difference in how long it took to die if you were a small child or an infant, whether you were an elderly person or whether you were a healthy middle-aged person. The only way to know this would be to have killed all those people. The CIA was eager to get this kind of information. And actually, one of the things that is the most bizarre about the fact that we relied on Nazi doctors is that Sidney Gottlieb himself was Jewish, and his parents had emigrated from Central Europe in the early 20th century. If they had not emigrated, Sidney Gottlieb might well himself have been brought up in Central Europe, forced into a ghetto, brought to a concentration camp and become the subject of one of these grotesque Nazi medical experiments. Nonetheless, he didn't seem to have any problem working as a CIA officer with the doctors who conducted those experiments. GROSS: Yeah, I found that pretty hard to understand. But, you know, also, Kurt Blome, one of the Nazi doctors who was hired by Sidney Gottlieb, was on trial in Nuremberg. He was acquitted, but he was one of the Nazi doctors who was tried. And the Nuremberg Code established that if you are conducting experiments, that the person you are experimenting on needs to give informed consent. And of course, MK-Ultra totally violated the Nuremberg Code, but apparently the U. S. never signed on to that, never adapted that. KINZER: If the United States had used the Nuremberg Code domestically, Sidney Gottlieb would never have been able to do what he did; there couldn't have been MK-Ultra. What Sidney Gottlieb did is exactly what we sentenced Nazi doctors to death after the Second World War for doing in concentration camps. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Stephen Kinzer. His new book is called \"Poisoner In Chief: Sidney Gottlieb And The CIA Search For Mind Control. \" We'll be right back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF AVISHAI COHEN'S \"GBEDE TEMIN\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Stephen Kinzer. We're talking about his new book, \"Poisoner In Chief: Sidney Gottlieb And The CIA Search For Mind Control. \" Gottlieb created the MK-Ultra program which experimented with psychoactive drugs like LSD to see what the effects were, with the goal of learning if LSD could be weaponized as a form of mind control. It wasn't just a question of administering these super-high doses of LSD for very extended periods of time. There was also, like, questioning and other kind of testing that went along with the administration of these high doses. Tell us about that. KINZER: Gottlieb and the CIA established secret detention centers throughout Europe and East Asia, particularly in Japan, Germany and the Philippines, which were largely under American control in the period of the early '50s. And therefore Gottlieb didn't have to worry about any legal entanglements. In these places, he carried out his most extreme experiments, some undoubtedly fatal. We don't know how many people died, but a number did, and many lives were permanently destroyed. So what you found in these Europe experiments was a confluence of two interests, both that preoccupied the CIA. No. 1 was Gottlieb's desire to find the key to mind control, which the CIA considered its absolute greatest project and most important priority. Second, CIA officers in Europe and Asia were capturing enemy agents and others who they felt might be suspected persons or otherwise, what they called expendable. They would grab these people and throw them into cells and then test all kinds of - not just drug potions but other techniques like electroshock, extremes of temperature, sensory isolation, all the meantime bombarding them with questions trying to see if they could break down resistance and find a way to destroy the human ego. So these were projects designed not only to understand the human mind but to figure out how to destroy it. And that made Gottlieb, although in some ways a very compassionate person, certainly the most prolific torturer of his generation. GROSS: And were there any guidelines in effect in the U. S. that would have made it illegal had people known what he was doing? KINZER: This is one of the most remarkable aspects of the Gottlieb story. He operated almost completely without supervision. He had sort of a check off from his titular boss and from his real boss, Richard Helms, and from the CIA director, Allen Dulles. But none of them really wanted to know what he was doing. This guy had a license to kill. He was allowed to requisition human subjects across the United States and around the world and subject them to any kind of abuse that he wanted, even up to the level of it being fatal. Yet nobody looked over his shoulder. He never had to file serious reports to anybody. I think the mentality must have been, this project is so important. Mind control, if it can be mastered, is the key to global world power, that the idea of it disturbing a few lives or losing even a few hundred lives could not be seen as important enough to outweigh that imperative. Only when you get caught up in a cause like that that allows you to put aside conscience and all other moral considerations and even serious scientific considerations can you allow yourself to get caught up in a situation like this where one person is allowed, on his own whim, to go out and torture and kill people. And the people who might be supervising him really don't want to hear about it for reasons that have to do with the old CIA code which is the code of all secret services - the less you know, the better. You're not implicated. As a result of this, Gottlieb was allowed to work for 10 years without anybody supervising him or even really being aware or wanting to be aware of what he was doing. GROSS: So before Sidney Gottlieb started experimenting with LSD, he ran CIA experiments with marijuana, cocaine, heroin, mescaline. I guess those didn't work as mind control drugs. KINZER: He was trying everything. He not only used the drugs that you mentioned but extreme forms of stimulants and sedatives. One of the techniques they tested in Europe was to sedate a person to the coma state and then feed him extreme doses of stimulants. And then when the person was in the transition phase between comatose and hyperactive, they would electroshock him with very high doses, hoping that maybe this combination would be the thing that could blow away a person's mind. So the CIA, and Gottlieb in particular, were limited only by their own imagination. Gottlieb's imagination ran wild. He himself used LSD, by his own estimate, about at least 200 times. So his imagination was very fertile. And under the conditions of his employment, he was allowed to pursue any form of experimentation that he could imagine. GROSS: My guest is Stephen Kinzer. His new book is called \"Poisoner In Chief: Sidney Gottlieb And The CIA Search For Mind Control. \" After a break, we'll talk about how Gottlieb thought LSD could be weaponized to weaken world leaders and how he created poisons that could be used to assassinate them. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Stephen Kinzer about his new book \"Poisoner In Chief: Sidney Gottlieb And The CIA Search For Mind Control. \" In the '50s and early '60s, Gottlieb headed the secret CIA program MK-Ultra, which conducted experiments to see if LSD and other mind-altering drugs could be weaponized as a form of mind control. Gottlieb was also the CIA's chief chemist, creating poisons and unusual ways of surreptitiously administering them should they be needed to kill enemies, including world leaders, and he headed the program that created high-tech gadgets for spies. You know, one of the uses Gottlieb envisioned for LSD was - you could slip it to an unfriendly world leader, and their behavior would be so erratic and weird that they'd lose popularity or they'd be thrown out of office because they would appear to not be able to function normally anymore. KINZER: You're right. So Gottlieb was the chief CIA chemist. In that capacity, he was also the chief poison maker, so he made the poisons to kill Zhou Enlai, Fidel Castro, Patrice Lumumba. But he wasn't only involved in making poisons to kill people. He was also interested in making toxins that would affect their behavior in various ways. He made a list of the ways he thought drugs could be used to affect behavior. Could you find a drug that would alter a personality structure in a way that would allow the operator to take control of another person's behavior? Could you produce shock and confusion or physical disablement? At one point, he came up with the idea of using a spray can full of LSD to pollute the studio in which Fidel Castro was going to give a radio speech, and then presumably, Castro would become disoriented and, as you say, lose popularity and fall from power. This is the level of bizarre plots that he became involved with when he was hired as part of a separate aspect of his job besides MK-Ultra to be the person who devised toxins and psychoactive substances to be used in covert operations by CIA officers around the world. GROSS: So this is just a little sidebar that I found very interesting as somebody who listens to a lot of jazz. The people who Sidney Gottlieb hired included George Hunter White, who directed a lot of the MK-Ultra experiments, and he had been a narcotics agent and led the Narcotics Bureau's campaign against jazz in New York City. He spied on musicians and entrapped them, including Billie Holiday, and Billie Holiday being busted was a turning point in her career because she couldn't get a cabaret license. There were places she couldn't perform in. It was a really tragic thing for her, and that's this guy. KINZER: George Hunter White was one of the key operatives of MK-Ultra, and he stands out even in this extremely bizarre MK-Ultra cast of Nazi doctors and torturers and obsessed chemists. So George Hunter White, as you say, was a narcotics agent in New York, but he was the kind of narcotics agent who not only lived at the edge of the law. He crossed over a lot. He used all the substances that he confiscated from people. His use of alcohol and narcotics was legendary, but he was also a cop who did pursue jazz figures, including Billie Holiday. He had a special dislike for her because he said the way that she flaunted her furs and her big cars was offensive to him. GROSS: Wow. KINZER: In the early 1950s, Gottlieb hired this guy George Hunter White to run a safe house for him in New York City to which people would be lured off the street and then given LSD so CIA officers could watch them from an adjoining apartment through a one-way mirror. Later, White was moved to San Francisco, where he set up one of the craziest MK-Ultra projects that was known inside the agency as Operation Midnight Climax. This was an operation in which White would assemble a stable of prostitutes who would bring their men back to an apartment that the CIA hired and furnished, feed them LSD and George Hunter White would sit in an adjoining apartment sitting on a portable toilet, drinking pitchers of martinis while watching people having sex under the influence of LSD with the vague idea that this was somehow going to help the United States defeat communism. So these were the kind of people that naturally gravitate to a project like this one. GROSS: When the men were having sex with prostitutes and were unknowingly given doses of LSD, weren't they then asked questions to see what their answers would be like under LSD? KINZER: Exactly. So White and the people who worked with him would prep these prostitutes, and they would say, we want to find out under what circumstances - under what combination of sex and drugs men would be most likely to reveal secrets. So we want you to stay with the guy after the thing is over and talk to him and try to draw him out about his work and ask him, for example, you know that plane you've been working on? So how high does it fly, really? And the idea was to try to draw out information and to see whether drugs could make people talk, and of course, they found out things that are very obvious - that people will talk. Men will talk after sex. And the people who were observing these experiments, like George Hunter White, had no background in psychology or anything that would allow them to assess these situations in a clinical way. Everything was very slapdash and haphazard, so not surprisingly, no serious results ever came out of this, except the fact that we can now sit here and talk about the fact that our tax dollars were used to pay for a bordello run by the CIA in San Francisco to which unwitting men were brought, fed LSD and used as experiments in Sydney Gottlieb's campaign to try to figure out how to penetrate the human mind so it could be controlled in the interests of the United States government and its covert projects around the world. GROSS: Well, there's plenty more to talk about, but we have to take a short break here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Stephen Kinzer. His new book is called \"Poisoner In Chief: Sidney Gottlieb And The CIA Search For Mind Control. \" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Stephen Kinzer. His new book is called \"Poisoner In Chief: Sidney Gottlieb and the CIA Search For Mind Control. \" Gottlieb created the MK-Ultra program which experimented with psychoactive drugs like LSD to see what the effects were, with the goal of learning if LSD could be weaponized as a form of mind control. So Sidney Gottlieb's MK-Ultra program was ended in the early 1960s. Why was it ended? KINZER: After all the experiments that led to deaths in unknown numbers around Europe and Asia and led to unknown torments across the United States, Gottlieb, who was, in the end, a scientist, was forced to reach the conclusion that he had failed. Mind control, he finally came to conclude, is a myth. It was fed by fantasies from fiction that these people had imbibed at a young age. But once you got to see if you could transfer those fantasies from the realm of fiction to the realm of reality, they broke down. So Gottlieb finally had to admit he never could find a way to control human minds. And what skeptics had said at the beginning, which is that you cannot program a person to do something that he or she is basically and deeply and morally opposed to doing, and make them go out and do it. He had to waste unknown numbers of lives in order to reach a conclusion that should have been clear from the beginning. GROSS: So what did he do after the MK-Ultra program was ended? Because he stayed in the CIA. KINZER: Gottlieb had a long career after MK-Ultra ended, and he went on to become the head of the Technical Services staff, which is the - part of the CIA where they make the tools, the gizmos, the gadgets that spies use. So if you remember Q from those James Bond movies, that was Gottlieb. And he spent years at the head of that operation. And he made an astonishing variety of covert tools from all those things you see on TV like cameras that you can fit inside a cigarette lighter or a tie clip, all the way to more bizarre things like a rubber boat, a car with a secret compartment to smuggle agents out of foreign countries, a compressor for foreign currency so you could pack a huge amount of it into a small container, and even a jailbreak kit that could be contained in a rectal suppository. He invented a hyper. . . GROSS: Can you explain that? 'Cause I can't envision that exactly. KINZER: (Laughter) He had a series of tiny tools that would have knives and other devices that would allow you to break through solid walls, all miniaturized. This was just a piece of his genius. He invented a hyper-thin hypodermic needle so that you could poison a bottle of wine through the cork without leaving any trace in the cork. His imagination was just as fertile when he was inventing spy tools for CIA officers as it had been earlier when he was trying to devise ways of finding mind control techniques. GROSS: You describe him as the poisoner in chief, and that's not just about the LSD experiments. He actually created and found ways to administer poison. Describe that part of his job. KINZER: As the chief CIA chemist, it was logical that Gottlieb be consulted whenever the CIA needed a poison or a toxin. And this became part of his work during the late 1950s and into 1960. In the mid-'50s, the United States set out on a project to kill Prime Minister Zhou Enlai of China while he was visiting Indonesia. Gottlieb actually made a potion that was supposed to be put in a rice bowl that Zhou Enlai would eat from. And actually, this poison was only going to work after a day or two. The idea was that Zhou would be back in China, and the poison wouldn't be able to be traced back to the CIA. Later on, when the CIA became obsessed at the order of the White House in killing Fidel Castro, it was Sidney Gottlieb who made all the poison pills, the poison potions, even the poison wet suit that was supposed to be given to Castro. In 1960, President Eisenhower ordered the assassination of Patrice Lumumba, the prime minister of the Congo. Sidney Gottlieb was given the job of making the poison. GROSS: Among the very, very bizarre things about Sidney Gottlieb is after leaving the CIA, he pursued a spiritual life. He and his wife go to India. They tried to work with the poor. They're working with people who have leprosy. It is so hard to reconcile the different parts of Sydney Gottlieb's personality - an Orthodox Jew who works with Nazi doctors on the CIA drug experiments, somebody who has, like, ruined lives, who's created poisons and done these, like, really horrible experiments and people but feels like he himself is a very spiritual person. KINZER: This is one of the things that makes the Gottlieb story so fascinating. So Gottlieb really lived a Jekyll-and-Hyde life. We already talked about the things that he was doing in his day job, but what was he like outside of work? Actually, he was a very gentle, compassionate humanist. He lived in an eco cabin in the woods with no running water. He grew his own vegetables. He meditated. He studied Buddhism and wrote poetry. He got up before dawn to milk his goats. He ate yogurt at work and preached the benefits of natural living way back in the 1950s. Later on he built himself one of the first solar homes in Virginia. So he was kind of a proto hippie. And he traveled between these two worlds of spiritual meditation and then torturous experiments. I think it creates a much fuller and more perplexing picture of a person who lived such different sides of his life. You wonder, how could he have reconciled this? Maybe he was thinking that he was an extreme individualist and he was fighting a global force that wanted to crush all individualism in the world, and therefore anything was justified. In the long run, in the cosmic sense, I think you can say that commitment to a cause always gives you the justification for immoral acts. And patriotism is among the most seductive of those causes because it posits the nation as a value that's so transcendent that anything done in its service is virtuous. So caught up in that mentality of the age, and maybe by his own personal desire to be of service to the United States - because, as a result of his handicap, he had been refused the chance to serve in World War II - Gottlieb felt that he could put aside the normal pull of conscience and morality. I don't think he ever faced the question or answered the question of whether there are limits to the amount of evil you can do in a righteous cause before the evil begins to outweigh the righteousness. GROSS: So Sidney Gottlieb worked in secrecy. That secrecy was partially shattered by the Church Committee, a committee - it was a Senate committee from the 1970s that was chaired by Democratic Senator Frank Church. And it was tasked with investigating abuses committed by intelligence agencies, and Gottlieb was called to testify. So how much did the committee find out about what Gottlieb had really done? KINZER: Gottlieb was living in India, working in a hospital for leprosy victims when he got a note from the CIA saying, somebody has figured out who you are, and that somebody is the Church Committee that's investigating the CIA, and they want to talk to you. So the anonymity in which Gottlieb had lived his whole life was suddenly under threat. Gottlieb had to come back to the United States. He did testify at two rounds of hearings, one undercover - that is, under a pseudonym in a private room - another under his own name but also in a private room. And the Senators were able to ask him some probing questions, but really, they didn't know anything about MK-Ultra. If they had known anything like what's in this book, Gottlieb would have been questioned much more seriously, but the Church Committee was focused on a number of other abuses that the CIA had been accused of, like domestic spying, assassination plots in which Gottlieb had played, essentially, only the role of a pharmacist. They didn't know what he had done abroad. They didn't know what he had done in prisons inside the United States. His lawyer had arranged for him to be granted immunity from prosecution for his testimony. Nonetheless, he didn't reveal anything, and he claimed, essentially, to have forgotten everything that he had spent his whole CIA career doing. So he forgot who his boss was. He forgot who was deputy was. He couldn't remember what part of the CIA he had worked in. And the Church Committee investigators didn't press him hard enough. They didn't know what to ask him. So essentially, although his anonymity was briefly shattered, he was able to emerge from that experience without anybody reaching the heart of his mystery. GROSS: Gottlieb tried to destroy evidence of programs that he headed. What did he do to try to destroy the evidence of MK-Ultra? KINZER: The end of Gottlieb's career came in 1972 when his patron Richard Helms, who was then director of the CIA, was removed by Nixon. Once Helms was gone, it was just a matter of time until Gottlieb would be gone, and most important was that Helms was really the only person at the CIA who had an idea of what Gottlieb had been doing. So as they were both on their way out of the CIA, they agreed that they should destroy all records of MK-Ultra. Gottlieb actually drove out to the CIA Records Center and ordered the archivist to destroy boxes full of MK-Ultra records, and he wrote in his report that these records were destroyed over my stated objections. So the records of MK-Ultra were destroyed as Gottlieb was leaving office. However, it turns out that there were some found in other places. There was a depot for expense account reports that had not been destroyed, and various other pieces of paper remained. So there is enough out there to reconstruct some of what he did, but his effort to wipe away his traces by destroying all those documents in the early '70s was quite successful. GROSS: Well, Stephen Kinzer, thank you for this book. I found the revelations in it really remarkable. Thank you for talking with us. KINZER: Thank you. GROSS: Stephen Kinzer is the author of the new book \"Poisoner In Chief: Sidney Gottlieb And The CIA Search For Mind Control. \" This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF THE MIDNIGHT HOUR'S \"BETTER ENDEAVOR\") TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. You may have heard stories about the CIA's secret experiments with LSD, through which '60s counterculture luminaries like Ken Kesey and Allen Ginsberg were first introduced to the drug. There's a lot more to the CIA's experiments with LSD, and some of it is pretty horrifying. My guest, journalist Stephen Kinzer, has spent several years investigating the CIA's mind control program, which was known as MK-Ultra. LSD was just one of the mind-altering drugs that were tested in the program to see if and how they could be weaponized to control human behavior. Many of the unwitting subjects of these experiments were subjected to what amounts to psychological torture. The MK-Ultra program was created by Sidney Gottlieb in 1953. He ran it until it was shut down in the early '60s. Gottlieb was also the CIA's chief chemist, creating poisons and innovative ways of surreptitiously administering them. He also became head of the CIA program that creates high-tech gadgets for spies to use. Stephen Kinzer's new book is called \"Poisoner In Chief: Sidney Gottlieb And The CIA Search For Mind Control. \" One of Kinzer's previous books was about the Dulles brothers, Allen and John Foster Dulles. Allen Dulles was the CIA director during most of the years MK-Ultra was in operation. Stephen Kinzer, welcome back to FRESH AIR. Let's start with, what was the mission of MK-Ultra? STEPHEN KINZER: During the early period of the Cold War, in the late '40s and early 1950s, the CIA became paralyzed with a fear that communists had perfected some kind of a drug or a potion or a technique that would allow them to control human minds. This was actually a greatly exaggerated fear, but it played on something cultural that affected everybody that grew up in the early 20th century. We were fed a lot of books and movies about the idea of mind control, that you could hypnotize someone or give someone a drug that would make them do something that otherwise they would never do. And seized by this myth, the CIA not only believed that communists had approached or reached this Holy Grail, but that the CIA should also find out a way to do it. So MK-Ultra was a project lasting up to 10 years in which the CIA sought to find ways to control the human mind. They wanted to be able to have a truth serum that would make prisoners say everything they knew, also an amnesiac that would make people forget what they had done and, most important, a technique or a drug that would allow the CIA to direct agents to carry out acts like sabotage or assassination and then forget who had ordered them to do it, or even that they'd carried out the actions at all. So MK-Ultra was the most sustained search in history for techniques of mind control. GROSS: So LSD was created in 1943 by Dr. Albert Hoffman at the Sandoz Laboratories in Basel, Switzerland. How did the CIA find out about LSD? KINZER: As part of the search for drugs that would allow people to control the human mind, CIA scientists became aware of the existence of LSD, and this became an obsession for the early directors of MK-Ultra. Actually, the MK-Ultra director, Sidney Gottlieb, can now be seen as the man who brought LSD to America. He was the unwitting godfather of the entire LSD counterculture. In the early 1950s, he arranged for the CIA to pay $240,000 to buy the world's entire supply of LSD. He brought this to the United States, and he began spreading it around to hospitals, clinics, prisons and other institutions, asking them, through bogus foundations, to carry out research projects and find out what LSD was, how people reacted to it and how it might be able to be used as a tool for mind control. Now, the people who volunteered for these experiments and began taking LSD, in many cases, found it very pleasurable. They told their friends about it. Who were those people? Ken Kesey, the author of \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,\" got his LSD in an experiment sponsored by the CIA, by MK-Ultra, by Sidney Gottlieb. So did Robert Hunter, the lyricist for the Grateful Dead, which went on to become a great purveyor of LSD culture. Allen Ginsberg, the poet who preached the value of the great personal adventure of using LSD, got his first LSD from Sidney Gottlieb, although of course he never knew that name. So CIA brought LSD to America unwittingly. And actually, it's a tremendous irony that the drug that the CIA hoped would be its key to controlling humanity actually wound up fueling a generational rebellion that was dedicated to destroying everything that the CIA held dear and defended. GROSS: Even Timothy Leary, who turned a lot of people onto LSD and helped guide them through trips, he found out about LSD because of Sidney Gottlieb. He wasn't part of one of the experiments, but what's the connection? KINZER: You're absolutely right. Tim Leary, who became the great guru of LSD, first came across psychedelics through Sidney Gottlieb, although like all these other people, he had never heard Gottlieb's name because Gottlieb lived in complete invisibility. So Tim Leary's interest in psychedelic drugs was sparked by an article that appeared in Life magazine in 1957. It was about a couple of Americans who had gone to Mexico and found the magic mushroom that produces hallucinations. Leary was fascinated by this. He later went to Mexico, and before he ever tried LSD, he was using those magic mushrooms. What he did not know and had no way of knowing is that that expedition to Mexico that produced the Life magazine article was paid for by Sidney Gottlieb and the CIA. It was part of his effort to test all kinds of substances, including naturally occurring ones like shrubs and trees and barks and mushrooms and fish parts and animal pieces, as possible tools for mind control. So it's not surprising that later on in life Tim Leary said the entire LSD movement was started by the CIA. If he had known better, he would have said it was founded by the CIA and, in particular, Sidney Gottlieb. GROSS: So just so I understand this correctly - so the CIA basically set up phony philanthropic foundations which then funded university and college research, and it's through those research experiments that people like Ginsberg and Kesey and Robert Hunter got introduced to LSD. And the university researchers had no idea that their research was actually being funded by the CIA. KINZER: I think that's largely correct. So Stanford University was running a program in which they asked for volunteers to come in and try this new substance. Allen Ginsberg was one of the volunteers; so was Robert Hunter. A similar set of experiments was going on at the Menlo Park Veterans Administration Hospital. That's where Ken Kesey took LSD for the first time. He was so excited about it he took a job in the hospital and began stealing the LSD to give it to his friends. That became the basis for \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. \" So all of these original strands that came together in the '60s to produce this great countercultural revolt based around LSD can be traced back through these bogus foundations to the CIA and, ultimately, the director of MK-Ultra, Sidney Gottlieb. GROSS: Now, there's a much darker side to this program because a lot of people who were being experimented on, they were prisoners. I mean, they had no idea what they were being given. One of those prisoners was the famous gangster Whitey Bulger, who was serving time then for hijacking a truck, and he was in the Atlanta Penitentiary. So he actually wrote something describing his experience. Can you give us a summary of what he said? KINZER: Whitey Bulger was one of the prisoners who volunteered for what he was told was an experiment aimed at finding a cure for schizophrenia. As part of this experiment, he was given LSD every day for more than a year. He later realized that this had nothing to do with schizophrenia, and he was a guinea pig in a government experiment aimed at seeing what people's long-term reactions to LSD was; essentially, could we make a person lose his mind by feeding him LSD every day over such a long period? Bulger wrote afterword about his experiences, which he described as quite horrific. He thought he was going insane. He wrote, I was in prison for committing a crime, but they committed a greater crime on me. And towards the end of his life, Bulger came to realize the truth of what had happened to him, and he actually told his friends that he was going to find that doctor in Atlanta who was the head of that experiment program in the penitentiary and go kill him. Now, that doctor later died a natural death, so Bulger didn't get to carry out his wish. But Bulger was one of many prisoners across America who unwittingly were fed huge doses of LSD, and the reason for this was very simple. Gottlieb wanted to create a way to seize control of people's minds, and he realized it was a two-part process. First, you had to blast away the existing mind. Second, you had to find a way to insert a new mind into that resulting void. Well, he didn't get too far on No. 2, but he did a lot of work on No. 1 - trying to find out how to destroy the mind of a human being, and that was the purpose of experiments that he carried out in prisons in the United States and at secret detention centers in Europe and East Asia. GROSS: And he worked with some pretty high-class torturers, too, from one of the Nazi doctors and the chief poisoner from Japan during World War II. How did they end up in his program? KINZER: One of the most remarkable discoveries that I made in the research for this book is that the CIA mind control project, MK-Ultra, was essentially a continuation of work that began in Japanese and Nazi concentration camps. Not only was it roughly based on those experiments, but the CIA actually hired the vivisectionists and the torturers who had worked in Japan and in Nazi concentration camps to come and explain what they had found out so that we could build on their research. For example, Nazi doctors had conducted extensive experiments with mescaline at the Dachau concentration camp, and the CIA was very interested in figuring out whether mescaline could be the key to mind control. That was one of their big avenues of investigation. So they hired the Nazi doctors who had been involved in that project to advise them. Another thing the Nazis provided was information about poison gases like sarin, which is still being used. Nazi doctors came to America to Fort Dietrich in Maryland, which was the center of this project, to lecture to CIA officers to tell them how long it took for people to die from sarin and was there a difference in how long it took to die if you were a small child or an infant, whether you were an elderly person or whether you were a healthy middle-aged person. The only way to know this would be to have killed all those people. The CIA was eager to get this kind of information. And actually, one of the things that is the most bizarre about the fact that we relied on Nazi doctors is that Sidney Gottlieb himself was Jewish, and his parents had emigrated from Central Europe in the early 20th century. If they had not emigrated, Sidney Gottlieb might well himself have been brought up in Central Europe, forced into a ghetto, brought to a concentration camp and become the subject of one of these grotesque Nazi medical experiments. Nonetheless, he didn't seem to have any problem working as a CIA officer with the doctors who conducted those experiments. GROSS: Yeah, I found that pretty hard to understand. But, you know, also, Kurt Blome, one of the Nazi doctors who was hired by Sidney Gottlieb, was on trial in Nuremberg. He was acquitted, but he was one of the Nazi doctors who was tried. And the Nuremberg Code established that if you are conducting experiments, that the person you are experimenting on needs to give informed consent. And of course, MK-Ultra totally violated the Nuremberg Code, but apparently the U. S. never signed on to that, never adapted that. KINZER: If the United States had used the Nuremberg Code domestically, Sidney Gottlieb would never have been able to do what he did; there couldn't have been MK-Ultra. What Sidney Gottlieb did is exactly what we sentenced Nazi doctors to death after the Second World War for doing in concentration camps. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Stephen Kinzer. His new book is called \"Poisoner In Chief: Sidney Gottlieb And The CIA Search For Mind Control. \" We'll be right back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF AVISHAI COHEN'S \"GBEDE TEMIN\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Stephen Kinzer. We're talking about his new book, \"Poisoner In Chief: Sidney Gottlieb And The CIA Search For Mind Control. \" Gottlieb created the MK-Ultra program which experimented with psychoactive drugs like LSD to see what the effects were, with the goal of learning if LSD could be weaponized as a form of mind control. It wasn't just a question of administering these super-high doses of LSD for very extended periods of time. There was also, like, questioning and other kind of testing that went along with the administration of these high doses. Tell us about that. KINZER: Gottlieb and the CIA established secret detention centers throughout Europe and East Asia, particularly in Japan, Germany and the Philippines, which were largely under American control in the period of the early '50s. And therefore Gottlieb didn't have to worry about any legal entanglements. In these places, he carried out his most extreme experiments, some undoubtedly fatal. We don't know how many people died, but a number did, and many lives were permanently destroyed. So what you found in these Europe experiments was a confluence of two interests, both that preoccupied the CIA. No. 1 was Gottlieb's desire to find the key to mind control, which the CIA considered its absolute greatest project and most important priority. Second, CIA officers in Europe and Asia were capturing enemy agents and others who they felt might be suspected persons or otherwise, what they called expendable. They would grab these people and throw them into cells and then test all kinds of - not just drug potions but other techniques like electroshock, extremes of temperature, sensory isolation, all the meantime bombarding them with questions trying to see if they could break down resistance and find a way to destroy the human ego. So these were projects designed not only to understand the human mind but to figure out how to destroy it. And that made Gottlieb, although in some ways a very compassionate person, certainly the most prolific torturer of his generation. GROSS: And were there any guidelines in effect in the U. S. that would have made it illegal had people known what he was doing? KINZER: This is one of the most remarkable aspects of the Gottlieb story. He operated almost completely without supervision. He had sort of a check off from his titular boss and from his real boss, Richard Helms, and from the CIA director, Allen Dulles. But none of them really wanted to know what he was doing. This guy had a license to kill. He was allowed to requisition human subjects across the United States and around the world and subject them to any kind of abuse that he wanted, even up to the level of it being fatal. Yet nobody looked over his shoulder. He never had to file serious reports to anybody. I think the mentality must have been, this project is so important. Mind control, if it can be mastered, is the key to global world power, that the idea of it disturbing a few lives or losing even a few hundred lives could not be seen as important enough to outweigh that imperative. Only when you get caught up in a cause like that that allows you to put aside conscience and all other moral considerations and even serious scientific considerations can you allow yourself to get caught up in a situation like this where one person is allowed, on his own whim, to go out and torture and kill people. And the people who might be supervising him really don't want to hear about it for reasons that have to do with the old CIA code which is the code of all secret services - the less you know, the better. You're not implicated. As a result of this, Gottlieb was allowed to work for 10 years without anybody supervising him or even really being aware or wanting to be aware of what he was doing. GROSS: So before Sidney Gottlieb started experimenting with LSD, he ran CIA experiments with marijuana, cocaine, heroin, mescaline. I guess those didn't work as mind control drugs. KINZER: He was trying everything. He not only used the drugs that you mentioned but extreme forms of stimulants and sedatives. One of the techniques they tested in Europe was to sedate a person to the coma state and then feed him extreme doses of stimulants. And then when the person was in the transition phase between comatose and hyperactive, they would electroshock him with very high doses, hoping that maybe this combination would be the thing that could blow away a person's mind. So the CIA, and Gottlieb in particular, were limited only by their own imagination. Gottlieb's imagination ran wild. He himself used LSD, by his own estimate, about at least 200 times. So his imagination was very fertile. And under the conditions of his employment, he was allowed to pursue any form of experimentation that he could imagine. GROSS: My guest is Stephen Kinzer. His new book is called \"Poisoner In Chief: Sidney Gottlieb And The CIA Search For Mind Control. \" After a break, we'll talk about how Gottlieb thought LSD could be weaponized to weaken world leaders and how he created poisons that could be used to assassinate them. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Stephen Kinzer about his new book \"Poisoner In Chief: Sidney Gottlieb And The CIA Search For Mind Control. \" In the '50s and early '60s, Gottlieb headed the secret CIA program MK-Ultra, which conducted experiments to see if LSD and other mind-altering drugs could be weaponized as a form of mind control. Gottlieb was also the CIA's chief chemist, creating poisons and unusual ways of surreptitiously administering them should they be needed to kill enemies, including world leaders, and he headed the program that created high-tech gadgets for spies. You know, one of the uses Gottlieb envisioned for LSD was - you could slip it to an unfriendly world leader, and their behavior would be so erratic and weird that they'd lose popularity or they'd be thrown out of office because they would appear to not be able to function normally anymore. KINZER: You're right. So Gottlieb was the chief CIA chemist. In that capacity, he was also the chief poison maker, so he made the poisons to kill Zhou Enlai, Fidel Castro, Patrice Lumumba. But he wasn't only involved in making poisons to kill people. He was also interested in making toxins that would affect their behavior in various ways. He made a list of the ways he thought drugs could be used to affect behavior. Could you find a drug that would alter a personality structure in a way that would allow the operator to take control of another person's behavior? Could you produce shock and confusion or physical disablement? At one point, he came up with the idea of using a spray can full of LSD to pollute the studio in which Fidel Castro was going to give a radio speech, and then presumably, Castro would become disoriented and, as you say, lose popularity and fall from power. This is the level of bizarre plots that he became involved with when he was hired as part of a separate aspect of his job besides MK-Ultra to be the person who devised toxins and psychoactive substances to be used in covert operations by CIA officers around the world. GROSS: So this is just a little sidebar that I found very interesting as somebody who listens to a lot of jazz. The people who Sidney Gottlieb hired included George Hunter White, who directed a lot of the MK-Ultra experiments, and he had been a narcotics agent and led the Narcotics Bureau's campaign against jazz in New York City. He spied on musicians and entrapped them, including Billie Holiday, and Billie Holiday being busted was a turning point in her career because she couldn't get a cabaret license. There were places she couldn't perform in. It was a really tragic thing for her, and that's this guy. KINZER: George Hunter White was one of the key operatives of MK-Ultra, and he stands out even in this extremely bizarre MK-Ultra cast of Nazi doctors and torturers and obsessed chemists. So George Hunter White, as you say, was a narcotics agent in New York, but he was the kind of narcotics agent who not only lived at the edge of the law. He crossed over a lot. He used all the substances that he confiscated from people. His use of alcohol and narcotics was legendary, but he was also a cop who did pursue jazz figures, including Billie Holiday. He had a special dislike for her because he said the way that she flaunted her furs and her big cars was offensive to him. GROSS: Wow. KINZER: In the early 1950s, Gottlieb hired this guy George Hunter White to run a safe house for him in New York City to which people would be lured off the street and then given LSD so CIA officers could watch them from an adjoining apartment through a one-way mirror. Later, White was moved to San Francisco, where he set up one of the craziest MK-Ultra projects that was known inside the agency as Operation Midnight Climax. This was an operation in which White would assemble a stable of prostitutes who would bring their men back to an apartment that the CIA hired and furnished, feed them LSD and George Hunter White would sit in an adjoining apartment sitting on a portable toilet, drinking pitchers of martinis while watching people having sex under the influence of LSD with the vague idea that this was somehow going to help the United States defeat communism. So these were the kind of people that naturally gravitate to a project like this one. GROSS: When the men were having sex with prostitutes and were unknowingly given doses of LSD, weren't they then asked questions to see what their answers would be like under LSD? KINZER: Exactly. So White and the people who worked with him would prep these prostitutes, and they would say, we want to find out under what circumstances - under what combination of sex and drugs men would be most likely to reveal secrets. So we want you to stay with the guy after the thing is over and talk to him and try to draw him out about his work and ask him, for example, you know that plane you've been working on? So how high does it fly, really? And the idea was to try to draw out information and to see whether drugs could make people talk, and of course, they found out things that are very obvious - that people will talk. Men will talk after sex. And the people who were observing these experiments, like George Hunter White, had no background in psychology or anything that would allow them to assess these situations in a clinical way. Everything was very slapdash and haphazard, so not surprisingly, no serious results ever came out of this, except the fact that we can now sit here and talk about the fact that our tax dollars were used to pay for a bordello run by the CIA in San Francisco to which unwitting men were brought, fed LSD and used as experiments in Sydney Gottlieb's campaign to try to figure out how to penetrate the human mind so it could be controlled in the interests of the United States government and its covert projects around the world. GROSS: Well, there's plenty more to talk about, but we have to take a short break here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Stephen Kinzer. His new book is called \"Poisoner In Chief: Sidney Gottlieb And The CIA Search For Mind Control. \" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Stephen Kinzer. His new book is called \"Poisoner In Chief: Sidney Gottlieb and the CIA Search For Mind Control. \" Gottlieb created the MK-Ultra program which experimented with psychoactive drugs like LSD to see what the effects were, with the goal of learning if LSD could be weaponized as a form of mind control. So Sidney Gottlieb's MK-Ultra program was ended in the early 1960s. Why was it ended? KINZER: After all the experiments that led to deaths in unknown numbers around Europe and Asia and led to unknown torments across the United States, Gottlieb, who was, in the end, a scientist, was forced to reach the conclusion that he had failed. Mind control, he finally came to conclude, is a myth. It was fed by fantasies from fiction that these people had imbibed at a young age. But once you got to see if you could transfer those fantasies from the realm of fiction to the realm of reality, they broke down. So Gottlieb finally had to admit he never could find a way to control human minds. And what skeptics had said at the beginning, which is that you cannot program a person to do something that he or she is basically and deeply and morally opposed to doing, and make them go out and do it. He had to waste unknown numbers of lives in order to reach a conclusion that should have been clear from the beginning. GROSS: So what did he do after the MK-Ultra program was ended? Because he stayed in the CIA. KINZER: Gottlieb had a long career after MK-Ultra ended, and he went on to become the head of the Technical Services staff, which is the - part of the CIA where they make the tools, the gizmos, the gadgets that spies use. So if you remember Q from those James Bond movies, that was Gottlieb. And he spent years at the head of that operation. And he made an astonishing variety of covert tools from all those things you see on TV like cameras that you can fit inside a cigarette lighter or a tie clip, all the way to more bizarre things like a rubber boat, a car with a secret compartment to smuggle agents out of foreign countries, a compressor for foreign currency so you could pack a huge amount of it into a small container, and even a jailbreak kit that could be contained in a rectal suppository. He invented a hyper. . . GROSS: Can you explain that? 'Cause I can't envision that exactly. KINZER: (Laughter) He had a series of tiny tools that would have knives and other devices that would allow you to break through solid walls, all miniaturized. This was just a piece of his genius. He invented a hyper-thin hypodermic needle so that you could poison a bottle of wine through the cork without leaving any trace in the cork. His imagination was just as fertile when he was inventing spy tools for CIA officers as it had been earlier when he was trying to devise ways of finding mind control techniques. GROSS: You describe him as the poisoner in chief, and that's not just about the LSD experiments. He actually created and found ways to administer poison. Describe that part of his job. KINZER: As the chief CIA chemist, it was logical that Gottlieb be consulted whenever the CIA needed a poison or a toxin. And this became part of his work during the late 1950s and into 1960. In the mid-'50s, the United States set out on a project to kill Prime Minister Zhou Enlai of China while he was visiting Indonesia. Gottlieb actually made a potion that was supposed to be put in a rice bowl that Zhou Enlai would eat from. And actually, this poison was only going to work after a day or two. The idea was that Zhou would be back in China, and the poison wouldn't be able to be traced back to the CIA. Later on, when the CIA became obsessed at the order of the White House in killing Fidel Castro, it was Sidney Gottlieb who made all the poison pills, the poison potions, even the poison wet suit that was supposed to be given to Castro. In 1960, President Eisenhower ordered the assassination of Patrice Lumumba, the prime minister of the Congo. Sidney Gottlieb was given the job of making the poison. GROSS: Among the very, very bizarre things about Sidney Gottlieb is after leaving the CIA, he pursued a spiritual life. He and his wife go to India. They tried to work with the poor. They're working with people who have leprosy. It is so hard to reconcile the different parts of Sydney Gottlieb's personality - an Orthodox Jew who works with Nazi doctors on the CIA drug experiments, somebody who has, like, ruined lives, who's created poisons and done these, like, really horrible experiments and people but feels like he himself is a very spiritual person. KINZER: This is one of the things that makes the Gottlieb story so fascinating. So Gottlieb really lived a Jekyll-and-Hyde life. We already talked about the things that he was doing in his day job, but what was he like outside of work? Actually, he was a very gentle, compassionate humanist. He lived in an eco cabin in the woods with no running water. He grew his own vegetables. He meditated. He studied Buddhism and wrote poetry. He got up before dawn to milk his goats. He ate yogurt at work and preached the benefits of natural living way back in the 1950s. Later on he built himself one of the first solar homes in Virginia. So he was kind of a proto hippie. And he traveled between these two worlds of spiritual meditation and then torturous experiments. I think it creates a much fuller and more perplexing picture of a person who lived such different sides of his life. You wonder, how could he have reconciled this? Maybe he was thinking that he was an extreme individualist and he was fighting a global force that wanted to crush all individualism in the world, and therefore anything was justified. In the long run, in the cosmic sense, I think you can say that commitment to a cause always gives you the justification for immoral acts. And patriotism is among the most seductive of those causes because it posits the nation as a value that's so transcendent that anything done in its service is virtuous. So caught up in that mentality of the age, and maybe by his own personal desire to be of service to the United States - because, as a result of his handicap, he had been refused the chance to serve in World War II - Gottlieb felt that he could put aside the normal pull of conscience and morality. I don't think he ever faced the question or answered the question of whether there are limits to the amount of evil you can do in a righteous cause before the evil begins to outweigh the righteousness. GROSS: So Sidney Gottlieb worked in secrecy. That secrecy was partially shattered by the Church Committee, a committee - it was a Senate committee from the 1970s that was chaired by Democratic Senator Frank Church. And it was tasked with investigating abuses committed by intelligence agencies, and Gottlieb was called to testify. So how much did the committee find out about what Gottlieb had really done? KINZER: Gottlieb was living in India, working in a hospital for leprosy victims when he got a note from the CIA saying, somebody has figured out who you are, and that somebody is the Church Committee that's investigating the CIA, and they want to talk to you. So the anonymity in which Gottlieb had lived his whole life was suddenly under threat. Gottlieb had to come back to the United States. He did testify at two rounds of hearings, one undercover - that is, under a pseudonym in a private room - another under his own name but also in a private room. And the Senators were able to ask him some probing questions, but really, they didn't know anything about MK-Ultra. If they had known anything like what's in this book, Gottlieb would have been questioned much more seriously, but the Church Committee was focused on a number of other abuses that the CIA had been accused of, like domestic spying, assassination plots in which Gottlieb had played, essentially, only the role of a pharmacist. They didn't know what he had done abroad. They didn't know what he had done in prisons inside the United States. His lawyer had arranged for him to be granted immunity from prosecution for his testimony. Nonetheless, he didn't reveal anything, and he claimed, essentially, to have forgotten everything that he had spent his whole CIA career doing. So he forgot who his boss was. He forgot who was deputy was. He couldn't remember what part of the CIA he had worked in. And the Church Committee investigators didn't press him hard enough. They didn't know what to ask him. So essentially, although his anonymity was briefly shattered, he was able to emerge from that experience without anybody reaching the heart of his mystery. GROSS: Gottlieb tried to destroy evidence of programs that he headed. What did he do to try to destroy the evidence of MK-Ultra? KINZER: The end of Gottlieb's career came in 1972 when his patron Richard Helms, who was then director of the CIA, was removed by Nixon. Once Helms was gone, it was just a matter of time until Gottlieb would be gone, and most important was that Helms was really the only person at the CIA who had an idea of what Gottlieb had been doing. So as they were both on their way out of the CIA, they agreed that they should destroy all records of MK-Ultra. Gottlieb actually drove out to the CIA Records Center and ordered the archivist to destroy boxes full of MK-Ultra records, and he wrote in his report that these records were destroyed over my stated objections. So the records of MK-Ultra were destroyed as Gottlieb was leaving office. However, it turns out that there were some found in other places. There was a depot for expense account reports that had not been destroyed, and various other pieces of paper remained. So there is enough out there to reconstruct some of what he did, but his effort to wipe away his traces by destroying all those documents in the early '70s was quite successful. GROSS: Well, Stephen Kinzer, thank you for this book. I found the revelations in it really remarkable. Thank you for talking with us. KINZER: Thank you.

Ross, through a spokesman, has denied the report, but the secretary has a history of meddling with federal scientific agencies. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The latest storm to engulf the commerce secretary began 10 days ago, when weather forecasters in Birmingham, Ala. , issued a tweet saying Hurricane Dorian posed no threat to their state. Kevin Laws, who's with the National Weather Service in Birmingham, told WBHM Radio they had no political motive. They were just trying to reassure nervous citizens who'd been flooding their office with phone calls. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KEVIN LAWS: We were reacting to the calls that were coming into our office, and people were actually frightened. I mean, they were wanting to cancel surgeries, and they were wanting to go pick up elderly parents at the coastline because, you know, they were genuinely scared. And we felt like we needed to make a statement on where this storm was going to go and to reassure our people, and that's what our mandate is. HORSLEY: Laws and his colleagues learned only later what sparked those anxious phone calls - a tweet from President Trump mistakenly including Alabama in a list of states that could be hard-hit by the storm. For days, this was the fodder for late-night comics, as Trump insisted he was right about the hurricane's path, even showing off a map that had been clumsily doctored with a Sharpie. But the story took a more serious turn last Friday when NOAA, the agency that includes the Weather Service, issued an unsigned statement defending the president's tweet and chastising the Birmingham forecasters who'd contradicted it. According to the New York Times, that statement followed political pressure from Commerce Secretary Ross, who oversees the weather agency and threatened to fire NOAA officials if they failed to back up the president. That was enough for Democratic Congressman Don Beyer of Virginia, who says it's time for Ross to step down. DON BEYER: This is the straw that broke the camel's back. You know, threatening to fire senior NOAA appointees if they didn't prop up Trump's false weather claims, you know, is just one bridge too far. HORSLEY: A Commerce Department spokesman denies the Times report, saying Ross didn't threaten to fire anyone over the dueling hurricane statements, and this morning, NOAA's acting administrator told forecasters nobody's job is at risk. But Beyer, who serves on the House Science Committee, notes Ross also bucked scientific experts at the Census Bureau when he tried to include a citizenship question, despite a warning it would jeopardize an accurate headcount. BEYER: It's part of a pattern of deemphasizing science and facts and the truth in order to play some, you know, often naive or silly political agenda. HORSLEY: Ultimately, efforts to add a citizenship question to the census were blocked by the Supreme Court, which found Ross had misrepresented his political motives. The Trump administration has also been quietly purging scientific information about climate change from government websites and replacing independent scientific advisers with industry insiders. Michael Halpern of the Union of Concerned Scientists says that's sometimes hard for people to understand, but a fight over the weather service brings it home. MICHAEL HALPERN: Everyone knows their local TV meteorologist and understands that they get information directly from the government. The air pollution scientists who work for EPA are a little bit more behind-the-scenes, but their work is just as critical to protecting the public. HORSLEY: Ross hasn't only tried to skew government measurements. He's also tried to skew measures of his own wealth. For years, Forbes Magazine had included Ross on its list of the richest Americans, estimating his fortune in 2016 at nearly $3 billion. Senior Forbes editor Dan Alexander says Ross is really worth only a fraction of that. DAN ALEXANDER: We estimate that he's worth about $600 million, and what's sad - somebody who has been so successful and is so wealthy - still, for him, it wasn't enough, you know? He wanted to be seen as richer, wanted people to think that he was a billionaire, and he just never was. HORSLEY: In reporting his story, Alexander spoke with longtime co-workers of Ross about his reputation for bending the truth, one that foreshadows this latest controversy. ALEXANDER: At this point, people just don't trust him, and so it wasn't that much of a surprise to see that Wilbur was apparently helping cover up for misinformation about that.

He's the acting administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and he was trying to calm a controversy that only seems to be getting worse. AILSA CHANG, HOST: It began when President Trump made the inaccurate claim on Twitter that Alabama would be hit hard by Hurricane Dorian - not true. Weather forecasters in Alabama said the state was not in danger, but then NOAA backed up the president. And now there are questions about whether the agency violated its own policies. All of this fits a pattern, says Gretchen Goldman of the Union of Concerned Scientists, which, we should note, is an NPR sponsor. Goldman says what's unfolded is a perfect representation of what's happening under the Trump administration. GRETCHEN GOLDMAN: It is a situation where we see the president said what he wanted, independent of what the evidence told us. He then doubled down on that. He ignored scientific experts, and he tried to force fit the science to back him up. And that is exactly what we've seen the president and others in his administration do across federal agencies and across issues. CHANG: Your group, the Union of Concerned Scientists, issued a report saying that this administration has basically created a chilling effect on scientists. Can you describe how that chilling effect is happening? GOLDMAN: It's happening across the government - across the government on everything from food safety to environmental protection to product safety - like strollers. Scientists need to be able to use science and communicate that science in order to protect people. But what this administration is doing is creating an environment where those scientific experts aren't going to feel safe communicating that science if they don't feel that their leaders are going to support them. And that's true especially when the science happens to be politically inconvenient. CHANG: Well, to be fair, don't politics seep into science at some level during every administration? Because every administration will fund and promote the science that backs up their policy priorities, right? GOLDMAN: We do see interference in the science across administrations. Science is very powerful, and you want it on your side. And. . . CHANG: Sure. GOLDMAN: . . . That makes it very vulnerable to political interference. But it's not appropriate to force fit the science into your policy decisions. What we're seeing is, under the Trump administration, this is happening at an unprecedented level. We've logged more than a hundred times that this administration has misused science in its policy decisions, and that's more than any other administration in the past five decades. CHANG: What do you mean by that - misuse science? GOLDMAN: We were looking specifically in instances where they were supposed to make a decision based on science or they were supposed to allow science to be public and they didn't. So these are things like squashing scientific reports from the National Academies of Science, which happened a few times; refusing to ban a pesticide that's been linked to brain damage in children. So we've logged 100 of those. CHANG: Your team wrote in this report that some of the censorship that's happening is literally asking scientists to not use certain words or certain phrases. Give me an example of that. GOLDMAN: That's right. There's been a few cases of that. One of the more high-profile ones was at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where scientists were asked not to use words like evidence-based. And that's obviously absurd. CHANG: What's objectionable about that? GOLDMAN: Your guess is as good as mine. But it's characteristic of this administration in wanting to control what scientists do and say, which is not serving the public. And one of the reasons this NOAA story was so big is because that one's very easy to understand. Everyone relies on the weather forecast every day, and. . . CHANG: YeahGOLDMAN: . . . We expect experts to give us a truthful forecast on that. And this is a more visible example, but we're seeing that kind of thing happen - on everything from chemical safety risks to drug policy at the FDA - all across the government. CHANG: Gretchen Goldman is the research director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. Thanks very much for coming into the studio today.

Goldman says what's unfolded is a perfect representation of what's happening under the Trump administration. GRETCHEN GOLDMAN: It is a situation where we see the president said what he wanted, independent of what the evidence told us. He then doubled down on that. He ignored scientific experts, and he tried to force fit the science to back him up. And that is exactly what we've seen the president and others in his administration do across federal agencies and across issues. CHANG: Your group, the Union of Concerned Scientists, issued a report saying that this administration has basically created a chilling effect on scientists. Can you describe how that chilling effect is happening? GOLDMAN: It's happening across the government - across the government on everything from food safety to environmental protection to product safety - like strollers. Scientists need to be able to use science and communicate that science in order to protect people. But what this administration is doing is creating an environment where those scientific experts aren't going to feel safe communicating that science if they don't feel that their leaders are going to support them. And that's true especially when the science happens to be politically inconvenient. CHANG: Well, to be fair, don't politics seep into science at some level during every administration? Because every administration will fund and promote the science that backs up their policy priorities, right? GOLDMAN: We do see interference in the science across administrations. Science is very powerful, and you want it on your side. And. . . CHANG: Sure. GOLDMAN: . . . That makes it very vulnerable to political interference. But it's not appropriate to force fit the science into your policy decisions. What we're seeing is, under the Trump administration, this is happening at an unprecedented level. We've logged more than a hundred times that this administration has misused science in its policy decisions, and that's more than any other administration in the past five decades. CHANG: What do you mean by that - misuse science? GOLDMAN: We were looking specifically in instances where they were supposed to make a decision based on science or they were supposed to allow science to be public and they didn't. So these are things like squashing scientific reports from the National Academies of Science, which happened a few times; refusing to ban a pesticide that's been linked to brain damage in children. So we've logged 100 of those. CHANG: Your team wrote in this report that some of the censorship that's happening is literally asking scientists to not use certain words or certain phrases. Give me an example of that. GOLDMAN: That's right. There's been a few cases of that. One of the more high-profile ones was at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where scientists were asked not to use words like evidence-based. And that's obviously absurd. CHANG: What's objectionable about that? GOLDMAN: Your guess is as good as mine. But it's characteristic of this administration in wanting to control what scientists do and say, which is not serving the public. And one of the reasons this NOAA story was so big is because that one's very easy to understand. Everyone relies on the weather forecast every day, and. . . CHANG: Yeah GOLDMAN: . . . We expect experts to give us a truthful forecast on that. And this is a more visible example, but we're seeing that kind of thing happen - on everything from chemical safety risks to drug policy at the FDA - all across the government. CHANG: Gretchen Goldman is the research director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. Thanks very much for coming into the studio today.

Officials are using artificial intelligence and machine learning to stay one step ahead of poachers and keep elephants from killing villagers. NPR's Dina Temple-Raston reports from Malawi as part of the NPR series \"I'll Be Seeing You\" about the technologies that watch us. DINA TEMPLE-RASTON, BYLINE: The best way to get close to an elephant is to use an old-fashioned tracking method. We saw the fresh dung piles along the road and followed those and found him in this clearing. An enormous elephant is munching on grass less than 20 feet in front of us. It's magical. Liwonde National Park is 200 square miles of scenes just like that, and seeing them makes it hard to believe that just four years ago, the park was on the verge of collapse. CRAIG REID: So I always describe Liwonde as we found it as being in a state of terminal decline. TEMPLE-RASTON: That's park manager Craig Reid. He arrived here four years ago with a nonprofit organization called African Parks, and his job was to bring Liwonde back from the brink. REID: So effectively, what would have happened had we not intervened would be a total elimination of all wildlife over the 10 year period following. TEMPLE-RASTON: The things that go wrong in a failed park go wrong very fast. In Liwonde's case, it went beyond crumbling infrastructure or washed-out roads. Poaching was endemic, and elephants were killing villagers outside the park. Various Donzani has a small house just outside the park's fence line. He's a retired schoolteacher. VARIOUS DONZANI: My house is 50 meters from the fence. TEMPLE-RASTON: Fifty meters from the fence? DONZANI: Fifty meters. TEMPLE-RASTON: Donzani is a subsistence farmer, and he and his family rely on the garden for food. He grows mangoes and corn and rice, which happen to be three of an elephant's favorite foods. Elephants have a sweet tooth. So proximity, food and opportunity - that's all you need to spark a human-elephant conflict. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEPHANT TRUMPETING)TEMPLE-RASTON: This is the sound from a video of an elephant charging in Liwonde. After hippos, elephants kill more people in Africa than any other animal. Try shooing an elephant off a field, and this is what you face. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEPHANT TRUMPETING)TEMPLE-RASTON: An adult female weighs over three tons. A bull elephant is typically over six. Park manager Craig Reid says being killed by an elephant is a horrifying thing. REID: These big bulls will charge a person, and when people are caught by an elephant, they're normally using their trunk to knock them on the ground and then kneel on them, crushing them either with their knees or with the base of their trunk, which, at that point, is all curled up and almost like a fist. TEMPLE-RASTON: Donzani has seen it happen. He said several years ago, a herd of elephants came out of the park and into the fields. DONZANI: I tell you, it was a disaster. Seven people were killed that day. TEMPLE-RASTON: Seven people killed in one day. These kinds of deadly episodes have a ripple effect. Smugglers and international cartels will look for local farmers - not Donzani - who have had these kinds of run-ins with elephants, and they'll promise them enough money to buy food for their families. All they have to do is help the poachers locate an elephant. On the black market, a single elephant tusk can sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: A new study, the Great Elephant Census, suggests a failure to protect the world's largest land mammals, elephants. TEMPLE-RASTON: It so happens that around the time Liwonde Park manager Craig Reid arrived in Malawi, one of the founders of Microsoft, Paul Allen, was putting the finishing touches on something he called the Great Elephant Census. It was a massive, multi-million dollar project aimed at counting all the savanna elephants in Africa, and it found that in the seven years between 2007 and 2014, nearly a third of Africa's elephants were killed, mainly by poachers. Allen wanted a high-tech solution, so he funded a company called Vulcan, and they created a program called EarthRanger. And what it does is it takes all those things park managers know from years of experience and all that paperwork park rangers fill out and puts it through a machine learning program to find patterns and to learn the rhythms of the park. LAWRENCE MUNRO: Message public (unintelligible). TEMPLE-RASTON: Liwonde's operations manager is a man named Lawrence Munro, and part of his job is to plan and schedule ranger patrols. He's been using EarthRanger to help him deploy those rangers more efficiently. MUNRO: You can kill the (unintelligible) for this circle. TEMPLE-RASTON: Munro was standing in front of an image of the park up on a flat screen. It shows the river and clearings and forests. There are little elephant icons tracking GPS location signals from collared elephants, and little rhino icons move across the screen as well. Munro starts clicking a mouse through various EarthRanger menus. He moves through an animation of suspicious activity in the park. You can see a concentration of snares, little icons that look like little Western lassos, and there are a bunch of them right off the main road. MUNRO: So you can see those snares are up there just to the post. TEMPLE-RASTON: Munro and the park's head of security Paul Chidyera decide to set up new checkpoints right where EarthRanger recorded a large number of snares. Before EarthRanger, Munro used to do this kind of analysis with a map and magnets. MUNRO: You have to rely a lot more on memory, a lot more on radio traffic. Here, you can do a lot more pre-emptive stuff because you can see the picture. TEMPLE-RASTON: Munro said it used to take a month to start to see patterns emerging. Now he can do that daily. MUNRO: We study it intently every Wednesday because we want to deploy our guys accordingly, but you can do it daily. It's basically the speed at which you can strategize. TEMPLE-RASTON: Strategize and respond. Earlier this year, the head of law enforcement at Liwonde, Paul Chidyera, got an alert on his cell phone after an EarthRanger sensor was tripped. He set up a poacher cam in the area to try to get a beat on what it was. The poacher cam has a special algorithm inside that helps the camera determine whether something going past has a human shape or an animal one. If it looks human, it snaps a picture and sends it with GPS coordinates to EarthRanger and staff cell phones. The poacher cam got a photo of someone coming in. PAUL CHIDYERA: When he was arrested, he was confronted, and he revealed all of what he has been doing. TEMPLE-RASTON: In fact, as they scrolled back through EarthRanger's database, they found other pictures of him coming into the park with weapons. Those pictures were submitted as evidence in his trial. In the end, the poacher was sentenced to 27 years as a repeat offender. In the past two years, poaching in Liwonde has plummeted. The park hasn't lost a single high-value animal in 30 months, and those deadly unscheduled elephant trips outside the park - they're way down, too. While all of this has been going on, EarthRanger's machine learning algorithm has been training. The program will use game theory and behavioral analysis to tell people like Munro where poachers will go before they get there, allowing rangers to intercept bad guys pre-bang. Poachers will go to where they believe the elephants will be, and they'll find rangers waiting there for them instead. Pawan Nrisimha of Vulcan, who helped create EarthRanger, says AI can take a long time to learn. PAWAN NRISIMHA: The biggest difficulty here is really gathering that data to train up that artificial intelligence model to know what to predict. TEMPLE-RASTON: Now that EarthRanger has been deployed in Liwonde for two years, it's getting close to having enough data to start making predictions. Nrisimha sees EarthRanger getting poachers before they can even fire a shot in the next year or two. Dina Temple-Raston, NPR News.

This drone will leave earth in 2026, but work has already begun on it. NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has been visiting with the team of scientists behind this mission. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: This drone will head to a moon called Titan. And the first thing to know about Titan is that it's cool - like literally, it's really cold. ELIZABETH TURTLE: It's 94 Kelvin and negative 290 Fahrenheit. BRUMFIEL: Zibi Turtle is head of the mission, which is being run out of the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. Turtle - it should come as no surprise - also thinks Titan's figuratively cool. TURTLE: Titan is a really fascinating world. It's the largest moon of Saturn. It's the only satellite in the solar system that has a dense atmosphere. In fact, its atmosphere is denser than Earth's atmosphereBRUMFIEL: And there's more Earthlike things about it. Titan has dunes, mountains, gullies, even rivers and lakes. Though, on Titan, it's so cold the lakes are filled with liquid methane, not water. Think of it as a little, frigid Earthlette (ph) floating around the outer solar system. And that's what has Turtle and her teams so interested. Like Earth, Titan is home to a lot of different kinds of organic molecules. The climate's probably too harsh for those molecules to turn into life. But Turtle thinks Titan could provide clues to how life started here on Earth. TURTLE: All of these materials have been basically doing chemistry experiments for us. And so what we want to be able to do is go pick up the results of those experiments to understand, you know, the same kinds of steps that were taken here on Earth toward life. BRUMFIEL: But look, I haven't told you the coolest thing about Titan yet. TURTLE: If you had a good way to keep warm and some oxygen with you to breath and put wings on, you'd be able to fly. BRUMFIEL: What - you mean, like, flapping? TURTLE: Exactly. A human being would be able to fly on Titan. It's that much easier to fly on Titan than it is on Earth. BRUMFIEL: Titan's dense atmosphere and low gravity make getting off the ground a cinch. And that's why Turtle's plan is to explore with a drone rather than a rover. Down the hall from her office in a conference room, there's a giant quadcopter. Wow. TURTLE: Sweet. I didn't know we had that - the larger one. . . BRUMFIEL: This is fantastic. Look at this thing. Hi. TURTLE: Before I forget. . . DOUG ADAMS: Hey. I'm Doug Adams. BRUMFIEL: Doug Adams is one of the lead engineers on the project. The drone he's showing me takes up the whole table. And it's only a fraction of the size of what they have in mind. Oh, that's quarter scale? ADAMS: That's quarter scale. TURTLE: That's quarter scale. BRUMFIEL: Oh. . . TURTLE: Yeah. BRUMFIEL: . . . This thing's big. TURTLE: It is. BRUMFIEL: The real drone, known as Dragonfly, will be roughly the size of a compact car. Titan's distance from Earth means that nobody can fly Dragonfly by remote control. It'll have to be completely autonomous. And there's no way to recharge it, which - if you've ever owned a drone - you know needs to happen a lot. And at this point, you may be thinking what I was thinking - really? ADAMS: Almost everyone that gets exposed to Dragonfly has a similar thought process. The first time you see it, you think, you've got to be kidding. That's crazy. BRUMFIEL: But Adams says the mission really is possible using technology we use all the time on Earth. Quadcopter-style drones, for example, are all over the place. This one's just a little bigger. Self-driving technology is increasingly common - and bonus, it should be easy on Titan because there aren't any obstacles. ADAMS: We make the joke, if we hit a tree then we win - right? - because, you know, we found a tree on Titan. BRUMFIEL: Recharging is a problem, but they've got a solution for that, too - a nuclear battery. NASA actually already uses one on its Mars rover. Turtle says, as ambitious as Dragonfly sounds, it's just a bunch of old tech bolted together. TURTLE: One of the strategies that lowers risk for a mission is to use proven technology (laughter). BRUMFIEL: Yeah. But, I mean, you're building a nuclear-powered, self-driving drone for a moon of Saturn. . . TURTLE: (Laughter). BRUMFIEL: . . . So it is something new, isn't it? I mean, let's not. . . ADAMS: It is. . . BRUMFIEL: . . . Not understate that. ADAMS: So we won't understate that. However, as Zibi pointed out, the secret is to limit the miracles, right? We're assembling as many technologies that are already existing as possible and limiting what we have to do. BRUMFIEL: Even Dragonfly's scientific instruments that it will use to take samples and send data back to Earth have been tested on other missions. In fact, what Adams is most worried about is something we all have at our fingertips here on Earth that he can't take to Titan. ADAMS: We don't actually have a map. There's no GPS. There's no magnetic field even to orient yourself. BRUMFIEL: The biggest challenge facing Dragonfly is how to find its way around. Then again, any good explorer should get a little lost, right?

BRUMFIEL: Yeah. But, I mean, you're building a nuclear-powered, self-driving drone for a moon of Saturn. . . TURTLE: (Laughter). BRUMFIEL: . . . So it is something new, isn't it? I mean, let's not. . . ADAMS: It is. . . BRUMFIEL: . . . Not understate that. ADAMS: So we won't understate that. However, as Zibi pointed out, the secret is to limit the miracles, right? We're assembling as many technologies that are already existing as possible and limiting what we have to do. BRUMFIEL: Even Dragonfly's scientific instruments that it will use to take samples and send data back to Earth have been tested on other missions. In fact, what Adams is most worried about is something we all have at our fingertips here on Earth that he can't take to Titan. ADAMS: We don't actually have a map. There's no GPS. There's no magnetic field even to orient yourself. BRUMFIEL: The biggest challenge facing Dragonfly is how to find its way around. Then again, any good explorer should get a little lost, right?

NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports that researchers now have a rough estimate of how the total number of birds has changed since 1970. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Ken Rosenberg is 65 years old, and he says, over his lifetime, he's noticed a decline in migrating birds, like evening grosbeaks. KEN ROSENBERG: When I was a kid, there were years when you could see 50 or 100 at your feeder, and now you're lucky in a big year to see 10. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Rosenberg works at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. He knew that some bird populations, like bald eagles, have actually gone up over the last few decades. So he wondered how the total number of birds in the sky might be changing. ROSENBERG: Are there fewer birds than there were in 1970, or are we seeing a shift and losing some of the rare specialized species and shifting towards more generalist, more common birds, species that are more adapted to humans? GREENFIELDBOYCE: To find out, he and some colleagues gathered all the data they could on over 500 bird species; a lot of it came from bird surveys done each year by volunteers. They also used data from weather radar installations that can detect flocks of migrating birds. They crunched all the numbers and were stunned by the results. ROSENBERG: By our estimates, it's a 30% loss in the total number of breeding birds since 1970 - less than 50 years - and that's 3 billion birds. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Three billion fewer birds. Rosenberg says most of that loss comes from bird families like sparrows, finches, warblers and swallows. ROSENBERG: Things like meadowlarks, dark-eyed junco, horned lark, red-winged blackbird. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And the main culprit is probably the loss of their natural habitat, with increased urbanization and more agriculture. This massive bird accounting project is described in the journal Science - it's not exactly as precise as balancing your checkbook. Ted Simons is an ecologist with North Carolina State University. He says trying to count and track birds is a daunting task. TED SIMONS: We're certainly far from having the tools and having the resources to have real high confidence in our estimates of these populations. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Still, he thinks it's very likely that the total bird population has substantially declined. And others say the new estimate sounds about right, like migratory bird researcher Kristen Ruegg at Colorado State University. KRISTEN RUEGG: Overall, the conclusions weren't necessarily surprising. I mean, they were depressing but not surprising. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says having this estimate is a way to wake people up to the problem. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

This is the latest over the administration's decision to revoke California's authority to set its own clean car standards. More than a dozen states now follow those standards. Those states and more have joined the suit. The fight could go all the way to the Supreme Court. Earlier this week, I spoke with California's Attorney General Xavier Becerra. He says the Trump administration is trying to put the brakes on progress. Today, a conversation with EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler. ANDREW WHEELER: It's important to remember - and I don't think all the states were paying attention to this aspect - we're not stopping California's ability to set standards for health protection, health emissions, from automobiles. This is only about CO2, energy efficiency. California still has the right, the ability, to set a standard to protect their citizens for clean air rationale for emissions from cars that impact public health. What we're talking about here is energy efficiency, and that is something that we don't believe the state of California or any state should be setting for the entire country. CORNISH: You know, one of the things that's also come up is the fact that four major automakers agreed to meet California standards. I mean, what about their stance is so troubling to the president and to you? WHEELER: Automobile manufacturers can always go above. What we do is, we set the floor. They can always go above, and there's no reason why they can't sell more energy-efficient vehicles than what the federal standard is. The problem is, if one state decides to set a standard, it would then end up applying to the entire country. Our standard. . . CORNISH: It doesn't apply. Right? States volunteer if they want to join California in having a similar standard. WHEELER: Auto manufacturers will not manufacture two different vehicles. Our standard is going to make cars cheaper, more energy-efficient. It's going to lower the price of a car, and it's going to save lives. CORNISH: The internal EPA memo surfaced with the Associated Press talking about auto emission standards. It was saying that what you guys are proposing could result in 17 more deaths a year than the Obama standards. WHEELER: No. We don't believe that that's accurate. We're using NTSA's data. They're the ones that track public safety and highway mortality. And their data shows that our proposal will save lives, overall. And as far as the four auto companies and their position with California, we haven't seen the details of that deal so we don't know exactly what those auto companies may have signed up for or what they may have agreed to. That was why my general counsel and the general counsel of the Department of Transportation sent that letter to California wanting to better understand what it is exactly that they believe they agreed to so that we can see whether or not they have the legal ability to make that kind of an agreement. You know, the Congress gave Department of Transportation and EPA the ability to set energy-efficiency standards. CORNISH: They also gave California this ability to have a waiver, right? I mean, that is part of. . . WHEELER: Only for extraordinary. . . CORNISH: . . . The Clean Air Act. WHEELER: Only for extraordinary and compelling reasons. We are not. . . CORNISH: And you feel those reasons have changed? WHEELER: It's not that they've changed, that they just aren't there and they haven't been there. CORNISH: Regarding the cost of cars - because this is something the administration has talked about - Governor Newsom has said that China is going to eliminate the internal combustion engine. India, Japan - the rest of the world, they're moving in a new direction. Isn't this move hurting the country's ability to compete globally? WHEELER: Not at all. What this does - again, it sets a floor. And any car manufacturer can - if they can make the advances and produce the electric vehicles or other vehicles that consumers want to buy, that's great. And we applaud that, and we encourage that. But the Obama standard anticipated that there would be 50% electronic - electric vehicles by 2025. Right now, electric vehicles only make up 2% of the fleet being sold here in the United States. CORNISH: Won't this discourage that development or that innovation? WHEELER: No. But we can't - you can't force Americans to buy a product that they don't want to purchase. CORNISH: This is part of a larger administration deregulation effort, right? Many of these rollbacks, not just this one, are being challenged in court. I mean, how confident are you that this legacy of deregulation is going to withstand legal challenge? WHEELER: We're very confident 'cause we're following the statutes. We're following the law. Perfect example is what we did for the utility sector. The Obama administration's Clean Power Plan was stayed by the Supreme Court. That was an historic stay. They had never stepped in at that stage in litigation and actually issued a stay for a Clean Air Act regulation. They did that because I believe the Clean Power Plan was outside of the Clean Air Act. It was outside the bounds of the law. CORNISH: Are you hoping this, too, will go to the Supreme Court? WHEELER: Well, I think we need that certainty. So I do hope if we are challenged on it, it goes to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court upholds what we're doing. But we are closely following - unlike the previous administration - we are closely following the statutes, and we're closely following the Supreme Court decisions. So our regulations are based in the law, and that is what a regulatory agency is supposed to do. CORNISH: Now, my time is almost up, but I want to ask this because people in California have been asking it. Which is, is this political punishment? Is this punitive against a blue state that has been suing this administration quite a bit? WHEELER: Absolutely not. It's not punitive at all. You know, the automobile manufacturers were not able to comply with the Obama standard. Only three companies were able to meet the Obama standards. And the Obama standards. . . CORNISH: But four companies had said they were going to work with California. OK? So they had. . . WHEELER: They said - but we don't know. CORNISH: They were working on it. (Laughter) They were working on it. So California thinks that the administration has swooped in, and the governor has alluded to this idea of a kind of political vengeance. WHEELER: There's no political vengeance at all. I just wish the California officials would focus more on cleaning up the air in their state than trying to look like they're doing something globally for climate change. I think they're the ones politicizing this. They don't like what the president says on climate change so they're trying to show the rest of the world that they can do a lot, when they really should be focusing on providing clean air and clean water to their citizens. 'Cause they're not doing that. CORNISH: Andrew Wheeler is administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Thank you for your time. WHEELER: Thank you.

(APPLAUSE)BRADY: In New York, thousands of students may fill the streets because the school district is giving strikers excused absences - same in Portland, Ore. Strikes also are planned in rural places, where just a few dozen protesters are expected. Seventeen-year-old Nicholas DuVernay organized a protest in his politically conservative small town of La Grande, Ore. NICHOLAS DUVERNAY: Since probably the beginning of my junior year in high school, I've been interested in climate science and pretty passion about environmental topics. BRADY: These youthful climate strikers all say adults are moving too slowly. They have a list of demands that were summed up at a Capitol Hill press conference this week by 17-year-old Baltimore resident Nadia Nazar.

We must halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and change the way we farm. MARTIN: To tell us more about this summit, we're joined now by NPR science reporter Rebecca Hersher. Becky, thanks for joining us. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: Of course, hi. MARTIN: So what's the goal of this summit? HERSHER: Well, basically, they're trying to push leaders. U. N. leaders are trying to push world leaders to make better promises to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And that's because next year, in 2020, that's the first deadline to make more ambitious promises. MARTIN: Do we expect countries to make those bigger promises? HERSHER: It really depends on the country. So some of the good ones - France, some other European leaders, India, some small island nations. They are on track to probably signal that they intend to make these bigger promises, and some of that is political. It may be easier for some places to do that than others. China is an interesting one. China is the biggest emitter in the world. They've set quite conservative targets. And that means that they're on track to meet them. And they may be able to make a bigger promise going forward. Now, the not-so-good ones? Brazil? Not going to make bigger promises. Russia? Not on track. The U. S. is not. Trump has threatened to pull out of the Paris climate agreement. The U. S. is not on track to meet its previous promises, let alone to make bigger ones. MARTIN: What is the U. S. role in this summit? HERSHER: Well, the U. S. delegation - it's no longer much of a leader, you know? The U. S. was a leader in Paris. But this administration is moving to allow more emissions from power plants, from cars, from oil fields. But - this is the big but - Americans still have a role. So hundreds of cities, dozens of states, tons and tons of American companies have all said that they want to reduce their emissions. So there's only so much they can do without the federal government, but that does have an impact on the global stage. MARTIN: And what about the scientific community? Is there - what's the role of climate science at tomorrow's summit? HERSHER: It's absolutely crucial. It's the foundation of what's going on. So the U. N. put out another report today summing up the current science. And the idea behind these reports is just to help national leaders make good policy, understand what's at stake, set good goals, make good promises. So there was a big report last year, saying that humans have to cut greenhouse gas emissions by half by 2030. That's what leaders are looking to as they meet tomorrow. And the scientific community is good at telling leaders what's happening now because, you know, climate change is already underway. Sea levels are rising. Droughts and heat waves and cold snaps are all getting longer and more intense. Extreme rain is getting more likely, like what we're seeing in Texas. And storms are getting more frequent and severe. So those are all the things that will keep getting worse if the Earth continues to warm and all the things that are top of mind this week. MARTIN: That is NPR science reporter Rebecca Hersher. Becky, thanks so much for talking with us. HERSHER: Thanks. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Now to the United Nations climate summit. World leaders gather in New York City tomorrow for this amid a stark reality. The Earth is getting steadily warmer, and greenhouse gas emissions are still rising.

They are holding a special United Nations climate change summit. 2020 is the deadline for countries to make bigger, bolder promises to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But many of the world's biggest economies are struggling to keep up with their previous promises. NPR's Rebecca Hersher has this carbon report card. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: Let's start with a couple basic climate science facts that world leaders are staring down today. Fact No. 1 - the average temperature on our planet has already increased about 1 degree Celsius since pre-industrial times. Kelly Levin studies global emissions at the World Resources Institute think tank. KELLY LEVIN: You've seen the Arctic hitting record highs and a scorching summer in Europe and the United States, leaving hundreds dead, and July was the warmest month on record ever, globally. And this is just with 1 degree Celsius of warming. HERSHER: Storms are getting more frequent and severe, sea levels are rising, and heat waves and droughts are getting longer, which brings us to fact No. 2 - if the Earth gets 1 1/2 degrees Celsius hotter, all of those things get significantly worse. Many animals will go extinct. Many people will be forced to move, which is why leaders from nearly 200 nations are meeting in New York because - fact No. 3 - right now the world is on track for about 3 degrees of warming by the end of the century. So yeah, it's not good. Angel Hsu is a researcher at Yale-NUS College in Singapore. I spoke to her via Skype. ANGEL HSU: Unfortunately, national governments are really falling behind when it comes to delivering the ambition and the emissions cuts that we really need to avoid dangerous climate change. HERSHER: National governments including the U. S. , the second largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world behind China. The U. S. has promised to cut greenhouse gas emissions significantly by 2025. The good news - overall carbon emissions have gone down in the last decade, mostly because companies stopped burning so much coal. But under the Trump administration, that trend has slowed. HSU: What ended up happening in 2018 was a spike in emissions from the United States, and that also occurred in China as well. So that's what's really worrisome. HERSHER: But Hsu says there's a kind of silver lining. The Chinese government has been investing a lot in renewable energy, like solar and hydropower and electric public transit, and appears to be planning more. And because it's not a democracy, the leaders who make climate promises can't be voted out of office. HSU: And I think what's really encouraging about China is, when the leadership is committed to something, they can really follow through. HERSHER: India has also signaled it might be getting ready to promise big emissions cuts, and it's on track to achieve its current emissions promises. Levin says many countries recognize there's a lot to gain from burning less coal, less gas, cutting down fewer trees. LEVIN: Clean water and clean air and more efficient food production - there are such tremendous benefits that can be borne by climate action. HERSHER: Which brings us back to the United States. The federal government is currently trying to roll back policies that would control greenhouse gas emissions - things like limits on emissions from power plants and oil fields and cars. Meanwhile, hundreds of state and local governments are doing the opposite - passing local regulations, making local emissions promises - all of which puts the U. S. delegation at today's meeting in an awkward position and raises the question, if the U. S. is no longer leading international climate action, who will? Rebecca Hersher, NPR News.

N. has released a new climate science report on oceans. Here's are the headlines. Ice is melting everywhere and sea level rise is accelerating. The oceans are getting hotter faster. This is killing sea animals and disrupting fisheries. And there's also a relatively new problem - heat waves in the oceans. NPR's Rebecca Hersher has the story. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: The report is a synthesis of everything we know about climate change in the oceans so everyone's on the same page about what's happening. And what's happening, in the most basic terms, is that the oceans are getting a lot hotter. The rate of ocean warming has doubled since 1993. And marine heat waves are getting more frequent and intense. Haven't heard of marine heat waves? That's because they're new. Andrew Pershing is the chief scientific officer at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute. ANDREW PERSHING: It's sort of remarkable that prior to 2012, 2013, nobody kind of thought about heat waves in the ocean. And then in 2012, we had a huge event here in the Northwest Atlantic. And the Gulf of Maine was right at the center of it. HERSHER: Just like a heat wave on land, the water near Maine got abnormally hot that year. Scientists had never seen anything like it. And it was happening in other places, too. PERSHING: It was a real surprise. And then subsequently, these kind of heat wave events have popped up all over the ocean. So we've actually had three major heat waves in the Gulf of Maine - 2012, 2016 and 2018 - and repeat heat waves in the North Pacific. Australia's had some repeat heat waves. So it's really becoming a part of the conversation in oceanography. HERSHER: Because they're so new, scientists still aren't able to predict ocean heat waves or say much about how long they'll last once they start. In fact, right now, there's a marine heat wave off the west coast of the U. S. where there's an area of abnormally hot water known as the blob. HILLARY SCANNELL: How hot is it? So right now, it is up to 4 degrees Celsius above what we would normally expect. HERSHER: Hillary Scannell studies marine heat waves at the University of Washington. Four degrees Celsius is about 7 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than usual - a big enough difference where you'd notice it if you touched the water. SCANNELL: This patch of warm water is very unusual because it is so extreme and intense. HERSHER: Which is bad news for the animals that live in that water. Noah Oppenheim is the executive director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations. He's also a former marine researcher. NOAH OPPENHEIM: The impacts to the ocean sort of cascade up through the food web starting with plankton and into the krill, which form the prey base for animals as small as sardines all the way up to salmon and then whales. HERSHER: That cascade comes up in the new report. As oceans get hotter and marine heat waves get more intense, it knocks everything in the ocean out of equilibrium. That's already happened in the Pacific Northwest in recent years. Blobs of hot water there caused blooms of toxic algae, which meant the region's Dungeness crab fishery was closed for months. Salmon was also decimated. The federal government declared fishery disasters in 2016 and 2017. It's one of the many economic challenges that come with warmer oceans in addition to the costs of dealing with sea level rise. And hotter oceans also affect the weather far from the coasts, contributing to droughts and driving bigger, wetter storms. Cutting greenhouse gas emissions dramatically will help with all of these effects but slowly. OPPENHEIM: Even if we cut carbon emissions right now, we are still looking at 20 or 30 years of change. And so that means no matter what we do, we have to figure out how are we going to adapt to these changes? HERSHER: Which will mean remaking the global economy, rebuilding infrastructure and rethinking how we manage coastal communities. Rebecca Hersher, NPR News.

They've found everything from gas giants to smaller, Earth-sized worlds. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports they have now found a planet that challenges the conventional wisdom about how planets form. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: This newly discovered planet orbits a tiny, dim red star about 30 light-years away from Earth. Juan Carlos Morales is an astrophysicist at the Institute of Space Studies of Catalonia in Barcelona. He and his colleagues used a telescope to watch the star. They saw a telltale wobble that meant it was being tugged by the gravity of a big planet. JUAN CARLOS MORALES: In terms of size, it's - it may be very similar to Jupiter. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That was a surprise. MORALES: It's a very large planet for such a small star. GREENFIELDBOYCE: So large that it defies the most popular explanation for how planets form. Alan Boss is an astronomer at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D. C. He explains that newborn stars are temporarily surrounded by a swirling disc of leftover gas and dust. ALAN BOSS: Those dust grains are what form the cores of the giant planets, as well as the bulk of the terrestrial planets, like Earth. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The little bits of solid material collide and stick together, gradually building up and getting larger and larger - like, over a million years or more. At least, that's how scientists have explained all the planets they've found until now. Boss says, around this puny star, that process would happen too slowly to form a gas giant before the disc of gas and dust disappeared. So what did create this planet? Well, in the journal Science, researchers say there's another possibility, one Boss first proposed way back in 1997. Part of the star's disc could spontaneously contract and collapse into a planet. BOSS: So that can happen in something like a hundred years. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Boss says this idea hasn't been taken all that seriously. I asked him how he felt about scientists finally finding a planet that can only be explained in this way. BOSS: (Laughter) Well, I still - a little shocked that someone actually thinks that I've got - my ideas have some merit. So I am sure I'll get over it, but it's very pleasant. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Sara Seager is a planetary scientist at MIT. She likes this discovery because it's the latest example of how, in science, there's frequently two competing explanations. SARA SEAGER: And in the end of the day, it often turns out that both paradigms or both concepts are right, actually. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says nature is smarter than we are.

This week, the University of California, Los Angeles opened the world's first institute to study kindness with a $20 million gift. The Bedari Kindness Institute aims to pool the knowledge gleaned from researchers at UCLA working in different divisions - sociology, psychology and neurobiology - and house all of their scholarship about kindness in one place. The institute says it also wants to create opportunities to translate that research into real world practices, such as why does a person give up his or her seat on the train or why does somebody volunteer his or her time to help someone in need? How does kindness spread, and does being kind impact our brains? We wanted to learn more about all this, so we've called on Daniel Fessler. He is a professor of anthropology at UCLA, and he is the inaugural director of the Bedari Kindness Institute. And he's with us now. Professor Fessler, thank you so much for talking to us. DANIEL FESSLER: Well, thank you for your interest. I'm happy to be here. MARTIN: I was just looking at your bio, and you say in your own bio - your own university bio that when your colleagues talk about your work, they politely call it eclectic. And I took that to mean that your work is hard to categorize. So I just wanted to ask, you know, how - what is your work, and how does it translate into this task of creating this kindness institute? FESSLER: So it is indeed eclectic, broad-ranging, you might say. I'm an evolutionary anthropologist. And, in particular, I work on understanding contemporary human behavior, contemporary human health and how the mind works in the contemporary world in light of our species' long history of evolution. And in terms of kindness, an important feature of our species is that we are perhaps the most cooperative animal on the planet. So in no other species do you see cooperation between large numbers of unrelated individuals, or even, in many species, tolerance of large numbers of unrelated individuals. And at the same time, our species is also an extremely conflictual one. So there's a good argument to be made that the reason we're so cooperative is because we have a long history of intergroup violent conflict. And trying to understand how the cooperation aspect of it works, the helping-one-another component of it in juxtaposition with the conflict aspect, is an important step towards understanding how we can promote a more harmonious society and a more harmonious world. MARTIN: Could you talk a little bit more about that? I was wondering in part how you settled on kindness as the focus. FESSLER: The reason that we select kindness in this regard is we are not exclusively concerned with actions, but we're also concerned with the thoughts, beliefs, feelings and intentions that lie behind those actions. So we define kindness as thoughts, feelings and beliefs that motivate action intended to generate a benefit for another party. In other words, intended to enhance the welfare of the other party, where doing so is an end in itself and not a means to an end. So, for example, there are many situations in which, for ulterior motives, someone may enhance someone else's welfare, but they don't actually care about that other person's welfare. And, in fact, their intentions may be malicious. Likewise, there are cases in which one may intend to provide a benefit to someone, but something goes wrong along the way. We're interested in those class of events where people intend to benefit another. Sometimes they intend so consciously. Sometimes they intend to do so unconsciously. And that differentiates it from, say, strictly cooperation or pro-sociality, by which we mean the ability to get along with others, because people may do that for a wide variety of reasons that have nothing to do with valuing the other person's welfare. MARTIN: In a way, is this a battle for hearts and minds? Some, I think, would argue that the goal here of the present moment is to win this battle, right? This is a high conflict moment, where people are in a conflict for, you know, resources and of - for primacy, for national identity and that the goal is to win that battle. And I'm wondering if, in part, this purpose of this institute is to enter that fray with a different model of what is possible, a different way of relating? FESSLER: If we can change - not change people's political positions or change their personal beliefs or objectives but change the way that they experience others and change their objectives as regards to benefiting rather than displacing or exploiting others, in the long run, everyone is actually better off. If you view a situation as winner-take-all when no one ultimately can actually take all, then everyone will benefit when one views the situation instead as a lifeboat in which we all need to cooperate. And we can maintain our differences and our different perspectives and beliefs, but if we're all in the lifeboat together, we better keep that boat afloat. MARTIN: That's Daniel Fessler, professor of anthropology at UCLA and the inaugural director of the Bedari Kindness Institute there. Professor Fessler, thanks so much for talking to us. I hope we'll talk again. FESSLER: Thank you very much. I look forward to it. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  We're going to turn now to a topic that you don't hear much about in the news these days - kindness.

I\u2019ve always wanted to share interesting things that don\u2019t make it onto the show and to hear directly from you. Now there\u2019s a way to connect one on one - my newsletter. You can subscribe at news. hiddenbrain. org. That address again is news. hiddenbrain. org. See you soon. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. There's a video on YouTube you might have seen. It has nearly 200 million views. In this video, a pair of twin brothers are standing in a kitchen having a little chat. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED INFANTS: (Babbling). VEDANTAM: These twin brothers. . . (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED INFANTS: (Babbling). VEDANTAM: . . . Are diaper-clad babies. Now, if this video featured 10-year-old twins or adult twins, I guarantee you it wouldn't have gone viral. What makes this video special is that we have no clue what these babies are saying. To us non-babies, it sounds like gobbledygook - cute, mysterious gobbledygook. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED INFANTS: (Babbling). VEDANTAM: Here at HIDDEN BRAIN, we love trying to understand the puzzles and contradictions of human behavior, but we spend most of our time talking about the older members of the human race. Today, we focus on the younger set - the much younger set. LAURA CIRELLI: I find babies are so impressive. We can't really ask them what they're thinking. We have to come up with clever ways of figuring out what's going on in their little brains. VEDANTAM: We'll meet some of the researchers trying to decipher the behavior of babies. RACHEL ALBERT: Oh, oh, you're - oh, that's a ball. Yeah, you're right. VEDANTAM: Do babies understand us when we're talking to them? ALBERT: That's a ball. You tried to say ball. That's great. VEDANTAM: And how babies communicate even if they don't have words. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED INFANTS: (Babbling). VEDANTAM: The language of babies this week on HIDDEN BRAIN. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CIRELLI: Hi, I'm Laura Cirelli. VEDANTAM: When Laura was in college, she spent her summer vacations back home in Sudbury, Ontario. CIRELLI: Like, five hours north of Toronto. VEDANTAM: And she worked at the Magical Nook, a day care center. CIRELLI: It was a large center that had different age groups, so there was, like, a baby room and a toddler room, preschoolers, school-age children. Probably about a hundred children in total, but my favorite room was the toddler room for sure. VEDANTAM: Laura's job was to help the teachers at the center engage with the kids and enforce the rules. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Music was an essential tool. CIRELLI: We would sing \"Wheels On The Bus. . . \"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WHEELS ON THE BUS\")UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing) The wheels on the bus go round and round. CIRELLI: \". . . Old MacDonald. . . \"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"OLD MACDONALD HAD A FARM\")UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing) Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O. CIRELLI: If we didn't sing the clean up song with the preschoolers, then I don't think anything would have ever gotten cleaned up. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"BARNEY AND FRIENDS\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters, singing) Clean up, clean up, everybody everywhere. CIRELLI: But as soon as we started, it seemed to be the trick to convince them that, yes, they were willing to put their toys away. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"BARNEY AND FRIENDS\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Baby Bop) Such a mess. VEDANTAM: Laura regularly found herself in awe of the toddlers. CIRELLI: One little kid who I had a good connection with, she grabbed my hand and brought me over to the little slide, and she really wanted to go down the slide. You could tell. So I helped her up the little stairs, and I caught her at the bottom of the slide. And all the rest of the toddlers in this playground just looked over and saw her and looked at each other and then ran over to the slide and formed a cute little lineup waiting their turn for me to help them down. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Laura's days are the Magical Nook are now over. After graduating college, she went on to earn her Ph. D. in psychology, neuroscience and behavior. She is now a professor at the University of Toronto Scarborough, and her work focuses on early childhood development. With years of knowledge now under her belt, she looks back on that moment at the slide and sees it as a form of communication. CIRELLI: You know, in order for kids to look around and see what their peers are doing and to understand the goals that are embedded in those activities and to then realize that they need to follow the social construct of lining up, it seems like a super simple thing, but there's a lot of understanding about themselves, about other people, about goals and activities that they need to really completely understand in order for that to happen. VEDANTAM: Laura says actions like standing in line for the slide can be categorized as prosocial behaviors. They're actions we take to help others and to benefit the group. She decided to study what she'd seen on the playground more systematically. She invited a bunch of parents to bring their toddlers into the lab. CIRELLI: We were specifically testing 14-month-old babies. So they're - you know, they're walking. They're not quite talking. VEDANTAM: These 14-month-olds said bye-bye to Mommy and Daddy and then were strapped into front-facing baby carriers worn by assistants in the study. The researchers turned on some music. CIRELLI: Usually, it was \"Twist And Shout\" playing the background. (SOUNDBITE OF BEATLES SONG, \"TWIST AND SHOUT\")VEDANTAM: And the person carrying the baby began to bounce. CIRELLI: It was like (rhythmic clapping) so we would bounce them down on one beat and up on the other, down and up sort of thing. VEDANTAM: So if you're this baby, you're strapped onto someone's chest, you can't see their face. Instead, you're looking in front of you at another assistant. CIRELLI: The person facing the baby would either move in synchrony with how they were being bounced, so they're bouncing together, or they would move either too quickly or too slowly so that their movements weren't aligned with what the baby was experiencing. VEDANTAM: After about 2 1/2 minutes, the bouncing stopped and the baby was removed from the carrier. CIRELLI: And then this person who had faced them and moved either in or out of sync with them would perform some little, simple social games with them. So she would do things like draw pictures with markers or throw paper balls in a bucket. VEDANTAM: Every now and then, the assistant who had faced the baby would drop a marker or paper ball and then pretend like the object was out of reach. CIRELLI: So she would reach pathetically for them for about 30 seconds and we'd look to see what the babies did in this really weird situation where this person they just met needs help but isn't really asking for help and doesn't really seem to be able to achieve their goal on their own. VEDANTAM: Laura measured how many babies would pick up and hand back the objects. CIRELLI: And looked at whether the babies who we bounced in sync with helped at a different rate than the babies we bounced out of sync with. VEDANTAM: She found that babies who felt that they were bouncing in sync with a dance partner were more likely to help that partner pick up an object when it was out of reach. It was remarkable. CIRELLI: So they would help on over half of the trials if we moved in sync with them, whereas if we moved out of sync with them, they would help on only less than a third of the trials. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: You've likely experienced the same drive if you've ever moved in sync with someone else, maybe on a sports team in school or in marching band or maybe, like Laura, as a dancer. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"BEAUTY AND THE BEAST\")JERRY ORBACH: (As Lumiere, singing) Be our guest, be our guest, put our service to the test. Tie your napkin 'round your neck, cherie, and we'll provide the rest. VEDANTAM: This song was a soundtrack of Laura's last recital in high school where she dressed up as Mrs. Potts for a performance of \"Beauty And The Beast. \"CIRELLI: There were many numbers in the performance, but in the \"Be Our Guest\" performance, everyone comes together, all the little kitchen utensils and everything, and we do have to really synchronize at certain parts of the dance. And so when you're experiencing that, you really feel like you're part of this bigger group. And, I mean, you're focusing on the task at hand, you know, doing all of these steps, but that's become quite automatic at this point. And instead, you can really sort of feel the connection with your co-dancers, and you start to just ignore the audience completely because you're part of this bigger thing. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"BEAUTY AND THE BEAST\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters, singing) Come on and lift your glass. You've won your own free pass to be our guest. ORBACH: (As Lumiere) If you're stressed. . . VEDANTAM: Laura's fellow dancers remain some of her closest friends to this day. CIRELLI: I'm going to be the emcee at one of their weddings in September (laughter). So yeah, we've definitely stayed very close. VEDANTAM: Music and dance create bonds because, as Laura says, synchronous movement is a language of its own. This unspoken language can guide behavior even though many of us are not familiar with its syntax and vocabulary. CIRELLI: I think music is providing a really interesting context where a lot of social cues are happening. So when we're moving with other people, when we're doing familiar things and singing familiar songs, these are actually cueing us, babies and adults, to think about the relationships that we have with these people. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CIRELLI: We think about teaching our kids to be prosocial and to be good citizens, but they're already attending to this information from a really early age. VEDANTAM: The toddler experiment also shows that kids who can't speak are still hungry to communicate. When a small child reaches out to pick up a marker or a paper ball, she may be saying, I like you. I want to help you. Let's be friends. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CIRELLI: I find babies are so impressive. We can't really ask them what they're thinking. We have to come up with clever ways of figuring out what's going on in their little brains, and everybody underestimates them. VEDANTAM: Music and dance aren't the only ways adults and small kids communicate with one another. There's another language that actually sounds a lot like language. UNIDENTIFIED INFANTS: (Babbling). ALBERT: The traditional way of looking at babbling, even as recently as 15, 20 years ago, was really that it was just motor practice, that it had no bearing on later language. It was just something babies did to exercise their mouths. VEDANTAM: This is Rachel Albert. ALBERT: I am an assistant professor of psychology at Lebanon Valley College in Annville, Pa. VEDANTAM: She studies infant language development. Those, quote-unquote, \"traditional views on babbling. . . \"UNIDENTIFIED INFANT: (Babbling). VEDANTAM: . . . Rachel says toss them out. ALBERT: When babies babble, they're indicating that they're either in a heightened state of arousal or by actually babbling they're increasing their arousal level and putting themselves in kind of this optimal state of being ready to learn over and above than if they were just quietly looking at an object. VEDANTAM: Rachel says babbles have a certain je ne sais quoi. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking French). VEDANTAM: When she hears a baby babble, she's taken back to high school French class. ALBERT: And I had one of those immersive French teachers who would only speak French in the classroom. And so it was really like being dropped into a non-native environment where you have to kind of figure things out. I vividly remember that she would come into the classroom, and she would start talking and. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking French). ALBERT: . . . The whole class would kind of have blank stares of panic as she would go. And so she'd start slowing down her speech. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking French). ALBERT: . . . And pointing and labeling particular objects in the room. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking French). ALBERT: So she would, in French, be kind of pointing and saying, you know, are you sitting in a desk? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking French). ALBERT: Look at the desk. Here's a desk. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking French). ALBERT: . . . And kind of repeating those key vocabulary words until we started to figure out, oh, OK, this is the word for desk. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking French). ALBERT: And I thought, well, this must be somewhat similar to what a baby experiences - right? - where there's all this conversation going around. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. ALBERT: They start to become active communication partners and trying to engage in that world, but how do they make sense of it? UNIDENTIFIED INFANT: (Babbling). VEDANTAM: Parent's often see themselves as the know-it-all French teacher and the babbling baby as a clumsy student. Rachel says this framework is the one that's mostly used in studying infant language development. ALBERT: But the baby is playing as much of a role in this interaction as the mom. By changing the way that they babble and what they're looking at - might actually be changing their opportunities for learning because they're changing what the parents say. It's kind of what we call a social feedback loop. So when the baby babbles, Mom responds. The way Mom responds actually will change in real time what the child says next. And they go around and around in this conversation influencing each other. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: There's a word to describe a back-and-forth exchange where the thing that one person says affects what another person says. This feedback loop of communication and learning is what we call language. (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT VOCALIZING)VEDANTAM: Babies make as many as a thousand vocalizations every day. On average, parents respond to about 60% of these babbles. ALBERT: Even just silently responding - if the mom just acknowledges the infant's vocalization with a touch - leans in, smiles and touches the baby - the infant will immediately, within the span of just 10 minutes, start to produce more speech-like vocalizations. So just that nonverbal feedback, that acknowledgement of the baby's vocalization, changes in the moment how they're babbling. VEDANTAM: Rachel says that when babies are babbling, they are more receptive to new information. Parents can take advantage of this by having conversations with their baby. And one rule of being a good conversationalist - stay attentive to what your partner is saying. ALBERT: So parents that are just talking constantly about irrelevant things that aren't what their child's looking at - for example, if a baby is looking at a ball and I'm talking about this cup over here that I'm playing with - well, you're actually providing mismatching communication - mismatching information for them that's going to make it harder to learn. VEDANTAM: Rachel says if you listen closely, babbling often falls into four distinct categories. They have different sounds, and they elicit different responses. (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT COOING)VEDANTAM: The first type is called. . . (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT VOCALIZING)VEDANTAM: . . . QRVALBERT: QRV is the least mature infant vocalizations. It stands for quasi-resonant vocalization. And so it's those really kind of nasal, creaky ehh (ph) kind of - sounds that a lot of times parents interpret almost as fussing. VEDANTAM: The second type is called. . . (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT VOCALIZING)VEDANTAM: . . . FRV. (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT VOCALIZING)ALBERT: So that's a fully resonant vowel. And around 3 or 4 months, the baby's vocal tract opens up. And then they're able to produce those more open, kind of adult-like sounding vowels that kind of have those ohs or ah quality. And so parents recognize those as more speech-like than those first, creaky nasalized vowels. And so they're more likely to respond to those. VEDANTAM: The third is called. . . (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT VOCALIZING)VEDANTAM: . . . MSFR. (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT VOCALIZING)ALBERT: So that's a marginal syllable. And babies will start, around 6 or so months, throwing consonants into the mix. So you can hear in that sound, there's kind of a D-J kind of juh (ph) sound. (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT VOCALIZING)ALBERT: But it's a slow, drawn-out transition between when the consonant stops and when the vowel begins. VEDANTAM: And the pinnacle. . . (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT VOCALIZING)VEDANTAM: . . . The piece de resistance if you will. . . (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT VOCALIZING)ALBERT: So that's what's called a canonical syllable. And those are those nice ba-bas (ph) and da-das (ph) that parents naturally associate with babbling. And so babies start regularly producing those pretty frequently around 9 months. And parents react very strongly to these canonical syllables. They hear them as the most speech-like. They tend to often interpret them as approximations of words. So, you know, in that example, if a baby was holding a ball. . . (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT VOCALIZING)ALBERT: . . . A mom would be very likely to respond - oh, you - oh, that's a ball. Yeah, you're right. That's a ball. You tried to say ball. That's great. VEDANTAM: To Rachel, these different vocalizations are endlessly fascinating. Now that she knows how to tell apart the QRVs. . . (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT VOCALIZING)VEDANTAM: . . . From the FRVs. . . (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT VOCALIZING)VEDANTAM: . . . And the MSFRs. . . (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT VOCALIZING)VEDANTAM: . . . From the canonical syllables. . . (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT VOCALIZING)VEDANTAM: . . . She simply can't stop herself. ALBERT: On my wedding day, I remember very distinctly - I was in graduate school at the time and knee-deep in coding this all the time, spending hours listening to these different sounds. And I remember being up at the front of the church about to say my vows and hearing some babies out in the audience babble and kind of immediately coding it and going - oh, that was a marginal syllable. And then thinking - no, focus. This is a very important moment. You're supposed to be attending to what your pastor is saying. But I couldn't help but have my attention pulled by the baby in the audience and trying to code what she was saying. (SOUNDBITE OF INFANTS VOCALIZING)VEDANTAM: You don't have to memorize all the jargon to take away something valuable from the research. Just knowing that when babies are babbling, they're ready to learn - that can be a useful takeaway for everyone. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: When we return, we discuss two final elements of baby language. One is going to make you very happy. The other - well, that's something you don't want to hear as you're saying your wedding vows. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)KATRINA DOUDNA: (Screaming) No. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: A warning - if you're driving or listening to this story as you're cooking, you're about to hear something very distracting. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)KATRINA: (Screaming) No. No. VEDANTAM: This is Katrina Doudna of Sunnyvale, Calif. It's dinnertime. She's throwing a tantrum because she wants to sit at the head of the table. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)KATRINA: (Screaming). VEDANTAM: Problem is the table's round. There is no head. NOEMI DOUDNA: When she was in the midst of a tantrum, she'd picked something that she knew was completely unreasonable. (Imitating tantrum) I don't want my feet. Take my feet off. I don't want my feet. I don't want my feet. VEDANTAM: That's Katrina's mom, Noemi. I interviewed her a number of years ago when Katrina was 3. N DOUDNA: I once teased her - which turned out to be a big mistake. But I once said, well, OK - let's go get some scissors and take care of your feet. (Imitating tantrum) No. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MIKE POTEGAL: My curiosity was focused on what are the elements of the tantrums? You know, are the snips and snails and puppy-dog tails or what? VEDANTAM: This is Mike. POTEGAL: It's Mike Potegal. I am currently an associate professor in the Program in Occupational Therapy at University of Minnesota. VEDANTAM: Mike was inspired to study tantrums after witnessing his own daughter's operatic meltdowns. POTEGAL: Among the things that I learned from that was that there was a sequence in which various behaviors appeared, various behaviors of which tantrums are composed. VEDANTAM: Just like Rachel Albert did with babbling, Mike picked out a rhythm in a cacophony of his daughter's tantrums. To prove his point, he teamed up with a colleague. . . JAMES GREEN: James Green. VEDANTAM: He's a psychologist at the University of Connecticut. GREEN: We developed a onesie that toddlers can wear that has a high-quality wireless microphone sewn into it. Parents put this onesie on the child and press a go button on the equipment. VEDANTAM: And then they waited for a meltdown. James and Mike recorded more than a hundred of them. And what they found confirmed their hypothesis. POTEGAL: There are two major - I think of them as emotional behavioral components of tantrums. VEDANTAM: The first is anger. POTEGAL: Hitting, kicking, screaming, throwing things, pushing and pulling. VEDANTAM: And the other component is distress. POTEGAL: Whining, crying, throwing the self down - that is, dropping to the floor - and comfort-seeking. VEDANTAM: Don't confuse these components with stages. Mike says the behaviors occur simultaneously. The distress is more consistent. POTEGAL: Throughout the tantrum, from its beginning to its end. VEDANTAM: The anger punctuates the tantrum. It provides the dramatic spikes, and it also tapers toward the end. POTEGAL: In every case, the anger terminates before the distress. VEDANTAM: Mike says there's a reason that most tantrums end with a distress call. POTEGAL: Because the distress, sadness, tends to elicit comfort-giving. And so it would make sense from an evolutionary perspective if the anger, which is disruptive, is smoothed over by the distress component which then, other things equal, will call for a parent comforting the child. VEDANTAM: Let's go back to Katrina, the child who was throwing a fit because she can't sit at the head of the family's circular dinner table. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)KATRINA: (Screaming) No. No. VEDANTAM: Dad tries to reason with her. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)DAVID DOUDNA: Do you want to sit at? Do you want to sit - do you know what? It doesn't have corner 'cause it's round. It's a circle. KATRINA: (Screaming). VEDANTAM: James Green says that he's fallen into the same trap before. GREEN: When children are at the peak of anger and they're screaming and they're kicking, probably asking questions might prolong that period of anger. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)KATRINA: (Screaming). VEDANTAM: Dad decides to intervene. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)D DOUDNA: I'm going to pick this chair for you. KATRINA: (Screaming) No, no. No. VEDANTAM: Now Katrina is on the floor. She grabs a stool and. . . (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)VEDANTAM: . . . Slams it against the wall. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)KATRINA: (Screaming). VEDANTAM: It seems like things are escalating, but James says it's just the opposite. GREEN: Once she's thrown herself on the floor and thrown something or, in this case, knocked the chair against the wall, we're probably on the down slope of this tantrum. She's spent a lot of energy screaming, yelling and now doing these physical behaviors. VEDANTAM: Listen to Katrina. And pay attention to how the register of her voice changes. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)KATRINA: (Screaming) No. (Sobbing) No. (Screaming) No. VEDANTAM: Mike says, in many cases, parents can safely ignore their child's tantrums. POTEGAL: And this approach has a formal name - planned ignoring. And it basically means turning your back on the child and walking out of the room because talking to them and telling them to stop is giving them attention, albeit negative attention. VEDANTAM: This works best when the child throws a tantrum to get attention or because you've said no to eating cookies at dinner. But if the child throws a tantrum in response to something you asked them to do. . . POTEGAL: A very different approach is appropriate. And the reason for that is that what the tantrum does is basically a stall. It's a way for the child to not comply with the parent request. And so the best approach, if it can be managed, is to get the child to comply with the request. For younger children, this can be done with a hand-over-hand kind of forced cooperation. So you can say to the child, OK, get your PJs on. And if the child refuses, you can say - OK, I'm going to count to three or five or whatever you like. And if you have not begun putting your PJs on I'm going to put my hands on your hands and help you do it. And children really do not like this. VEDANTAM: Because, he says, it's a threat to their autonomy. And if the child still doesn't comply, maybe you can use it as an opportunity to do some research, just like Mike. POTEGAL: We would walk down the street. And I'd see a kid having a tantrum. And I would say - I would mutter or say out loud to my wife, data. And then of course she'd give me a sidelong look about (laughter) what's wrong with you (laughter)? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: We've talked so far about the secret languages of dancing and babbling. We've looked at the grammar of temper tantrums. We're getting close to the end of our story, and that brings us to lullabies. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Laura Cirelli, the first researcher we featured on dancing and synchronization, has also done work on the language of music with infants. CIRELLI: Across cultures, we all engage with music, and we do it at such an early age, so we really wanted to continue to explore this idea that one of the real benefits and perhaps one of the underlying reasons why we invest so much time and energy in music across cultures is because of these social and emotional implications. VEDANTAM: Remember the magic of the clean up song that Laura talked about earlier? She and her fellow researchers wanted to closely examine the effect of music on babies and their caregivers. They asked parents to volunteer to come into the lab with their babies. Thirty mothers said they would do it. CIRELLI: They would be in a soundproof room, and babies would be sat in a little highchair, and moms would sit facing them. VEDANTAM: They were also measuring stress levels. CIRELLI: So we used little stickers on the bottom of the baby's foot and on the mother's fingertips, and we were - what we're able to measure with this is actually their sweat gland activity. VEDANTAM: The mothers then sang two versions of \"Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star. \" One version. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TWINKLE, TWINKLE LITTLE STAR\")UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing) Twinkle, twinkle little star. VEDANTAM: . . . Was upbeat. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TWINKLE, TWINKLE LITTLE STAR\")UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing) How I wonder what you are. VEDANTAM: The other. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TWINKLE, TWINKLE LITTLE STAR\")UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing) Twinkle, twinkle little star. VEDANTAM: . . . Was a lullaby. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TWINKLE, TWINKLE LITTLE STAR\")UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing) How I wonder what you are. CIRELLI: What we found was that when Mom sang in a playful way, the - both Mom and baby's arousal levels stayed stable. But when Mom sang in a soothing way. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TWINKLE, TWINKLE LITTLE STAR\")UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing) Twinkle, twinkle little star. CIRELLI: . . . Both mom and baby's arousal levels decreased as the song progressed. So what this is telling us is that lullabies are really working to calm not only baby but also the mother. And so this supports this idea that there's a function here. VEDANTAM: Is this telling us just what our - is this just confirming what our intuitions are telling us or do you think it's telling us something more than that? CIRELLI: Anecdotally, I'm sure most parents would agree that lullabies soothe their babies. But usually, when we're singing lullabies to our babies, we're holding them and we're rocking them and we're adding all of this really important soothing tactile information. So we wanted to know what the song is doing, removing all of that tactile input. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CIRELLI: So the babies are sitting in a highchair. They're facing their mom, but they're not experiencing that holding and that rocking that typically comes along with lullabies. But I think the really interesting thing here is we usually think of that unidirectional relationship. Like, when moms sing to babies, it is to change the baby's behavior. But I think it's - the really new, interesting thing here is considering how it's also affecting the mom. VEDANTAM: Indeed, if there's one thing that all this research shows, it's that communicating with babies is not a one-way street. Parents and caregivers are shaped by what babies say and sing and scream, just as babies are hungrily soaking up information from adults. When we think about raising a human, it's natural that most of us think about the role that adults play in shaping their children. What's less clear - but what is abundantly true - is that babies are every bit as involved in raising humans of their own. It's not just a figure of speech. We're all always growing up. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This week's show was produced by Parth Shah and was edited by Tara Boyle. Our team includes Rhaina Cohen, Jenny Schmidt, Thomas Lu and Laura Kwerel. We like to end our podcast by acknowledging an unsung hero, a person behind the scenes who helps us create the show. Today, we want to recognize the mothers and fathers of the HIDDEN BRAIN team - Vatsala (ph), Lakshmiputhi (ph), Melanie (ph), Steve (ph), Dorothea (ph), Steven (ph), Comlesh (ph), Bella (ph), Herschel (ph), Toby (ph), Evan (ph) and Linda (ph). Thank you for your work in raising us humans. You truly have made HIDDEN BRAIN possible. I'm Shankar Vedantam, and this is. . . UNIDENTIFIED INFANT: (Babbling). VEDANTAM: (Laughter) This is NPR. UNIDENTIFIED INFANT: (Babbling) Muh - Mom. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST:  Hey, Shankar here. I\u2019ve always wanted to share interesting things that don\u2019t make it onto the show and to hear directly from you. Now there\u2019s a way to connect one on one - my newsletter. You can subscribe at news. hiddenbrain. org. That address again is news. hiddenbrain. org. See you soon. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. There's a video on YouTube you might have seen. It has nearly 200 million views. In this video, a pair of twin brothers are standing in a kitchen having a little chat. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED INFANTS: (Babbling). VEDANTAM: These twin brothers. . . (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED INFANTS: (Babbling). VEDANTAM: . . . Are diaper-clad babies. Now, if this video featured 10-year-old twins or adult twins, I guarantee you it wouldn't have gone viral. What makes this video special is that we have no clue what these babies are saying. To us non-babies, it sounds like gobbledygook - cute, mysterious gobbledygook. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED INFANTS: (Babbling). VEDANTAM: Here at HIDDEN BRAIN, we love trying to understand the puzzles and contradictions of human behavior, but we spend most of our time talking about the older members of the human race. Today, we focus on the younger set - the much younger set. LAURA CIRELLI: I find babies are so impressive. We can't really ask them what they're thinking. We have to come up with clever ways of figuring out what's going on in their little brains. VEDANTAM: We'll meet some of the researchers trying to decipher the behavior of babies. RACHEL ALBERT: Oh, oh, you're - oh, that's a ball. Yeah, you're right. VEDANTAM: Do babies understand us when we're talking to them? ALBERT: That's a ball. You tried to say ball. That's great. VEDANTAM: And how babies communicate even if they don't have words. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED INFANTS: (Babbling). VEDANTAM: The language of babies this week on HIDDEN BRAIN. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) CIRELLI: Hi, I'm Laura Cirelli. VEDANTAM: When Laura was in college, she spent her summer vacations back home in Sudbury, Ontario. CIRELLI: Like, five hours north of Toronto. VEDANTAM: And she worked at the Magical Nook, a day care center. CIRELLI: It was a large center that had different age groups, so there was, like, a baby room and a toddler room, preschoolers, school-age children. Probably about a hundred children in total, but my favorite room was the toddler room for sure. VEDANTAM: Laura's job was to help the teachers at the center engage with the kids and enforce the rules. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Music was an essential tool. CIRELLI: We would sing \"Wheels On The Bus. . . \" (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WHEELS ON THE BUS\") UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing) The wheels on the bus go round and round. CIRELLI: \". . . Old MacDonald. . . \" (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"OLD MACDONALD HAD A FARM\") UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing) Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O. CIRELLI: If we didn't sing the clean up song with the preschoolers, then I don't think anything would have ever gotten cleaned up. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"BARNEY AND FRIENDS\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters, singing) Clean up, clean up, everybody everywhere. CIRELLI: But as soon as we started, it seemed to be the trick to convince them that, yes, they were willing to put their toys away. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"BARNEY AND FRIENDS\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Baby Bop) Such a mess. VEDANTAM: Laura regularly found herself in awe of the toddlers. CIRELLI: One little kid who I had a good connection with, she grabbed my hand and brought me over to the little slide, and she really wanted to go down the slide. You could tell. So I helped her up the little stairs, and I caught her at the bottom of the slide. And all the rest of the toddlers in this playground just looked over and saw her and looked at each other and then ran over to the slide and formed a cute little lineup waiting their turn for me to help them down. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Laura's days are the Magical Nook are now over. After graduating college, she went on to earn her Ph. D. in psychology, neuroscience and behavior. She is now a professor at the University of Toronto Scarborough, and her work focuses on early childhood development. With years of knowledge now under her belt, she looks back on that moment at the slide and sees it as a form of communication. CIRELLI: You know, in order for kids to look around and see what their peers are doing and to understand the goals that are embedded in those activities and to then realize that they need to follow the social construct of lining up, it seems like a super simple thing, but there's a lot of understanding about themselves, about other people, about goals and activities that they need to really completely understand in order for that to happen. VEDANTAM: Laura says actions like standing in line for the slide can be categorized as prosocial behaviors. They're actions we take to help others and to benefit the group. She decided to study what she'd seen on the playground more systematically. She invited a bunch of parents to bring their toddlers into the lab. CIRELLI: We were specifically testing 14-month-old babies. So they're - you know, they're walking. They're not quite talking. VEDANTAM: These 14-month-olds said bye-bye to Mommy and Daddy and then were strapped into front-facing baby carriers worn by assistants in the study. The researchers turned on some music. CIRELLI: Usually, it was \"Twist And Shout\" playing the background. (SOUNDBITE OF BEATLES SONG, \"TWIST AND SHOUT\") VEDANTAM: And the person carrying the baby began to bounce. CIRELLI: It was like (rhythmic clapping) so we would bounce them down on one beat and up on the other, down and up sort of thing. VEDANTAM: So if you're this baby, you're strapped onto someone's chest, you can't see their face. Instead, you're looking in front of you at another assistant. CIRELLI: The person facing the baby would either move in synchrony with how they were being bounced, so they're bouncing together, or they would move either too quickly or too slowly so that their movements weren't aligned with what the baby was experiencing. VEDANTAM: After about 2 1/2 minutes, the bouncing stopped and the baby was removed from the carrier. CIRELLI: And then this person who had faced them and moved either in or out of sync with them would perform some little, simple social games with them. So she would do things like draw pictures with markers or throw paper balls in a bucket. VEDANTAM: Every now and then, the assistant who had faced the baby would drop a marker or paper ball and then pretend like the object was out of reach. CIRELLI: So she would reach pathetically for them for about 30 seconds and we'd look to see what the babies did in this really weird situation where this person they just met needs help but isn't really asking for help and doesn't really seem to be able to achieve their goal on their own. VEDANTAM: Laura measured how many babies would pick up and hand back the objects. CIRELLI: And looked at whether the babies who we bounced in sync with helped at a different rate than the babies we bounced out of sync with. VEDANTAM: She found that babies who felt that they were bouncing in sync with a dance partner were more likely to help that partner pick up an object when it was out of reach. It was remarkable. CIRELLI: So they would help on over half of the trials if we moved in sync with them, whereas if we moved out of sync with them, they would help on only less than a third of the trials. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: You've likely experienced the same drive if you've ever moved in sync with someone else, maybe on a sports team in school or in marching band or maybe, like Laura, as a dancer. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"BEAUTY AND THE BEAST\") JERRY ORBACH: (As Lumiere, singing) Be our guest, be our guest, put our service to the test. Tie your napkin 'round your neck, cherie, and we'll provide the rest. VEDANTAM: This song was a soundtrack of Laura's last recital in high school where she dressed up as Mrs. Potts for a performance of \"Beauty And The Beast. \" CIRELLI: There were many numbers in the performance, but in the \"Be Our Guest\" performance, everyone comes together, all the little kitchen utensils and everything, and we do have to really synchronize at certain parts of the dance. And so when you're experiencing that, you really feel like you're part of this bigger group. And, I mean, you're focusing on the task at hand, you know, doing all of these steps, but that's become quite automatic at this point. And instead, you can really sort of feel the connection with your co-dancers, and you start to just ignore the audience completely because you're part of this bigger thing. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"BEAUTY AND THE BEAST\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters, singing) Come on and lift your glass. You've won your own free pass to be our guest. ORBACH: (As Lumiere) If you're stressed. . . VEDANTAM: Laura's fellow dancers remain some of her closest friends to this day. CIRELLI: I'm going to be the emcee at one of their weddings in September (laughter). So yeah, we've definitely stayed very close. VEDANTAM: Music and dance create bonds because, as Laura says, synchronous movement is a language of its own. This unspoken language can guide behavior even though many of us are not familiar with its syntax and vocabulary. CIRELLI: I think music is providing a really interesting context where a lot of social cues are happening. So when we're moving with other people, when we're doing familiar things and singing familiar songs, these are actually cueing us, babies and adults, to think about the relationships that we have with these people. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) CIRELLI: We think about teaching our kids to be prosocial and to be good citizens, but they're already attending to this information from a really early age. VEDANTAM: The toddler experiment also shows that kids who can't speak are still hungry to communicate. When a small child reaches out to pick up a marker or a paper ball, she may be saying, I like you. I want to help you. Let's be friends. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) CIRELLI: I find babies are so impressive. We can't really ask them what they're thinking. We have to come up with clever ways of figuring out what's going on in their little brains, and everybody underestimates them. VEDANTAM: Music and dance aren't the only ways adults and small kids communicate with one another. There's another language that actually sounds a lot like language. UNIDENTIFIED INFANTS: (Babbling). ALBERT: The traditional way of looking at babbling, even as recently as 15, 20 years ago, was really that it was just motor practice, that it had no bearing on later language. It was just something babies did to exercise their mouths. VEDANTAM: This is Rachel Albert. ALBERT: I am an assistant professor of psychology at Lebanon Valley College in Annville, Pa. VEDANTAM: She studies infant language development. Those, quote-unquote, \"traditional views on babbling. . . \" UNIDENTIFIED INFANT: (Babbling). VEDANTAM: . . . Rachel says toss them out. ALBERT: When babies babble, they're indicating that they're either in a heightened state of arousal or by actually babbling they're increasing their arousal level and putting themselves in kind of this optimal state of being ready to learn over and above than if they were just quietly looking at an object. VEDANTAM: Rachel says babbles have a certain je ne sais quoi. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking French). VEDANTAM: When she hears a baby babble, she's taken back to high school French class. ALBERT: And I had one of those immersive French teachers who would only speak French in the classroom. And so it was really like being dropped into a non-native environment where you have to kind of figure things out. I vividly remember that she would come into the classroom, and she would start talking and. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking French). ALBERT: . . . The whole class would kind of have blank stares of panic as she would go. And so she'd start slowing down her speech. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking French). ALBERT: . . . And pointing and labeling particular objects in the room. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking French). ALBERT: So she would, in French, be kind of pointing and saying, you know, are you sitting in a desk? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking French). ALBERT: Look at the desk. Here's a desk. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking French). ALBERT: . . . And kind of repeating those key vocabulary words until we started to figure out, oh, OK, this is the word for desk. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking French). ALBERT: And I thought, well, this must be somewhat similar to what a baby experiences - right? - where there's all this conversation going around. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. ALBERT: They start to become active communication partners and trying to engage in that world, but how do they make sense of it? UNIDENTIFIED INFANT: (Babbling). VEDANTAM: Parent's often see themselves as the know-it-all French teacher and the babbling baby as a clumsy student. Rachel says this framework is the one that's mostly used in studying infant language development. ALBERT: But the baby is playing as much of a role in this interaction as the mom. By changing the way that they babble and what they're looking at - might actually be changing their opportunities for learning because they're changing what the parents say. It's kind of what we call a social feedback loop. So when the baby babbles, Mom responds. The way Mom responds actually will change in real time what the child says next. And they go around and around in this conversation influencing each other. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: There's a word to describe a back-and-forth exchange where the thing that one person says affects what another person says. This feedback loop of communication and learning is what we call language. (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT VOCALIZING) VEDANTAM: Babies make as many as a thousand vocalizations every day. On average, parents respond to about 60% of these babbles. ALBERT: Even just silently responding - if the mom just acknowledges the infant's vocalization with a touch - leans in, smiles and touches the baby - the infant will immediately, within the span of just 10 minutes, start to produce more speech-like vocalizations. So just that nonverbal feedback, that acknowledgement of the baby's vocalization, changes in the moment how they're babbling. VEDANTAM: Rachel says that when babies are babbling, they are more receptive to new information. Parents can take advantage of this by having conversations with their baby. And one rule of being a good conversationalist - stay attentive to what your partner is saying. ALBERT: So parents that are just talking constantly about irrelevant things that aren't what their child's looking at - for example, if a baby is looking at a ball and I'm talking about this cup over here that I'm playing with - well, you're actually providing mismatching communication - mismatching information for them that's going to make it harder to learn. VEDANTAM: Rachel says if you listen closely, babbling often falls into four distinct categories. They have different sounds, and they elicit different responses. (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT COOING) VEDANTAM: The first type is called. . . (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT VOCALIZING) VEDANTAM: . . . QRV ALBERT: QRV is the least mature infant vocalizations. It stands for quasi-resonant vocalization. And so it's those really kind of nasal, creaky ehh (ph) kind of - sounds that a lot of times parents interpret almost as fussing. VEDANTAM: The second type is called. . . (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT VOCALIZING) VEDANTAM: . . . FRV. (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT VOCALIZING) ALBERT: So that's a fully resonant vowel. And around 3 or 4 months, the baby's vocal tract opens up. And then they're able to produce those more open, kind of adult-like sounding vowels that kind of have those ohs or ah quality. And so parents recognize those as more speech-like than those first, creaky nasalized vowels. And so they're more likely to respond to those. VEDANTAM: The third is called. . . (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT VOCALIZING) VEDANTAM: . . . MSFR. (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT VOCALIZING) ALBERT: So that's a marginal syllable. And babies will start, around 6 or so months, throwing consonants into the mix. So you can hear in that sound, there's kind of a D-J kind of juh (ph) sound. (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT VOCALIZING) ALBERT: But it's a slow, drawn-out transition between when the consonant stops and when the vowel begins. VEDANTAM: And the pinnacle. . . (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT VOCALIZING) VEDANTAM: . . . The piece de resistance if you will. . . (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT VOCALIZING) ALBERT: So that's what's called a canonical syllable. And those are those nice ba-bas (ph) and da-das (ph) that parents naturally associate with babbling. And so babies start regularly producing those pretty frequently around 9 months. And parents react very strongly to these canonical syllables. They hear them as the most speech-like. They tend to often interpret them as approximations of words. So, you know, in that example, if a baby was holding a ball. . . (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT VOCALIZING) ALBERT: . . . A mom would be very likely to respond - oh, you - oh, that's a ball. Yeah, you're right. That's a ball. You tried to say ball. That's great. VEDANTAM: To Rachel, these different vocalizations are endlessly fascinating. Now that she knows how to tell apart the QRVs. . . (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT VOCALIZING) VEDANTAM: . . . From the FRVs. . . (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT VOCALIZING) VEDANTAM: . . . And the MSFRs. . . (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT VOCALIZING) VEDANTAM: . . . From the canonical syllables. . . (SOUNDBITE OF INFANT VOCALIZING) VEDANTAM: . . . She simply can't stop herself. ALBERT: On my wedding day, I remember very distinctly - I was in graduate school at the time and knee-deep in coding this all the time, spending hours listening to these different sounds. And I remember being up at the front of the church about to say my vows and hearing some babies out in the audience babble and kind of immediately coding it and going - oh, that was a marginal syllable. And then thinking - no, focus. This is a very important moment. You're supposed to be attending to what your pastor is saying. But I couldn't help but have my attention pulled by the baby in the audience and trying to code what she was saying. (SOUNDBITE OF INFANTS VOCALIZING) VEDANTAM: You don't have to memorize all the jargon to take away something valuable from the research. Just knowing that when babies are babbling, they're ready to learn - that can be a useful takeaway for everyone. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: When we return, we discuss two final elements of baby language. One is going to make you very happy. The other - well, that's something you don't want to hear as you're saying your wedding vows. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) KATRINA DOUDNA: (Screaming) No. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: A warning - if you're driving or listening to this story as you're cooking, you're about to hear something very distracting. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) KATRINA: (Screaming) No. No. VEDANTAM: This is Katrina Doudna of Sunnyvale, Calif. It's dinnertime. She's throwing a tantrum because she wants to sit at the head of the table. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) KATRINA: (Screaming). VEDANTAM: Problem is the table's round. There is no head. NOEMI DOUDNA: When she was in the midst of a tantrum, she'd picked something that she knew was completely unreasonable. (Imitating tantrum) I don't want my feet. Take my feet off. I don't want my feet. I don't want my feet. VEDANTAM: That's Katrina's mom, Noemi. I interviewed her a number of years ago when Katrina was 3. N DOUDNA: I once teased her - which turned out to be a big mistake. But I once said, well, OK - let's go get some scissors and take care of your feet. (Imitating tantrum) No. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MIKE POTEGAL: My curiosity was focused on what are the elements of the tantrums? You know, are the snips and snails and puppy-dog tails or what? VEDANTAM: This is Mike. POTEGAL: It's Mike Potegal. I am currently an associate professor in the Program in Occupational Therapy at University of Minnesota. VEDANTAM: Mike was inspired to study tantrums after witnessing his own daughter's operatic meltdowns. POTEGAL: Among the things that I learned from that was that there was a sequence in which various behaviors appeared, various behaviors of which tantrums are composed. VEDANTAM: Just like Rachel Albert did with babbling, Mike picked out a rhythm in a cacophony of his daughter's tantrums. To prove his point, he teamed up with a colleague. . . JAMES GREEN: James Green. VEDANTAM: He's a psychologist at the University of Connecticut. GREEN: We developed a onesie that toddlers can wear that has a high-quality wireless microphone sewn into it. Parents put this onesie on the child and press a go button on the equipment. VEDANTAM: And then they waited for a meltdown. James and Mike recorded more than a hundred of them. And what they found confirmed their hypothesis. POTEGAL: There are two major - I think of them as emotional behavioral components of tantrums. VEDANTAM: The first is anger. POTEGAL: Hitting, kicking, screaming, throwing things, pushing and pulling. VEDANTAM: And the other component is distress. POTEGAL: Whining, crying, throwing the self down - that is, dropping to the floor - and comfort-seeking. VEDANTAM: Don't confuse these components with stages. Mike says the behaviors occur simultaneously. The distress is more consistent. POTEGAL: Throughout the tantrum, from its beginning to its end. VEDANTAM: The anger punctuates the tantrum. It provides the dramatic spikes, and it also tapers toward the end. POTEGAL: In every case, the anger terminates before the distress. VEDANTAM: Mike says there's a reason that most tantrums end with a distress call. POTEGAL: Because the distress, sadness, tends to elicit comfort-giving. And so it would make sense from an evolutionary perspective if the anger, which is disruptive, is smoothed over by the distress component which then, other things equal, will call for a parent comforting the child. VEDANTAM: Let's go back to Katrina, the child who was throwing a fit because she can't sit at the head of the family's circular dinner table. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) KATRINA: (Screaming) No. No. VEDANTAM: Dad tries to reason with her. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) DAVID DOUDNA: Do you want to sit at? Do you want to sit - do you know what? It doesn't have corner 'cause it's round. It's a circle. KATRINA: (Screaming). VEDANTAM: James Green says that he's fallen into the same trap before. GREEN: When children are at the peak of anger and they're screaming and they're kicking, probably asking questions might prolong that period of anger. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) KATRINA: (Screaming). VEDANTAM: Dad decides to intervene. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) D DOUDNA: I'm going to pick this chair for you. KATRINA: (Screaming) No, no. No. VEDANTAM: Now Katrina is on the floor. She grabs a stool and. . . (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) VEDANTAM: . . . Slams it against the wall. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) KATRINA: (Screaming). VEDANTAM: It seems like things are escalating, but James says it's just the opposite. GREEN: Once she's thrown herself on the floor and thrown something or, in this case, knocked the chair against the wall, we're probably on the down slope of this tantrum. She's spent a lot of energy screaming, yelling and now doing these physical behaviors. VEDANTAM: Listen to Katrina. And pay attention to how the register of her voice changes. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) KATRINA: (Screaming) No. (Sobbing) No. (Screaming) No. VEDANTAM: Mike says, in many cases, parents can safely ignore their child's tantrums. POTEGAL: And this approach has a formal name - planned ignoring. And it basically means turning your back on the child and walking out of the room because talking to them and telling them to stop is giving them attention, albeit negative attention. VEDANTAM: This works best when the child throws a tantrum to get attention or because you've said no to eating cookies at dinner. But if the child throws a tantrum in response to something you asked them to do. . . POTEGAL: A very different approach is appropriate. And the reason for that is that what the tantrum does is basically a stall. It's a way for the child to not comply with the parent request. And so the best approach, if it can be managed, is to get the child to comply with the request. For younger children, this can be done with a hand-over-hand kind of forced cooperation. So you can say to the child, OK, get your PJs on. And if the child refuses, you can say - OK, I'm going to count to three or five or whatever you like. And if you have not begun putting your PJs on I'm going to put my hands on your hands and help you do it. And children really do not like this. VEDANTAM: Because, he says, it's a threat to their autonomy. And if the child still doesn't comply, maybe you can use it as an opportunity to do some research, just like Mike. POTEGAL: We would walk down the street. And I'd see a kid having a tantrum. And I would say - I would mutter or say out loud to my wife, data. And then of course she'd give me a sidelong look about (laughter) what's wrong with you (laughter)? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: We've talked so far about the secret languages of dancing and babbling. We've looked at the grammar of temper tantrums. We're getting close to the end of our story, and that brings us to lullabies. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Laura Cirelli, the first researcher we featured on dancing and synchronization, has also done work on the language of music with infants. CIRELLI: Across cultures, we all engage with music, and we do it at such an early age, so we really wanted to continue to explore this idea that one of the real benefits and perhaps one of the underlying reasons why we invest so much time and energy in music across cultures is because of these social and emotional implications. VEDANTAM: Remember the magic of the clean up song that Laura talked about earlier? She and her fellow researchers wanted to closely examine the effect of music on babies and their caregivers. They asked parents to volunteer to come into the lab with their babies. Thirty mothers said they would do it. CIRELLI: They would be in a soundproof room, and babies would be sat in a little highchair, and moms would sit facing them. VEDANTAM: They were also measuring stress levels. CIRELLI: So we used little stickers on the bottom of the baby's foot and on the mother's fingertips, and we were - what we're able to measure with this is actually their sweat gland activity. VEDANTAM: The mothers then sang two versions of \"Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star. \" One version. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TWINKLE, TWINKLE LITTLE STAR\") UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing) Twinkle, twinkle little star. VEDANTAM: . . . Was upbeat. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TWINKLE, TWINKLE LITTLE STAR\") UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing) How I wonder what you are. VEDANTAM: The other. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TWINKLE, TWINKLE LITTLE STAR\") UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing) Twinkle, twinkle little star. VEDANTAM: . . . Was a lullaby. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TWINKLE, TWINKLE LITTLE STAR\") UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing) How I wonder what you are. CIRELLI: What we found was that when Mom sang in a playful way, the - both Mom and baby's arousal levels stayed stable. But when Mom sang in a soothing way. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TWINKLE, TWINKLE LITTLE STAR\") UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing) Twinkle, twinkle little star. CIRELLI: . . . Both mom and baby's arousal levels decreased as the song progressed. So what this is telling us is that lullabies are really working to calm not only baby but also the mother. And so this supports this idea that there's a function here. VEDANTAM: Is this telling us just what our - is this just confirming what our intuitions are telling us or do you think it's telling us something more than that? CIRELLI: Anecdotally, I'm sure most parents would agree that lullabies soothe their babies. But usually, when we're singing lullabies to our babies, we're holding them and we're rocking them and we're adding all of this really important soothing tactile information. So we wanted to know what the song is doing, removing all of that tactile input. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) CIRELLI: So the babies are sitting in a highchair. They're facing their mom, but they're not experiencing that holding and that rocking that typically comes along with lullabies. But I think the really interesting thing here is we usually think of that unidirectional relationship. Like, when moms sing to babies, it is to change the baby's behavior. But I think it's - the really new, interesting thing here is considering how it's also affecting the mom. VEDANTAM: Indeed, if there's one thing that all this research shows, it's that communicating with babies is not a one-way street. Parents and caregivers are shaped by what babies say and sing and scream, just as babies are hungrily soaking up information from adults. When we think about raising a human, it's natural that most of us think about the role that adults play in shaping their children. What's less clear - but what is abundantly true - is that babies are every bit as involved in raising humans of their own. It's not just a figure of speech. We're all always growing up.

Oil companies played a key role in launching solar technology - yeah, the very oil companies behind the fossil fuels that are rapidly warming our planet. NPR's Andrea Hsu has our story. ANDREA HSU, BYLINE: Let's begin in 1954, before Big Oil got involved, when a telephone company made big news. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR #1: Turning sunlight into electricity, scientists of the Bell Laboratories at Murray Hill, N. J. , demonstrate a solar battery which converts light into power - a small amount, yes, but a big first for science. HSU: The unveiling before reporters featured a tiny Ferris wheel running on solar power. By 1958, the technology was being sent into space. Vanguard 1, the first satellite equipped with a solar-powered transmitter, was launched from Cape Canaveral. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ED HERLIHY: It's one of the most perfect flights ever seen at the missile center. And there's not a hitch along the way. HSU: The success in space got people thinking, why aren't we using this more on land? Think about all the places in the world without electricity. ELLIOT BERMAN: Here's the sun. Here are the people. All you got to do is figure out a way to put the two things together. HSU: This is photochemist Elliot Berman. In 1968, 10 years after the Vanguard launch, he wrote up a plan for something he wanted to research. BERMAN: How to make a solar panel that would be economic for Earth use. HSU: See, making solar cells was really expensive. For the space program, cost was no issue. But for Earth use, Berman knew it would have to be a fraction of what it was then. He wanted to find a material that was cheaper than silicon, which was and still is the standard. When his company declined to fund the research, he went out on his own. BERMAN: And I figured it would take me six months, maybe, to raise this money. It wasn't that much money. HSU: But 18 months later, no luck until one day at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in Manhattan, he pitched his idea to the venture people of Exxon, the oil company known as Esso back then. BERMAN: Who, turned out, were interested. HSU: Now let me bring in Lou Shrier, who worked for Exxon for 25 years. LOUIS SHRIER: It was such an obvious thing, trying to make use of all this sunlight. HSU: Shrier's original job was solving difficult engineering problems, like how to move oil across Alaska. But another problem was looming. U. S. demand for oil was up. A promotional film from the industry spoke of the oil supply as a matter of national security. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR #2: Faced with this responsibility, oil companies must continue to invest in the risky business of searching for oil. HSU: Inside Exxon, Shrier says there was mounting concern about the countries behind OPEC. SHRIER: What if these producers start jacking up the price and our market dries up? What can we do if we can't be in the oil business at all? Chief executives of Exxon Corp. , the parent, as early as 1960, said, we've got to diversify. HSU: So Exxon began looking into all kinds of side businesses - office machinery, information technology and nonconventional energy. That's where Lou Shrier landed. His first interest was biofuels. SHRIER: But then I kind of became enamored of solar energy, hearing some of this vision of people like Elliot Berman and others. And I said, gee, you know, we ought to look at this not just as a research activity, but get into it commercially. HSU: So Elliot Berman, the photochemist, set out to prove that solar could be a commercial success. It was the early '70s, and the world was his playground. How about a solar glove-warmer for skiers? BERMAN: If I could put a solar panel on a backpack and use that to heat the gloves, wouldn't that be wonderful? HSU: Now a bigger idea. Out in the Gulf of Mexico, Exxon's oil platforms had to have foghorns and flashing lights. BERMAN: It was all being powered by batteries. HSU: Solar would be much cheaper, Berman told them. He wanted to build a product right away, so he tried to buy solar cells from a space manufacturer. BERMAN: I gave him a purchase order for $100,000. Remember; I was at Exxon. I could write big checks. HSU: But his check was turned down. What was on offer were the solar cells that weren't good enough for space, and there weren't enough of them. Eventually, Berman's team resorted to making their own. BERMAN: And so this was the product - five silicon wafers. HSU: Made from slightly imperfect silicon, castoffs from the electronics industry. Now, as all this was happening, fears about the U. S. oil supply were deepening. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: From National Public Radio in Washington, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. HSU: Let's go back to 1973. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)HERB HOLMES: The OPEC nations have decided to cut oil production by 5% and continue cutting the oil production. . . HSU: The oil embargo sparked long lines at gas stations, where you could only fill your tank on even or odd days, depending on your license plate. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: I don't know. This is my husband's car, and he only told me it was on even days. My car - I haven't even checked the license plate. HSU: Richard Nixon called on Americans to lower their thermostats through the winter. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RICHARD NIXON: Incidentally, my doctor tells me that in a temperature of 66 to 68 degrees, you're really more healthy than when it's 75 to 78, if that's any comfort. HSU: And four years later, Jimmy Carter delivered this somber news to the nation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JIMMY CARTER: The oil and natural gas that we rely on for 75% of our energy are simply running out. HSU: What wasn't running out was sunlight. And by now, the Exxon-funded Solar Power Corporation had established markets for its solar panels, powering everything from mountaintop telecommunication stations to water pumps in rural villages. And yet, there were questions about what the oil giant was really up to. CHRIS EBERSPACHER: The oil companies were highly suspect in a lot of people's mind. HSU: Chris Eberspacher was a research scientist for Arco Solar, owned by the oil company Atlantic Richfield, a competitor to Exxon starting in the late '70s. EBERSPACHER: Of course, in the '60s, '70s and '80s, there were a number of oil spills. There was clear evidence of environmental spoliation. And so I think oil companies were seen with great skepticism. HSU: And justifiably so, says Eberspacher. But inside Arco, he says the commitment to solar was real. EBERSPACHER: Our clear marching orders were to change the world. HSU: While Exxon had open markets for solar, Arco invested it in making the technology more efficient, more durable. Terry Jester, who joined Arco Solar as a senior in college, says that work proved crucial. TERRY JESTER: That fundamental investment in materials and understanding how these things behave - because now people don't even talk about the reliability of solar panels - they're so reliable. But all that work was done in the early days. HSU: Arco became the biggest solar manufacturer in the world, but solar had yet to turn a profit. Chris Eberspacher recalls how the chairman of the board would defend the spending. It went something like this. EBERSPACHER: All the money that we've spent on solar so far is roughly equivalent to one dry hole. HSU: Exploratory drilling that turned up nothing. EBERSPACHER: And we don't intend to give up. We intend to drill this hole all the way to the bottom. HSU: In the end, the oil companies did give up. The energy crisis of the '70s gave way to an oil surplus in the '80s. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RONALD REAGAN: Large amounts of oil and natural gas lay beneath our land and off our shores untouched. HSU: Ronald Reagan ended Jimmy Carter's solar subsidies, and Lou Shrier concluded it would take at least a decade before Exxon's solar business would be self-sustaining. So Exxon got out of solar. And by the end of the '80s, so had Arco. Left behind was a generation of innovators. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR #3: With SolPad, the power to positively affect humanity is power you can now hold in your hands. HSU: Terry Jester now leads a startup that's launching a home solar system in Puerto Rico this fall. And Chris Eberspacher is working to combine new materials with silicon to make solar panels more efficient than ever before. EBERSPACHER: I'm no fan of oil companies, but I have to be fair when thinking about who did what when. HSU: They were early players, he says, who laid the foundation for solar. EBERSPACHER: They were there. They made a difference. And that difference enabled an industry which is now changing the world. HSU: A world under threat because of fossil fuels. Solar is now cheap - so cheap that last fall, Exxon Mobil signed a 12-year agreement to purchase solar and wind power for its growing operations in West Texas. Soon they'll be using the sun to produce more oil. Andrea Hsu, NPR News.

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  Now this seemed like such a great idea, Audie, except there was writing on the back of the papyrus. Whoops. CORNISH: But wait. As NPR's Merrit Kennedy reports, there's new work showing what's been long concealed. MERRIT KENNEDY, BYLINE: This scroll came from a library near Mount Vesuvius. And it was caught in the famous eruption of that volcano nearly 2,000 years ago, the same eruption that buried the city of Pompei. The scroll doesn't look like much now. It's blackened and in tatters. In fact, it looks kind of like what you'd find at the bottom of your barbecue. But the same processes that charred the scroll also preserved it, according to papyrus scholar Graziano Ranocchia from the Italian National Research Council. GRAZIANO RANOCCHIA: Unless Vesuvius erupted, they would have never survived. KENNEDY: The scroll was discovered and painstakingly unrolled in 1795. To preserve the fragments, the scholars glued them to cardboard. RANOCCHIA: And it has been impossible to detach them from it it since then. KENNEDY: this papyrus is unusual because it has writing on the front and back. It's thought to be a rough draft of a history of the academy founded by the philosopher Plato written by another philosopher, Philodemus. The research team used infrared imaging to finally see some of what's concealed on the back. What they found are bits of text that Philodemus wanted to insert into his book, like quotes from other sources he was considering using in the history. Classicist Kilian Fleischer is putting together a new edition of Philodemus's history using these images. He says their research had an interesting byproduct - it also made it easier to read the front of the scroll. KILIAN FLEISCHER: It was a bit like Columbus went out to find India but ended up in America. KENNEDY: They were also able to identify places where the text was misread before. For example, scholars had previously read the Greek word for charmed, but the new imaging showed it actually said enslaved. Fleischer says that being able to more clearly see the text can bring new, hard facts to ancient history. Merrit Kennedy, NPR News.

It's blackened and in tatters. In fact, it looks kind of like what you'd find at the bottom of your barbecue. But the same processes that charred the scroll also preserved it, according to papyrus scholar Graziano Ranocchia from the Italian National Research Council. GRAZIANO RANOCCHIA: Unless Vesuvius erupted, they would have never survived. KENNEDY: The scroll was discovered and painstakingly unrolled in 1795. To preserve the fragments, the scholars glued them to cardboard. RANOCCHIA: And it has been impossible to detach them from it it since then. KENNEDY: this papyrus is unusual because it has writing on the front and back. It's thought to be a rough draft of a history of the academy founded by the philosopher Plato written by another philosopher, Philodemus. The research team used infrared imaging to finally see some of what's concealed on the back. What they found are bits of text that Philodemus wanted to insert into his book, like quotes from other sources he was considering using in the history. Classicist Kilian Fleischer is putting together a new edition of Philodemus's history using these images. He says their research had an interesting byproduct - it also made it easier to read the front of the scroll. KILIAN FLEISCHER: It was a bit like Columbus went out to find India but ended up in America. KENNEDY: They were also able to identify places where the text was misread before. For example, scholars had previously read the Greek word for charmed, but the new imaging showed it actually said enslaved. Fleischer says that being able to more clearly see the text can bring new, hard facts to ancient history. Merrit Kennedy, NPR News.", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.

That is the challenge facing the whole planet in the fight against climate change. NPR's Dan Charles reports on how Penn State University is doing that. DAN CHARLES, BYLINE: From the top of Beaver Stadium, one of the very biggest stadiums in the entire world, you can see just part of Penn State's vast and beautiful campus. ROB COOPER: You've picked a spectacular day to come visit, didn't you? CHARLES: Rob Cooper is the university's director of engineering and energy. COOPER: We've got 600 major buildings here over 22 million square feet. CHARLES: Parking lots with thousands of cars, a couple of gas burning steam plants for heating. COOPER: We have our own water system, wells. We have our own wastewater plant. CHARLES: Basically, it's a city, with 60,000 people when students are on campus, a lot more when there's a football game. And like most American cities, it runs largely on fossil fuels, releasing hundreds of thousands of tons of greenhouse gases every year from those steam plants, from power stations far away that supply electricity, from the cars that people drive to campus, from aircraft that faculty take to conferences. Penn State has added up all those emissions over the past 20 years, and it makes kind of an amazing graph. Twenty years ago, the line was going up, up, up. The university was growing, more people, more buildings, burning more coal and gas, just like the rest of America. And then you get to 2004, and the line suddenly changes direction. It starts falling like it's rolling down a mountain. And it's been falling ever since, even though the university is still growing. COOPER: Yeah. We've been pretty successful over the last 15 years. CHARLES: I wanted to know how it happened, so I went to see Professor Chris Uhl. CHRIS UHL: I'm in the department of biology and my, I guess, passion is with ecology. CHARLES: In the mid-1990s, Uhl helped organize a small environmental movement on campus. There were students calculating greenhouse emissions from specific buildings, looking at technical alternatives. UHL: When we unveiled these different reports, we would meet on the steps of Old Main, which is, you know, it's, like, this big center of the university. And lots of people showed up. You know, the press was there. CHARLES: They put the university under pressure. And as it happened, these activists had some allies deep inside the university administration - building engineers, maintenance guys - led by a former Navy officer named Ford Stryker, who was in charge of buildings and construction. FORD STRYKER: We've seen a lot of evidence that global warming was a real thing, and, you know, we were concerned about it. CHARLES: Stryker pulled off a classic bureaucratic move. He convinced the university president to declare environmental stewardship an official priority - and the pressure from students probably helped. This gave him leverage inside the administration. He got the university to set up a fund to pay for upgrades that cut greenhouse emissions. STRYKER: It took a while (laughter) to get the budget guys and, you know, the finance guys to agree. But, you know, we're like. . . CHARLES: They had to be convinced that it was money that could be paid back. STRYKER: Oh, yeah, heck, yeah. I mean, we had to demonstrate that we were actually saving money. CHARLES: And this is what turned around that graph of greenhouse emissions - a whole bunch of projects that cut the university's demand for energy. And they typically paid for themselves within 10 years through lower energy bills. Rob Cooper, who worked for Stryker, says some of what they did was really basic, like fine-tuning heating and air conditioning systems. COOPER: And you'd be surprised what you find when you try to tune up a building's HVAC system. It's one of the shortest paybacks. It's consistently three to five years on every building that we go into. CHARLES: In the central heating plant, they switched the fuel from coal to natural gas. They installed new energy-saving motors and windows. This year, the university signed a deal to buy electricity from a new 500-acre solar farm. Here's Andrew Gutberlet, Penn State's manager of engineering services. ANDREW GUTBERLET: Every time we looked at it before, the economics weren't there. We could not get solar power or any renewable energy for less than we were buying it off of the grid until now. CHARLES: Penn State's greenhouse emissions now are down by a third compared to the peak in 2004. In a few years with solar power rolling in, they should be down almost 50%, which seems really hopeful because, in principle, any city could do this. The country could. GUTBERLET: In essence, we are demonstrating that this can be done. CHARLES: Two notes of caution, though. First, Penn State's not a regular city with thousands of homeowners making their own decisions. It owns all the buildings and the heating plants. It can make decisions that take 10 years to pay off. And the second caution is cutting emissions in half is good, but it's not enough, not if you're really trying to stop global warming. So Penn State has a much more ambitious goal - an 80% reduction by 2050. Some people on campus are pushing for 100%. So I ask Shelley McKeague, the person at Penn State who's in charge of measuring those emissions, are you going to make that goal? SHELLEY MCKEAGUE: You're asking me? CHARLES: (Laughter). MCKEAGUE: We need to. I mean, do we have a concrete plan to get there? We do not. And the reality is the country doesn't either. CHARLES: But they are studying lots of possibilities, figuring out how much each one would cost, what it would accomplish. So far, they are on track to reach their goal. Dan Charles, NPR News.

He's the Dutch engineer and environmentalist who's been working on a contraption to clean the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. That's the floating debris field in the Pacific where 1. 8 trillion pieces of plastic have collected. Well, after many, many setbacks, Boyan Slat's Ocean Cleanup project has had some success. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)BOYAN SLAT: All right. So thank you all for joining us. MARTIN: This week, Slat and his team presented a press conference to an online audience and a small group of journalists gathered at the group's headquarters in Rotterdam. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)SLAT: I am very proud to share with you that we're now catching plastics. (APPLAUSE)SLAT: Yes. There's our only two fans in the room. That's great. MARTIN: It is great, but surely not the reaction that Slat expected when he first dreamed up his plan to clean the ocean. Here's Slat explaining his original concept the first time we spoke in 2016. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)SLAT: I envisioned an extremely long network of floating barriers. They're like curtains floating in the ocean. And because it's in a V shape, the plastic gets pushed towards the center. And that's the spot where we can efficiently extract it from the seawater and store it before shipping it to land for recycling. MARTIN: Well, as we know, Slat's idea didn't quite work as planned. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)SLAT: The path of progress wasn't exactly a straight line. And we began to refer to these issues that we had along the way as unscheduled learning opportunities, and we had quite a few. MARTIN: First, as Slat explained at the press conference, his device floated along with the ocean's current at the same speed as the debris it was meant to capture. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)SLAT: Causing the system to actually not collect any plastics. MARTIN: Then, late last year, part of the structure itself fell apart. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)SLAT: Forcing us to tow the system back to port. MARTIN: After six more months of tinkering, the modified prototype was redeployed to the floating garbage patch. And at this week's press briefing, Slat was at long last able to share pictures of what the system has captured - an enormous abandoned fishing net, hardhats, office chairs, plastic forks. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)SLAT: And, you know, car tire - no idea how that ended up there. But if you're missing a wheel, let us know.

Three scientists are going to share the award for their work in understanding how our bodies regulate the use of this vital molecule. Here is the announcement from Stockholm this morning. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)THOMAS PERLMANN: The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institute has today decided to award the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine jointly to William Kaelin, Sir Peter Ratcliffe and Gregg Semenza. GREENE: All right, let's talk about this announcement with NPR science correspondent Richard Harris. Hi, Richard. RICHARD HARRIS, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: I'm all for oxygen. I think we're all in favor of oxygen. (LAUGHTER)HARRIS: I agree. GREENE: Yeah. HARRIS: Two thumbs up for oxygen. GREENE: Yeah, exactly. Well, so first things first, who won here? HARRIS: OK. The prize this year is split three ways. One third goes to William Kaelin, who is a Howard Hughes investigator at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute at Harvard. He was born in 1957 in New York City. A third of it also goes to Gregg Semenza, who is at Johns Hopkins University. He was born in 1956 and is also a native-born New Yorker. And the third third goes to Sir Peter Ratcliffe, who was born in the U. K. and is at Oxford University. And I should mention all three are physicians as well as scientists. GREENE: Who know a thing or two about oxygen. And it sounds like the prize is specifically about how our bodies use it, right? HARRIS: That's right. Obviously, we can't live without it. GREENE: True. HARRIS: But it's also true that too much oxygen can also be harmful. So our bodies have developed mechanisms to make sure that the cells take up just the right amount of oxygen, and this actually can be tricky. Here's Randall Johnson from the University of Cambridge, and he gave this little explanation this morning during the Nobel Prize announcement. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RANDALL JOHNSON: Just as a candle needs the right amount of oxygen to burn cleanly, cells need to adjust their metabolic rates based on how much oxygen they have available to them. HARRIS: So for example, when you go to higher elevation, you've probably noticed that you could struggle for breath when you exert yourself at first. GREENE: Yeah, definitely. HARRIS: Yeah. But gradually, your body adapts, right? And it does that using a mechanism that increases oxygen availability to your cells. Of course, if this oxygen control system goes awry, you can be anemic - low blood oxygen and low iron as well, which is one of the carriers of oxygen in the blood. And likewise, certain cancers are sensitive to oxygen levels, and they play a role in this story as well. GREENE: So much of this stuff sounds like stuff that we've talked about in the past. So what is new? What did these scientists actually discover here? HARRIS: Well, you're right. Absolutely. Researchers have long ago figured out and homed in on how our bodies sense oxygen and how it just - for example, how fast we breathe to help moderate the amount of oxygen we take into our lungs. But this explanation really gets down to what happens at a genetic level. And Gregg Semenza and Peter Ratcliffe were both focused on the genes of a hormone called erythropoietin, or EPO. And it turns out that this gene is turned up or turned down based on the amount of oxygen levels in the body. So Semenza figured out the details of exactly how that mechanism works, which he published back in 1995. It turns out that's more or less what you could call sort of the master switch for regulating oxygen. GREENE: You mentioned cancer playing a role in the story. What exactly is the role of cancer here? HARRIS: Well, William Kaelin is the cancer researcher in this group, and he was studying a condition called von Hippel-Lindau disease, which dramatically increases a person's risk of getting cancer. And as he explored the genetics of this disease, he discovered a particular gene that actually inhibits cancer development in people with this disease. And as it turns out - yes, you guessed it - that gene is also tied into the other oxygen regulating genes. GREENE: All right. Interesting stuff. NPR science correspondent Richard Harris for us this morning. Thanks, Richard. HARRIS: My pleasure. (SOUNDBITE OF KIASMOS' \"SHED\") DAVID GREENE, HOST:   Let's hear it for oxygen - that is the subject of this year's Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Three scientists are going to share the award for their work in understanding how our bodies regulate the use of this vital molecule. Here is the announcement from Stockholm this morning. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) THOMAS PERLMANN: The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institute has today decided to award the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine jointly to William Kaelin, Sir Peter Ratcliffe and Gregg Semenza. GREENE: All right, let's talk about this announcement with NPR science correspondent Richard Harris. Hi, Richard. RICHARD HARRIS, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: I'm all for oxygen. I think we're all in favor of oxygen. (LAUGHTER) HARRIS: I agree. GREENE: Yeah. HARRIS: Two thumbs up for oxygen. GREENE: Yeah, exactly. Well, so first things first, who won here? HARRIS: OK. The prize this year is split three ways. One third goes to William Kaelin, who is a Howard Hughes investigator at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute at Harvard. He was born in 1957 in New York City. A third of it also goes to Gregg Semenza, who is at Johns Hopkins University. He was born in 1956 and is also a native-born New Yorker. And the third third goes to Sir Peter Ratcliffe, who was born in the U. K. and is at Oxford University. And I should mention all three are physicians as well as scientists. GREENE: Who know a thing or two about oxygen. And it sounds like the prize is specifically about how our bodies use it, right? HARRIS: That's right. Obviously, we can't live without it. GREENE: True. HARRIS: But it's also true that too much oxygen can also be harmful. So our bodies have developed mechanisms to make sure that the cells take up just the right amount of oxygen, and this actually can be tricky. Here's Randall Johnson from the University of Cambridge, and he gave this little explanation this morning during the Nobel Prize announcement. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RANDALL JOHNSON: Just as a candle needs the right amount of oxygen to burn cleanly, cells need to adjust their metabolic rates based on how much oxygen they have available to them. HARRIS: So for example, when you go to higher elevation, you've probably noticed that you could struggle for breath when you exert yourself at first. GREENE: Yeah, definitely. HARRIS: Yeah. But gradually, your body adapts, right? And it does that using a mechanism that increases oxygen availability to your cells. Of course, if this oxygen control system goes awry, you can be anemic - low blood oxygen and low iron as well, which is one of the carriers of oxygen in the blood. And likewise, certain cancers are sensitive to oxygen levels, and they play a role in this story as well. GREENE: So much of this stuff sounds like stuff that we've talked about in the past.

NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has this report on how these scientists brought the very big picture into clearer focus. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Scientific discoveries are often described as eureka moments, when the researcher suddenly realizes they've got it right. But for Didier Queloz, his Nobel-winning discovery started with the sinking feeling he'd done something wrong. The year was 1994, and Queloz was a lonely graduate student looking at a distant star. He thought he saw the star wobbling, as if a planet was pulling on it, but it just didn't look right. DIDIER QUELOZ: I panicked because you have to realize, at that time, I felt that I could have messed up completely. BRUMFIEL: Queloz was so convinced he'd done something wrong, he didn't tell us supervisor, Michel Mayor. Instead, he spent months checking the telescope, his computer codes. But it all looked OK. QUELOZ: I think it's a point where, in your head, you realize that it's not anymore your equipment that has a problem, but that's really the star. It's real. And I don't know exactly when it happened, frankly. BRUMFIEL: Queloz eventually told Mayor he'd found a planet around another star. Sara Seager, a planet hunter at MIT, says the research community was shocked by the discovery. SARA SEAGER: They found the most craziest thing ever. They found a planet that's about Jupiter mass, orbiting so close to the star. It's like, many, many times closer to its star than Mercury is to our sun. BRUMFIEL: Seager says a planet this big this close to a star forced researchers to completely change the way they thought about how planets form. SEAGER: Now the thinking is that planets move around. They migrate in the discs that they formed in. So the planet would've formed farther from the star where there is enough material for a giant planet to form. And by interacting with the gas in the disc and maybe with other planets, it migrated in, kind of like a game of billiards. BRUMFIEL: Queloz, now at the University of Cambridge and the University of Geneva, and Mayor, also at Geneva, shared half the prize. The other half went to Jim Peebles at Princeton University. Peebles is a cosmologist, meaning he studies the entire universe. He spent half a century thinking about the origins of everything, and it's in large part because of his work that we now understand stars and planets only make up a tiny portion of what's out there - around 5%. The rest of the universe is composed of two mysterious entities known only as dark matter and dark energy. JIM PEEBLES: The fact that we can't say what dark matter and dark energy is might lead some to ask whether we know what we're talking about at all. BRUMFIEL: He says it's up to others to figure it out. PEEBLES: It's another Nobel Prize coming to someone. Find out. BRUMFIEL: Peebles, though, is going to take a break and have a party. PEEBLES: We will celebrate. We will get together with our two remaining daughters, with their husbands, with all of our grandchildren. We'll celebrate but not tonight.

Joining us to discuss the big picture - the really, really big picture - that is involved in this research is NPR science correspondent Geoff Brumfiel. Hi there, Geoff. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: OK, so who won the prize? BRUMFIEL: Well, half the prize went to James Peebles of Princeton University for his work on the origins and makeup of the entire universe. GREENE: Wow. BRUMFIEL: And then the other half was shared between Michel Mayor of the University of Geneva and Didier Queloz of Geneva University (ph) and Cambridge University for their discovery of the first exoplanet orbiting a sun-like star. GREENE: OK. Well, take us through what we need to know about this research and what it says about our place in the universe (laughter). BRUMFIEL: Yeah. Well, why don't we start small here with a. . . GREENE: OK. Got it. BRUMFIEL: I mean relatively small, with the discovery of this planet. GREENE: OK. (LAUGHTER)BRUMFIEL: So back in 1995, Mayor and Queloz were researchers, and they were looking at a star in the Milky Way called D51 Pegasi. And what they did was they monitored the star, and they were looking for a wobble. So basically, you know, a star like the sun obviously pulls on the Earth, but what you may not think about is the Earth pulls on the sun as well. And so. . . GREENE: The sun actually wobbles? BRUMFIEL: Yeah, it actually wobbles a little bit. . . GREENE: OK. BRUMFIEL: . . . Because of the planets going around it. So they were monitoring the star, and they saw it wobble. There was another planet out there pulling on it. But this was not an Earth-sized planet; this was something more like the size of Jupiter. And it was orbiting really, really close to the star, far closer than anyone thought a Jupiter could exist. So this was the first of many hot Jupiters that scientists have since discovered, and that's really upended our understanding of planetary formation. GREENE: Huh. And so that was half the prize announced today, right? What was the other half? BRUMFIEL: The other half went to James Peebles, and he's cosmologist. This is a scientist who thinks about the very origins of the entire universe and how the universe will end. And of course, you can imagine this can veer pretty quickly into philosophy and sort of rampant speculation. GREENE: I'm sure. BRUMFIEL: That's not what Peebles did. What he did was he looked at a radiation left over from the very beginning of the universe, just after the Big Bang. It's called the cosmic microwave background, and it's sort of like this static - almost like a TV noise, if you have the channel tuned to the wrong station - that's just ubiquitous. But he took that radiation and he studied it, and he did calculations. And actually, by studying it, he was able to determine, together with many other researchers, that the stuff we see around us - planets, stars, things like that - only really make up about 5% of the universe. GREENE: Really? BRUMFIEL: The rest of it is dark matter, which is something that interacts only through gravity, and an even more mysterious thing called dark energy, and this is a force that appears to be pushing the entire universe apart. It's almost like an anti-gravity on very, very large scales. GREENE: Dark energy does not sound like a good thing, necessarily. BRUMFIEL: Not necessarily, but it's there. GREENE: So the Nobel committee gave this award for new perspectives on our place in the universe? What is new? How has the perspective changed? BRUMFIEL: I mean, I think these discoveries very much suggest, first of all, that we're not alone. Today we know there are literally thousands of planets out there; some may host life. But at the same time these discoveries also show we're very special. I mean, a lot of these planets are hot Jupiters that can never have life as we know it. And in terms of, you know, our place in the universe, we make up only 5% of it. So I hope everyone just feels a little more special today as a result of this Nobel Prize. GREENE: Let's feel special.

D. s in the United States are awarded to women, only 12% of patent inventors are female. That's according to the latest statistics from the U. S. Patent Office, and Mercedes Meyer thinks she knows why that is. MERCEDES MEYER: We are being categorized at a young age, and we are being domesticated into a mindset of girls don't do that. Girls don't invent. PFEIFFER: Meyer is a lawyer, not an inventor. But she and some colleagues at the Intellectual Property Owners Association have written a roadmap for changing that statistic. NPR's Joe Palca has been exploring the minds and motivations of scientists and inventors as part of his series Joe's Big Idea. Today, he has this look at two inventors who are role models for what Meyer is trying to accomplish. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Audrey Sherman grew up in St. Paul, Minn. She got drawn into a life of invention when she was in high school. A scientist from the local company 3M came to talk to her class. AUDREY SHERMAN: She said, I cook all day, and I drive a sports car. PALCA: By cook all day, Sherman says the 3M representative meant she spent all day cooking molecules. And driving a sports car meant she was making big bucks doing it. SHERMAN: And that was it. I was, like, I'm doing that (laughter). PALCA: Later that year, a 3M recruiter came to the school looking for students interested in a summer internship. Sherman didn't make it into the official interview list, but she showed up in the library anyway where the recruiter had set up shop. SHERMAN: He saw me sitting there, and he says, oh, I was just ready to leave, but come on up. Years later, he told the story of closing his briefcase and seeing this little girl on the edge of her seat just bouncing and bouncing and bouncing. And he knew he couldn't leave without talking to her. And that was me. PALCA: Sherman and 3M were made for each other. Even before she graduated from college, she went to work there designing new kinds of tape. SHERMAN: Everybody loves tape because it's sticky. And they hate tape because it's sticky. If you've ever gift-wrapped with a cat in the house, you know (laughter). I don't know how cat hair gets in there, but it does every time. PALCA: For some applications, she designed tape that stuck tighter. For others, she made tapes that peeled off easily. And along the way, she started amassing patents. SHERMAN: And it just kept snowballing and snowballing and snowballing until in 2016, I was the first female at the company in over 100 years to have 100 U. S. patents. PALCA: That makes her fifth-most in the company. SHERMAN: I'm going to try to go for number one. PALCA: Another woman who found her way to the top is an inventor is Lisa Seacat DeLuca. She grew up in Helena, Mont. Her first brush with inventing was even earlier than Audrey Sherman's. LISA SEACAT DELUCA: In second grade, our teacher had a challenge where she asked all of us to come up with an invention idea and create a prototype. And I was thinking, OK. What could I invent? And I hated when it would rain because in Montana, it gets really cold rain, and it's really windy. So I invented this umbrella that extended from my head all the way down to the ground. But my prototype was really cute. It was like a plate with a shower curtain taped around it. PALCA: That invention never really took off, but it was a start. Seacat DeLuca left Montana to study computer science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Her work caught the eye of IBM, and she got an internship that led to a job with the company as a software engineer. Inventing hadn't really crossed her mind until she noticed that her supervisor had been awarded a patent. SEACAT DELUCA: I was, like, wow. This person I'm working for is a genius. He's an inventor. And I started walking around all my - you know, getting to know all my colleagues, and everyone had one. So then it became a - you know, that's amazing that this person's an inventor, too. I am going to be an inventor. PALCA: Seacat DeLuca started thinking about the software she was designing and what bits of it were patentable. She now holds more than 500 patents. She says inventing is just a way of solving problems. SEACAT DELUCA: As a young kid, you think about inventors, and you think about a lot of old, dead guys, right (laughter)? You think of these people like Edison that have made what life is what it is today, and it's hard to put yourself in their shoes and think of yourself as growing up to someday be an aspiring inventor. And so when I saw regular people being inventors, it just changed my whole perspective on what it meant to be an inventor. PALCA: Seacat DeLuca doesn't say she's a successful inventor because she's a woman. But she agrees it would be great if there were more women inventors. SEACAT DELUCA: Really, it all comes down to diversity. And the more diverse thought that we bring to the table, the better and the more diverse ideas that we bring as well. PALCA: For her part, Audrey Sherman says acknowledging that there is a problem with too few women inventors will help solve the problem. SHERMAN: Raising the awareness is the first thing. First you say it, then you do it. PALCA: Sherman and Seacat DeLuca both say if companies open the door to becoming an inventor to everyone, women are sure to walk through it. Joe Palca, NPR News.

It's not a journey to Australia or to Europe or to Iowa; it's a journey inside our bodies. Now, Bryson is not a scientist, though he did do one popular science book with a pretty ambitious title. It was called \"A Short History of Nearly Everything. \" His newest book is called \"The Body,\" and it's its own kind of journey. BILL BRYSON: You're starting from the point that most of us don't really understand how we work, how we're put together. And the whole idea is that it just - start at the brain, start at the top of the head, and just find your way through the body. And everywhere you go inside the human body, it is a world of wonder. GREENE: Yeah, Bill Bryson still sounds like a traveler. BRYSON: I was genuinely fascinated by it all. And once you start delving into the body and how it's put together - and what a miracle life is when you think about it. I mean, we have - you know, we're - each of us is made up of 37 trillion cells, and there's nothing in charge. I mean, all of those cells are just - you know, have - are just chaotic activity going on and little chemical signals going from one cell to another. And yet somehow, it's all this random chaotic activity results in a completely, you know, sentient, active, thinking human being. GREENE: Well, it sounds like some of the moments were not laborious. I mean, you had some fun. You talked about going to this museum in Philadelphia that is a repository for the insane things that people have accidentally swallowed (laughter). BRYSON: Well, this - it's one - it's the Modern Museum in Philadelphia. It's a extraordinary small museum. And one of the things they have there is this collection of objects that were kept by a doctor in the early 20th century who specialized in retrieving swallowed objects from - sometimes from saving people's lives. So they're often from people who had died because they choked on these things they swallowed. And it is the most extraordinary collection. You can look at open drawers, glass-covered drawers, and see thousands of objects that he retrieved from the gullets and esophaguses of unfortunate people. And everything from padlocks and opera glasses and just all kinds of things people had swallowed either accidentally or, you know, by bizarre intent. So that's - I mean, that's a very good reason to go to Philadelphia because it's quite an extraordinary collection. GREENE: A toy trumpet was one of them, I remember. BRYSON: Yeah, yeah, yeah. GREENE: You have to wonder why someone would deliberately swallow a toy trumpet (laughter). BRYSON: I'm presuming that's quite a small toy trumpet. GREENE: Yeah. BRYSON: I mean, these are all objects that you could obviously fit in your mouth and swallow. So, I mean, you don't have to imagine the toy trumpet, you know, it's a foot long or anything. GREENE: I want to cover a few of the things that we learned in your book. One of them was exactly how our first president, George Washington, died after he left office. He came down with some sort of awful throat ailment. And then tell us what happened next. BRYSON: Yeah. Well, it wasn't even necessarily all that awful. It was - I mean, he had just been out - he'd retired. You know, he'd won the Revolutionary War and then served two heroic terms as president. And he - all he really wanted to do was just retire to Mount Vernon and have a quiet life. And he was just - only just started enjoying his retirement. And he'd been out surveying the plantation on horseback one day in winter, and it was rainy, and he got very wet. And when he came home, unwisely, he ate dinner in damp clothes, and then as a result of that, he got some kind of a throat infection - really, probably no more than just a bad cold. But then his doctors got hold of him. Because he was a person of such eminence, three doctors were called in. And they all came and looked into him, and what they did was they started bleeding him, which was the standard procedure for people who were unwell at that time, particularly. . . GREENE: Bleeding him out, I mean, just removing blood from his body. BRYSON: They drained initially, you know, like, 40 ounces of blood from him. And then when that didn't make him better, they drained more and more. And in the meantime, they were also doing things - like, they applied a poultice of Spanish fly on his neck, which somehow was believed to draw out bad humors. They gave him emetics to make him vomit, again, to try and just get rid of toxins that were presumed to be making him unwell. And then in the end, they drained about 40% of his blood from him, and of course, this had exactly the opposite effect of making him better; it made him much worse. And he died, poor man died. But essentially, he was killed by his doctors, and that was - you can't say that that was a routine event in the 18th century, but it was pretty common. GREENE: Well, and medical science, I mean, clearly has advanced a great deal over time. But I was just struck by how many things, how many basic things about our bodies that we just don't understand. Yawning is one that stands out to me. (LAUGHTER)GREENE: I mean, we really have no idea what a yawn is and why we do it? BRYSON: Nobody's ever come up with a truly plausible explanation for why we yawn or even an explanation for yawning is infectious. If you see someone yawn, you can almost not resist the urge to yawn yourself. GREENE: Yeah. BRYSON: I think probably lots of your listeners are fighting an urge to yawn right now. GREENE: (Laughter) Right now. I certainly am, yeah. BRYSON: I just - all you have to do is talk about yawning, and everybody wants to yawn. If you see another person yawn, if you see your cat yawn, you yawn. There is no logical explanation for that. And it's hard to think of a way that you could ever test a hypothesis to see what the cause may be. But that's just true of lots of these. We don't understand chronic pain. You know, if you have some pain that just goes on and on and on and makes your life a misery, there's no value in that, and yet, you know, this is a common occurrence for lots and lots of people. I mean, one of the greatest maladies affecting modern humans is that - is backache. Lots and lots of people are off work with chronic backache. There is no reason why you should have to suffer chronic backache or any other kind of really chronic pain, and yet we do. Nobody really understands that. Almost anywhere you look in the body, you will find mystery. GREENE: Do you think about your own body differently now after this project? BRYSON: Yeah (laughter). Yes, I do. I mean, first of all, I really appreciate what my body does for me. I mean, I really do. The fact that there are all of these systems operating - one of the facts that just blew me away when I was - just stumbled upon when I was doing the book, was that we all get cancer a couple of thousand times a year on average, they think. But the thing is, you only - there's only one or two of your cells turn cancerous, and then your immune system identifies those rogue cells and immediately kills them. So it doesn't turn into anything. You don't - it doesn't become tumorous or anything like that. GREENE: We all get cancer, but it doesn't - it rarely become serious. BRYSON: Yeah. So if you get serious cancer, if you get cancer in the conventional sense that, you know, you have to go and have it treated, you've been really, really unlucky. But probably, your body has tens of thousands of times dealt with cancers in your body already. I found that amazing. And in all kinds of ways, your body looks after you. I mean, right now with every breath we take, we're inhaling pathogens and things that could - would do us no good. But your body, you know, is built to identify them and get rid of them. And it's a rare event when we get sick. It's not a typical thing. Occasionally, things get through, but mostly our bodies look after us. And they do it for decades. You know, your heart pumps once a second, day and night, for 70, 80 years. That's quite a feat.

For an upcoming episode, she explored a rainforest canopy with a pioneering scientist who wants to get more young girls up into the trees. MADDIE SOFIA, BYLINE: That scientist is ecologist Nalini Nadkarni. NALINI NADKARNI: OK. That's licorice fern. That is - the scientific name is Polypodium vulgare. SOFIA: She was my guide deep in the woods of Olympic National Forest in Washington state. NADKARNI: This is called Selaginella. This is called - this is a clubmoss. It's actually a very primitive plant. It's actually. . . SOFIA: Nalini has been studying and exploring forests like this for 35 years. NADKARNI: OK. So that is called Dicranum. That's another species of moss. SOFIA: She's kind of a big deal. NADKARNI: I like to call it plushy moss just because it's so soft and so plushy, so much like a little pillow. Here's Hilacomen flendins (ph). This is Racomitrium. There's, like, three, four different species of moss right there. SOFIA: Now, even though we were in the Pacific Northwest, this is a rainforest. NADKARNI: And it's called a temperate rainforest - a rainforest because we get - it's characterized by having a lot of rainfall. There are about 120 inches of rain a year. SOFIA: Wow. All that rain produces an incredible array of plant life. NADKARNI: So see how soft these mosses are? SOFIA: Yes. NADKARNI: Don't you just want to sleep on them? SOFIA: I mean, yeah. NADKARNI: Yeah. SOFIA: But the plant life that Nalini studies. . . NADKARNI: OK. I'm going to come up side by side with you. SOFIA: OK. . . . All of it is about. . . Wow. . . . Sixty feet off the ground. NADKARNI: All right, Maddie. SOFIA: (Laughter) This is awesome. NADKARNI: It's really awesome. SOFIA: Here in the canopy, we're climbing through a dizzying thicket of bright green leaves and moss and ferns, all bathed in sunlight. NADKARNI: All right. Come up with me now, little rope. SOFIA: And the science of this world - it's a relatively new thing. NADKARNI: You know, people have been studying forests for centuries, but it's only been in the last 20, 25, 30 years that people have actually climbed up into the forest canopy to understand the environment up in the treetops. SOFIA: Over the course of those decades, researching canopies in the Pacific Northwest, as well as the forests of Costa Rica, Nalini's documented all kinds of things about the canopy. Sixty feet up this giant maple tree, she shows me one of the cooler ones. NADKARNI: Just looking at the underside of these mosses - like, there's this canopy soil. Let me dig some out over here. SOFIA: Nalini peels back a thick fistful of moss from the branch on the tree. And instead of bark, we're looking at a tightly packed bed of brown dirt. NADKARNI: I mean, that is actual soil that is basically composed of the dead and decomposing mosses that live up here. And there are, like, earthworms that live up here. There are invertebrates. . . SOFIA: So this is, like, soil, like, on the ground but up. NADKARNI: Exactly. It's called - it's a canopy soil. SOFIA: Wow. NADKARNI: Look at that. And it's so weird, you know? You're here smelling the soil smell. But you're, you know - you're up 60 feet above the forest floor. So it's this sort of whole world that the canopy creates. They're living plants. They're mosses. They're ferns. They're soil. And it's all kind of invertebrates that live here, birds that forage for these invertebrates that live in the canopy soil. So it's, like, this microcosm, this mini ecosystem that's going on kind of independent of the forest floor, but at the same time, interacting with the forest as a whole. SOFIA: Of course, today, canopies all over the world face threats from climate change, from logging, fire and deforestation. And a lot of Nalini's work now is about trying to figure out what would happen if we lost such a complex, interconnected ecosystem. NADKARNI: I think it's important for canopies to be as intact as possible because they do foster so much diversity - that you can get 70 species of mosses on a single tree, and each of those mosses is sort of living its life with its insects and invertebrates and supporting birds. And so it's just part of this sort of whole cycle of what makes a primary forest important. SOFIA: Here's another thing Nalini noticed when she was first getting started in canopy research - there were very few women scientists doing this kind of work. And so in the early 2000s, she set out to change that. NADKARNI: Actually, this was just a fabulous day that happened in my lab. I had this forest canopy lab. Undergraduates would work there. My graduate students would work me. And we were just kicking around ideas, like how could we make the forest canopy more meaningful to not just other scientists, but to regular people? Like, how about young girls? They need encouragement. And somebody said, well, what about Barbie? SOFIA: OK. This is kind of a long story, but the short version is this. Because she wasn't busy enough helping to, you know, basically create an entire new field of scientific research, Nalini decided, you know, in her free time that she would try to create, market and get into the hands of little girls and boys everywhere TreeTop Barbie. NADKARNI: What if we took this iconic doll, which is so symbolic of what young girls aspire to - what if we just put this shell around her which is a canopy biologist? SOFIA: So for years, Nalini and her students would buy up old used dolls from Goodwill, make little explorer outfits for them and then she'd sell them, complete with a little handbook of canopy facts. She even showed off TreeTop Barbie in a TED talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)NADKARNI: What we do - my students in my lab and I - is we buy Barbies from Goodwill and Value Village. We dress her in clothes that have been made by seamstresses, and we send her out with a canopy handbook. (APPLAUSE)NADKARNI: And my feeling is - thank you. SOFIA: Preaching the Barbie gospel in front of audiences like this at first made Nalini really nervous. NADKARNI: Like, should I really be spending time with this? And are people going to think it's weird that me as a scientist and me as a woman scientist and me as a brown woman scientist is spending her time doing this? There's sort of a risk that goes along with that. SOFIA: And so for years, the Barbies were Nalini's own little project - until last year when she got an unexpected phone call from National Geographic. NADKARNI: They said, Dr. Nadkarni, we recognize that you have, you know, sort of forged the way with this Barbie science explorer sort of thing. We have partnered with Mattel to make these five explorer Barbies. And would you be the adviser on this? And I said, fantastic. SOFIA: Did you. . . NADKARNI: This is like a dream come true. SOFIA: Did you say it's about stinking time? NADKARNI: I - well, I didn't say stinking time. I said, it's about time. It's so great that you're doing this. SOFIA: So it happened. Now there's a wildlife photojournalist Barbie, astrophysicist Barbie, a whole series of tiny-waisted scientist and explorer dolls. And Nalini says, yeah, she gets it. There are still ways in which Barbie is not the perfect role model. NADKARNI: But the fact that now there are Barbies out here in the world - these explorer Barbies that are being role models for little girls so that they can literally see themselves as a nature photographer or an astrophysicist - and that fills me with joy because it brings me back to when I was an 8-year-old kid all alone up in a tree, saying, I want to somehow help trees, but I don't quite know how. Now these girls have a way to do that, and I think that's splendid. KELLY: That is ecologist Nalini Nadkarni speaking with Maddie Sofia.

I'm Terry Gross. Our guest, journalist Gilbert Gaul, says Americans have chosen to build $3 trillion worth of property in some of the riskiest places on earth - the barrier islands and coastal flood plains of the Atlantic and Gulf Coast. In an era of rising seas and increasingly destructive hurricanes, Gaul says an array of government subsidies encourage homeowners and developers to keep building on vulnerable shorelines, and when disaster strikes, taxpayers end up picking up much of the cost of rebuilding, leaving overdeveloped coastlines and wetlands that are much more vulnerable than ever to the tidal surges and heavy rains that come with modern storms. Gilbert Gaul has reported for The New York Times and The Washington Post, and he's the winner of two Pulitzer Prizes - one at the Pottsville, Pa. , Republican for a series about the decline of a coal company, and another at The Philadelphia Inquirer about regulatory problems with the nation's blood supply. He spoke to FRESH AIR'S Dave Davies about his new book, \"The Geography Of Risk: Epic Storms, Rising Seas, And The Cost Of America's Coasts. \"DAVE DAVIES, BYLINE: Well, Gilbert Gaul, welcome to FRESH AIR. You know, I learned from your book that this practice of building vacation homes by the thousands on these barrier islands is a relatively recent thing in American history. You tell us about a guy in the early 20th century in New Jersey named Morris Shapiro. What'd he do? GILBERT GAUL: So Morris Shapiro was one of the seminal builders of vacation homes, beach houses, along the New Jersey coasts and, really, along the national coasts. He arrives in the United States in 1899 through Ellis Island, and then the family moves to Elizabeth in north Jersey, along port city there. Morris is 18 or 19 years old at the time. A few years later, he starts the largest shoe store in Elizabeth, N. J. , selling galoshes or boots to the port workers in Elizabeth for 99 cents. He makes a fair amount of money. He realizes one day that real estate is a game to be in. One day in August of 1926, he had purchased a new car - a Willys-Knight sedan. He decides to take it out one Sunday morning and take it for a drive. He sees a sign for a place called Long Beach Island, drives over a rickety wooden bridge, which is only about a foot or two above Barnegat Bay. At that time, Long Beach Island had maybe 700 people. He sees someone standing outside a clapboard shack. And he gets out and meets this guy, they start talking. Morris asks him if, by any chance, he knows of any property for sale. Just so happens, the man says, I have 53 acres from ocean to bay. I'll sell them to you for $1,000 an acre. He buys 53 acres for $53,000. I was curious, in 2015, what that would cost today. So I went into the property records in the tax assessor's office and began compiling the information. Turns out, it would cost him about $400 million to buy the property, which is, I think, a 530-fold increase after - just for inflation. So it's a signal for what was to come at the coast. And Morris really becomes one of the seminal builders there of our time. DAVIES: Right. So he subdivides the - it takes him years. . . GAUL: Yes. DAVIES: . . . Before he does this, and he subdivides the properties. And I guess what's distinctive about this is that there were ocean-side resorts for the wealthy. . . GAUL: Right. DAVIES: . . . This was for working people. GAUL: Right. The genius of Morris Shapiro was that instead of building large Victorian hotels or large Victorian houses, he comes to the idea, you know, there is a market for smaller cottages. And he eventually develops this market - I call them blue-collar cottages - because he was focusing on people like teachers, electricians, plumbers, ordinary Americans. And he wanted to develop a market and sell these small cottages to them. And that's exactly what he did. So the initial cottages he built were, you know, maybe 600 square feet at most versus today where, you know, the average size of a so-called cottage at the beach is more like 3,000 square feet. DAVIES: So it takes off. GAUL: Yes. Oh, yes. It - he really begins developing these cottages in the late 1930s and 1940s. The market for second homes at the coast really begins to develop after the war, after World War II - when the economy is booming, Americans have money, they're looking for ways to indulge themself after years of sacrifice. And the market does take off. And Morris Shapiro ends up developing roughly 2,000 cottages on this barrier island that I focus on in New Jersey called Long Beach Island, which today is the largest and richest barrier island in the state. DAVIES: So other developers see this opportunity, they follow suit. There is commercial development that comes with it as well as government investments in highways and other infrastructure. And we got real shore towns now that are real kind of destinations that are - people are really - this thing is really booming now. GAUL: It is, today. So we have $3 trillion worth of property, I estimate, along what I call the near coast, from the Atlantic Coast to the Gulf Coast. DAVIES: So this thing really gets moving. There are a lot of people living at the shore, and these houses are built. And then in 1962, a nasty storm, a nor'easter, comes. What happens? GAUL: The Ash Wednesday Storm of March 1962 is one of two seminal events that defined the mid-Atlantic coast - the other one being Hurricane Sandy or Superstorm Sandy, as other people call it, in 2012. And the '62 storm was not only unusual in terms of the meteorology of the storm. There were five high tides. Water just piled up and piled up over three days. It wrecked the mid-Atlantic Coast, just blew it away. The Shapiros thought - and by that time Morris had died, and it's Jerry and Herb running the business, the sons - and they thought - in fact, Herb told me this several times - they thought they would never sell another cottage, the damage was so destructive. And, in fact, within two months, they were back in business. The business began to boom afterword. They had two record years in a row selling houses. And what that tells you is that storms are a kind of clearing mechanism at the coast - a form of urban renewal at the beaches is the way I describe it in the book - because they clear out older homes, more vulnerable homes. And people come in with money - speculators, realtors and other folks - and they buy up the properties, sometimes for cheap, and then begin to build newer and larger homes. And that's how the coast developed. DAVIES: Right. And I guess what's interesting about that is that one might think if you see a storm coming through and literally destroy anything that was there, you might think - if I build here, that's quite a risk. GAUL: So one of the. . . DAVIES: Why didn't that deter people? GAUL: Yeah, yeah. No. I mean, one of the thing - because there were - really, all the incentives were to - in place - were to build, not to step back and pause. After the '62 storm in New Jersey, Richard J. Hughes - who was the governor at that time - did something that was really interesting. He said, you know, let's pause for six months and think about the coast and think about what we want the coast to look like, given what we've just gone through. And then he said that the damage was so extraordinary that we needed to be a lot more cautious about the way we developed at the coast. He proposed a hundred-foot buffer from the sand dunes backward, where there would be no building. Even the Corps of Engineers thought that was a good idea at the time. And what happened was he sent out his labor and commerce secretary, Raymond Male, to give the message to the beach town mayors and the coastal legislators. And they, of course, hated the idea because all their economic incentives are to build - I mean, if you - if you're the mayor of a town, you don't want to be smaller. You want to be larger. And so even though, at the coast, it's a lot riskier, there are far more risks - they want to build. DAVIES: Right. GAUL: And they did. DAVIES: So this sets up a phenomena that we see. . . GAUL: Yes. DAVIES: . . . In ensuing decades. You now have mayors of coastal towns whose economies are built on the seaside development. And again and again, governors and environmental officials come down and say, wait. Wait. We need to be smarter, we need to plan. We need to restrict. And the mayors say. . . GAUL: No way. They fight it off. And there is a long history in New Jersey, in particular, of this occurring. But it's also occurred in North Carolina. It's occurred in South Carolina. It's occurred in Florida. It's occurred in Texas. I focused on New Jersey because I knew this barrier island really well. And I lived there. And I've been going to it for 57 years. And after the '62 storm, there were several other attempts at the state level to slow development at the coast because it was basically unchecked. And the other important fact here is that the mayors and the councils of these towns control land use. They control what goes where, not the state. And the state said, well, let's slow down a little bit. They proposed several different pieces of legislation that would have limited development somewhat - not entirely by any stretch but somewhat. And each time, the mayors fought back. At one point in 1980, Long Beach Island even hired Burson-Marsteller, which at the time, I think, was the world's largest PR firm and - out there, to help them organize what we would call today a grassroots political organization to beat back attempts to limit development. There was a meeting at St. Francis Center on Long Beach Island where they packed 1,500 people into this place on a day when the temperature was over a hundred degrees, no less. And as you would expect, they just attacked the state officials over and over, and they beat back the attempts to limit development. DAVIES: Gilbert Gaul's book is \"The Geography Of Risk. \" We'll talk more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF WES MONTGOMERY'S \"4 ON 6\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Gilbert Gaul. His new book is about government policies that have promoted sprawling development on our coasts and waterways and how taxpayers assume much of the cost of rebuilding when disasters occur. His new book is called \"The Geography Of Risk: Epic Storms, Rising Seas, And The Cost Of America's Coasts. \"So we have this dynamic where there are, you know, regulators who think, gosh, we need to control this. But there are powerful economic interests, you know, represented by politicians who say, nope. Nope. There's money here. There's property we have to build. Then the other element is, who pays. . . GAUL: Right. DAVIES: . . . When there is a disaster? And going back. . . GAUL: Yeah. DAVIES: . . . To the 1962 storm. . . GAUL: Yeah. DAVIES: . . . John F. Kennedy was in the White House. People said, we need help. What happened? GAUL: They got help. What - again, another thing that I was interested in was this question of risk. How do you apportion risk? How much of it is going to be private? How much is it going to be public? So I went back and traced the history of risk at the coast, if you will. And it really begins in 1950, when legislators passed the first Disaster Relief Act legislation. And that creates a disaster relief fund and that covered not just coast. . . DAVIES: That's Congress - the federal fund. GAUL: That's Congress. And that covered everything - so if you had a wildfire back then or you had an earthquake or whatever, tornado. But it evolves as the modern coast develops as millions and millions of houses get built along the coast. Surprise - what happens? The expectations of the property owners change. And they expect, after storms, that the government will be there to help them. That ends up doing a couple of things, and it ends up giving people incentives to rebuild. It ends up lowering the risk of those property owners, and that's what we see. Kennedy was under pressure after '62 to do something to help the beach towns and the property owners, and they passed what was then a fairly modest disaster relief appropriation of about $25 million. But it's just a signal to what begins to happen. Afterward, we continue to see more and more federal programs to come in after storms. And we begin to see more and more federal programs before storms to build bridges, to build utility - grants for water systems, grants for public buildings, grants for fire engines - everything you could possibly think of. So it's happening both at the front end to incentivize people to build in these places they shouldn't be building, coastal floodplains, and then after the storms, we then pay these towns to rebuild, basically, in harm's way. DAVIES: So you have a circumstance, you know, where there's development on the shore, there are politicians who represent those communities and want help. The federal government has established that they will come in and rebuild, which means that the risk of homing these - of owning these beautiful places, a lot of it goes to taxpayers. And now we have a changing climate. How does that affect things? GAUL: Right. I should add that - this puts this in perspective, I think. In the 1950s, when the modern coast was just being built, the federal government covered 5% of the cost of recovery after hurricanes and coastal storms - nor'easters and things like that. Today, it covers 70% on average of the cost of recovery. And in some cases, it covers 100%. So for example, after Hurricane Sandy, any beach town in New Jersey that was already in the process of widening its beaches - and that would be by the Corps of Engineers and largely the federal government - legislation - or a line was put into the legislation - disaster recovery legislation calling for the Corps of Engineers to pay for 100% of the cost of putting sand in front of multimillion-dollar, oceanfront mansions. DAVIES: Let's just pause on this for a second. GAUL: (Laughter). DAVIES: We're talking about the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. . . GAUL: Yes. DAVIES: . . . You know, these symbols of efficiency and infrastructure. GAUL: (Laughter). DAVIES: And they're dredging sand from. . . GAUL: Yes, from the ocean. DAVIES: . . . The ocean and barging it in. . . GAUL: Yes. DAVIES: . . . And building beaches. GAUL: Yes, the Corps - I mean, this is not all that the Corps does by any stretch. But it is an unusual thing - at least in my opinion that they do - that they have gotten in the business of widening beaches. And what I mean by that is, literally, if a beach is eroding - and that's what barrier islands do. They naturally erode. If it gets bad enough and if they can get a legislator to get them on the list - the approved list for beach projects, the Corps comes in and - with its contractors. And it begins pumping sand onto those beaches. Millions and millions or hundreds of millions of dollars to widen beaches. And the largest benefit by far is - goes to the people who are lucky enough to own these million-dollar and multimillion-dollar houses parked right behind the dunes and then the next two rows of houses right behind them. It does almost nothing to the backsides of barrier islands in terms of benefit. DAVIES: This was amazing to me when I read in your book that the Corps of Engineers have, at least with these kinds of projects, become entrepreneurs of a sort. GAUL: Sure. DAVIES: I mean, you quote one of the guys in the Corps of Engineers saying kind of, you know, rhetorically to coastal towns, if you don't have a federal project, we want to talk to you. We are pulling out all the stops to get funding for you. GAUL: Yeah. DAVIES: They're developing work for theirselves. And that means getting federal money to move sand. . . GAUL: Oh, yeah. DAVIES: . . . To beaches. GAUL: Yeah, yeah. The Corps is by no means agnostic in any of this. They're an active player in all of this. They spend a lot of time holding the hands of the beach town mayors where they work. I've seen it in person. And they spend a fair amount of time going down on trains to Washington to meet with coastal legislators who either want a project or have a project or want more money. That's simply the way it works. Back in - oh, gosh, I don't know - 20 years ago or so, the Corps had this light go on in the office one day where they decided that it was a business, and they needed to act in a more businesslike fashion. And that's literally the way this all works. They have pumped millions and millions of cubic yards of sand up and down the coast. In New Jersey alone, I want to say it's it's 100 million cubic yards of sand. I mean, that's enough to fill up football stadiums a dozen times, to put it in some sort of perspective. It's a ginormous amount of sand. We've spent nationally somewhere in the magnitude of $5 billion widening beaches up and down the coast. In New Jersey, really, it's interesting. We've started so many of these things at the coast. New Jersey is famous for really being the place that invented this piece of business and in helping to get the Corps into the business of beach building for millionaires. DAVIES: So the Corps works with the local politicians. They talk to their representatives in Congress. They find the money. And then private contractors who work for the Corps do all this work. And the projects are in the tens or hundreds of millions. GAUL: Hundreds. DAVIES: Does it help? Does - is it a lasting improvement to these communities? GAUL: No, no. It's a Band-Aid. So pumping sand on the beach helps you in the short term, but the sand doesn't stay. Once upon a time, the engineers - and I like these guys, by the way. I think they're great guys. They're just doing what they're doing. But once upon a time, they used to argue that the sand remained in place, that it - essentially implying that it was a fix. But the reality is that it doesn't. And there are all kinds of reasons to explain why that is. But the reality is that they pump sand, and then if you have a nor'easter and you have winds in New Jersey out of the Northeast, prevailing winds and big waves - that they do exactly what you would think they would do. They wash away the sand. GROSS: We're listening to the interview FRESH AIR's Dave Davies recorded with Gilbert Gaul, author of \"The Geography Of Risk. \" After a break, Gaul will explain the origins of federal flood insurance that has subsidized risky development in coastal areas. And he'll talk about a resort island in the Gulf of Mexico that he says has been a magnet for violent storms. Also, John Powers will review the new HBO series \"Watchmen,\" which is adapted from a comic book series and stars Regina King. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview FRESH AIR's Dave Davies recorded with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Gilbert Gaul. His new book, \"The Geography Of Risk,\" is about the sprawling development of vacation homes and rental properties in coastal areas that are vulnerable to increasingly destructive hurricanes in an age of climate change. Gaul says an array of federal subsidies have encouraged this development, transferring much of the financial risk of seaside living from private investors and homeowners to taxpayers. DAVIES: One of the things you note in the book is that with climate change, with warmer oceans, hurricanes are getting - seem to be getting bigger and more powerful. GAUL: Right. DAVIES: And they're not just wind events. They're - you call them rain bombs. GAUL: Yeah. DAVIES: And in some respects, flooding is a huge part of this. GAUL: It is. It is. We think of the word hurricane, and we think of wind - right? - because they can generate, in the case of a hurricane like Michael in Florida in last year, 155-mile-per-hour winds. So that alone's going to cause monumental damage. But hurricanes are also flood events. And what we've seen in recent years - the science isn't fixed on this, why it occurs, but we've seen a number of very large hurricanes, like Harvey in 2017, Florence in 2018, Imelda just this summer, where they roar up to the coast and stall out. Harvey's a great example because Harvey was, you know, this big blob of a storm. It reaches the Gulf Coast, and it literally just stalls out. It's spinning around at three miles an hour slowly migrating towards Houston. The warmer ocean creates more fuel for that hurricane, water vapor that, you know, in simplest terms, just get sucked up into that vortex. And then it ends up getting dumped on to Houston. And it was biblical - 40 to 60 inches of rain in places where we had built over coastal prairies, tidal creeks, places you never should have developed. But Texas, having no real zoning laws, (laughter) developers built wherever they wanted. And Houston was a growing place. I mean, it was a big place. You had big oil. You had lots of health care. And it just sprawled all over the place. But these places where they shouldn't have built flooded epically. Over 125,000 houses flooded in Harvey. It's estimated that 75,000 of those houses were seriously damaged. They were at ground level. They needed to be elevated. But the costs of elevating those houses would be, my math suggests, at least $15 billion. And that's just one town. This is happening everywhere. These rain bombs are happening on the East Coast. They're happening all across the Gulf Coast. And this is one of the signs of climate change. DAVIES: Another one of the ways that the federal government supports development at the shore is through flood insurance, which is available to homeowners. GAUL: Right. DAVIES: This goes back, I guess, to the '60s, really. And when Lyndon Johnson was going to do this, there was a commission that said, we can do this. You can provide. . . GAUL: Yeah. DAVIES: . . . Federal flood insurance, but you ought to impose some conditions. GAUL: Right. So the short history of flood insurance is that private insurers used to sell flood insurance back in the '20s and '30s. But then, after a series of rain events and flood events, especially the 1927 Mississippi flood, they got out of the business. There was this tortured struggle for decades over should the federal government get involved and sell flood insurance. Lyndon Johnson comes in after Hurricane Betsy in '65 and calls for another study of can the government do this. They come - a guy by the name of Gilbert Fowler White, who is one of the nation's most eminent geographers at the time, is the head of the panel leading this study. They produce a report. And he concluded that, yes, the government could offer a flood insurance program, but it would only work if under a number of conditions. It had to include limitations on new building and flood plains. The premiums had to be high enough that they reflected the actual risk. The government shouldn't offer subsidized flood insurance. And it should be phased in over time. DAVIES: And you don't want to subsidize it because you don't want to distort the market, right? GAUL: You distort the market when you have a subsidy in it, yeah. Yeah. It leads people to do things that ordinarily they wouldn't do if they had to pay for it (laughter). DAVIES: Right. GAUL: Yeah. DAVIES: So what a rational thought. . . GAUL: And so (laughter). . . DAVIES: Rational ideas and wise warnings. What happens when the Congress acts? GAUL: Well, what happens is we of course include subsidies, rather dramatic subsidies, where people are paying, you know, as little as, you know, 20, 30, 40% of the actual risk in their premiums. There really was very little land use. And that goes back to the fact that, again, it's the beach towns that control zoning. DAVIES: Little restrictions on land use. GAUL: Yeah, yeah. And development just accelerates even with - as a result of flood insurance, actually. The premiums are really low. And then we rushed in. Instead of phasing it in by doing maybe a test case or two in a state, which is what Fowler suggested, we introduced it nationally right away. And the other critical point was we brought in flood insurance without building in money for reserves. And that's important because when you have a giant storm like a Katrina, where you had billions and billions of flood claims, there's no money there to cover it because you have no reserves. No private insurer would be allowed to operate this way, but the government does because it uses the U. S. Treasury - federal taxpayers, if you will - as its financial backstop. So in a case like Katrina, the Congress just says, OK, we'll raise the bar and allow the flood insurance program to borrow that money to pay the claims with little or no expectation that that will ever be paid back. So you end up with $40 billion in debt in this flood insurance program. It's a program that was broken from day one and is still broken. DAVIES: Right. And there have been efforts to reform it. GAUL: (Laughter). DAVIES: Has anything changed? GAUL: Not really, not in a major sense. There are still subsidies. There are still properties that flood over and over and over again and are still paying fairly low premiums. In 2012, there was a serious attempt to reform the program that would have introduced higher premiums and shifted the risk back onto property owners in a more rational way. And it - the legislation passed by large numbers in both the House and Senate and was adopted. And as soon as it came into play, people began to see what it would do, and all of a sudden, all hell broke loose. The property owners, the politicians, the mayors all began to object that these rates were going to drive people away from the coast. So then the politicians in Washington, including the backers of the original legislation, withdraw, and we end up passing new legislation that slowed down rate increases and even reversed some of the rate increases. And that's where we stand today. DAVIES: So what kind of coastline has this left us? Where are we? GAUL: Well, as I said earlier, we have $3 trillion worth of property built on the Atlantic and Gulf Coast. Much of it is located on barrier islands, which by definition are eroding and have little if any elevation and are the most vulnerable to hurricanes and to sea level rise. We have built, in addition, along our back bays, our sounds and our estuaries, many of which are prone to flooding increasingly with sea level rise, and we saw that in Hurricane Sandy in 2012 in New Jersey. We have filled them with housing as well, so we've created this dynamic where we have all of this property at risk in an age where those risks are accelerating and increasing. That's not good. DAVIES: Gilbert Gaul's book is \"The Geography Of Risk. \" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF AMANDA GARDIER'S \"FJORD\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Gilbert Gaul. His new book is about government policies that promote sprawling development on our coasts and waterways and how taxpayers assume much of the cost of rebuilding when disasters occur. His new book is \"The Geography Of Risk: Epic Storms, Rising Seas, And The Cost Of America's Coasts. \"Millions of people today live on our, you know, barrier islands and coastal waterways and bays, but a lot of the property that, you know, taxpayers assume the risk for are second homes and vacation homes. GAUL: Yes. DAVIES: Do we have any idea how much? GAUL: Well, I tried to figure that out in the context of the flood insurance program. And I did the math, and I came up with a figure just for flood insurance. The federal government is insuring 1. 3 million beach houses and second homes. It could be higher. It could be as high as one of every three properties that are insured by the federal government. There are certainly millions of people living along the coast, but one of the things that I found and write about is this phenomena where much of the coast is becoming investment property. It's beach houses and second homes. But unlike in the past where people would go and actually live there during the summer months, the owners may be there for two weeks, and then the rest of the time, the place is empty. They don't even rent it out. They're not even trying to run it as a business. It's just an investment property, just like a stock or a bond. And that, in my mind, sort of changes the way I think about not only those houses but the impacts that those investment properties are having on the culture and economics up the coast. DAVIES: You know, as develops - as coastal communities face rising seas and bigger storms, you've - there's the prospect of these big, expensive places being ripped apart and rebuilt. Is there a place that you studied that's an example of this? GAUL: Well, yeah. The place I studied was smaller, but it still illustrates the risk. I have been following a place called Dauphin Island, which is off the coast of Alabama in Mobile. It's a 14. 5-mile-long barrier island shaped like a drumstick. The eastern end of it is a fairly lush maritime forest and reasonably wide. And then the western end of it, facing the Mississippi Sound and the Gulf of Mexico, has no elevation, and yet that's where all the big houses are, and they're all second homes. They're all beach houses. I asked the mayor, well, why did they build there? You know, that's the riskiest possible place. And he said, well, they like the view. The place has been hit by over a dozen hurricanes in the last few decades, including several major hurricanes. After I went there initially in 1998, after a small Category 2 hurricane that wiped out 30 or so of the older houses - literally pitched them across the narrow end of the barrier island like bowling balls into the houses along the Mississippi Sound - the owners then elevated their houses 15 feet in the air. They built new houses up on these stilts and were safe. They were safe until they weren't. So what happened was in 2005, Hurricane Katrina rolls along. We all know it's a big, massive, violent storm. It pushed 19 feet of storm surge over the western end of Dauphin Island. Nineteen feet swept away those houses off of the stilts. I think 400 of the 450 homes there were wrecked. I managed to get on the island a few days after the hurricane, and I was staggered by what I saw. All you see are these empty stilts bent in the sand where the houses used to be sitting up in the air like birdhouses. It just shows you that elevation only gets you so far. DAVIES: And they rebuilt again? GAUL: Of course. Yes. For this book, I spoke with the Realtors and went and visited again and spoke with the mayor again. And yes, it's all rebuilt. And now the construction line for the - original construction line for the houses is a hundred yards offshore, underwater in the Gulf of Mexico (laughter). The houses are just sitting there at the edge. There's no elevation, no sand dunes, nothing. They're just sitting there at the edge of the water and, in some cases, in the water. DAVIES: So up on stilts. GAUL: Up on stilts - but again, taunting nature until the next big hurricane roils up the Gulf. And there will be one. DAVIES: So this might be the kind of place where a rational government policy would say, you can't rebuild here. GAUL: Right. It absolutely would be. But the - Dauphin Island depends on those houses for its tax revenues for the local government. I will tell you, though, that after Katrina, 15 of the homeowners there had the good sense to say, we've had enough. They raised the white flag. And they asked to be bought out. Dauphin Island, the town, filed an application with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has various programs to fund buyouts - they're not very big, but they have them - asking to be bought out to pay for these 15 houses. Two years went by. They finally got a letter back from FEMA. And the letter said, sorry; we don't have enough money. You guys don't qualify. Well, if these homes don't qualify in a place like Dauphin Island, which has been smashed over and over and over again, you know, what's going to happen? DAVIES: Right. GAUL: We simply don't have enough money to buy out all these mistakes we've made at the coasts. DAVIES: So - I mean, this sounds like kind of a mess - an overdeveloped mess. GAUL: It is. DAVIES: What would a more rationally managed coastline look like? What can we do? GAUL: So there's two questions there. A more rational coastline wouldn't look at all like it looks today. It would have far fewer houses. It would have much more open space, whether that would be state or federal parks, something like that - because when you have storms, those are places where the water can go and you can literally live with the water. The water gets stored there during the storm, and then it drains back out. It doesn't do any damage. You only have damage when you develop in coastal floodplains. If there's nothing there, you don't have damage. So that's a no-brainer. There would be less. It would be very different. It would be more public, less private. In terms of what we can do now, what folks call resiliency or sustainability at the coast - and this has become a new big industry - you know, you can keep widening beaches. You can elevate houses. You can elevate roads, things like that. But you're only buying yourself time. In some cases, you might be buying a few decades. In some cases, you may only be buying yourself a few years depending upon the wild card of how much sea level rise accelerates in the future and whether you have the bad luck of getting hit by one of these huge hurricanes. DAVIES: Gilbert Gaul, thanks so much for speaking with us. GAUL: Thank you. GROSS: Gilbert Gaul spoke with FRESH AIR's Dave Davies about his new book \"The Geography Of Risk. \" Coming up, John Powers reviews the new HBO series \"Watchmen,\" adapted from a comic book series, starring Regina King. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF QUADRO NUEVO'S \"TU VUO' FA' L'AMERICANO\") TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Our guest, journalist Gilbert Gaul, says Americans have chosen to build $3 trillion worth of property in some of the riskiest places on earth - the barrier islands and coastal flood plains of the Atlantic and Gulf Coast. In an era of rising seas and increasingly destructive hurricanes, Gaul says an array of government subsidies encourage homeowners and developers to keep building on vulnerable shorelines, and when disaster strikes, taxpayers end up picking up much of the cost of rebuilding, leaving overdeveloped coastlines and wetlands that are much more vulnerable than ever to the tidal surges and heavy rains that come with modern storms. Gilbert Gaul has reported for The New York Times and The Washington Post, and he's the winner of two Pulitzer Prizes - one at the Pottsville, Pa. , Republican for a series about the decline of a coal company, and another at The Philadelphia Inquirer about regulatory problems with the nation's blood supply. He spoke to FRESH AIR'S Dave Davies about his new book, \"The Geography Of Risk: Epic Storms, Rising Seas, And The Cost Of America's Coasts. \" DAVE DAVIES, BYLINE: Well, Gilbert Gaul, welcome to FRESH AIR. You know, I learned from your book that this practice of building vacation homes by the thousands on these barrier islands is a relatively recent thing in American history. You tell us about a guy in the early 20th century in New Jersey named Morris Shapiro. What'd he do? GILBERT GAUL: So Morris Shapiro was one of the seminal builders of vacation homes, beach houses, along the New Jersey coasts and, really, along the national coasts. He arrives in the United States in 1899 through Ellis Island, and then the family moves to Elizabeth in north Jersey, along port city there. Morris is 18 or 19 years old at the time. A few years later, he starts the largest shoe store in Elizabeth, N. J. , selling galoshes or boots to the port workers in Elizabeth for 99 cents. He makes a fair amount of money. He realizes one day that real estate is a game to be in. One day in August of 1926, he had purchased a new car - a Willys-Knight sedan. He decides to take it out one Sunday morning and take it for a drive. He sees a sign for a place called Long Beach Island, drives over a rickety wooden bridge, which is only about a foot or two above Barnegat Bay. At that time, Long Beach Island had maybe 700 people. He sees someone standing outside a clapboard shack. And he gets out and meets this guy, they start talking. Morris asks him if, by any chance, he knows of any property for sale. Just so happens, the man says, I have 53 acres from ocean to bay. I'll sell them to you for $1,000 an acre. He buys 53 acres for $53,000. I was curious, in 2015, what that would cost today. So I went into the property records in the tax assessor's office and began compiling the information. Turns out, it would cost him about $400 million to buy the property, which is, I think, a 530-fold increase after - just for inflation. So it's a signal for what was to come at the coast. And Morris really becomes one of the seminal builders there of our time. DAVIES: Right. So he subdivides the - it takes him years. . . GAUL: Yes. DAVIES: . . . Before he does this, and he subdivides the properties. And I guess what's distinctive about this is that there were ocean-side resorts for the wealthy. . . GAUL: Right. DAVIES: . . . This was for working people. GAUL: Right. The genius of Morris Shapiro was that instead of building large Victorian hotels or large Victorian houses, he comes to the idea, you know, there is a market for smaller cottages. And he eventually develops this market - I call them blue-collar cottages - because he was focusing on people like teachers, electricians, plumbers, ordinary Americans. And he wanted to develop a market and sell these small cottages to them. And that's exactly what he did. So the initial cottages he built were, you know, maybe 600 square feet at most versus today where, you know, the average size of a so-called cottage at the beach is more like 3,000 square feet. DAVIES: So it takes off. GAUL: Yes. Oh, yes. It - he really begins developing these cottages in the late 1930s and 1940s. The market for second homes at the coast really begins to develop after the war, after World War II - when the economy is booming, Americans have money, they're looking for ways to indulge themself after years of sacrifice. And the market does take off. And Morris Shapiro ends up developing roughly 2,000 cottages on this barrier island that I focus on in New Jersey called Long Beach Island, which today is the largest and richest barrier island in the state. DAVIES: So other developers see this opportunity, they follow suit. There is commercial development that comes with it as well as government investments in highways and other infrastructure. And we got real shore towns now that are real kind of destinations that are - people are really - this thing is really booming now. GAUL: It is, today. So we have $3 trillion worth of property, I estimate, along what I call the near coast, from the Atlantic Coast to the Gulf Coast. DAVIES: So this thing really gets moving. There are a lot of people living at the shore, and these houses are built. And then in 1962, a nasty storm, a nor'easter, comes. What happens? GAUL: The Ash Wednesday Storm of March 1962 is one of two seminal events that defined the mid-Atlantic coast - the other one being Hurricane Sandy or Superstorm Sandy, as other people call it, in 2012. And the '62 storm was not only unusual in terms of the meteorology of the storm. There were five high tides. Water just piled up and piled up over three days. It wrecked the mid-Atlantic Coast, just blew it away. The Shapiros thought - and by that time Morris had died, and it's Jerry and Herb running the business, the sons - and they thought - in fact, Herb told me this several times - they thought they would never sell another cottage, the damage was so destructive. And, in fact, within two months, they were back in business. The business began to boom afterword. They had two record years in a row selling houses. And what that tells you is that storms are a kind of clearing mechanism at the coast - a form of urban renewal at the beaches is the way I describe it in the book - because they clear out older homes, more vulnerable homes. And people come in with money - speculators, realtors and other folks - and they buy up the properties, sometimes for cheap, and then begin to build newer and larger homes. And that's how the coast developed. DAVIES: Right. And I guess what's interesting about that is that one might think if you see a storm coming through and literally destroy anything that was there, you might think - if I build here, that's quite a risk. GAUL: So one of the. . . DAVIES: Why didn't that deter people? GAUL: Yeah, yeah. No. I mean, one of the thing - because there were - really, all the incentives were to - in place - were to build, not to step back and pause. After the '62 storm in New Jersey, Richard J. Hughes - who was the governor at that time - did something that was really interesting. He said, you know, let's pause for six months and think about the coast and think about what we want the coast to look like, given what we've just gone through. And then he said that the damage was so extraordinary that we needed to be a lot more cautious about the way we developed at the coast. He proposed a hundred-foot buffer from the sand dunes backward, where there would be no building. Even the Corps of Engineers thought that was a good idea at the time. And what happened was he sent out his labor and commerce secretary, Raymond Male, to give the message to the beach town mayors and the coastal legislators. And they, of course, hated the idea because all their economic incentives are to build - I mean, if you - if you're the mayor of a town, you don't want to be smaller. You want to be larger. And so even though, at the coast, it's a lot riskier, there are far more risks - they want to build. DAVIES: Right. GAUL: And they did. DAVIES: So this sets up a phenomena that we see. . . GAUL: Yes. DAVIES: . . . In ensuing decades. You now have mayors of coastal towns whose economies are built on the seaside development. And again and again, governors and environmental officials come down and say, wait. Wait. We need to be smarter, we need to plan. We need to restrict. And the mayors say. . . GAUL: No way. They fight it off. And there is a long history in New Jersey, in particular, of this occurring. But it's also occurred in North Carolina. It's occurred in South Carolina. It's occurred in Florida. It's occurred in Texas. I focused on New Jersey because I knew this barrier island really well. And I lived there. And I've been going to it for 57 years. And after the '62 storm, there were several other attempts at the state level to slow development at the coast because it was basically unchecked. And the other important fact here is that the mayors and the councils of these towns control land use. They control what goes where, not the state. And the state said, well, let's slow down a little bit. They proposed several different pieces of legislation that would have limited development somewhat - not entirely by any stretch but somewhat. And each time, the mayors fought back. At one point in 1980, Long Beach Island even hired Burson-Marsteller, which at the time, I think, was the world's largest PR firm and - out there, to help them organize what we would call today a grassroots political organization to beat back attempts to limit development. There was a meeting at St. Francis Center on Long Beach Island where they packed 1,500 people into this place on a day when the temperature was over a hundred degrees, no less. And as you would expect, they just attacked the state officials over and over, and they beat back the attempts to limit development. DAVIES: Gilbert Gaul's book is \"The Geography Of Risk. \" We'll talk more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF WES MONTGOMERY'S \"4 ON 6\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Gilbert Gaul. His new book is about government policies that have promoted sprawling development on our coasts and waterways and how taxpayers assume much of the cost of rebuilding when disasters occur. His new book is called \"The Geography Of Risk: Epic Storms, Rising Seas, And The Cost Of America's Coasts. \" So we have this dynamic where there are, you know, regulators who think, gosh, we need to control this. But there are powerful economic interests, you know, represented by politicians who say, nope. Nope. There's money here. There's property we have to build. Then the other element is, who pays. . . GAUL: Right. DAVIES: . . . When there is a disaster? And going back. . . GAUL: Yeah. DAVIES: . . . To the 1962 storm. . . GAUL: Yeah. DAVIES: . . . John F. Kennedy was in the White House. People said, we need help. What happened? GAUL: They got help. What - again, another thing that I was interested in was this question of risk. How do you apportion risk? How much of it is going to be private? How much is it going to be public? So I went back and traced the history of risk at the coast, if you will. And it really begins in 1950, when legislators passed the first Disaster Relief Act legislation. And that creates a disaster relief fund and that covered not just coast. . . DAVIES: That's Congress - the federal fund. GAUL: That's Congress. And that covered everything - so if you had a wildfire back then or you had an earthquake or whatever, tornado. But it evolves as the modern coast develops as millions and millions of houses get built along the coast. Surprise - what happens? The expectations of the property owners change. And they expect, after storms, that the government will be there to help them. That ends up doing a couple of things, and it ends up giving people incentives to rebuild. It ends up lowering the risk of those property owners, and that's what we see. Kennedy was under pressure after '62 to do something to help the beach towns and the property owners, and they passed what was then a fairly modest disaster relief appropriation of about $25 million. But it's just a signal to what begins to happen. Afterward, we continue to see more and more federal programs to come in after storms. And we begin to see more and more federal programs before storms to build bridges, to build utility - grants for water systems, grants for public buildings, grants for fire engines - everything you could possibly think of. So it's happening both at the front end to incentivize people to build in these places they shouldn't be building, coastal floodplains, and then after the storms, we then pay these towns to rebuild, basically, in harm's way. DAVIES: So you have a circumstance, you know, where there's development on the shore, there are politicians who represent those communities and want help. The federal government has established that they will come in and rebuild, which means that the risk of homing these - of owning these beautiful places, a lot of it goes to taxpayers. And now we have a changing climate. How does that affect things? GAUL: Right. I should add that - this puts this in perspective, I think. In the 1950s, when the modern coast was just being built, the federal government covered 5% of the cost of recovery after hurricanes and coastal storms - nor'easters and things like that. Today, it covers 70% on average of the cost of recovery. And in some cases, it covers 100%. So for example, after Hurricane Sandy, any beach town in New Jersey that was already in the process of widening its beaches - and that would be by the Corps of Engineers and largely the federal government - legislation - or a line was put into the legislation - disaster recovery legislation calling for the Corps of Engineers to pay for 100% of the cost of putting sand in front of multimillion-dollar, oceanfront mansions. DAVIES: Let's just pause on this for a second. GAUL: (Laughter). DAVIES: We're talking about the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. . . GAUL: Yes. DAVIES: . . . You know, these symbols of efficiency and infrastructure. GAUL: (Laughter). DAVIES: And they're dredging sand from. . . GAUL: Yes, from the ocean. DAVIES: . . . The ocean and barging it in. . . GAUL: Yes. DAVIES: . . . And building beaches. GAUL: Yes, the Corps - I mean, this is not all that the Corps does by any stretch. But it is an unusual thing - at least in my opinion that they do - that they have gotten in the business of widening beaches. And what I mean by that is, literally, if a beach is eroding - and that's what barrier islands do. They naturally erode. If it gets bad enough and if they can get a legislator to get them on the list - the approved list for beach projects, the Corps comes in and - with its contractors. And it begins pumping sand onto those beaches. Millions and millions or hundreds of millions of dollars to widen beaches. And the largest benefit by far is - goes to the people who are lucky enough to own these million-dollar and multimillion-dollar houses parked right behind the dunes and then the next two rows of houses right behind them. It does almost nothing to the backsides of barrier islands in terms of benefit. DAVIES: This was amazing to me when I read in your book that the Corps of Engineers have, at least with these kinds of projects, become entrepreneurs of a sort. GAUL: Sure. DAVIES: I mean, you quote one of the guys in the Corps of Engineers saying kind of, you know, rhetorically to coastal towns, if you don't have a federal project, we want to talk to you. We are pulling out all the stops to get funding for you. GAUL: Yeah. DAVIES: They're developing work for theirselves. And that means getting federal money to move sand. . . GAUL: Oh, yeah. DAVIES: . . . To beaches. GAUL: Yeah, yeah. The Corps is by no means agnostic in any of this. They're an active player in all of this. They spend a lot of time holding the hands of the beach town mayors where they work. I've seen it in person. And they spend a fair amount of time going down on trains to Washington to meet with coastal legislators who either want a project or have a project or want more money. That's simply the way it works. Back in - oh, gosh, I don't know - 20 years ago or so, the Corps had this light go on in the office one day where they decided that it was a business, and they needed to act in a more businesslike fashion. And that's literally the way this all works. They have pumped millions and millions of cubic yards of sand up and down the coast. In New Jersey alone, I want to say it's it's 100 million cubic yards of sand. I mean, that's enough to fill up football stadiums a dozen times, to put it in some sort of perspective. It's a ginormous amount of sand. We've spent nationally somewhere in the magnitude of $5 billion widening beaches up and down the coast. In New Jersey, really, it's interesting. We've started so many of these things at the coast. New Jersey is famous for really being the place that invented this piece of business and in helping to get the Corps into the business of beach building for millionaires. DAVIES: So the Corps works with the local politicians. They talk to their representatives in Congress. They find the money. And then private contractors who work for the Corps do all this work. And the projects are in the tens or hundreds of millions. GAUL: Hundreds. DAVIES: Does it help? Does - is it a lasting improvement to these communities? GAUL: No, no. It's a Band-Aid. So pumping sand on the beach helps you in the short term, but the sand doesn't stay. Once upon a time, the engineers - and I like these guys, by the way. I think they're great guys. They're just doing what they're doing. But once upon a time, they used to argue that the sand remained in place, that it - essentially implying that it was a fix. But the reality is that it doesn't. And there are all kinds of reasons to explain why that is. But the reality is that they pump sand, and then if you have a nor'easter and you have winds in New Jersey out of the Northeast, prevailing winds and big waves - that they do exactly what you would think they would do. They wash away the sand. GROSS: We're listening to the interview FRESH AIR's Dave Davies recorded with Gilbert Gaul, author of \"The Geography Of Risk. \" After a break, Gaul will explain the origins of federal flood insurance that has subsidized risky development in coastal areas. And he'll talk about a resort island in the Gulf of Mexico that he says has been a magnet for violent storms. Also, John Powers will review the new HBO series \"Watchmen,\" which is adapted from a comic book series and stars Regina King. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview FRESH AIR's Dave Davies recorded with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Gilbert Gaul. His new book, \"The Geography Of Risk,\" is about the sprawling development of vacation homes and rental properties in coastal areas that are vulnerable to increasingly destructive hurricanes in an age of climate change. Gaul says an array of federal subsidies have encouraged this development, transferring much of the financial risk of seaside living from private investors and homeowners to taxpayers. DAVIES: One of the things you note in the book is that with climate change, with warmer oceans, hurricanes are getting - seem to be getting bigger and more powerful. GAUL: Right. DAVIES: And they're not just wind events. They're - you call them rain bombs. GAUL: Yeah. DAVIES: And in some respects, flooding is a huge part of this. GAUL: It is. It is. We think of the word hurricane, and we think of wind - right? - because they can generate, in the case of a hurricane like Michael in Florida in last year, 155-mile-per-hour winds. So that alone's going to cause monumental damage. But hurricanes are also flood events. And what we've seen in recent years - the science isn't fixed on this, why it occurs, but we've seen a number of very large hurricanes, like Harvey in 2017, Florence in 2018, Imelda just this summer, where they roar up to the coast and stall out. Harvey's a great example because Harvey was, you know, this big blob of a storm. It reaches the Gulf Coast, and it literally just stalls out. It's spinning around at three miles an hour slowly migrating towards Houston. The warmer ocean creates more fuel for that hurricane, water vapor that, you know, in simplest terms, just get sucked up into that vortex. And then it ends up getting dumped on to Houston. And it was biblical - 40 to 60 inches of rain in places where we had built over coastal prairies, tidal creeks, places you never should have developed. But Texas, having no real zoning laws, (laughter) developers built wherever they wanted. And Houston was a growing place. I mean, it was a big place. You had big oil. You had lots of health care. And it just sprawled all over the place. But these places where they shouldn't have built flooded epically. Over 125,000 houses flooded in Harvey. It's estimated that 75,000 of those houses were seriously damaged. They were at ground level. They needed to be elevated. But the costs of elevating those houses would be, my math suggests, at least $15 billion. And that's just one town. This is happening everywhere. These rain bombs are happening on the East Coast. They're happening all across the Gulf Coast. And this is one of the signs of climate change. DAVIES: Another one of the ways that the federal government supports development at the shore is through flood insurance, which is available to homeowners. GAUL: Right. DAVIES: This goes back, I guess, to the '60s, really. And when Lyndon Johnson was going to do this, there was a commission that said, we can do this. You can provide. . . GAUL: Yeah. DAVIES: . . . Federal flood insurance, but you ought to impose some conditions. GAUL: Right. So the short history of flood insurance is that private insurers used to sell flood insurance back in the '20s and '30s. But then, after a series of rain events and flood events, especially the 1927 Mississippi flood, they got out of the business. There was this tortured struggle for decades over should the federal government get involved and sell flood insurance. Lyndon Johnson comes in after Hurricane Betsy in '65 and calls for another study of can the government do this. They come - a guy by the name of Gilbert Fowler White, who is one of the nation's most eminent geographers at the time, is the head of the panel leading this study. They produce a report. And he concluded that, yes, the government could offer a flood insurance program, but it would only work if under a number of conditions. It had to include limitations on new building and flood plains. The premiums had to be high enough that they reflected the actual risk. The government shouldn't offer subsidized flood insurance. And it should be phased in over time. DAVIES: And you don't want to subsidize it because you don't want to distort the market, right? GAUL: You distort the market when you have a subsidy in it, yeah. Yeah. It leads people to do things that ordinarily they wouldn't do if they had to pay for it (laughter). DAVIES: Right. GAUL: Yeah. DAVIES: So what a rational thought. . . GAUL: And so (laughter). . . DAVIES: Rational ideas and wise warnings. What happens when the Congress acts? GAUL: Well, what happens is we of course include subsidies, rather dramatic subsidies, where people are paying, you know, as little as, you know, 20, 30, 40% of the actual risk in their premiums. There really was very little land use. And that goes back to the fact that, again, it's the beach towns that control zoning. DAVIES: Little restrictions on land use. GAUL: Yeah, yeah. And development just accelerates even with - as a result of flood insurance, actually. The premiums are really low. And then we rushed in. Instead of phasing it in by doing maybe a test case or two in a state, which is what Fowler suggested, we introduced it nationally right away. And the other critical point was we brought in flood insurance without building in money for reserves. And that's important because when you have a giant storm like a Katrina, where you had billions and billions of flood claims, there's no money there to cover it because you have no reserves. No private insurer would be allowed to operate this way, but the government does because it uses the U. S. Treasury - federal taxpayers, if you will - as its financial backstop. So in a case like Katrina, the Congress just says, OK, we'll raise the bar and allow the flood insurance program to borrow that money to pay the claims with little or no expectation that that will ever be paid back. So you end up with $40 billion in debt in this flood insurance program. It's a program that was broken from day one and is still broken. DAVIES: Right. And there have been efforts to reform it. GAUL: (Laughter). DAVIES: Has anything changed? GAUL: Not really, not in a major sense. There are still subsidies. There are still properties that flood over and over and over again and are still paying fairly low premiums. In 2012, there was a serious attempt to reform the program that would have introduced higher premiums and shifted the risk back onto property owners in a more rational way. And it - the legislation passed by large numbers in both the House and Senate and was adopted. And as soon as it came into play, people began to see what it would do, and all of a sudden, all hell broke loose. The property owners, the politicians, the mayors all began to object that these rates were going to drive people away from the coast. So then the politicians in Washington, including the backers of the original legislation, withdraw, and we end up passing new legislation that slowed down rate increases and even reversed some of the rate increases. And that's where we stand today. DAVIES: So what kind of coastline has this left us? Where are we? GAUL: Well, as I said earlier, we have $3 trillion worth of property built on the Atlantic and Gulf Coast. Much of it is located on barrier islands, which by definition are eroding and have little if any elevation and are the most vulnerable to hurricanes and to sea level rise. We have built, in addition, along our back bays, our sounds and our estuaries, many of which are prone to flooding increasingly with sea level rise, and we saw that in Hurricane Sandy in 2012 in New Jersey. We have filled them with housing as well, so we've created this dynamic where we have all of this property at risk in an age where those risks are accelerating and increasing. That's not good. DAVIES: Gilbert Gaul's book is \"The Geography Of Risk. \" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF AMANDA GARDIER'S \"FJORD\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Gilbert Gaul. His new book is about government policies that promote sprawling development on our coasts and waterways and how taxpayers assume much of the cost of rebuilding when disasters occur. His new book is \"The Geography Of Risk: Epic Storms, Rising Seas, And The Cost Of America's Coasts. \" Millions of people today live on our, you know, barrier islands and coastal waterways and bays, but a lot of the property that, you know, taxpayers assume the risk for are second homes and vacation homes. GAUL: Yes. DAVIES: Do we have any idea how much? GAUL: Well, I tried to figure that out in the context of the flood insurance program. And I did the math, and I came up with a figure just for flood insurance. The federal government is insuring 1. 3 million beach houses and second homes. It could be higher. It could be as high as one of every three properties that are insured by the federal government. There are certainly millions of people living along the coast, but one of the things that I found and write about is this phenomena where much of the coast is becoming investment property. It's beach houses and second homes. But unlike in the past where people would go and actually live there during the summer months, the owners may be there for two weeks, and then the rest of the time, the place is empty. They don't even rent it out. They're not even trying to run it as a business. It's just an investment property, just like a stock or a bond. And that, in my mind, sort of changes the way I think about not only those houses but the impacts that those investment properties are having on the culture and economics up the coast. DAVIES: You know, as develops - as coastal communities face rising seas and bigger storms, you've - there's the prospect of these big, expensive places being ripped apart and rebuilt. Is there a place that you studied that's an example of this? GAUL: Well, yeah. The place I studied was smaller, but it still illustrates the risk. I have been following a place called Dauphin Island, which is off the coast of Alabama in Mobile. It's a 14. 5-mile-long barrier island shaped like a drumstick. The eastern end of it is a fairly lush maritime forest and reasonably wide. And then the western end of it, facing the Mississippi Sound and the Gulf of Mexico, has no elevation, and yet that's where all the big houses are, and they're all second homes. They're all beach houses. I asked the mayor, well, why did they build there? You know, that's the riskiest possible place. And he said, well, they like the view. The place has been hit by over a dozen hurricanes in the last few decades, including several major hurricanes. After I went there initially in 1998, after a small Category 2 hurricane that wiped out 30 or so of the older houses - literally pitched them across the narrow end of the barrier island like bowling balls into the houses along the Mississippi Sound - the owners then elevated their houses 15 feet in the air. They built new houses up on these stilts and were safe. They were safe until they weren't. So what happened was in 2005, Hurricane Katrina rolls along. We all know it's a big, massive, violent storm. It pushed 19 feet of storm surge over the western end of Dauphin Island. Nineteen feet swept away those houses off of the stilts. I think 400 of the 450 homes there were wrecked. I managed to get on the island a few days after the hurricane, and I was staggered by what I saw. All you see are these empty stilts bent in the sand where the houses used to be sitting up in the air like birdhouses. It just shows you that elevation only gets you so far. DAVIES: And they rebuilt again? GAUL: Of course. Yes. For this book, I spoke with the Realtors and went and visited again and spoke with the mayor again. And yes, it's all rebuilt. And now the construction line for the - original construction line for the houses is a hundred yards offshore, underwater in the Gulf of Mexico (laughter). The houses are just sitting there at the edge. There's no elevation, no sand dunes, nothing. They're just sitting there at the edge of the water and, in some cases, in the water. DAVIES: So up on stilts. GAUL: Up on stilts - but again, taunting nature until the next big hurricane roils up the Gulf. And there will be one. DAVIES: So this might be the kind of place where a rational government policy would say, you can't rebuild here. GAUL: Right. It absolutely would be. But the - Dauphin Island depends on those houses for its tax revenues for the local government. I will tell you, though, that after Katrina, 15 of the homeowners there had the good sense to say, we've had enough. They raised the white flag. And they asked to be bought out. Dauphin Island, the town, filed an application with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has various programs to fund buyouts - they're not very big, but they have them - asking to be bought out to pay for these 15 houses. Two years went by. They finally got a letter back from FEMA. And the letter said, sorry; we don't have enough money. You guys don't qualify. Well, if these homes don't qualify in a place like Dauphin Island, which has been smashed over and over and over again, you know, what's going to happen? DAVIES: Right. GAUL: We simply don't have enough money to buy out all these mistakes we've made at the coasts. DAVIES: So - I mean, this sounds like kind of a mess - an overdeveloped mess. GAUL: It is. DAVIES: What would a more rationally managed coastline look like? What can we do? GAUL: So there's two questions there. A more rational coastline wouldn't look at all like it looks today. It would have far fewer houses. It would have much more open space, whether that would be state or federal parks, something like that - because when you have storms, those are places where the water can go and you can literally live with the water. The water gets stored there during the storm, and then it drains back out. It doesn't do any damage. You only have damage when you develop in coastal floodplains. If there's nothing there, you don't have damage. So that's a no-brainer. There would be less. It would be very different. It would be more public, less private. In terms of what we can do now, what folks call resiliency or sustainability at the coast - and this has become a new big industry - you know, you can keep widening beaches. You can elevate houses. You can elevate roads, things like that. But you're only buying yourself time. In some cases, you might be buying a few decades. In some cases, you may only be buying yourself a few years depending upon the wild card of how much sea level rise accelerates in the future and whether you have the bad luck of getting hit by one of these huge hurricanes. DAVIES: Gilbert Gaul, thanks so much for speaking with us. GAUL: Thank you.

But on Thursday, Californians got access to an early warning system that could allow a heads-up of up to 20 seconds - just enough time to stop, drop and take cover. The early warning alert is available through an app called MyShake, developed in part by Richard Allen, the director of the Berkeley Seismological Lab. He joins us now from the UC Berkeley campus. Welcome. RICHARD ALLEN: Great to be with you, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: First things first, did the app alert users to that Compton quake? ALLEN: So no. So that earthquake, as you said, was only a magnitude 3 1/2 earthquake. And so we only send out alerts when the earthquakes are greater than a magnitude 4. 5. And then we only send out the alert to regions expected to see shaking intensity three, which means most people feel a bit of a jolt. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And how does it work? What does it use to sense an incoming quake? And then what does it do? ALLEN: So what underlines the system is a system called ShakeAlert. ShakeAlert is a system that has a - traditional seismic sensors across all of California. It detects the earthquake when it's underway. And then with very rapid algorithms, we analyze that data. And we determine the area that is likely to experience shaking. And so that's what creates the kernel of an alert. And then once we have that, the MyShake system takes it. It identifies the phones that are in - within a region that are going to feel shaking. And it pushes the alert out to those phones. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Is there hope of increasing the time of the warning period to, say, minutes, hours, days? Is that something that you foresee might be something that science would be able to do? ALLEN: So it's real important to understand that earthquake early warning is about rapidly detecting an earthquake that's underway and then pushing out an alert ahead of the shaking. So that gives us the limitation on the time - how much time is there between when an earthquake starts and when people might feel the shaking? Our best estimates are that we can provide a few seconds to a few tens of seconds of warning with both the technology and the science we have at our disposal today. Now, in the really big earthquakes, that time can actually be a few minutes. And so, of course, the research continues. The development continues. And we can see whether we can increase that for more than just a few seconds to a few tens of seconds. We'll have to see. But what we cannot do is go beyond those minutes. So when we talk about a few days, now we're talking about prediction. We're talking about predicting when the earthquake's going to start. That's a completely different problem. We don't know how to solve that problem. And so I think most seismologists would agree that's unlikely in the foreseeable future. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And obviously, California is not the only place in the world that suffers earthquakes. Is this technology available elsewhere in the world? Could it be used anywhere else in the world? ALLEN: So there are just a few places that have early warning today. It's - Mexico, Japan and now California are the big ones. And the challenge there is that they have to have these traditional seismic networks that are expensive to run. And so that's one of the research pieces here with the MyShake app - is that, in fact, in every smartphone, there's an accelerometer, a sensor that can detect earthquakes. And so what we're doing is we're exploring the ability to also detect the earthquakes with smartphones. And if we can do that, then we could do earthquake early warning wherever there are smartphones. And there are basically smartphones wherever there are people. So the ultimate goal here is to actually be able to deliver earthquake early warning around the globe. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And I assume you have the app on your phone? ALLEN: Of course. I've had the app on my phone for quite some time. I've been very fortunate to be getting alerts for quite a few months at this point. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Richard Allen is the director of the Berkeley Seismological Lab and helped develop a new earthquake early warning app. Thank you very much. ALLEN: Great to be with you, Lulu. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:  The LA area shook early Friday, thanks to a magnitude 3. 5 earthquake centered near Compton. But on Thursday, Californians got access to an early warning system that could allow a heads-up of up to 20 seconds - just enough time to stop, drop and take cover. The early warning alert is available through an app called MyShake, developed in part by Richard Allen, the director of the Berkeley Seismological Lab. He joins us now from the UC Berkeley campus. Welcome. RICHARD ALLEN: Great to be with you, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: First things first, did the app alert users to that Compton quake? ALLEN: So no. So that earthquake, as you said, was only a magnitude 3 1/2 earthquake. And so we only send out alerts when the earthquakes are greater than a magnitude 4. 5. And then we only send out the alert to regions expected to see shaking intensity three, which means most people feel a bit of a jolt. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And how does it work? What does it use to sense an incoming quake? And then what does it do? ALLEN: So what underlines the system is a system called ShakeAlert. ShakeAlert is a system that has a - traditional seismic sensors across all of California. It detects the earthquake when it's underway. And then with very rapid algorithms, we analyze that data. And we determine the area that is likely to experience shaking. And so that's what creates the kernel of an alert. And then once we have that, the MyShake system takes it. It identifies the phones that are in - within a region that are going to feel shaking. And it pushes the alert out to those phones. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Is there hope of increasing the time of the warning period to, say, minutes, hours, days? Is that something that you foresee might be something that science would be able to do?

CubeSats are really small. They're just about twice as big as a Rubik's Cube, but electronics are getting ever more mini, and it's possible to pack a sophisticated mission into a tiny satellite. NPR's Joe Palca has more. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Aerospace giants use spiffy advertising to attract top engineering talent. With CubeSats, it was different - at least at the start. HANNAH GOLDBERG: I saw a flyer on a bus stop that said, want to build a satellite? PALCA: Hannah Goldberg saw that flyer when she was an undergraduate engineering major in 1999. Now she works at GomSpace, a Danish satellite company making CubeSats for the European Space Agency. GOLDBERG: In the beginning, the early days of CubeSats, they kind of had a bad reputation. People didn't think you could do much science or much engineering benefit with them. PALCA: CubeSats are basically a box with fixed dimensions. You can put anything you like inside. And since they were initially intended for students learning the principles of aerospace engineering, no big deal if they broke after a few months in space. But Goldberg says with the advent of smartphones, engineers started getting really good at packing a bunch of electronics into a small space. CubeSats started getting more sophisticated, and scientists started to take notice. Barbara Cohen is a planetary scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. She says, at first, scientists were cautious about a CubeSat mission. BARBARA COHEN: We want to get science out of it. We don't want it to be throwing something into space for the sake of in three months becoming space debris. PALCA: Now she thinks CubeSats are ready for prime time. COHEN: It's a miniature spacecraft. That's actually the way we think about it. PALCA: Cohen is working on a mission called Lunar Flashlight. It's actually made up of six CubeSats joined together, about as big as a family-sized cereal box. COHEN: Lunar Flashlight is designed to look for exposed water frost in the permanently shadowed regions of the moon. PALCA: The spacecraft will shine a laser into those regions' deep craters at the moon's south pole. One of the reasons CubeSats can be so small and light is they can hitch a ride on other missions' rockets. But Cohen says for the moon or some other spot outside Earth orbit, you still need to be able to change course. COHEN: And about one-third of our satellite is dedicated to our propulsion system. PALCA: Lunar Flashlight uses fairly standard thrusters to change course, but Tiffany Russell Lockett says there are a lot of ways to propel yourself through space. TIFFANY RUSSELL LOCKETT: We are using a solar sail as our primary propulsion system. PALCA: Lockett is an engineer at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. LOCKETT: A solar sail is a large, thin film, reflective surface. Think of, like, a sailboat or a large kite. But instead of using wind to propel itself, it uses sunlight. PALCA: The sail is folded up for launch and unfurls once in space. Lockett's CubeSat is headed for an asteroid. Once it gets there. . . LOCKETT: We take pictures. PALCA: One reason scientists like CubeSat missions is they're relatively cheap, so you can have them all to yourself. Evgenya Shkolnik is an astronomer at Arizona State University. For now, she's using the Hubble Space Telescope to study stars that might have planets around them. EVGENYA SHKOLNIK: Hubble is shared by hundreds of people every year. And even though our team has a large - what's considered a large program on Hubble, it's still only about a week of time. PALCA: That's why Shkolnik is working on a CubeSat.

Well, they used to be government scientists. We'll get to that in just a moment with Chris Frey of North Carolina State University. Dr. Frey, thanks so much for being with us. CHRIS FREY: No. Thank you, Scott. SIMON: Research out of Carnegie Mellon points to a rise in particulates in the air from 2016 to 2018. What are the particular dangers of particulates? FREY: Oh, there are many, and it depends on the size of the particles. The ones that the Carnegie Mellon study is focusing on are what we call fine particles or PM 2. 5. And these are particles that when you breathe them, they can get deep into your lungs, and they can even get to the alveoli, which are the air sacs that exchange oxygen from the air you breathe into your blood. And so these particles can cause a range of effects from respiratory illness and cardiovascular illness to premature death. SIMON: Why the rise in particulates in the air? FREY: One thing that we're seeing in some of the work that I and colleagues have been doing recently is that, you know, there's evidence that there's increased drought in some parts of the country that is leading, for example, to more so-called wildfires. And, you know, we're seeing wildfires right now in multiple parts of California. Those wildfires - I said so-called. . . SIMON: Yeah. FREY: . . . Because they're partly a result of human activity, you know, if a transformer makes a spark in a dry area and it ignites a fire. And then the burn of the fire - how much land is burned depends on things like land use practices. So that seems to be increasing quite a bit. So the contribution of wildfires is probably one of the leading reasons why we're seeing an increase despite the decreases in particles from other sources like power plants and cars. SIMON: I referred to people who used to be government scientists in introducing you, and I was alluding to the fact that you were part of a group of scientists who were advising the government on particulate matter. And what happened? FREY: Yeah, a lot of things happened (laughter). But, hopefully, the short version of the story is in 2018 - October 10, 2018, by press release, we learned that current EPA administrator Wheeler had disbanded our panel in the middle of a review cycle. And we were given no reason why. And shortly after we disbanded, about 20 of us decided, well, we agreed to provide public service and to advise the agency and the public on the health effects of particulate matter, and just because we're separated from EPA doesn't mean we can't keep doing that. SIMON: So you and your colleagues have continued to do this work on your own in the public interest. FREY: Yes. That's right. SIMON: What should be done? FREY: So to reduce the particulate matter is a pretty complicated thing because there are emission controls that can be used for large - what we call - stationary sources like power plants and industrial boilers to capture particles. But there are also gases that are emitted, and, in the atmosphere, they become particles. So sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, organic compounds - some of it goes back to things like refineries and, you know, industries that use solvents. And it touches on so many different industries and sectors of the economy that, in a sense, everybody can kind of make a contribution to reducing. And then the other thing is there's a growing share of what we refer to as wildfires, but, you know, they're not necessarily truly wild in their origin or how they burn.

But in real life, there are scientists who study vampires - vampire bats, that is. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports on a new study that reveals the warm, fuzzy side of these bloodthirsty little beasts. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: A common vampire bat doesn't actually suck blood; it uses its teeth to make a small cut on, say, a cow. Then it laps at the wound, drinking about a tablespoon of blood. GERRY CARTER: They need to do this basically every night. So if they miss two nights, they're very weak. If they miss three nights, they will probably die. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Gerry Carter is a researcher at The Ohio State University. He says a desperately hungry bat isn't hopeless because back at the hollow tree or wherever it lives, it can find fellow bats who are willing to regurgitate a bit of their last bloody meal so that the other can eat. CARTER: The females all do this for their offspring, but they also do it for adults, including unrelated adults. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And adult bats that share food with each other develop bonds. Carter has studied this in common vampire bats that he captured in Panama and kept in the lab. CARTER: We can just take a bat, deprive it of food for a while, put it back and then see who is willing to share food with it. And we can just do this repeatedly over time. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Certain pairs of bats were more likely to share food back and forth. They became buddies. Carter watched these relationships strengthen over time in about two dozen female bats that he kept for nearly two years. Just before these bats were released back into the wild, the researchers glued on tiny sensors. For over a week, the sensors checked each bat's proximity to all the other tagged bats every two seconds.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. We begin today with a story of an economic bubble, or, to be more precise, a mania. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Foreign language spoken). VEDANTAM: This mania took place in Amsterdam in the 1630s. Picture a city of canals, elegant townhouses and a populace obsessed with one thing. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Foreign language spoken). VEDANTAM: . . . Tulips. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Foreign language spoken). ROBERT SHILLER: Amsterdam was the site of a big flowers market; it still is. People would trade tulips. And there were some tulips that were especially beautiful, they thought. And so people wanted those, and the price started going up. VEDANTAM: This is economist Robert Shiller. And when he says prices started going up, what he means is they started going up a lot. SHILLER: People were getting rich trading in tulips. One tulip would be the same value as a whole house. VEDANTAM: One tulip could hold as much value as a house. Now, historians say they've only found a few examples of this, but even more modestly priced tulips could sell for what would today be thousands of dollars. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Foreign language spoken). VEDANTAM: From a distance of nearly 400 years, the Dutch tulip mania of the 1630s might seem absurd, but the flowers were a way for the residents of Amsterdam to convey that they were cultured and influential. The tulips had great symbolic value. They told an amazing story. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This week on HIDDEN BRAIN - the powerful way in which stories and psychology shape our economic lives, how narratives affect not just the purchases we make as individuals but the fate of our entire economic system. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Most people think of the economy as following a set of fairly scientific principles. I buy more if things are cheap. I buy less if they're expensive. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: The nation's gross domestic product, or GDP, grew at a stronger than expected rate of 2 1/2%. VEDANTAM: Or say I run a company. I hire people if it looks like the economy is growing. I cut back if it looks like things are going to tank. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Delayed hiring, 4% accelerated hiring. You can see there mostly just going down. VEDANTAM: If I run the Federal Reserve, economic indicators tell me whether to raise or lower interest rates. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)AILSA CHANG: The central bank is cutting interest rates for the third time since July. VEDANTAM: It all looks very rational, very mathematical. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: But this picture neglects a fundamental aspect of economic life. We live in a world of stories. The stories that we tell in news reports, around the water cooler, in conversations with friends and family, these stories profoundly shape the trajectory of the economy. Economist Robert Shiller's new book explores this idea. It's called \"Narrative Economics. \" The winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize in economics, Robert Shiller says his interest in the relationship between stories and the economy goes all the way back to his early college days. He was an economics major, but he took a history course that examined the Great Depression. He was struck by the disconnect between the economic ideas he was learning about and the stories he read about how people behaved in the real world. SHILLER: People didn't sound like the people described in my economic theory. They seemed to be faddish and vulnerable to crazes and new ideas, and then they'd drop them and forget them. It just seemed like there was a note of reality that has been lost when we separate out departments. A history department has something to offer; so does the psych and sociology department, et cetera. But we tend to be - in academia, we tend to be polarized or more than polarized. We tend to compartmentalize. And I've, all my life ever since, thought that I wanted to read what these other people were saying as well as what my economist people are saying. VEDANTAM: Because, of course, they're all just different ways to understand the human condition, right? I mean, psychologists and anthropologists and sociologists and economists, I mean, they're all basically trying to understand why people do what they do. They're just using different tools. SHILLER: And political scientists. VEDANTAM: Yeah, yeah. SHILLER: Yeah. So we need all these perspectives. Don't be too compartmentalized. It may carry you for a while, but if you don't know what's happening in other realms of thought, you might miss the big picture. VEDANTAM: Robert says these realms of thought can help us decode things that otherwise seem puzzling about the economy. Take for example the story of a paper written by a mysterious mathematician in 2008. The author went by a pseudonym. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Satoshi Nakamoto. VEDANTAM: Satoshi Nakamoto. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Who is Satoshi Nakamoto? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Satoshi Nakamoto is a fake name for somebody. NEHA NARULA: He's a myth. I mean, he doesn't - no one knows who he is. Some people have claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, but we have not seen any definitive proof. ANDY COURT: When you ask about the creator - who created this? Who invented this? They must be a real genius. Everyone's like, we have no idea. VEDANTAM: The reason Satoshi Nakamoto created such a stir - this person, whose identity is still unknown, came up with a new type of currency - bitcoin. SHILLER: The first successful cryptocurrency. The story was that Nakamoto was able to invent a currency that could function without the help of any government, even against the opposition of any government. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Bitcoin emerged as the digital currency that in theory could not be manipulated by a central authority. SHILLER: And it would be smart, young, cosmopolitan people all over the world who would secure this decentralized system. It's a wonderful story and especially wonderful since nobody could figure out who Satoshi Nakamoto really was. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). SHILLER: He never - can't be found. No one has met him. How did he do that? That's an amazing story. VEDANTAM: Robert makes the case that bitcoin spread because it was a tale with surprise and intrigue. A genius mathematician invents a cryptocurrency and becomes a billionaire. It sounds like the plot of a movie. If I was making that movie, one subplot I would include is the story of the singer Lily Allen. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THE FEAR\")LILY ALLEN: (Singing) I want to be rich and I want lots of money. I don't care about clever. I don't care about funny. VEDANTAM: Lily Allen received an offer to get paid for a performance in bitcoin. SHILLER: She turned it down. That was the most momentous error you can imagine because she would be a billionaire if she had taken that bitcoin. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) And, you know, you hear the story and even if you don't know anything about cryptocurrencies, you ask yourself, am I missing out by not getting in on this? I mean, the story induces FOMO. SHILLER: That's exactly right, and that's a strong emotion, fear. It's regret theory. People are fearful of being regretful that they miss something. It hurts. You don't want to look forward to that pain in the future, so you might as well try. That's the thinking. VEDANTAM: What's astonishing is that the craze over bitcoin spread even though very few people actually understand what a cryptocurrency is or understand its underlying blockchain technology. But these terms very quickly became buzzwords. Here's comedian John Oliver on \"Last Week Tonight. \"(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LAST WEEK TONIGHT WITH JOHN OLIVER\")JOHN OLIVER: The problem is there is now enough excitement around the very word blockchain that it's become a magnet for investment. Reuters found that the existing companies that merely added the word blockchain to their name saw their stock price on average increase more than threefold. And one of them was particularly dumb. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Long Island Iced Tea renamed themselves Long Blockchain. And guess what happened. Yeah, their stock tripled. VEDANTAM: Robert, so you write at one point that the total value of bitcoin exceeded $300 billion, but bitcoin has no value unless people think it has value. So something that existed purely in people's heads went from being worth $0 to $300 billion? SHILLER: Yes, it can easily happen if the viral effect is strong enough. Now, bitcoin enthusiasts will say, well, what about gold? Gold has no real value. It's just a shiny metal that's pretty to look at. And yet it has tremendous value, and it has for thousands of years. But I have to say there are some differences. Gold is scarce - inherently scarce. Anybody can start a new cryptocurrency. Gold is in the Bible. It's mentioned over 300 times in the Holy Bible. VEDANTAM: You know, I was thinking about this as I was reading the book. You know, when I think about real money, obviously, real money, you know, has on many occasions bought me real things. But at some level, doesn't real money function a little bit like bitcoin in that it requires you and I to both agree that the notes that I have in my wallet have real value, that in some ways we both agree on the story of what the notes mean and the story is what gives the notes their power? SHILLER: That's right. That's - you've spoken just perfectly about narrative economics. I'll give you another example - banks. Why don't banks fail? All it takes is a story. If someone says the bank is going to be bankrupt soon, everybody will rush in and try to take their money out. And the banks can't - they don't have it on hand. They can't pay it out. So that's another example of how, yes, our whole banking system is built on a narrative. VEDANTAM: Yeah. Because at any given point, the bank might have enough money cash on hand to basically pay out, you know, five or 10% of what its total assets are. It's investing the rest of the money in other projects. So if everyone asks for their money back at the same time, the bank would simply not be able to deliver. SHILLER: And it happens, and it's supported by visual imagery. Photographers go to the bank, and they take a photograph of the big crowd clamoring to get in to get their money out. This has happened so many times that the FDIC - Federal Deposit Insurance Company - has a gallery of photos in one of their residences. And so it's become a narrative in itself that we have to watch out for that it doesn't come back. It's a perennial narrative. VEDANTAM: So bitcoin was not just a mysterious new scheme. It tapped into many deep and ancient narratives about ordinary people and elites, about anarchy, about populism. Talk to me about those larger themes that it tapped into. SHILLER: Well, there was a movement that began in the 19th century with the philosopher Proudhon called anarchism, which took an extreme statement that we don't need any government. If we just leave the people alone with no government, they will do much better. People are naturally inclined, many people, to anarchism, and so they're so happy to hear of bitcoin. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SHILLER: . . . Which was claimed can't be controlled by the government because bitcoin is for the whole world. It just sounds so enlightened and brilliant. VEDANTAM: And in some ways, if you feel like you are part of the large number of people who doesn't have power, who doesn't have a voice and you feel like powerful elites are running your life, as many people do, in some ways, bitcoin is - you know, it's sort of - you're throwing a rock against the edifice of the elites. You're basically fighting back in some ways. SHILLER: Right. And when you buy bitcoin, you feel like you're on the bright side of things. You're an owner of some of this fancy computer stuff in a sense. VEDANTAM: Yeah. SHILLER: And you're part of it. VEDANTAM: Yeah, you're one of the disruptors; you're not the ones being disrupted. SHILLER: That's the hope that it gives you. Yes. VEDANTAM: Robert says these underlying currents help explain why a story like bitcoin took off. If psychology and sociology explain the origins of economic fads, Robert draws in ideas from another field - medicine - to understand how such fads spread and when they die. Stories, he says, function like viruses or parasites. They spread only when they have a receptive host. SHILLER: It is really important to understand that things that are popular are the result of contagion. There is a contagion rate which varies through time. There's also a recovery rate - how soon people forget about the narrative. This is just straight out of medical epidemiology. The contagion rate has to be higher than the recovery rate and then the epidemic will take off. It'll start small, but it will get bigger and bigger until the contagion rate falls down below the recovery rate, and then it starts to recede. It's mysterious because we don't normally think about the contagion rate and the recovery rate for stories. But that, in fact, are basic parameters that explain when they get strong and when they fade away. VEDANTAM: And, of course, for the people who haven't invested in bitcoin, who didn't get in on the craze, you know, those people might listen to this and say, hang on a second, I wasn't affected by the story. But in some ways, that's not different from an epidemic. Not everyone falls sick when an epidemic is raging. SHILLER: Yeah. So if you have not invested in bitcoin, that's not necessarily a sign of your common sense. It's just that you never encountered a contagious person who is spreading the word. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Bitcoin is a single story. When we come back, Robert Shiller makes the case that narrative economics can explain larger phenomena, including shifts in the entire economy. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Robert, in your book, you write, when we choose to tell a story to others, we base that choice on our perceptions of how people will react to that story in their own minds. We will likely spread a story, whether it is a story about boom-time thinking or about economic despair, if we think that others will like the story enough to want to spread it further. Talk about this idea that part of the reason stories spread - and some stories spread more than others - is that we are actually, each of us, gauging whether if we tell the story to somebody else, they, in turn, would want to pass it on. SHILLER: Right. It's what psychologists call theory of mind. That is, we are always thinking about what we imagine other people are thinking. That's because understanding other people's thinking is very important for success in human society. People enjoy conversation. It's part of our species. It's everywhere in the world. Everywhere you go, you'll see people standing facing each other engaged in conversation. And if you get a translation of what they're saying, they're telling stories (laughter). And people, when they hear a story, they turn it over in their mind and say, maybe I could use this story in another conversation. So people evaluate them based on their apparent success in motivating other people. So yeah, it's as if people are all trying to go viral. It's not a new thing with the Internet. They were going viral thousands of years ago. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Nearly a century ago, a powerful story swept the country. It's a story that has echoes in our own time, and the lessons from history are instructive. In the 1920s and '30s, many people feared that technological innovations were going to disrupt the economy and put lots of people out of work. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: For the majority, it means the interminable line outside factory gates, desperately hoping for a job that rarely comes. SHILLER: It explains some things that got out of hand and bad. The Great Depression of the 1930s came shortly after the term technological unemployment became popular in the late 1920s about machines replacing jobs. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #5: Machines replaced hands. New machines replaced old machines. New inventions - the electric light, automobile, telephone - started as luxuries, then, as they were made better and cheaper, became commonplace. SHILLER: And when the unemployment rate got high after 1930, people started to think, this is it. It's robots replacing our jobs. And you may think, it's pretty strange that people thought about robots in 1930. That sounds like long before they had computers. But they did think they had robots. I'll give you an example of what they called a robot. (SOUNDBITE OF ROTARY PHONE DIAL SPINNING)SHILLER: It's the dial telephone. Before that when you picked up a phone, there was no dial, no keypad. You had to just - there was an operator there and it would say, number, please. UNIDENTIFIED OPERATOR: Number, please. SHILLER: They replaced that operator with a machine. That's called a robot. And it scared people then. And they thought that, maybe we better fall back and save some more money. When everybody does that, it makes the depression worse. VEDANTAM: So one of the interesting points you make is that stories vanish and resurface, like the story you were just telling about technological innovation displacing workers. And sometimes these stories vanish and come back over decades or even centuries. And that really is analogous to what happens with pathogens that go dormant and then they reemerge sometimes decades later as epidemics. SHILLER: That's right. And a pathogen can reemerge because of a mutation. Like, influenza mutates quite regularly, and we have to get inoculated imperfectly against those mutations. Or it can change because of some change in our practices. If there's some event that brings people closer together in an enclosed space, it can spread much more rapidly and the contagion rate goes up. So these are fundamental lessons that I don't hear very often from most economists. They don't talk in these terms, and they don't see the causal impact from narratives to the economy. VEDANTAM: So it's interesting. When we think about stories - and if you draw the analogy with pathogens, perhaps then modifications to stories or tweaks in an underlying story might be necessary for a dormant story to come back and become dominant again. SHILLER: Yes. And so sometimes the tweaks are just frivolous sounding. I'll give an example from my book. The idea of trickle-down economics where you cut taxes on the rich on the theory that they will raise GDP and, ultimately, enrich the poorer people was starting to look pretty old by the 1970s. But then a new narrative appeared that was really written by a writer Jude Wanniski about the Laffer curve. And it was basically the same theory that if you cut taxes, GDP will go up and tax revenues will even go up. You just have to cut taxes. That was a lovely story, and it was embellished by details, visual images. Like, it was said that Arthur Laffer, the economist, presented his idea - new idea about taxes in the form of a diagram which he drew on a napkin at a fancy restaurant with Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and future Vice President Dick Cheney. Putting these names at a visual image of a diagram drawn on a napkin was all that that narrative needed to get epidemic again. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). SHILLER: And that led to, I would say, Margaret Thatcher's ascendance to the prime minister in Britain in '79 and then Ronald Reagan, president of the United States - both tax cutters. VEDANTAM: So the diagram drawn on that napkin eventually came to be called the Laffer curve. Explain what that curve is. Explain what the very simple intuition is behind that curve that eventually led to fairly significant policy changes on both sides of the Atlantic. SHILLER: Yeah. It's almost - the Laffer curve story, it's almost like a joke with a punchline. So what Laffer said is, if we have a 0% tax rate on incomes, how much will we collect? Zero, obviously. But what if we have a 100% tax rate on incomes, what will we collect? Well, it'll be zero again because nobody's going to work if the government takes all of it. So in between, the revenue has to be positive. So connect the dots and you have a hump-shaped curve. That means that to raise any given amount of revenue, there are always two tax rates - a low one and a high one. You can picture that on my diagram, which I'm asking you to make a mental image of. And so that's a new idea. Nobody has been talking about two tax rates to raise the same revenue. It's clever. It's like a - it's a stunt, a trick. It's a magic trick. It's fun. You can have - you'll know that you'll get a rise out of people if you explain it well enough and tell such a story. So it went absolutely viral - not just in the United States, it spread all over the world. VEDANTAM: It might be hard to visualize this curve, but think about it this way. As Robert says, the government raises $0 in taxes where the taxation rate is zero but also when it is 100%. Think of what would happen if the tax rate was 1% or 99%. In both cases, the government would raise only a small amount of money. When it's 1%, a lot of people would go to work, but the government would get only a small portion of their income. When it's 99%, the government would also get very little because only a few people would work when 99 cents of every dollar are taken away from them. You can imagine the same dynamic playing out at other levels of taxation. The intuitive idea here is that there can be two levels of taxation that produce the same amount of revenue. If that's the case, you can make everyone happy by taxing people at a lower rate. SHILLER: You've got to give Art Laffer credit for that - seems obvious now. And it had big, profound effects. It was a big epidemic in the '70s and early '80s, but it's coming back now. Arthur Laffer is still there and he's still gloating in his great success. That was the best thing he ever did in terms of narrative quality. VEDANTAM: So is it true that Art Laffer himself has debunked the story about the napkin and the story with Don Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney in the restaurant in Washington? SHILLER: Well, the National Museum of American History in Washington was designing an exhibit on business history. And they had the idea that it would be good to get the napkin. And maybe - well, Jude Wanniski, the author of the story, had died. They called his widow and asked her, we're looking for a napkin with a diagram drawn on it. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). SHILLER: . . . Can you look around his things? And she - then she called back and said, yes, I found a napkin with a diagram. So she gave it to them and they proudly put it in their display. You can find it searching on the web. And they tell you it's - they tell you they're very proud to have this exhibit. But there is one problem with it. That a reporter later called Art Laffer and asked him about it and he said, I don't believe that story. He said, I don't remember writing on a napkin. And moreover, my mother taught me - it would be a cloth napkin at a fine restaurant. My mother taught me not to do such things. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) Well, I mean, what's fascinating, of course, is that's such a good story and it's such a fun story that it almost feels a pity to apply the facts to it and debunk it. SHILLER: And that applies to conversation, generally. Yeah. How many people actually fact-check their stories when they tell them? VEDANTAM: The Laffer curve is still being debated by economists. While the curve might make sense at the ends of the taxation spectrum, it might not describe what people do at realistic levels of taxation. Most governments aren't choosing between a tax rate of 10% and a tax rate of 90%. They're choosing between 25% and 30%. That means drawing implications from the Laffer curve might not make much sense. But in the 1980s, the story of the Laffer curve proved irresistible. Calls to reduce taxation were buttressed by other stories like this one from President Ronald Reagan. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RONALD REAGAN: They only know how many checks they're sending out. VEDANTAM: . . . To showcase wasteful government spending. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)REAGAN: In Chicago, they found a woman who holds the record. She used 80 names, 30 addresses, 15 telephone numbers to collect food stamps, Social Security, veterans benefits for four nonexistent deceased veterans husbands as well. . . VEDANTAM: So, Robert, tell me how Reagan's stories about so-called welfare queens intersected with these ideas from the Laffer curve and eventually changed federal policy. SHILLER: Yeah. Well, Reagan was a good storyteller by the way. So he had a great deal of power from that. That kind of story elicits anger, and anger is a strong emotion. But the problem with that story is it's not a statistic. It's just a - in fact, it's the record holder, so, I mean, there's only one like her. And - but storytellers don't care. They tell anomalous and rare events as if they're common. And if it's contagious like that, it generates fake news. VEDANTAM: You were talking a second ago about how President Reagan, in some ways, was a marvelous storyteller. One of his stories affected not just how individuals and companies act but perhaps even how nations act. He liked to tell a story about the failures of communism in Soviet Russia where people had to wait for years to get routine household services. In one joke he told to many audiences, he described a man who goes to buy a car and is told he has to wait for 10 years. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)REAGAN: But this man, he laid down his money and then the fellow who was - that was in charge said to him, OK, come back in 10 years and get your car. And he said, morning or afternoon? (LAUGHTER)REAGAN: And the fellow behind the counter said, well, 10 years from now, what difference does it make? And he said, well, the plumber's coming in the morning. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: And what is so effective here, Robert, is that Reagan is not saying explicitly communism doesn't work. That message is embedded inside the joke, and that's the power of the story. SHILLER: Yeah. And it also shows an example of the tendency for stories to go viral that are associated with a celebrity. The real author of that story is someone living in Russia, I suppose, who gets no credit for it. It really goes viral when it's connected with someone that we know. And that's just the way we are. Lots of famous quotes in history turn out not to have been first said by the famous person. The famous person was quoting somebody else that he doesn't care about. VEDANTAM: Yeah. And isn't it also the case that sometimes the stories might not even be true? I mean, we don't even know whether there actually was a specific person in the Soviet Union who came up with this. There have been questions raised about the welfare queen story that Reagan told, for example. And in some ways, once a story is traveling and it's embedded, the truth is often not sufficient to demolish it. SHILLER: Yes, and this is not a new problem. It goes way back. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: If you turn on the news these days, there is a powerful story that's in circulation that tells us that a long period of economic expansion is soon going to be over. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #6: Although things may look good for now, many Wall Street analysts are concerned about the warning signs ahead. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #7: Red recession warning light now flashing for the first time since 2007. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #8: As a key predictor of recession is now flashing. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #9: Bond markets once again flashing that ominous recession warning signal. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #10: The economy could be headed for turmoil. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)CHANG: Falling 800 points, losing 3% of its value. VEDANTAM: What do you tell people when they ask you to predict the next recession? And by the way, that's me indirectly asking you to predict the next recession. SHILLER: My feeling is that we are at a heightened risk of a recession and having a recession before the 2020 elections in the U. S. might might even be 50%. You'll see clear evidence of a recession coming. But I can't go above that. There will be another recession. We know that. But the other question that - people tend to talk about all or nothing. Will we or will we not have a recession? The question is if there is - another question, which I like to entertain, if there is a recession, is there a chance that it will develop into a severe recession? And I'm worried about that, even though I can't tell you precisely whether we'll be in a recession. And I think there are narratives today that might worsen a recession, notably the artificial intelligence narrative, which in an earlier form in the Great Depression really did heighten the impact of the Depression. We can see that again people becoming conservative in their expenditure because they're afraid of losing their jobs. It's already going on in some parts of the country, but it could become big. VEDANTAM: One point that Robert makes is that the veracity of economic narratives is not the point. Stories can invent their own reality. One example he gives is the narrative around Japan's Lost Decade, a period of economic stagnation during the 1990s and early 2000s. SHILLER: The Lost Decade story for Japan was particularly impactful since it followed the 1980s when Japan was considered the economic powerhouse of the world. People were saying that nobody can compete with Japan. They've pushed out Western makers of cameras, stereo equipment. They're hammering away at their sales of cars. There were books written back then about the Japanese miracle, and then suddenly it went sour in the 1990s. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering if President Donald Trump might be a fan of your book, whether or not he's actually read it, because he clearly also believes in the power of stories. Here he is talking down the risks of an impending recession. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't think we're having a recession. We're doing tremendously well. Our consumers are rich. I gave a tremendous tax cut. And they're loaded up with money. They're buying. I saw the Walmart numbers. They were through the roof just two days ago. That's better than any poll. That's better than any economist. VEDANTAM: So, Robert, given what you say about how talk can shape economic reality, is President Trump absolutely right to be spinning a positive story? SHILLER: Well, I wouldn't use the word absolutely right. That's a little strong. But he is having an impact, I believe. It's not just his current spinning of the story. He's written many books with co-authors. These books have advice to be like him. He tells you how he did it. He tells you, for example, don't be afraid to boast about yourself because, you know, people are maybe a little resentful about boasting people, but in the long run, they believe in them because they - if you don't boast, nobody will hear about your successes. This is Donald Trump talking. He's telling you to spread your personal narrative aggressively, and he's been doing that for himself for 50 years. And it's worked. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Robert Shiller won the 2013 Nobel Prize in economics.

SHILLER: All right. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) Take care. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: I'm Shankar Vedantam, and this is NPR. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST:  From NPR, this is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. We begin today with a story of an economic bubble, or, to be more precise, a mania. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Foreign language spoken). VEDANTAM: This mania took place in Amsterdam in the 1630s. Picture a city of canals, elegant townhouses and a populace obsessed with one thing. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Foreign language spoken). VEDANTAM: . . . Tulips. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Foreign language spoken). ROBERT SHILLER: Amsterdam was the site of a big flowers market; it still is. People would trade tulips. And there were some tulips that were especially beautiful, they thought. And so people wanted those, and the price started going up. VEDANTAM: This is economist Robert Shiller. And when he says prices started going up, what he means is they started going up a lot. SHILLER: People were getting rich trading in tulips. One tulip would be the same value as a whole house. VEDANTAM: One tulip could hold as much value as a house. Now, historians say they've only found a few examples of this, but even more modestly priced tulips could sell for what would today be thousands of dollars. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Foreign language spoken). VEDANTAM: From a distance of nearly 400 years, the Dutch tulip mania of the 1630s might seem absurd, but the flowers were a way for the residents of Amsterdam to convey that they were cultured and influential. The tulips had great symbolic value. They told an amazing story. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This week on HIDDEN BRAIN - the powerful way in which stories and psychology shape our economic lives, how narratives affect not just the purchases we make as individuals but the fate of our entire economic system. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Most people think of the economy as following a set of fairly scientific principles. I buy more if things are cheap. I buy less if they're expensive. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: The nation's gross domestic product, or GDP, grew at a stronger than expected rate of 2 1/2%. VEDANTAM: Or say I run a company. I hire people if it looks like the economy is growing. I cut back if it looks like things are going to tank. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Delayed hiring, 4% accelerated hiring. You can see there mostly just going down. VEDANTAM: If I run the Federal Reserve, economic indicators tell me whether to raise or lower interest rates. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) AILSA CHANG: The central bank is cutting interest rates for the third time since July. VEDANTAM: It all looks very rational, very mathematical. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: But this picture neglects a fundamental aspect of economic life. We live in a world of stories. The stories that we tell in news reports, around the water cooler, in conversations with friends and family, these stories profoundly shape the trajectory of the economy. Economist Robert Shiller's new book explores this idea. It's called \"Narrative Economics. \" The winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize in economics, Robert Shiller says his interest in the relationship between stories and the economy goes all the way back to his early college days. He was an economics major, but he took a history course that examined the Great Depression. He was struck by the disconnect between the economic ideas he was learning about and the stories he read about how people behaved in the real world. SHILLER: People didn't sound like the people described in my economic theory. They seemed to be faddish and vulnerable to crazes and new ideas, and then they'd drop them and forget them. It just seemed like there was a note of reality that has been lost when we separate out departments. A history department has something to offer; so does the psych and sociology department, et cetera. But we tend to be - in academia, we tend to be polarized or more than polarized. We tend to compartmentalize. And I've, all my life ever since, thought that I wanted to read what these other people were saying as well as what my economist people are saying. VEDANTAM: Because, of course, they're all just different ways to understand the human condition, right? I mean, psychologists and anthropologists and sociologists and economists, I mean, they're all basically trying to understand why people do what they do. They're just using different tools. SHILLER: And political scientists. VEDANTAM: Yeah, yeah. SHILLER: Yeah. So we need all these perspectives. Don't be too compartmentalized. It may carry you for a while, but if you don't know what's happening in other realms of thought, you might miss the big picture. VEDANTAM: Robert says these realms of thought can help us decode things that otherwise seem puzzling about the economy. Take for example the story of a paper written by a mysterious mathematician in 2008. The author went by a pseudonym. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Satoshi Nakamoto. VEDANTAM: Satoshi Nakamoto. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Who is Satoshi Nakamoto? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Satoshi Nakamoto is a fake name for somebody. NEHA NARULA: He's a myth. I mean, he doesn't - no one knows who he is. Some people have claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, but we have not seen any definitive proof. ANDY COURT: When you ask about the creator - who created this? Who invented this? They must be a real genius. Everyone's like, we have no idea. VEDANTAM: The reason Satoshi Nakamoto created such a stir - this person, whose identity is still unknown, came up with a new type of currency - bitcoin. SHILLER: The first successful cryptocurrency. The story was that Nakamoto was able to invent a currency that could function without the help of any government, even against the opposition of any government. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Bitcoin emerged as the digital currency that in theory could not be manipulated by a central authority. SHILLER: And it would be smart, young, cosmopolitan people all over the world who would secure this decentralized system. It's a wonderful story and especially wonderful since nobody could figure out who Satoshi Nakamoto really was. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). SHILLER: He never - can't be found. No one has met him. How did he do that? That's an amazing story. VEDANTAM: Robert makes the case that bitcoin spread because it was a tale with surprise and intrigue. A genius mathematician invents a cryptocurrency and becomes a billionaire. It sounds like the plot of a movie. If I was making that movie, one subplot I would include is the story of the singer Lily Allen. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THE FEAR\") LILY ALLEN: (Singing) I want to be rich and I want lots of money. I don't care about clever. I don't care about funny. VEDANTAM: Lily Allen received an offer to get paid for a performance in bitcoin. SHILLER: She turned it down. That was the most momentous error you can imagine because she would be a billionaire if she had taken that bitcoin. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) And, you know, you hear the story and even if you don't know anything about cryptocurrencies, you ask yourself, am I missing out by not getting in on this? I mean, the story induces FOMO. SHILLER: That's exactly right, and that's a strong emotion, fear. It's regret theory. People are fearful of being regretful that they miss something. It hurts. You don't want to look forward to that pain in the future, so you might as well try. That's the thinking. VEDANTAM: What's astonishing is that the craze over bitcoin spread even though very few people actually understand what a cryptocurrency is or understand its underlying blockchain technology. But these terms very quickly became buzzwords. Here's comedian John Oliver on \"Last Week Tonight. \" (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LAST WEEK TONIGHT WITH JOHN OLIVER\") JOHN OLIVER: The problem is there is now enough excitement around the very word blockchain that it's become a magnet for investment. Reuters found that the existing companies that merely added the word blockchain to their name saw their stock price on average increase more than threefold. And one of them was particularly dumb. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Long Island Iced Tea renamed themselves Long Blockchain. And guess what happened. Yeah, their stock tripled. VEDANTAM: Robert, so you write at one point that the total value of bitcoin exceeded $300 billion, but bitcoin has no value unless people think it has value. So something that existed purely in people's heads went from being worth $0 to $300 billion? SHILLER: Yes, it can easily happen if the viral effect is strong enough. Now, bitcoin enthusiasts will say, well, what about gold? Gold has no real value. It's just a shiny metal that's pretty to look at. And yet it has tremendous value, and it has for thousands of years. But I have to say there are some differences. Gold is scarce - inherently scarce. Anybody can start a new cryptocurrency. Gold is in the Bible. It's mentioned over 300 times in the Holy Bible. VEDANTAM: You know, I was thinking about this as I was reading the book. You know, when I think about real money, obviously, real money, you know, has on many occasions bought me real things. But at some level, doesn't real money function a little bit like bitcoin in that it requires you and I to both agree that the notes that I have in my wallet have real value, that in some ways we both agree on the story of what the notes mean and the story is what gives the notes their power? SHILLER: That's right. That's - you've spoken just perfectly about narrative economics. I'll give you another example - banks. Why don't banks fail? All it takes is a story. If someone says the bank is going to be bankrupt soon, everybody will rush in and try to take their money out. And the banks can't - they don't have it on hand. They can't pay it out. So that's another example of how, yes, our whole banking system is built on a narrative. VEDANTAM: Yeah. Because at any given point, the bank might have enough money cash on hand to basically pay out, you know, five or 10% of what its total assets are. It's investing the rest of the money in other projects. So if everyone asks for their money back at the same time, the bank would simply not be able to deliver. SHILLER: And it happens, and it's supported by visual imagery. Photographers go to the bank, and they take a photograph of the big crowd clamoring to get in to get their money out. This has happened so many times that the FDIC - Federal Deposit Insurance Company - has a gallery of photos in one of their residences. And so it's become a narrative in itself that we have to watch out for that it doesn't come back. It's a perennial narrative. VEDANTAM: So bitcoin was not just a mysterious new scheme. It tapped into many deep and ancient narratives about ordinary people and elites, about anarchy, about populism. Talk to me about those larger themes that it tapped into. SHILLER: Well, there was a movement that began in the 19th century with the philosopher Proudhon called anarchism, which took an extreme statement that we don't need any government. If we just leave the people alone with no government, they will do much better. People are naturally inclined, many people, to anarchism, and so they're so happy to hear of bitcoin. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SHILLER: . . . Which was claimed can't be controlled by the government because bitcoin is for the whole world. It just sounds so enlightened and brilliant. VEDANTAM: And in some ways, if you feel like you are part of the large number of people who doesn't have power, who doesn't have a voice and you feel like powerful elites are running your life, as many people do, in some ways, bitcoin is - you know, it's sort of - you're throwing a rock against the edifice of the elites. You're basically fighting back in some ways. SHILLER: Right. And when you buy bitcoin, you feel like you're on the bright side of things. You're an owner of some of this fancy computer stuff in a sense. VEDANTAM: Yeah. SHILLER: And you're part of it. VEDANTAM: Yeah, you're one of the disruptors; you're not the ones being disrupted. SHILLER: That's the hope that it gives you. Yes. VEDANTAM: Robert says these underlying currents help explain why a story like bitcoin took off. If psychology and sociology explain the origins of economic fads, Robert draws in ideas from another field - medicine - to understand how such fads spread and when they die. Stories, he says, function like viruses or parasites. They spread only when they have a receptive host. SHILLER: It is really important to understand that things that are popular are the result of contagion. There is a contagion rate which varies through time. There's also a recovery rate - how soon people forget about the narrative. This is just straight out of medical epidemiology. The contagion rate has to be higher than the recovery rate and then the epidemic will take off. It'll start small, but it will get bigger and bigger until the contagion rate falls down below the recovery rate, and then it starts to recede. It's mysterious because we don't normally think about the contagion rate and the recovery rate for stories. But that, in fact, are basic parameters that explain when they get strong and when they fade away. VEDANTAM: And, of course, for the people who haven't invested in bitcoin, who didn't get in on the craze, you know, those people might listen to this and say, hang on a second, I wasn't affected by the story. But in some ways, that's not different from an epidemic. Not everyone falls sick when an epidemic is raging. SHILLER: Yeah. So if you have not invested in bitcoin, that's not necessarily a sign of your common sense. It's just that you never encountered a contagious person who is spreading the word. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Bitcoin is a single story. When we come back, Robert Shiller makes the case that narrative economics can explain larger phenomena, including shifts in the entire economy. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Robert, in your book, you write, when we choose to tell a story to others, we base that choice on our perceptions of how people will react to that story in their own minds. We will likely spread a story, whether it is a story about boom-time thinking or about economic despair, if we think that others will like the story enough to want to spread it further. Talk about this idea that part of the reason stories spread - and some stories spread more than others - is that we are actually, each of us, gauging whether if we tell the story to somebody else, they, in turn, would want to pass it on. SHILLER: Right. It's what psychologists call theory of mind. That is, we are always thinking about what we imagine other people are thinking. That's because understanding other people's thinking is very important for success in human society. People enjoy conversation. It's part of our species. It's everywhere in the world. Everywhere you go, you'll see people standing facing each other engaged in conversation. And if you get a translation of what they're saying, they're telling stories (laughter). And people, when they hear a story, they turn it over in their mind and say, maybe I could use this story in another conversation. So people evaluate them based on their apparent success in motivating other people. So yeah, it's as if people are all trying to go viral. It's not a new thing with the Internet. They were going viral thousands of years ago. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Nearly a century ago, a powerful story swept the country. It's a story that has echoes in our own time, and the lessons from history are instructive. In the 1920s and '30s, many people feared that technological innovations were going to disrupt the economy and put lots of people out of work. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: For the majority, it means the interminable line outside factory gates, desperately hoping for a job that rarely comes. SHILLER: It explains some things that got out of hand and bad. The Great Depression of the 1930s came shortly after the term technological unemployment became popular in the late 1920s about machines replacing jobs. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #5: Machines replaced hands. New machines replaced old machines. New inventions - the electric light, automobile, telephone - started as luxuries, then, as they were made better and cheaper, became commonplace. SHILLER: And when the unemployment rate got high after 1930, people started to think, this is it. It's robots replacing our jobs. And you may think, it's pretty strange that people thought about robots in 1930. That sounds like long before they had computers. But they did think they had robots. I'll give you an example of what they called a robot. (SOUNDBITE OF ROTARY PHONE DIAL SPINNING) SHILLER: It's the dial telephone. Before that when you picked up a phone, there was no dial, no keypad. You had to just - there was an operator there and it would say, number, please. UNIDENTIFIED OPERATOR: Number, please. SHILLER: They replaced that operator with a machine. That's called a robot. And it scared people then. And they thought that, maybe we better fall back and save some more money. When everybody does that, it makes the depression worse. VEDANTAM: So one of the interesting points you make is that stories vanish and resurface, like the story you were just telling about technological innovation displacing workers. And sometimes these stories vanish and come back over decades or even centuries. And that really is analogous to what happens with pathogens that go dormant and then they reemerge sometimes decades later as epidemics. SHILLER: That's right. And a pathogen can reemerge because of a mutation. Like, influenza mutates quite regularly, and we have to get inoculated imperfectly against those mutations. Or it can change because of some change in our practices. If there's some event that brings people closer together in an enclosed space, it can spread much more rapidly and the contagion rate goes up. So these are fundamental lessons that I don't hear very often from most economists. They don't talk in these terms, and they don't see the causal impact from narratives to the economy. VEDANTAM: So it's interesting. When we think about stories - and if you draw the analogy with pathogens, perhaps then modifications to stories or tweaks in an underlying story might be necessary for a dormant story to come back and become dominant again. SHILLER: Yes. And so sometimes the tweaks are just frivolous sounding. I'll give an example from my book. The idea of trickle-down economics where you cut taxes on the rich on the theory that they will raise GDP and, ultimately, enrich the poorer people was starting to look pretty old by the 1970s. But then a new narrative appeared that was really written by a writer Jude Wanniski about the Laffer curve. And it was basically the same theory that if you cut taxes, GDP will go up and tax revenues will even go up. You just have to cut taxes. That was a lovely story, and it was embellished by details, visual images. Like, it was said that Arthur Laffer, the economist, presented his idea - new idea about taxes in the form of a diagram which he drew on a napkin at a fancy restaurant with Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and future Vice President Dick Cheney. Putting these names at a visual image of a diagram drawn on a napkin was all that that narrative needed to get epidemic again. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). SHILLER: And that led to, I would say, Margaret Thatcher's ascendance to the prime minister in Britain in '79 and then Ronald Reagan, president of the United States - both tax cutters. VEDANTAM: So the diagram drawn on that napkin eventually came to be called the Laffer curve. Explain what that curve is. Explain what the very simple intuition is behind that curve that eventually led to fairly significant policy changes on both sides of the Atlantic. SHILLER: Yeah. It's almost - the Laffer curve story, it's almost like a joke with a punchline. So what Laffer said is, if we have a 0% tax rate on incomes, how much will we collect? Zero, obviously. But what if we have a 100% tax rate on incomes, what will we collect? Well, it'll be zero again because nobody's going to work if the government takes all of it. So in between, the revenue has to be positive. So connect the dots and you have a hump-shaped curve. That means that to raise any given amount of revenue, there are always two tax rates - a low one and a high one. You can picture that on my diagram, which I'm asking you to make a mental image of. And so that's a new idea. Nobody has been talking about two tax rates to raise the same revenue. It's clever. It's like a - it's a stunt, a trick. It's a magic trick. It's fun. You can have - you'll know that you'll get a rise out of people if you explain it well enough and tell such a story. So it went absolutely viral - not just in the United States, it spread all over the world. VEDANTAM: It might be hard to visualize this curve, but think about it this way. As Robert says, the government raises $0 in taxes where the taxation rate is zero but also when it is 100%. Think of what would happen if the tax rate was 1% or 99%. In both cases, the government would raise only a small amount of money. When it's 1%, a lot of people would go to work, but the government would get only a small portion of their income. When it's 99%, the government would also get very little because only a few people would work when 99 cents of every dollar are taken away from them. You can imagine the same dynamic playing out at other levels of taxation. The intuitive idea here is that there can be two levels of taxation that produce the same amount of revenue. If that's the case, you can make everyone happy by taxing people at a lower rate. SHILLER: You've got to give Art Laffer credit for that - seems obvious now. And it had big, profound effects. It was a big epidemic in the '70s and early '80s, but it's coming back now. Arthur Laffer is still there and he's still gloating in his great success. That was the best thing he ever did in terms of narrative quality. VEDANTAM: So is it true that Art Laffer himself has debunked the story about the napkin and the story with Don Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney in the restaurant in Washington? SHILLER: Well, the National Museum of American History in Washington was designing an exhibit on business history. And they had the idea that it would be good to get the napkin. And maybe - well, Jude Wanniski, the author of the story, had died. They called his widow and asked her, we're looking for a napkin with a diagram drawn on it. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). SHILLER: . . . Can you look around his things? And she - then she called back and said, yes, I found a napkin with a diagram. So she gave it to them and they proudly put it in their display. You can find it searching on the web. And they tell you it's - they tell you they're very proud to have this exhibit. But there is one problem with it. That a reporter later called Art Laffer and asked him about it and he said, I don't believe that story. He said, I don't remember writing on a napkin. And moreover, my mother taught me - it would be a cloth napkin at a fine restaurant. My mother taught me not to do such things. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) Well, I mean, what's fascinating, of course, is that's such a good story and it's such a fun story that it almost feels a pity to apply the facts to it and debunk it. SHILLER: And that applies to conversation, generally. Yeah. How many people actually fact-check their stories when they tell them? VEDANTAM: The Laffer curve is still being debated by economists. While the curve might make sense at the ends of the taxation spectrum, it might not describe what people do at realistic levels of taxation. Most governments aren't choosing between a tax rate of 10% and a tax rate of 90%. They're choosing between 25% and 30%. That means drawing implications from the Laffer curve might not make much sense. But in the 1980s, the story of the Laffer curve proved irresistible. Calls to reduce taxation were buttressed by other stories like this one from President Ronald Reagan. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RONALD REAGAN: They only know how many checks they're sending out. VEDANTAM: . . . To showcase wasteful government spending. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) REAGAN: In Chicago, they found a woman who holds the record. She used 80 names, 30 addresses, 15 telephone numbers to collect food stamps, Social Security, veterans benefits for four nonexistent deceased veterans husbands as well. . . VEDANTAM: So, Robert, tell me how Reagan's stories about so-called welfare queens intersected with these ideas from the Laffer curve and eventually changed federal policy. SHILLER: Yeah. Well, Reagan was a good storyteller by the way. So he had a great deal of power from that. That kind of story elicits anger, and anger is a strong emotion. But the problem with that story is it's not a statistic. It's just a - in fact, it's the record holder, so, I mean, there's only one like her. And - but storytellers don't care. They tell anomalous and rare events as if they're common. And if it's contagious like that, it generates fake news. VEDANTAM: You were talking a second ago about how President Reagan, in some ways, was a marvelous storyteller. One of his stories affected not just how individuals and companies act but perhaps even how nations act. He liked to tell a story about the failures of communism in Soviet Russia where people had to wait for years to get routine household services. In one joke he told to many audiences, he described a man who goes to buy a car and is told he has to wait for 10 years. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) REAGAN: But this man, he laid down his money and then the fellow who was - that was in charge said to him, OK, come back in 10 years and get your car. And he said, morning or afternoon? (LAUGHTER) REAGAN: And the fellow behind the counter said, well, 10 years from now, what difference does it make? And he said, well, the plumber's coming in the morning. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: And what is so effective here, Robert, is that Reagan is not saying explicitly communism doesn't work. That message is embedded inside the joke, and that's the power of the story. SHILLER: Yeah. And it also shows an example of the tendency for stories to go viral that are associated with a celebrity. The real author of that story is someone living in Russia, I suppose, who gets no credit for it. It really goes viral when it's connected with someone that we know. And that's just the way we are. Lots of famous quotes in history turn out not to have been first said by the famous person. The famous person was quoting somebody else that he doesn't care about. VEDANTAM: Yeah. And isn't it also the case that sometimes the stories might not even be true? I mean, we don't even know whether there actually was a specific person in the Soviet Union who came up with this. There have been questions raised about the welfare queen story that Reagan told, for example. And in some ways, once a story is traveling and it's embedded, the truth is often not sufficient to demolish it. SHILLER: Yes, and this is not a new problem. It goes way back. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: If you turn on the news these days, there is a powerful story that's in circulation that tells us that a long period of economic expansion is soon going to be over. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #6: Although things may look good for now, many Wall Street analysts are concerned about the warning signs ahead. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #7: Red recession warning light now flashing for the first time since 2007. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #8: As a key predictor of recession is now flashing. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #9: Bond markets once again flashing that ominous recession warning signal. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #10: The economy could be headed for turmoil. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) CHANG: Falling 800 points, losing 3% of its value. VEDANTAM: What do you tell people when they ask you to predict the next recession? And by the way, that's me indirectly asking you to predict the next recession. SHILLER: My feeling is that we are at a heightened risk of a recession and having a recession before the 2020 elections in the U. S. might might even be 50%. You'll see clear evidence of a recession coming. But I can't go above that. There will be another recession. We know that. But the other question that - people tend to talk about all or nothing. Will we or will we not have a recession? The question is if there is - another question, which I like to entertain, if there is a recession, is there a chance that it will develop into a severe recession? And I'm worried about that, even though I can't tell you precisely whether we'll be in a recession. And I think there are narratives today that might worsen a recession, notably the artificial intelligence narrative, which in an earlier form in the Great Depression really did heighten the impact of the Depression. We can see that again people becoming conservative in their expenditure because they're afraid of losing their jobs. It's already going on in some parts of the country, but it could become big. VEDANTAM: One point that Robert makes is that the veracity of economic narratives is not the point. Stories can invent their own reality. One example he gives is the narrative around Japan's Lost Decade, a period of economic stagnation during the 1990s and early 2000s. SHILLER: The Lost Decade story for Japan was particularly impactful since it followed the 1980s when Japan was considered the economic powerhouse of the world. People were saying that nobody can compete with Japan. They've pushed out Western makers of cameras, stereo equipment. They're hammering away at their sales of cars. There were books written back then about the Japanese miracle, and then suddenly it went sour in the 1990s. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering if President Donald Trump might be a fan of your book, whether or not he's actually read it, because he clearly also believes in the power of stories. Here he is talking down the risks of an impending recession. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't think we're having a recession. We're doing tremendously well. Our consumers are rich. I gave a tremendous tax cut. And they're loaded up with money. They're buying. I saw the Walmart numbers. They were through the roof just two days ago. That's better than any poll. That's better than any economist. VEDANTAM: So, Robert, given what you say about how talk can shape economic reality, is President Trump absolutely right to be spinning a positive story? SHILLER: Well, I wouldn't use the word absolutely right. That's a little strong. But he is having an impact, I believe. It's not just his current spinning of the story. He's written many books with co-authors. These books have advice to be like him. He tells you how he did it. He tells you, for example, don't be afraid to boast about yourself because, you know, people are maybe a little resentful about boasting people, but in the long run, they believe in them because they - if you don't boast, nobody will hear about your successes. This is Donald Trump talking. He's telling you to spread your personal narrative aggressively, and he's been doing that for himself for 50 years. And it's worked.

S. is pulling out of the Paris climate agreement. The State Department sent a letter to the U. N. that said, basically, we don't want to be part of this deal anymore. There is a one-year waiting period before the withdrawal takes effect, and as NPR's Rebecca Hersher reports, today's action makes the U. S. a conspicuous outsider when it comes to dealing with global warming. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: The 2015 Paris Climate Agreement was designed to be easy to join and hard to leave. In fact, the United States spearheaded the effort to make sure that's how it was. Otherwise, who knows what could happen? Another country could have an election, get a new leader who wasn't so keen on the international agreement and poof - it would all start to fall apart. And since 2015, there has been a lot of political turmoil in countries like Brazil and India and Turkey and China and Japan. But the U. S. is the only country where the new people in power have decided to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Andrew Light is a former top climate official in the State Department. ANDREW LIGHT: That's one of the ironies of all this. Even though we're the ones who've been pointing to these potential scenarios for problems with other countries, we seem to be the biggest problem. HERSHER: Light helped negotiate the Paris Agreement. It took years. LIGHT: These agreements are just only as good as the commitments from each country. HERSHER: The American commitment under the Paris Agreement is to reduce national greenhouse gas emissions by about a quarter compared to what they were in 2005. The U. S. is not on track to do that, in part because even though the formal withdrawal has just begun, President Trump began pulling back from the commitment more than two years ago in June 2017. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord. HERSHER: In that speech, President Trump suggested that the Paris requirements to transition to cleaner energy sources and help other countries do the same would cost too much. Rachel Cleetus works on climate and energy policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists, an American advocacy group. She says they've got the math wrong. For one thing, you have to take into account the costs of more intense and frequent wildfires and other natural disasters. RACHEL CLEETUS: What we can't afford is runaway climate change. Just look at California right now. Tell me that this is not an economic cost. In fact, the most expensive thing we can do is not take action to limit these types of climate impacts. HERSHER: As for what comes next, now that the U. S. has formally signalled it's done with Paris, a year has to pass before the withdrawal is final. In the meantime, a delegation from the State Department will still attend the annual meeting of the nearly 200 countries that are in the agreement. It's in early December, and if a new president were to take office in 2021 and decided to re-enter the Paris Agreement, they can. LIGHT: On Inauguration Day 2021, you know, they can communicate to the United Nations that we want to get back in the Paris Agreement. It takes 30 days for that to happen, so that's pretty much the easy part. HERSHER: The harder part will be pushing to get the U. S. back on track to reduce greenhouse gas emissions before the most catastrophic effects of climate change are inevitable. Rebecca Hersher, NPR News.

But when those batteries break or wear out, they mostly get thrown away. Now scientists are trying to figure out how to recycle them. NPR's Dan Charles has the story. DAN CHARLES, BYLINE: To understand why lithium-ion batteries are so hard to recycle, let's take a look at how they're put together with Linda Gaines, a scientist at Argonne National Laboratory outside of Chicago. LINDA GAINES: Each cell is a series of sandwiches. CHARLES: The outer layers of the sandwich are metal foil. Inside them are thin layers of powder. One of them is the really valuable one, made of things like lithium and cobalt and nickel. GAINES: And these sandwiches are either rolled up or folded up into a tight package, and then the electrolyte liquid is forced in. And the whole thing is put in a little can. CHARLES: That's an individual cell. Dozens or even hundreds of cells get stacked together into modules, and a bunch of modules go into the battery pack of a car. This whole sealed assembly is almost impossible to take apart, which would be risky anyway. Remember those stories of batteries catching fire. GAINES: It is a high-voltage device, and you would not want to be poking around in it with your screwdriver. CHARLES: When they stop working, though, it's wasteful and dangerous to just throw them in the trash. A few lithium-ion batteries go into a crude kind of recycling. They get chopped up and go into a furnace. The nickel and cobalt survive, but almost everything else gets burned away, including the lithium and aluminum. GAINES: I kind of find that offensive (laughter). You know, you've spent all that energy to make this really neat material, and you're just burning it as a fuel. CHARLES: So all over the world, teams of researchers are trying to invent something better to handle the big lithium-ion batteries that may power hundreds of millions of climate-saving electric cars down the road. Here's Gavin Harper from the University of Birmingham in England. GAVIN HARPER: We need to really make sure that we don't create a waste management problem with electric vehicles, where mountains of batteries accumulate, and we don't know what to do with them. CHARLES: Harper and his colleagues are building robots, which they hope can take over the dangerous job of cutting batteries open and collecting what's inside. In the U. S. , a whole group of labs, including Linda Gaines' group at Argonne, is trying to figure out if you just chop up the batteries, can you find a way to filter that mess and recover the valuable stuff - the metals and the high-priced powder at the heart of the battery? Gaines admits it'll be difficult. GAINES: If it was easy, it wouldn't be interesting. CHARLES: And you could kind of imagine it working. GAINES: Yeah, I can. CHARLES: They have a goal. Within three years, they want to have a process in hand for recycling lithium-ion batteries; one that companies will use because it's profitable. Dan Charles, NPR News.

MORNING EDITION went on the air for the first time on November 5, 1979. In the four decades since, we have witnessed and covered a whole lot of change. Now we're going to turn to the world of science, technology and health. And who better to do that with than NPR science correspondent Joe Palca, who has seen - I don't know - probably all of it, right, Joe? JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Well, yep (laughter). MARTIN: Good chunk of it. PALCA: Pretty much all of it, yeah. MARTIN: (Laughter) So it is safe to say, Joe, that in science and technology, I mean, the world is just - it feels like a totally different place in 40 years, doesn't it? PALCA: It's astounding. And deciding what to talk about is - it's almost impossible. I mean, we're not going to talk about the space shuttle. We're not going to talk about going to Mars. We're not going to talk about planets around stars outside of our solar system. . . MARTIN: Wow. PALCA: . . . Or gravitational waves (laughter). So forget about all of that. MARTIN: Because there's too much other stuff to talk about. PALCA: But we thought we'd focus on things that affected people's lives. So we're going to start with this 1981 report by my predecessor, Laurie Garrett. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)LAURIE GARRETT: In the last three months, 28 cases of Kaposi sarcoma have been reported in this country, all occurring among gay men, most of them young. PALCA: Now, no one knew it at the time, but those cases were the first hint that we were heading into a new epidemic that became AIDS. And only a few years later, the virus that causes AIDS was identified. MARTIN: I mean, we heard Laurie there talking about how this was something that was occurring among gay men. That's how most people thought of it, right? PALCA: Right. And then this announcement in 1991. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)EARVIN JOHNSON: Because of the HIV virus that I have attained, I will have to retire from the Lakers today. PALCA: That's Magic Johnson, you remember. MARTIN: Yeah. PALCA: And later in the news conference, he said something that was really remarkable. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHNSON: I plan on going on living for a long time, bugging you guys like I always have. So you'll see me around. PALCA: Now, happily, Magic Johnson is still alive. And effective AIDS drugs were just becoming available then, so it was a little surprising at his announcement because a lot of people thought that it was a death sentence. . . MARTIN: Right. Yeah. PALCA: . . . Or it could have been. And now, typically, AIDS is a manageable disease. And that takes us to another scientific advance. Just last year, we broadcast this story. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DAVID GREENE, HOST:  A Chinese researcher has shocked the world by claiming to have created the first genetically modified humans. MARTIN: Wow. PALCA: Now, that researcher was trying to protect babies from getting AIDS, and to do that, he modified them when they were still embryos. And it's not clear the modification will work, but the work caused a huge controversy because many people think modifying human embryos is unethical. But the fact that you can modify an embryo for any purpose is the result of a tool called CRISPR. MARTIN: Well, before you can modify genes effectively, you got to know what genes to modify, right? PALCA: Exactly. And that's where this announcement comes in. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BILL CLINTON: We are here to celebrate the completion of the first survey of the entire human genome. Without a doubt, this is the most important, most wondrous map ever produced by humankind. PALCA: Of course, that's President Bill Clinton announcing the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2000. It was a project to map and sequence all our DNA. And while the genome project was still underway in 1997, there was another remarkable biological breakthrough. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)BOB EDWARDS: Scientists in Scotland say they have cloned a sheep. This is the first time scientists have reported cloning an adult mammal, and the implications could be enormous. MARTIN: This is Dolly, right? PALCA: That's Dolly the sheep. MARTIN: I remember Dolly. Although, I mean, we still haven't had any cloned humans. PALCA: No, not yet and maybe not ever. But there's sure been a lot of talk about it. MARTIN: (Laughter). PALCA: Now I want to shift gears and talk about another topic that's been on our air almost from the start with MORNING EDITION. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)LILI FRANKLYN: In the past year, scientists have presented evidence that the polar ice caps are slowly melting, and some researchers feel that we'll see climate changes within the next decade. PALCA: That was Lili Franklyn reporting in 1982. At the time, people called this the greenhouse effect. . . MARTIN: Yeah. PALCA: . . . Why adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere would make the planet warm up. Since then, of course, climate change has become a political hot potato. Although, in 2008, there was this amazing TV commercial that suggested that there could be bipartisan agreement, even on this topic. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NANCY PELOSI: Hi, I'm Nancy Pelosi, lifelong Democrat and speaker of the House. NEWT GINGRICH: And I'm Newt Gingrich, lifelong Republican, and I used to be speaker. PELOSI: We don't always see eye to eye, do we, Newt? GINGRICH: No, but we do agree our country must take action to address climate change. MARTIN: Wow (laughter). PALCA: Wow indeed. But by 2017, that consensus had pretty much broken down. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: As of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the nonbinding Paris accord. PALCA: That, of course, was President Donald Trump. And the Paris accord is supposed to get countries to limit their greenhouse gas emissions. MARTIN: All right. So, Joe, if I asked you to name the technological change that has most affected our lives when you look at the past 40 years, what change has really made a difference to everyday people in our everyday lives? How would you answer? PALCA: Well, maybe like this. (SOUNDBITE OF DIAL-UP MODEM CONNECTING TO INTERNET)PALCA: That was how we used to connect to the Internet in the early days. MARTIN: I remember (laughter). PALCA: And the Internet has completely changed society. I mean, remember - computers were something mainly used by enthusiasts and scientists and engineers. And then this announcement in 1981 signaled computers were going mainstream. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GEORGE CONRADES: Today I'm pleased to tell you that we're introducing the IBM Personal Computer, and we believe it will set a new standard for the industry. PALCA: That's IBM's George Conrades speaking on an internal IBM video. And I think my favorite part of the video is when Conrades says the new PC comes with. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CONRADES: The option for color graphics and the new standard IBM keyboard with both upper- and lowercase letters. MARTIN: Upper- and lowercase. Fancy. Whoa. PALCA: (Laughter) Yeah. Yeah. Well, you remember - teletype didn't give you that. MARTIN: (Laughter) Amazing. PALCA: And the other event that really kicked the Internet revolution into high gear for most people was this announcement in 2007. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)STEVE JOBS: Today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone, and we are calling it iPhone. PALCA: The iPhone and its successors have changed everything about how most people interact with the world. In fact, Rachel, when MORNING EDITION went on the air, you had to be with a radio and near a broadcast tower, and now someone with a phone connected to the Internet could listen almost anywhere in the world. It's amazing. And so I really think that that is the big change. MARTIN: So many changes to remember over 40 years of covering science and technology. NPR science correspondent Joe Palca. Thank you, Joe. We appreciate it. PALCA: You bet.

PALCA: (Laughter) Yeah. Yeah. Well, you remember - teletype didn't give you that. MARTIN: (Laughter) Amazing. PALCA: And the other event that really kicked the Internet revolution into high gear for most people was this announcement in 2007. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEVE JOBS: Today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone, and we are calling it iPhone. PALCA: The iPhone and its successors have changed everything about how most people interact with the world. In fact, Rachel, when MORNING EDITION went on the air, you had to be with a radio and near a broadcast tower, and now someone with a phone connected to the Internet could listen almost anywhere in the world. It's amazing. And so I really think that that is the big change. MARTIN: So many changes to remember over 40 years of covering science and technology. NPR science correspondent Joe Palca.

The idea is to send in your saliva and receive data on your ethnic heritage or even get connected with long lost cousins. Most companies have guaranteed that they'll protect their users' genetic information, but experts say a recent case in Florida makes it clear this is not so certain. Erin Murphy is a professor at New York University's law school. She focuses on forensic evidence and the criminal justice system. Professor, thanks for joining us. ERIN MURPHY: Thank you for having me. SIMON: So what happened in Florida? MURPHY: Well, law enforcement in Florida petitioned a court for a warrant to conduct a search or continue a genealogical search in a database known as GEDmatch. And listeners may remember that name because that was the same database that was used when the Golden State killer case broke the first investigative genetic genealogy kind of law enforcement investigation. And the difference in this case is that that database was about, at the time of the Golden State Killer case, was about 1. 2 million users who had voluntarily uploaded their genetic information. And they had agreed to make it kind of publicly available. They had kind of put it out for the world to see. When there was a sort of backlash against the law enforcement use in that case, ultimately, GEDmatch decided to kind of put everybody back into a pool of, you know, kind of protected users. So overnight, this database went from 1. 2 million open samples to zero. So the difference in this case is that law enforcement didn't have access to an open platform that any ordinary person could use. Instead they had to go to a court and say, let us do this genealogical work in a database where users have, you know, sort of specifically not opted back in or have failed to opt back in to law enforcement access. SIMON: So this changes everything doesn't it, potentially? MURPHY: I think it does, although I also think it was an obvious next step. I mean, the reality is these searches are more efficient the bigger the database. And studies have shown that if you have a 3 million person database, you have effective genetic transparency for everyone in that population. You know, the example given is usually people of European descent because that's the primary consumers in the United States of these services. If 3 million people of European descent offer their genetic information to a database, you have essentially a universal genetic database for the American population of European descent. So what this changes, I think, is the plausible, you know, claim that this is just about people who've chosen to share. Now its clear law enforcement's position is if genetic information exists, we should be able to go to a court and get it. And it really has, I think, a downstream set of consequences for databases that we may really worry about people stopping contributing to, like research databases or other kind of medical or clinical databases that are really important. SIMON: What about the argument I gather some people in law enforcement have made, is that this could help them solve hundreds or thousands of cases? MURPHY: You know, that's obviously always a compelling argument. And I think it has to be taken seriously. One response I would give is, if that is the case, let people decide whether they think that's valuable. And one way for them to make that decision is to say law enforcement, you can use my genomic data. The second thing I would say is, right now law enforcement says oh, you know, this is for serial killers and rapes. These are for these really compelling cases of a great, strong public interest where there's broad consensus, but there is no regulatory requirement that be the case. It's completely at law enforcement's discretion to only look for murderers or rapists. And if they're going to do that kind of sensitive testing, you know, I think there should be more regulatory restrictions. And right now, it's really all at their discretion. There's not a set of rules that law enforcement has signed on to, much less been compelled to follow. SIMON: What if somebody wants to protect their DNA information - doesn't want to share it with government sources? MURPHY: Well, I think there are few answers to that. I mean, I think the most important thing is call your legislator and tell them I want to be able to make this choice. I don't want to have to choose between, you know, doing this kind of recreational or maybe even clinical testing that I'm interested in and becoming completely transparent to anybody anywhere. Second, I would say if, you know, you've already participated, almost all the major platforms or all of the major platforms allow you to delete information. So you can take down your information if you're worried about it being accessed. And the last thing I should say quickly is just, you know, the companies can make promises about their protections of privacy, but you also have to be a careful and discriminating consumer and realize they may break those promises. So Family Tree DNA, you know, signed on to a privacy statement that said we're not going to share information. They had a very prominent privacy promise on their website. And then it came out they had been secretly cooperating with the FBI. SIMON: Forgive me for putting it this bluntly, but is the battle already over? Don't consumers make decisions on the side of convenience all the time over privacy? MURPHY: I hope not, and I don't think so. And I think that there's something different about this kind of information because it has such profound future implications and broad implications. And I think one interesting thing about genomic data is that this is a kind of information where one person in a multi-thousand-person family tree can expose the genetic information of every other person without their consent or even knowledge because how many of us know our third, fourth cousin? SIMON: Erin Murphy, professor at NYU Law School, thanks so much for being with us. MURPHY: It's my pleasure. Thank you.

NPR science correspondent Joe Palca explains. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: When a virus infects a cell in our bodies, it hijacks the cell's molecular machinery to make copies of itself. Those new viruses can go on to spread the infection through your body. CAMERON MYHRVOLD: We need to be able to cut the virus at a fast enough rate to slow down replication or to stop replication from happening. PALCA: Cameron Myhrvold is a postdoc at the Broad Institute in Cambridge. Myhrvold works with so-called RNA viruses - viruses that package their genetic information in RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA. To cut the viral RNA, he uses a molecular tool called CRISPR - in this case, CRISPR-Cas3 - that can target a specific region of RNA. MYHRVOLD: Cas13, when it finds its target, it can become very active and start to cut other RNAs. PALCA: Finding the right target is key. There's a lot of RNAs inside cells that are necessary for the cell to survive. So it's important to find an RNA target that's unique to the virus you're trying to control. Myhrvold says RNA viruses are particularly difficult to control because they're a bit like shape shifters. They tend to change their genetic sequences when you try to pin them down. MYHRVOLD: They really want to understand what the virus is doing in response to Cas13 treatment. PALCA: Myhrvold's colleague Catherine Freije says what the virus does in response to treatment should be informative. CATHERINE FREIJE: That could potentially teach us about what parts of the virus are particularly important for its function. PALCA: And that, in turn, will show the best places to target the virus in order to disable it. So far, Freije and Myhrvold say they've only showed their anti-viral treatment works in cells. But Pardis Sabeti, head of the lab they work in, is bullish about using the CRISPR-Cas13 system to treat viral infections in people. PARDIS SABETI: There's still a bunch of things we want to work out, but we feel pretty confident that this will work as a therapy if it can be delivered in the right way. PALCA: By delivering, she means getting the CRISPR-Cas13 tool into the right cells inside an infected patient. Now, CRISPR-Cas13 specifically targets RNA, so it will only be useful for illnesses caused by RNA viruses, like flu and Zika. But Janice Chen says researchers are now finding a variety of CRISPRs with different properties. Chen is chief research officer at Mammoth Biosciences, a company that hopes to capitalize on CRISPR technology. JANICE CHEN: Having a broader CRISPR toolbox is really important to figuring out what is the specific need for any given application. PALCA: Progress in building that toolbox has proceeded quite quickly. After all, it's only been six years since scientists first became aware of how powerful a tool CRISPR could be.

The scientists aboard are there to do fieldwork, which is easier said than done, as Ravenna Koenig reports. RAVENNA KOENIG, BYLINE: If you spend your days on Arctic ice, one of the big challenges you could face comes in the form of a neighbor. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Polar bear. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Polar bear. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Oh, polar bear. KOENIG: On the deck of a ship moving through the frozen landscape, everyone runs to the side to see a polar bear padding along in the distance. This vessel is here helping set up an experiment to study the changing Arctic. It's called MOSAiC, or the Multidisciplinary Drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate. And this isn't the last time that the MOSAiC team will encounter polar bears. DAVID CHU: I've never had a problem with large, cuddly, carnivorous mammals before until they started disrupting my work. KOENIG: David Chu works for the U. S. Department of Energy and came out here to set up some atmospheric monitoring equipment. CHU: We had a mama bear and a cub that would quite frequently come visit us. KOENIG: Polar bear guards stand watch. And if a bear comes into sight, they alert everyone and, in some situations, make noise to scare it away. Trude Hohle is one of those guards. TRUDE HOHLE: Flare guns is very efficient. All of us has to have a good voice. We can use that, raise it and try to be bigger than the bear. KOENIG: They also carry guns for protection, but that's only as an absolute last resort. Another obvious challenge to working in the Arctic is the cold. Temperatures in this area can get as low as negative 50 degrees Fahrenheit. But working even in the single digits for hours at a time can take a toll. It's not just unpleasant; it can affect your thinking. TIM STANTON: We call it the Arctic blahs, and everybody gets it. You just - your mind's not right on top. KOENIG: Tim Stanton is an ocean physicist who's worked in the Arctic for decades. He says you do as much prep work as you can before you go out, but you can't escape having to use your brain on the ice. STANTON: You still have to think through some things, and that often takes, like, three times longer than it would in a cozy office. KOENIG: Then there's the fact that if anything goes wrong - and something always does - you can't just run to a hardware store. These scientists pack loads of extra tools and spare parts, but they can't prepare for everything. CHRIS COX: You cannot predict what's going to get you, right? It's going to be something you didn't anticipate. KOENIG: Chris Cox is an atmospheric scientist. And out in the field, his team had to deal with a finicky panel that was supposed to help get power to their equipment. He just found a way to rewire around it. COX: In an environment like this, it's almost easier to come up with those solutions, and I think the reason is that you don't have choices. KOENIG: When I asked these researchers what got them through the challenges of an Arctic work day, three big themes emerged. One, prepare. Two, don't panic.

Right? He's been getting a lot of attention lately for unveiling a new electric pickup truck that's been dubbed the Cybertruck. Well, a few months ago, he was hawking another one of his companies called Neuralink. He said the company's goal is to stitch computer wires - he called them threads - straight into human brains. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ELON MUSK: This, I think, has a very good purpose, which is to cure important diseases and ultimately to help secure humanity's future. GREENE: OK - high expectations there. Now, if you're wondering about curing diseases by connecting our brains to computers and whether this is possible, you would not be alone. But Musk's company is part of a fledgling industry that is trying to make this the wave of the future. And NPR's Elise Hu has been reporting on this in her series we call Future You. Hi, Elise. ELISE HU, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: All right. So this is the final report in your series, and you've been looking at ethical questions raised by businesses that are promoting this brain-computer interface. And we should say, Musk is not the only one who's spending a whole lot of money on this kind of thing. HU: No, he's not. Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook is another one. Then there's a guy named Bryan Johnson; he's a billionaire who founded the backbone to the payment system Venmo. And these tech moguls - and others - believe that if you can unlock the mysteries of our minds, then computers would be better able to read them and then better work inside them. GREENE: OK. So what case are all these people making for why this is a good investment? HU: I interviewed Bryan Johnson, whose company is working on this. It is called Kernel, and he's just as expansive as Elon Musk - or maybe even more so - in his vision of solving every problem known to humanity. BRYAN JOHNSON: If we are to address climate change, the risk of pandemics, of wars, terrorism, of mental illness, of everything we care to solve in the world, there's one thing they all have in common - our minds. My hope is that when we build tools with Kernel and that we can begin evolving our cognition - that if we do that, it's the fastest possible path to addressing every other problem we care about. HU: And Kernel is starting with a non-invasive cap - so a way to do this without stitching anything into our heads. But this is big talk. It envisions that everyone would be connected to computers at some point in the future and kind of rewiring ourselves to solve humanity's problems. GREENE: I mean, I love dreaming big - obviously. But I mean, this is a huge leap. I mean, we don't even know if these devices are going to work like they say they're going to work. And I would assume there'd be some regulatory stuff that would have to happen before we can actually be used. Right? HU: Right. And right now we're discussing a lot of the ethical questions here. And I've been looking at whether this kind of thing works at all over the course of this series. I've tried on a couple devices to connect with other machines; I moved two different robots just by thinking about it. So in this reporting, I have seen that science, and it's been making tremendous leaps forward. GREENE: But I also like that you've really boiled this down to one very important question, which is - should we even be trying to upgrade ourselves, upgrade people with computers? HU: And that's a key question. And I spoke with the tech ethicist Tristan Harris, who used to be at Google. He went on to found a thing called the Center for Humane Technology. And he told me about some of the things he worries about, beginning with the fact that, at this moment in history, you might say that many of us have been cognitively downgraded by our technology because we are so addicted to and distracted by our phones. And those aren't even connected to our bodies. TRISTAN HARRIS: What got us into the present situation where our attention spans are 40 seconds on any computer screen? What got us there wasn't - let's make our attention spans short. What got us there is - let's give ourselves superpowers. And we didn't know ourselves well enough that when we gave ourselves superpowers, we debased our way of making attention. HU: Tristan Harris says we need to assess where we are now before we introduce the kind of mind-computer connections that some of these entrepreneurs are talking about. HARRIS: If we don't even have a balance sheet of - these are the harms - and we're just eager to just race into the future and get to that future milestone, this is why - it's not about focusing on the present so much as it's about understanding carefully, like, where is this good and where is it in control and where is it happening with wisdom when we're making technology? HU: Just some of the considerations as this brain-machine interface industry becomes, by one estimate, a multibillion-dollar industry over the next few years. GREENE: All right. Elise's series Future You, with Elise Hu wraps up with an animated episode on neuro ethics and the future. You can catch it on npr. org and also on NPR's YouTube channel. Elise, I just want to say I'm going to miss this series. Thanks so much for all the great stuff. HU: Me, too. Thank you. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  Elon Musk, the co-founder of Tesla, is known for these audacious business plans that grab a whole lot of attention. Right? He's been getting a lot of attention lately for unveiling a new electric pickup truck that's been dubbed the Cybertruck. Well, a few months ago, he was hawking another one of his companies called Neuralink. He said the company's goal is to stitch computer wires - he called them threads - straight into human brains. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ELON MUSK: This, I think, has a very good purpose, which is to cure important diseases and ultimately to help secure humanity's future. GREENE: OK - high expectations there. Now, if you're wondering about curing diseases by connecting our brains to computers and whether this is possible, you would not be alone. But Musk's company is part of a fledgling industry that is trying to make this the wave of the future. And NPR's Elise Hu has been reporting on this in her series we call Future You. Hi, Elise. ELISE HU, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: All right. So this is the final report in your series, and you've been looking at ethical questions raised by businesses that are promoting this brain-computer interface. And we should say, Musk is not the only one who's spending a whole lot of money on this kind of thing. HU: No, he's not. Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook is another one. Then there's a guy named Bryan Johnson; he's a billionaire who founded the backbone to the payment system Venmo. And these tech moguls - and others - believe that if you can unlock the mysteries of our minds, then computers would be better able to read them and then better work inside them. GREENE: OK. So what case are all these people making for why this is a good investment? HU: I interviewed Bryan Johnson, whose company is working on this. It is called Kernel, and he's just as expansive as Elon Musk - or maybe even more so - in his vision of solving every problem known to humanity. BRYAN JOHNSON: If we are to address climate change, the risk of pandemics, of wars, terrorism, of mental illness, of everything we care to solve in the world, there's one thing they all have in common - our minds.

I'm Guy Raz, and on the show today, ideas about Falling In And Out Of Love. HELEN FISHER: We are playing with one of the most powerful brain systems that ever evolved. I mean, this is a survival mechanism. It evolved millions of years ago. And I'm not surprised that people suffer in love. RAZ: This is Helen Fisher. FISHER: I'm a biological anthropologist, and I study love. RAZ: And Helen is actually the chief science advisor to match. com and one of the country's leading experts on love. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: All right. Let me just ask you about love. I mean, I know - I don't mean to sound reductive. It's much more complicated. But can we say there's a place in our brain where love or feelings of love resides? FISHER: There's a place in our brain where all feelings reside. Every time you think something, do something, feel something, there's something going on in the brain. I came to believe, really, that we've evolved three distinctly different brain systems for mating and reproduction. One is the sex drive, second is feelings of intense romantic love, and the third is feelings of deep attachment. And I became quite convinced that all three resided in the brain and that if I looked, I could find some of the brain circuitry of romantic love and feelings of attachment. RAZ: And according to Helen, romantic love and attachment aren't even feelings. FISHER: They're drives. RAZ: Meaning they fulfill a biological need. FISHER: In fact, the basic brain region that generates the feelings of intense romantic love - that factory lies at the base of the brain right near a factory that orchestrates thirst and hunger. Thirst and hunger keep you alive today. Romantic love enables you to focus your mating energy on a particular individual and drive your DNA into tomorrow. So I and my brain-scanning partner Lucy Brown have come to believe that romantic love is a survival mechanism. RAZ: So if love is primarily a drive - right? - it's driven by biology, right? Like, how much agency do we actually have in that process? FISHER: Well, I think that we have a lot of agency. We're constantly making choices. I mean, you know, we tend to fall in love with somebody who has the same socioeconomic background, same general level of intelligence, same general level of good looks. But you can walk into a room, and everybody's from your background and good looks, and you don't fall in love with all of them. We make choices. And, you know, we carry in our head what I call a love map, an unconscious list of what you're looking for in a partner. And when the timing is right and somebody comes by who fits within that general perspective of who you're looking for, you can instantly trigger that brain circuitry for romantic love and be off to the races. RAZ: I mean, it's amazing because there is both - I mean, there's this - there's a drive. Our brains, as you say, are smart, and they figure out the person that it thinks we will be most compatible with. But then we also have agency, too. Like, we also can engineer it. FISHER: There's no question about it. The - one of the problems when you - once you've fallen madly in love, basic brain regions, like, with decision-making begin to shut down. And so you can overlook a lot. Oh, he's so cute. It doesn't matter he has a wife. He'll divorce her. Oh, she's just so charming. She'll get over her anger problem. So what you got to do is make your choices just like you said. You've got to use that agency before you fall in love. You know, if you begin to fall for somebody who you know is lying to you, the way out is through the door. We've evolved a huge cerebral cortex. We can overcome our drives. I mean, people have a drive to eat sugar. We can say, no, thank you. But you've got to realize who you are. Understand your assets and your defects and cognitively think of work-arounds. We can do this. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Does our brain chemistry make it harder to fall out of love than to fall in love? FISHER: It's extremely difficult to do. You know, we - I and my colleagues have put 15 people who had just been rejected in love into a brain scanner, and we ended up finding that those people who were still madly in love with somebody who had just dumped them - they still showed activity in this ventral tegmental area, a little factory near the base of the brain that pumps out the dopamine. It gives you that elation. We still found activity in a brain region linked with feelings of deep attachment to the partner. You don't stop loving somebody just because they've dumped you. We found activity in three brain regions linked with addiction, particularly the primary brain region - it's called the nucleus accumbens - that is associated with all of the addictions. So you still crave the person. And we even found activity in the brain region linked with physical pain - not only the distress that goes along with pain, but physical pain. So, you know, the brain is really in overdrive, and to conquer all of that, you really have to treat it as an addiction. Throw out the cards and letters. Don't write. Don't call. Don't show up. Assemble what you know about the situation. Create a story. And after you've built that story, then you can throw it out. And finally, of course, you put your life back together, and you move on. And matter of fact - we've proven that, in the brain, when we put these rejected people into the brain scanner, we ended up finding that those people who had been rejected quite a while ago - let's say several months as opposed to several days - we find less and less activity in this brain region linked with attachment. As time goes by, feelings of attachment and probably romantic love also begin to decline. So time does heal. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: So Helen, my last question for you is about sort of the science of love, right? I'm wondering, like, even with all of the advances in technology and all of our abilities to measure brain activity, are we still at a place where we've just scratched the scientific surface? FISHER: We've just scratched the scientific surface. But we've come a long way. I mean, you know, when I was growing up, people believed that romantic love was part of the supernatural. RAZ: Yeah. FISHER: We've proven that it's not, that this is a very specific brain system, that it is triggered under certain circumstances, that you can get over it if you treat it as an addiction and do certain things. We have more and more cognitive control over this powerful survival mechanismRAZ: That's Helen Fisher. She's a biological anthropologist. You can see all of Helen's talks at ted. com.

DESSA: Yeah, I wanted it out. I don't want to spend, like, all my good years obsessing on this dude who I can't win with. RAZ: This is Dessa. She's a musician, and you're actually hearing one of her songs. And for a long time, Dessa was desperately trying to move on from an unhealthy relationship. DESSA: It was one of those volatile ones, you know, where it's almost, like, difficult to put the relationship up against the tape measure to figure out how long it lasted because it was on and off for so long. But I would say that we first met and fell into love when we were 21 years old, and we were still tempted to try to give it another shot, like, 14 years later. RAZ: Wow. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"IT'S ONLY ME\")DESSA: (Singing) Hello. It's only me. I know it's late. RAZ: And was it - like, how would you characterize your relationship? DESSA: The most confident description that I could give it would be passionate, playful, unconventional, I think. I would also say it was bitterly sad, jealous, lonely. And I think that I've learned about the smallest of my feelings. Like, I really got to meet the worst of me in that relationship. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"IT'S ONLY ME\")DESSA: (Singing) Love is never free. RAZ: So here you are in a situation that I think millions people can relate to - right? - the irrationality of being in love with somebody who you know is not right, is not the right person. DESSA: Yes (laughter). RAZ: Did you feel trapped? DESSA: I felt spun out. I felt sad. I also felt sort of embarrassed. Like, it did not jive with my feminist intuitions to be so torn up over a dude for so long. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"IT'S ONLY ME\")DESSA: (Singing) Hello. It's only me. It started to get harder. So it's, like, even the - if you can imagine being on stage and it's loud and there are bright lights and everybody's had a few shots of whiskey, like, that bombast and that big victory feeling, both hands in the air and the big bow at the end, it was just getting harder to do because I knew that when I got off stage I was going to be so sad again. RAZ: Here's more from Dessa on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)DESSA: And even though I knew it wasn't doing either of us any good, I just couldn't figure out how to put the love down. Then drinking my wine one night, I saw a TED Talk by a woman named Dr. Helen Fisher. And she said that in her work, she'd been able to map the coordinates of love in the human brain. And I thought, well, if I could find my love in my brain, maybe I could get it out. So I went to Twitter. Anybody got access to an fMRI lab, like, at midnight or something? I'll trade for backstage passes and whiskey. (LAUGHTER)DESSA: And that's Dr. Cheryl Olman, who works at the University of Minnesota's Center for Magnetic Resonance Research. She took me up on it. I explained the - Dr. Fisher's protocol, and we decided to recreate it with a sample size of one - me. (LAUGHTER)DESSA: So I got decked out in a pair of forest green scrubs, and I was laid on a gurney and wheeled into an fMRI machine. If you're unfamiliar with that technology, essentially, an fMRI machine is a big, tubular magnet that tracks the progress of deoxygenated iron in your blood. So it's essentially figuring out what parts of your brain are making the biggest metabolic demand at any given moment, and in that way, it can figure out which structures are associated with the task - like tapping your finger, for example, will always light up the same region or, in my case, looking at pictures of your ex-boyfriend and then looking at pictures of a dude who just sort of resembled my ex-boyfriend but for whom I had no strong feelings. He was the control. And when I left the machine, we had these really high-resolution images of my brain. After she'd had time to analyze the data with her team and a couple of partners - Andrea and Phil - Cheryl sent me an image, a single slide. It was my brain in cross section with one bright dot of activity that represented my feelings for this dude. I'd known I was in love, and that's the whole reason I was going to these outrageous lengths. But having an image that proved it felt like such a vindication - like, yeah, it's all in my head, but now I know exactly where. (LAUGHTER)DESSA: And I also felt like an assassin who had her mark - that was what I had to annihilate. RAZ: Wow. So there was, like, a red beacon just coming out of this part of your brain when you saw photos of your ex-boyfriend, which I guess meant that your feelings for him resided in that very spot. DESSA: It was in exactly the places that Dr. Fisher's study had thought. So, like, the anterior cingulate - yes. RAZ: Yeah. DESSA: And the ventral tegmental region. And I started to cry in a coffee shop because I - don't know - it was really emotionally salient. RAZ: All right, so you've identified the part of your brain that is in love, and now you know where it is, and maybe you can, you know, do something about it. Maybe you can actually zap it, sort of. DESSA: Right. I ended up putting out another call on Twitter. I knew that I wanted to try to change that dot in my head. It was almost like - I imagine, like, you know PX90 (ph) ads in magazines? RAZ: Yeah. DESSA: How there's, like, the before picture? Yeah. RAZ: (Laughter) Yeah, yeah, and the after. DESSA: So, like, I had my before picture, yes. RAZ: So you have your before picture, and you're looking to go to your after picture, like, the picture of your brain without the red dot in it. DESSA: Exactly. RAZ: Yeah. DESSA: So I ended up working with this woman named Penijean Gracefire, and she was a clinician for neuro feedback. So essentially, you've got all these sensors affixed to your scalp, and they're measuring the electricity that your brain is generating, like, right through the bone and through the hair, so you can see what parts of your brain are active in real time. She'd done some research on, like, what parts of the brain were responsible for emotional regulation, and she thought, OK, I think we should target these areas in your head (laughter) to try to see if we can get them to be a little less vigilant, to chill out. And we worked at my dad's house because he has a flat-screen TV, so I could see my brain big. I could see, like, waves of color passing over this image of my brain that indicated which parts were hyperactive, which parts were hypoactive. And then the way that she described it, which I found helpful, was like - we're not trying to blunt your brain's ability to fall in love; we are trying to do - is, like, analogous to the way that you might train a muscle at the gym. You're trying to strengthen it. You're trying to make it more flexible. What - really, what you're trying to do is make sure that it can respond in a way that's appropriate to its circumstance. RAZ: Yeah. DESSA: So whenever my brain would dip towards lower levels of activity. . . RAZ: Yeah. DESSA: . . . Not only could I see it, but I could hear it. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)DESSA: And every time my brain operated in that healthy threshold, I got a little run of harp or vibraphone music. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DESSA: And I just watched my brain rotate at roughly the speed of a gyro machine on my dad's flat-screen TV. She said the learning would be essentially unconscious. But then I thought about the other things that I had learned without actively engaging my conscious mind. When you ride a bike - I don't really know what, like, my left calf muscle's doing or latissimus dorsi knows to engage when I wobble to the right; the body just learns. And similarly, like, Pavlov's dogs probably don't know a lot about, like, protein structures or the waveform of a ringing bell, but they salivate nonetheless because the body paired the stimuli. Finished the sessions. Went back to Dr. Cheryl Olman's fMRI machine, and we repeated the protocol. And after she had time to analyze that second set of data, she said, Dude A's dominance of your brain seems to essentially have been eradicated. I think this is the desired result, comma, yes, question mark? (LAUGHTER)DESSA: It wasn't the case that I felt like I was now, like, a loveless robot. You know what I mean? RAZ: Right. DESSA: I didn't feel like Spock. And it wasn't the case that I'd forgotten anything, if that makes sense; like, I hadn't erased any memories. But I did feel some relief. RAZ: You did feel like you extracted some of those feelings of love, those strong feelings of love? DESSA: The compulsion. RAZ: Yeah. DESSA: I just wasn't so wrapped around the axle; I wasn't, you know? And I wasn't crying on it like I used to, and I wasn't - I don't know. I just had felt so, like, obsessively compulsive, you know? RAZ: Yeah. DESSA: And, I mean, obviously, like, I'm a sample size of one, right? But on the other hand, to be frank, it's like, I had been trying to get over this so many ways for so many years. But, yeah, I haven't gone back to that place that I was beforehand of feeling really kind out of - like, out of my own control. RAZ: Does it make you feel more open to meeting another person? DESSA: Oh, interesting. I mean, OK, I don't know if this is - this might be wishful thinking on my part. But before this, I thought, you have to get over this guy completely if you're ever going to have an honest relationship again. RAZ: Right. DESSA: And I think that makes sense. Like, you don't want to hamstring a new relationship by being cluttered with some strong, old feeling. But by this point, I think the task is to be, like, as generous to your next partner and to yourself, be frank about how much, like, emotional capacity you have. And I don't know. I have the feeling that the man that I love next will have some passionate loves in his rearview mirror as well. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"CALL OFF YOUR GHOST\")DESSA: (Singing) We've been living too long, too close. And I'm ready to let you go. I'm ready. RAZ: That's the musician Dessa. You can find her full talk at ted. com. On the show today, In and Out of Love. Stay with us. I'm Guy Raz, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. GUY RAZ, HOST:   And by the way, Helen actually inspired our next guest to try to use neuroscience to fall out of love, to get rid of her feelings for an ex-boyfriend. DESSA: Yeah, I wanted it out. I don't want to spend, like, all my good years obsessing on this dude who I can't win with. RAZ: This is Dessa. She's a musician, and you're actually hearing one of her songs. And for a long time, Dessa was desperately trying to move on from an unhealthy relationship. DESSA: It was one of those volatile ones, you know, where it's almost, like, difficult to put the relationship up against the tape measure to figure out how long it lasted because it was on and off for so long. But I would say that we first met and fell into love when we were 21 years old, and we were still tempted to try to give it another shot, like, 14 years later. RAZ: Wow. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"IT'S ONLY ME\") DESSA: (Singing) Hello. It's only me. I know it's late. RAZ: And was it - like, how would you characterize your relationship? DESSA: The most confident description that I could give it would be passionate, playful, unconventional, I think. I would also say it was bitterly sad, jealous, lonely. And I think that I've learned about the smallest of my feelings. Like, I really got to meet the worst of me in that relationship. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"IT'S ONLY ME\") DESSA: (Singing) Love is never free. RAZ: So here you are in a situation that I think millions people can relate to - right? - the irrationality of being in love with somebody who you know is not right, is not the right person. DESSA: Yes (laughter). RAZ: Did you feel trapped? DESSA: I felt spun out. I felt sad. I also felt sort of embarrassed. Like, it did not jive with my feminist intuitions to be so torn up over a dude for so long. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"IT'S ONLY ME\") DESSA: (Singing) Hello. It's only me. It started to get harder. So it's, like, even the - if you can imagine being on stage and it's loud and there are bright lights and everybody's had a few shots of whiskey, like, that bombast and that big victory feeling, both hands in the air and the big bow at the end, it was just getting harder to do because I knew that when I got off stage I was going to be so sad again. RAZ: Here's more from Dessa on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) DESSA: And even though I knew it wasn't doing either of us any good, I just couldn't figure out how to put the love down. Then drinking my wine one night, I saw a TED Talk by a woman named Dr. Helen Fisher. And she said that in her work, she'd been able to map the coordinates of love in the human brain. And I thought, well, if I could find my love in my brain, maybe I could get it out. So I went to Twitter. Anybody got access to an fMRI lab, like, at midnight or something? I'll trade for backstage passes and whiskey. (LAUGHTER) DESSA: And that's Dr. Cheryl Olman, who works at the University of Minnesota's Center for Magnetic Resonance Research. She took me up on it. I explained the - Dr. Fisher's protocol, and we decided to recreate it with a sample size of one - me. (LAUGHTER) DESSA: So I got decked out in a pair of forest green scrubs, and I was laid on a gurney and wheeled into an fMRI machine. If you're unfamiliar with that technology, essentially, an fMRI machine is a big, tubular magnet that tracks the progress of deoxygenated iron in your blood. So it's essentially figuring out what parts of your brain are making the biggest metabolic demand at any given moment, and in that way, it can figure out which structures are associated with the task - like tapping your finger, for example, will always light up the same region or, in my case, looking at pictures of your ex-boyfriend and then looking at pictures of a dude who just sort of resembled my ex-boyfriend but for whom I had no strong feelings. He was the control. And when I left the machine, we had these really high-resolution images of my brain. After she'd had time to analyze the data with her team and a couple of partners - Andrea and Phil - Cheryl sent me an image, a single slide. It was my brain in cross section with one bright dot of activity that represented my feelings for this dude. I'd known I was in love, and that's the whole reason I was going to these outrageous lengths. But having an image that proved it felt like such a vindication - like, yeah, it's all in my head, but now I know exactly where. (LAUGHTER) DESSA: And I also felt like an assassin who had her mark - that was what I had to annihilate. RAZ: Wow. So there was, like, a red beacon just coming out of this part of your brain when you saw photos of your ex-boyfriend, which I guess meant that your feelings for him resided in that very spot. DESSA: It was in exactly the places that Dr. Fisher's study had thought. So, like, the anterior cingulate - yes. RAZ: Yeah. DESSA: And the ventral tegmental region. And I started to cry in a coffee shop because I - don't know - it was really emotionally salient. RAZ: All right, so you've identified the part of your brain that is in love, and now you know where it is, and maybe you can, you know, do something about it. Maybe you can actually zap it, sort of. DESSA: Right. I ended up putting out another call on Twitter. I knew that I wanted to try to change that dot in my head. It was almost like - I imagine, like, you know PX90 (ph) ads in magazines? RAZ: Yeah. DESSA: How there's, like, the before picture? Yeah. RAZ: (Laughter) Yeah, yeah, and the after. DESSA: So, like, I had my before picture, yes. RAZ: So you have your before picture, and you're looking to go to your after picture, like, the picture of your brain without the red dot in it. DESSA: Exactly. RAZ: Yeah. DESSA: So I ended up working with this woman named Penijean Gracefire, and she was a clinician for neuro feedback. So essentially, you've got all these sensors affixed to your scalp, and they're measuring the electricity that your brain is generating, like, right through the bone and through the hair, so you can see what parts of your brain are active in real time. She'd done some research on, like, what parts of the brain were responsible for emotional regulation, and she thought, OK, I think we should target these areas in your head (laughter) to try to see if we can get them to be a little less vigilant, to chill out. And we worked at my dad's house because he has a flat-screen TV, so I could see my brain big. I could see, like, waves of color passing over this image of my brain that indicated which parts were hyperactive, which parts were hypoactive. And then the way that she described it, which I found helpful, was like - we're not trying to blunt your brain's ability to fall in love; we are trying to do - is, like, analogous to the way that you might train a muscle at the gym. You're trying to strengthen it. You're trying to make it more flexible. What - really, what you're trying to do is make sure that it can respond in a way that's appropriate to its circumstance. RAZ: Yeah. DESSA: So whenever my brain would dip towards lower levels of activity. . . RAZ: Yeah. DESSA: . . . Not only could I see it, but I could hear it. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) DESSA: And every time my brain operated in that healthy threshold, I got a little run of harp or vibraphone music. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DESSA: And I just watched my brain rotate at roughly the speed of a gyro machine on my dad's flat-screen TV. She said the learning would be essentially unconscious. But then I thought about the other things that I had learned without actively engaging my conscious mind. When you ride a bike - I don't really know what, like, my left calf muscle's doing or latissimus dorsi knows to engage when I wobble to the right; the body just learns. And similarly, like, Pavlov's dogs probably don't know a lot about, like, protein structures or the waveform of a ringing bell, but they salivate nonetheless because the body paired the stimuli. Finished the sessions. Went back to Dr. Cheryl Olman's fMRI machine, and we repeated the protocol. And after she had time to analyze that second set of data, she said, Dude A's dominance of your brain seems to essentially have been eradicated. I think this is the desired result, comma, yes, question mark? (LAUGHTER) DESSA: It wasn't the case that I felt like I was now, like, a loveless robot. You know what I mean? RAZ: Right. DESSA: I didn't feel like Spock. And it wasn't the case that I'd forgotten anything, if that makes sense; like, I hadn't erased any memories. But I did feel some relief. RAZ: You did feel like you extracted some of those feelings of love, those strong feelings of love? DESSA: The compulsion. RAZ: Yeah. DESSA: I just wasn't so wrapped around the axle; I wasn't, you know? And I wasn't crying on it like I used to, and I wasn't - I don't know. I just had felt so, like, obsessively compulsive, you know?

GUY WINCH: There is some kind of debate about whether love should actually be classified as an addiction. RAZ: This is psychologist Guy Winch. WINCH: It's a little cynical, and it's a little, probably, unpopular. But if we're just looking at what happens in the brain, then it might need to be regulated by the FDA. RAZ: OK, he's not actually serious about the FDA, but Guy knows how addictive love can be because for the past 20 years, he's counseled hundreds of patients through heartbreak. WINCH: There's nothing else in terms of a human experience that can make a perfectly reasonable person go absolutely crazy, and you will see the biggest possible deviations from normal behavior when somebody is heartbroken. And it's hard to think of another human experience that would cause that kind of extremes, but with heartbreak, you see it all the time. You know, I know people who've literally stayed in bed for weeks at a time. They don't go to work, or they go to work but spend the entire day in the bathroom crying. And then to try and get to the person, to try and change the person's mind, they will call and call and call. The person is not answering, or they've blocked them. They will spend the entire night online trying to see if they can get to them or their social media page through some avenue or outlet. The desperation people feel is profound. RAZ: And that's because on a chemical level, romantic love really is kind of like a drug. Guy Winch continues this idea from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WINCH: Brain studies have shown that the withdrawal of romantic love activates the same mechanisms in our brain that gets activated when addicts are withdrawing from substances like cocaine or opioids. Almost every one of us will have our heart broken. My patient Kathy planned her wedding when she was in middle school. She would meet her future husband by age 27, get engaged a year later and get married a year after that. But when Kathy turned 27, she found a lump in her breast. She went through many months of harsh chemotherapy and painful surgeries, and then she found a lump in her other breast and had to do it all over again. Kathy recovered, though, and soon afterwards, she met Rich and fell in love. The relationship was everything she hoped it would be. Six months later, after a lovely weekend in New England, Kathy knew he was going to propose, and she could barely contain her excitement. But Rich did not propose to Kathy that night. He broke up with her. Kathy was shattered. Her heart was truly broken, and she now faced yet another recovery. But five months after the breakup, Kathy still couldn't stop thinking about Rich. Her heart was still very much broken. The question is why? Why was this incredibly strong and determined woman unable to marshal the same emotional resources that got her through four years of cancer treatments? Why do the same coping mechanisms that get us through all kinds of life challenges fail us so miserably when our heart gets broken? What I've learned is this. When your heart is broken, the same instincts you ordinarily rely on will time and again lead you down the wrong path. You simply cannot trust what your mind is telling you. Heartbreak can make even the most reasonable and measured of us come up with mysteries and conspiracy theories where none exist. Kathy became convinced something must have happened during her romantic getaway with Rich that soured him on the relationship, and she became obsessed with figuring out what that was. And so she spent countless hours going through every minute of that weekend in her mind, searching her memory for clues that were not there. He simply wasn't in love. Heartbreak is far more insidious than we realize. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: I mean, it's amazing. We can think of so many challenging human experiences, like battling a life-threatening ailment or dealing with a crushing injury, right? And yet (laughter), as you describe in your talk, there is something about heartbreak that is, as you say, more insidious than we realize. WINCH: It's actually much more insidious because the pain it generates is so severe. When you're dealing with a terrible disease or a terrible injury or even if you're grieving a loss, the pain certainly can be very severe initially. But the difference between emotional pain and physical pain is such that if you and I discuss the time you broke your leg and you described it to me in detail, one thing will not happen, and that is your leg will not hurt from the description. RAZ: Yeah. WINCH: But emotional pain is different. If you, 20 years after the fact, tell me in detail about the time your heart was broken, you will reactivate that a little bit. RAZ: Yeah. WINCH: You will be scratching whatever's left of that. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WINCH: Heartbreak is a master manipulator. The ease with which it gets our mind to do the absolute opposite of what we need in order to recover is remarkable. We spend hours remembering their smile, how great they made us feel, that time we hiked up the mountain and made love under the stars - all that does is make our loss feel more painful. We know that, yet we still allow our mind to cycle through one greatest hit after another, like we are being held hostage by our own passive-aggressive Spotify playlist. (LAUGHTER)WINCH: Heartbreak will make those thoughts pop into your mind. And so to avoid idealizing, you have to balance them out - by remembering their frown, not just their smile; how bad they made you feel; the fact that after the lovemaking, you got lost coming down the mountain, argued like crazy and didn't speak for two days. What I tell my patients is to compile an exhaustive list of all the ways the person was wrong for you - all the bad qualities, all the pet peeves - and then keep it on your phone. (LAUGHTER)WINCH: And once you have your list, you have to use it. When I hear even a hint of idealizing or the faintest whiff of nostalgia in a session, I go - phone, please. (LAUGHTER)WINCH: Your mind will try to tell you they were perfect, but they were not, and neither was the relationship. And if you want to get over them, you have to remind yourself of that frequently. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WINCH: Now, that is not to vilify the person, but that's just to balance out the idealizing - to remind yourself of all the times that you felt miserable because of them, to remind yourself of all the times you thought, maybe I should break up because this is just not making me happy. RAZ: How much control do we have in getting over heartbreak? I mean, do we have 100% control over it or 90% control over it? Can it even be quantified? WINCH: That's a very important question because what most people do when they're heartbroken is nothing; they just ride it out. We cannot let our mind just do its thing. Our mind might be the most brilliant piece of machinery in the universe, but it requires adult supervision, and that means that we have to assert what the right things are for us to do and not do. We have to battle thoughts that are un-useful or harmful or damaging to us. When our mind says, oh, you know, I know you're not supposed to be in touch with the person that much, but wasn't her second cousin's wedding this weekend? I'm sure if I spent seven to eight hours on Instagram, I could find some kind of images of it from other people. When our mind has that brilliant idea, we need to take over and go, that's not going to be useful for me. As tempting as it is - and it is - we then have to find ways to distract ourselves, call a friend, start watching a movie, go for a run - do something that prevents us from doing that thing that our mind thought was a great idea but actually is a terrible one. So in terms of how much control we have over our recovery from heartbreak, however much we have, we need to assert. We have to have the fight with our mind. We might win some and lose some, but the fight has to be had. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: That's Guy Winch.

NPR's Joe Palca explains why. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: No, they haven't discovered a small, insectivorous mammal on Mars. The mole we're talking about is a scientific instrument carried on NASA's InSight probe that landed on Mars a year ago. TROY HUDSON: The mole is designed to measure heat flow coming out of the interior of Mars. PALCA: Troy Hudson is InSight's instrument system engineer. The mole has a pointy tip and an internal hammer that works like a kind of pile driver to pound the mole into the ground. The frustrations began last February when the mole started downward. It was supposed to go down 16 feet. Instead, it got stuck after 14 inches. Hudson says he and his team decided the problem was related to bouncing. Just like a gun recoils when you fire it, the mole recoiled ever so slightly every time the hammer tried to drive it into the ground. So instead of going down, it bounced in place. Engineers thought they might be able to prevent the bouncing if they used the scoop on InSight's robotic arm to press against the all as it hammered. They tried that in October, and it worked. HUDSON: For the first time in eight months, we have definite forward progress. PALCA: That was about six weeks ago, but Hudson knew a problem was coming. Eventually, the top of the mole would be flush with the Martian surface, and there would be nothing for the scoop to press against. So they came up with a new plan. HUDSON: We moved the scoop over to a different position nearby and pushed hard on the soil, hoping that that would transfer force to the mole through the soil rather than directly. PALCA: In late October, they sent instructions for InSight's camera to record what happened. Hudson says he was horrified when he saw the pictures. HUDSON: I was very distraught. PALCA: The mole had backed almost halfway out of the hole. Hudson is pretty sure he knows what happened. Without the arm pressing, the mole started bouncing again. HUDSON: And when it does that, loose soil in front of the mole can infiltrate in front of the tip, filling up the space that occurs whenever it bounces. And then it's just bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, and more material fills in, and it ends up backing out of the ground. PALCA: Hudson says they're confident they can use the scoop press technique to get the mole back down to where it was. HUDSON: We haven't figured out exactly what we're going to do there yet.

NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: The Parker Solar Probe was built to withstand the searing temperatures around the sun. It blasted off in August of 2018. Flybys of Venus help it adjust its orbit so that it gradually gets closer and closer to the sun. So far, it swung close by three times, coming about 15 million miles from the sun. That's a lot closer than the nearest planet, Mercury. JUSTIN KASPER: The sun's already looking very different from what we've seen before. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Justin Kasper is an astrophysicist at the University of Michigan. He says one of the biggest findings is something that could explain a long-standing mystery - why the sun's atmosphere is so much hotter than its surface. KASPER: In apparent violation of, like - oh, I don't know - the second law of thermodynamics. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says it's just weird, like if you were walking away from a campfire and, instead of getting colder, the air got hotter. KASPER: We have to identify some way that energy leaves the sun, travels out into space and then gets deposited. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says the Parker Solar Probe might have just found out how that happens. Close to the sun, there are strange features in a plasma called the solar wind, charged particles that are constantly streaming out into space. KASPER: We'd see suddenly a spike in flow where, in just a couple seconds, the solar wind would start flowing 300,000 miles an hour faster. GREENFIELDBOYCE: These spikes would only last a few seconds or minutes. KASPER: But they nearly double the speed of the solar wind. And they're so violent, they actually flip the direction of the magnetic field in the solar wind around. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The magnetic field kind of reverses itself and then straightens out again. Nicky Fox is director of NASA's Heliophysics Division and was previously the project scientist for the Parker Solar Probe. NICOLA FOX: It's kind of like twisting, like, a rubber hose. It wants to continually straighten itself again. And so whatever is causing these features, as it is straightening out, it's giving out energy. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says all of this could explain what's heating up the sun's atmosphere. FOX: And so to see the sort of smoking gun for our main questions of heating and acceleration of the solar wind was just an incredible thing. GREENFIELDBOYCE: These results are reported in the journal Nature, along with plenty of others. For example, the solar wind rotates around the sun far faster than expected. And although the solar system can be a dusty place, it looks like the sun vaporizes or pushes out nearby dust. FOX: We've actually found a dust-free region close to the sun, and that was first predicted back in 1929.

JASON TEW: Poplar, sweetgum, there's an elm right there. CHARLES: Some piles will go into plywood. Some will become puffy absorbent fiber in baby diapers.

It's just an all-around good deal. CHARLES: Most of these pellets, millions of tons each year, will get shipped to Europe where they're burned in power plants because some European governments are offering financial subsidies to burn these pellets instead of, say, coal. It's supposed to help fight climate change. Here's Seth Ginther, executive director of the industry group that represents wood pellet companies. SETH GINTHER: The carbon benefits are tremendous. CHARLES: Burning wood, also called biomass, does release lots of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas. But the idea behind the subsidies is you can let forests grow back, and as they do, they'll recapture the carbon dioxide from the air and store it in their branches and roots again. So it's considered renewable, just like wind or solar. GINTHER: The European Union literally just passed something known as the Renewable Energy Directive II and biomass - sustainable biomass - was unequivocally included as part of what can meet renewable energy goals. CHARLES: But environmental groups are challenging that decision in court. They say the idea that large-scale wood burning is carbon neutral is based on bad math. And to explain exactly why, Adam Colette from the environmental group Dogwood Alliance takes me to another patch of land in North Carolina, near the town of Williamston. ADAM COLETTE: I know it doesn't look like much, but we're going to take a little walk. CHARLES: It's covered with bushes and little trees maybe 10 feet tall. COLETTE: In the South, we call it a briar patch. But yet on paper, this is a forest. CHARLES: Four years ago, it really was a forest with big trees. Then it was logged. Some of it went to make wood pellets. So let's count up the carbon emissions accurately, Colette says. When the big trees were cut, they stopped capturing carbon dioxide from the air. That benefit was lost, at least temporarily, and some of the carbon they'd previously stored was released into the air when the wood pellets were burned and as tree roots decomposed. But you won't see any of that in the official calculations of greenhouse emissions, he says. COLETTE: None of it's ever been counted in any of our, like, emissions counting in the U. S. or in Europe. CHARLES: That's because the forest eventually will grow back and recapture that lost carbon, but it could take a century for that to happen. Now, Seth Ginther from the U. S. Industrial Pellet Association says his industry should not be blamed for those carbon emissions because wood pellets are not the reason forests are cleared. GINTHER: These are lands that are being harvested for sawtimber, for housing, for paper and for other things. What we're taking is the byproduct of that.

COLETTE: You have more knocks on those doors, more telephone calls saying, hey, I'll give you X number of dollars for your trees. CHARLES: What Colette wants is for officials to knock on those doors with a different message, encouraging landowners to maintain forests, expand them. COLETTE: Our forests are young; they're degraded. And what that means is that the potential to suck carbon out of the atmosphere of forests in the U. S. South is enormous.

Only a couple dozen atoms of the stuff have ever existed. For the 150th anniversary of the periodic table, NPR science correspondent Joe Palca has the convoluted story of one of the latest elements to be added. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Tennessine lies at the outer edges of the periodic table. It's one of a group of unstable synthetic elements that don't last very long before they vanish. To make tennessine, you need to fuse together two existing elements - in this case, calcium and another nonnatural element, berkelium. And the only place you can get enough berkelium to try to do that is a special nuclear reactor at the Department of Energy Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. What comes out of the reactor is a mixture of exotic elements. The berkelium has to be separated out. CLARICE PHELPS: They perform that separation, and they give us what's called the Berkelium cut. PALCA: Clarice Phelps is a researcher at Oak Ridge. She and her colleagues then purified the berkelium. PHELPS: It took us a couple of months, about three months. PALCA: Finally, they had about 22 milligrams of the pure stuff. Now, there are only a handful of labs that can fire calcium ions at a berkelium target to make tennessine. One is in Russia. So Oak Ridge packed up the highly radioactive berkelium in specially shielded containers. A shipping company sent the containers up to New York's JFK Airport. There, they were loaded onto a plane headed for Moscow. But there was a problem. KRZYSZTOF RYKACZEWSKI: Somebody in this, you know, shipping company forgot to give papers to the captain (ph). PALCA: Krzysztof Rykaczewski is a senior researcher at Oak Ridge. He says when the plane landed, Russian customs agents were confronted with several large containers festooned with hazardous material labels and no paperwork describing the contents. RYKACZEWSKI: They immediately sent it back with the same plane to New York. PALCA: After returning to JFK, the berkelium set off again, with shipping papers. According to Rykaczewski, this time the customs agents said, yes, the papers are in order. RYKACZEWSKI: But we would like to have such papers by fax when the plane is starting so we are better prepared to receive the cargo. PALCA: Back to New York again. On the fifth trans-Atlantic flight, the berkelium was allowed into Russia, where it was sent on yet another plane to the Joint Institute of Nuclear Research in Dubna. For five months, scientists there used the cyclotron to fire calcium ions at the berkelium, hoping some of them would fuse with the target to form Element 117, what would later be called tennessine. Rykaczewski says the expectation was they wouldn't see the element directly; it was likely only to last a fraction of a second. Instead, they expected to see a specific pattern as 117 decayed into lighter elements. RYKACZEWSKI: And everything was nicely fitting to the picture that we observed - six decays of Element 117. PALCA: In other words, in five months, they only got six atoms of tennessine. When I first heard that name, I thought it was a mistake. All the other synthetic elements ended in -ium - think plutonium or americium. Oak Ridge nuclear engineer Julie Ezold understands my confusion. JULIE EZOLD: We all thought it was going to be that way as well. But remember - the periodic table has rules. PALCA: Ezold says Element 117 fits in a column of the periodic table filled with compounds called halogens - fluorine, chlorine, bromine. EZOLD: Therefore, its name had to end in -ine. So instead of tennessium (ph), it's tennessine. PALCA: Tennessine might not be the last element to be added to the periodic table. The search is underway for new ones. I asked Krzysztof Rykaczewski if he was part of the search. RYKACZEWSKI: Yes. It's fun, you know? It's a really great thing to discover a new element (laughter). PALCA: Joe Palca, NPR News.

PALCA: Clarice Phelps is a researcher at Oak Ridge. She and her colleagues then purified the berkelium. PHELPS: It took us a couple of months, about three months. PALCA: Finally, they had about 22 milligrams of the pure stuff. Now, there are only a handful of labs that can fire calcium ions at a berkelium target to make tennessine. One is in Russia. So Oak Ridge packed up the highly radioactive berkelium in specially shielded containers. A shipping company sent the containers up to New York's JFK Airport. There, they were loaded onto a plane headed for Moscow. But there was a problem. KRZYSZTOF RYKACZEWSKI: Somebody in this, you know, shipping company forgot to give papers to the captain (ph). PALCA: Krzysztof Rykaczewski is a senior researcher at Oak Ridge. He says when the plane landed, Russian customs agents were confronted with several large containers festooned with hazardous material labels and no paperwork describing the contents. RYKACZEWSKI: They immediately sent it back with the same plane to New York. PALCA: After returning to JFK, the berkelium set off again, with shipping papers. According to Rykaczewski, this time the customs agents said, yes, the papers are in order. RYKACZEWSKI: But we would like to have such papers by fax when the plane is starting so we are better prepared to receive the cargo. PALCA: Back to New York again. On the fifth trans-Atlantic flight, the berkelium was allowed into Russia, where it was sent on yet another plane to the Joint Institute of Nuclear Research in Dubna. For five months, scientists there used the cyclotron to fire calcium ions at the berkelium, hoping some of them would fuse with the target to form Element 117, what would later be called tennessine. Rykaczewski says the expectation was they wouldn't see the element directly; it was likely only to last a fraction of a second. Instead, they expected to see a specific pattern as 117 decayed into lighter elements. RYKACZEWSKI: And everything was nicely fitting to the picture that we observed - six decays of Element 117. PALCA: In other words, in five months, they only got six atoms of tennessine. When I first heard that name, I thought it was a mistake. All the other synthetic elements ended in -ium - think plutonium or americium. Oak Ridge nuclear engineer Julie Ezold understands my confusion. JULIE EZOLD: We all thought it was going to be that way as well. But remember - the periodic table has rules. PALCA: Ezold says Element 117 fits in a column of the periodic table filled with compounds called halogens - fluorine, chlorine, bromine. EZOLD: Therefore, its name had to end in -ine. So instead of tennessium (ph), it's tennessine. PALCA: Tennessine might not be the last element to be added to the periodic table. The search is underway for new ones. I asked Krzysztof Rykaczewski if he was part of the search. RYKACZEWSKI: Yes. It's fun, you know? It's a really great thing to discover a new element (laughter). PALCA: Joe Palca, NPR News.

From WNYC, Fred Mogul reports on the rush to study whale habitat before hundreds of wind turbines rise from the ocean floor off the coast of New York. JOHN: Morning Star, is that you looking for whales? FRED MOGUL, BYLINE: Captain Jim Miller pilots his boat, the Morning Star, out onto the Atlantic. JIM MILLER: Any whales in that direction there, John? JOHN: Not that I've seen. I'll keep my eye out, though, and let you know. MOGUL: Fall was turning into winter quickly. Today is super sunny and warm. But as the sand dunes recede and the ocean opens up, whitecaps start to appear. And the surf and my stomach start to churn. MILLER: A little snottier out here than I thought it would be. MOGUL: Miller's main job is a public high school math teacher. For much of the summer, he takes out scientific researchers, led by Dr. Howard Rosenbaum of the Wildlife Conservation Society. HOWARD ROSENBAUM: We have a resurgence of whales here in the New York area. We see humpback whales feeding, fin whales feeding. You have other animals that may be on migration. MOGUL: We're working our way out to an 80,000-acre triangle of ocean. An enormous Norwegian energy corporation called Equinor has a contract with New York state to build enough wind turbines to power a half-million homes. ROSENBAUM: Everyone is interested, you know, in the benefits of renewable energy and, you know, what that does for our climate and for society. We also just want to protect the wildlife and these most important habitats. MOGUL: Rosenbaum hopes the data his crew is gathering on whales will inform everything from the placement of the turbines to the boat speeds of construction and maintenance crews. ROSENBAUM: When wind farms are constructed, they're going to operate for decades, right? And so we want to get it as close to right as best as we can right now. MOGUL: After a half an hour or so, with New York City still visible in the background, a crew member spots what she thinks is a humpback whale about 300 yards away. At that distance, it's hard to tell. It looks kind of like an oily black patch of water. MILLER: I wonder if it's the same one we had the last time since it's so small. ROSENBAUM: Yeah. MOGUL: Small for a humpback whale. Even though you only see a 5- to 10-foot-long stretch of shiny black fin above the water, you sense the outline of something much larger. In fact, this juvenile humpback is about as long as a three-story building is tall. ROSENBAUM: See that little swirling water at the surface? That's where he just was. It's when an animal beats its tail underwater, and it comes up and. . . MOGUL: They want to get close to the whale to identify it, at first with photographs for a catalog they keep of more than 100 whales they follow through the area. ROSENBAUM: Tail, tail - all right. Hang on, guys. I'm going to go down and get the crossbow. MOGUL: Rosenbaum grabs a crossbow and loads it with an arrow that has a hollow 2-inch tip and a corklike stopper to prevent it from penetrating too deeply. The idea is to collect a core sample of the whale's skin and blubber. MILLER: Well, there we go, Howard. Nice. MOGUL: The arrow bobs in the water. A teammate retrieves it in a net. But nope - the angle was no good, and the arrow tip is empty. The whale, by the way, supposedly doesn't mind being shot. ROSENBAUM: It's kind of like getting bit by a mosquito. Sometimes you feel it. Sometimes you don't. MOGUL: Just then, a second humpback comes into range, an adult that's much larger. And Rosenbaum gets into position with his crossbow. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: That was a good hit. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Cross your fingers. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: No, it's all good. ROSENBAUM: Yeah. Nice. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Textbook. MOGUL: They scoop the floating arrow out of the water, and this one has a little sliver of whale flesh inside. ROSENBAUM: With this, we can tell the sex of the animal. We'll do some population comparisons to neighboring populations. We get a lot of valuable information from this one sample. MOGUL: With the whale blubber in hand, it's time to head south to our real destination, the site of Equinor's future Empire Wind farm. It takes another hour and a half to get there. And by there, I mean a large, lonely yellow buoy floating on a vast expanse of ocean. ROSENBAUM: We're actually looking at our near-real-time acoustic monitoring buoy. MOGUL: Despite feeling empty, this is a busy area for cargo ships and fishing trawlers. And down below, there's a teeming ecosystem with at least one humpback whale we saw and a fin whale we never saw but was picked up by the acoustic monitoring buoy. Rosenbaum hopes these data points will guide where Equinor plants its towering forest of wind turbines and will also help environmental authorities keep the multinational energy company accountable. ROSENBAUM: So if their permit says they have to do X, Y or Z activities and they have to stop and - if there are certain whales detected, this might alert them to the fact that there are whales present. MOGUL: We head back to shore, and the sun begins to set. Rosenbaum and I talk about the big cement footings that will hold up the wind turbines. ROSENBAUM: Does it create, you know, better foraging areas for whales? Does it disturb an area that whales might use? I mean, I think these are all questions that, you know, are going to be borne out in the years to come. MOGUL: Apparently, no one really knows what the effects on whales will be from all the cement, steel and electrical current soon to arrive in the Atlantic. But whatever the risk is, he thinks it's worth taking, compared to the greater risk faced by climate change. For NPR News, I'm Fred Mogul in New York.

A comet from another star is drawing near our sun. NPR's Geoff Brumfiel reports on this interstellar visitor. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: The comet is known as 2I/Borisov, or just Borisov for short. It was discovered back in August, and quickly, astronomers realized it was special. Most comets we see go around the sun. Borisov is coming in from deep space. Ye Quanzhi of the University of Maryland is one of many astronomers trying to figure out where the heck it came from. YE QUANZHI: We know this is definitely not from the solar system, and the universe is big. So we can only speculate. BRUMFIEL: Do you have a hunch? QUANZHI: Me? No (laughter). Not yet. BRUMFIEL: Ye and his colleagues have been looking at all the photos of the comet, trying to trace its trajectory and thus work out which star it might have come from. Even if they can, it would only tell them the last place Borisov visited. There's no way to know where this wanderer's journey started. It could have formed around another star many millions or even billions of years ago. But for something that's traveled potentially eons across the galaxy, Borisov actually looks pretty familiar. QUANZHI: So far, comet Borisov seems just like some of the solar system comets. That means there's something universal in the universe. BRUMFIEL: The same cosmic forces that formed our solar system and all the comets that go around our sun seem to be at work elsewhere. Of course, there's no way to know if those forces have also made other Earths or life or little green people with telescopes of their own. But Borisov is one data point to suggest that our solar system is maybe not alone. Borisov will swing by the sun on December 8. After that, it'll shoot back out into the icy void, onto the next star.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)VEDANTAM: The week has just begun in Keystone, Iowa. We are here to bear witness to a family meeting - an intervention, if you will. RACHEL KRUSE: It got kind of rough towards the end of the week, didn't it? We didn't feel like such a family, did we? VEDANTAM: Rachel Kruse is running this meeting. The other participants are gathered around her in a circle. A couple of them fidget, but most listen attentively. KRUSE: So on Friday, we decided that today we needed to have a family meeting, all right? So this weekend, I found this book, and it's called \"It's Mine! \" So when I read this book, I want you to think about how last week went and how this week could go. VEDANTAM: This family meeting is taking place in a kindergarten classroom in a rural part of eastern Iowa. Rachel is the teacher, and the lesson she wants to share is one that could have a lasting impact on her students. The story is set on an island. KRUSE: (Reading) On the island lived three quarrelsome frogs named Milton, Rupert and Lydia. They quarreled and quibbled from dawn to dusk. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: They said, mine, mine. . . KRUSE: (Reading) Stay out of the pond, yelled Milton. The water is mine. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: That's not nice. KRUSE: (Reading) Get off the island, shouted Rupert. The Earth is mine. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: That's not nice. KRUSE: It's not, is it? VEDANTAM: Then, a flood swallows up the island. KRUSE: (Reading) There was only one rock left. And there the frogs huddled, trembling from cold and fright. But they felt better now that they were together, sharing the same fears and hopes. VEDANTAM: Eventually, the sky clears. The frogs swim together, hop after butterflies and rest in the weeds. KRUSE: Right, we can work together, can't we? Because at the beginning of the story, when they were saying, it's mine, it's mine, was anybody having fun? UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: No. KRUSE: No. VEDANTAM: The kids get it. The frogs are happier when they stop being selfish. This is what it looks like to teach what are sometimes called soft skills, the kind of skills that kids don't get asked about on tests. Of course, Rachel teaches the other things you'd expect - counting. . . KRUSE: Four, five. . . UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Four, five. . . VEDANTAM: . . . Reading and pronunciation. . . KRUSE: Fish. Fish. UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Fish. Fish. VEDANTAM: But lessons like this one about the selfish frogs might have the greatest impact. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: In fact, this impact can actually be quantified in dollars. Today, we ask some questions with big implications. Can you put an economic value on a great kindergarten teacher? How is it that two children living just a few blocks from each other can have radically different chances in life? What is it that gives Salt Lake City an edge over Cleveland when it comes to offering people a better life than their parents? The state of your American dream - this week on HIDDEN BRAIN. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: The stories we tell about ourselves, stories of success and stories of failure, often have their beginnings in the distant past - sometimes in our childhoods, sometimes before we were even born. My guest today has explored this idea using hard data drawn from tens of millions of people. It's difficult to describe the range of things he does, except to say that Raj Chetty, an economist at Harvard University, might be the foremost authority today on the state of the American dream. Raj, welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. RAJ CHETTY: Thank you, Shankar. It's a pleasure to be here. VEDANTAM: I want to begin by looking at snapshots in time, Raj. And these are moments from your own life that I think explain a great deal about your work. The first snapshot is when you're living in New Delhi in India, and you go to see the Taj Mahal. It's a few hours from your home in Delhi. What do you see? CHETTY: Well, it was the first time I'd been to the Taj Mahal. And, you know, of course, like everyone, it's overwhelming in its beauty and how impressive of a monument it is. But I think what I was most struck by is after then coming back out of the monument, which was very immaculately kept and maintained, seeing the abject poverty outside the Taj Mahal - people begging for money, kids who don't have clothes, who are on the street, you know, don't have adequate food. Certainly, I was exposed to inequality, you know, throughout childhood, but I think this was just such a vivid version of it that stuck in my mind for many years. VEDANTAM: A couple of years after you visit Taj Mahal, your family immigrates to the United States. You are in a private school in Milwaukee. You play tennis and chess, and so you visit other schools in the area for competitions. What do you see? CHETTY: So a similar experience, actually. So I went to a private school on the north side of Milwaukee called University School. And we'd compete with other schools in, as you said, in tennis and chess. And you'd just see, again, the remarkable differences in the physical structure of these schools. So the school that I went to was on something like a 150-acre campus with lots of college-level classes. And in contrast, you know, the schools we'd visit were public schools in the city of Milwaukee, which, as you might know, these are schools that have faced a lot of challenges. And that was just evident, you know, as a child, seeing the opportunities kids there had, talking to them about the types of classes they could take - again, just really seeing a world with tremendous inequity and wondering, you know, how did I end up in this position? And how did these kids, who, at some level, were very similar - we're sitting on different sides of the chessboard - how did they end up in a different position in terms of what they had and opportunities? VEDANTAM: So let's take these ideas from these snapshots - you know, questions related to inequality, to segregation and to opportunity - and dive into some of the research that you've conducted. You once did a study that determined the precise value of having a great kindergarten teacher. Tell me about that study and what the value is that you computed. CHETTY: Yeah. So social scientists have, for a long time, been studying and been interested in understanding how education affects kids' outcomes. Most prior studies that have been done look at impacts on outcomes like test scores. So if you have a better teacher, for instance, or if you're in a smaller classroom, do you do better as measured by standardized tests? Now, one of the puzzling findings from that earlier work is that you tend to find that if you're in what you might think of as a better classroom - let's take, as a concrete example, classroom with a smaller number of kids - you tend to see that kids in those types of classes tend to have higher test scores at the end of that school year, but those gains quickly fade away. So that is if I was in a better kindergarten classroom, I'm doing better at the end of kindergarten but only a little better at the end of first grade. And by the time I'm in second or third grade, my performance on standardized tests basically looks comparable to other kids who were in different classes. So that - I think that fade-out pattern, led to a lot of discouragement among education researchers, saying, oh, it looks like these interventions that we're all studying - reducing class size, trying to improve teacher quality, so forth - they seem to have some impacts, but these impacts don't seem to last. So, you know, is this kind of a losing cause in the long run? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: The fade-out effect was discouraging. But Raj had a hunch that maybe the long-term research had not tracked the kids long enough. He found data from an older experiment from Tennessee. The students in this experiment had been randomly assigned to different kindergarten classrooms within their schools. Some had small class sizes of about 15 students. Others were placed in classes that had about 25 students. Raj and his colleagues did something novel with the data to discover the long-term - the really long-term - effects of kindergarten classrooms on students. CHETTY: We take kind of a big-data approach and link the school district records for those 12,000 kids to income tax records and Social Security records many years later that basically allow us to ask, how did your earnings when you're, say, 25 or 30 years old, vary depending upon which kindergarten classroom you were assigned to? So what this allows you to do is go beyond asking, what are the impacts of these interventions on test scores? - and ask, what are the impacts on things we actually care about at the end of the day? - the types of jobs people end up getting, how much they're earning, whether they go to college or not, and so forth. And what you end up finding, in a nutshell, is actually quite striking, which is even though you see this fade-out pattern that I was describing in terms of test score achievement, the gains actually reemerge in adulthood. The children who were assigned to better teachers, to smaller classes, are doing significantly better as adults, showing that early childhood education does, in fact, have lasting impacts, even though, curiously, those impacts don't seem to last in terms of test scores. VEDANTAM: I mean, it's a remarkable finding because I think when most of us think about it, we sort of say, well, schooling is important. But if you were to ask me, does what happen in kindergarten affect you when you're 30 years old? - I would have to say it's probably really marginal. But that's not what you're finding. CHETTY: Yeah. And so, to be clear, it is one of many, many different things that matters, right? So I would not say the kindergarten classroom that you're in sort of determines your fate. It's one of a hundred things that influences your outcomes. However, if, on average, you're assigned to a better teacher or to a smaller class, we see measurable improvements in children's outcomes on the order of thousands of dollars of earnings per year. And so the kind of quantification of that, that we put out in that paper, is you can think of having a better kindergarten teacher as being worth something like $300,000 for a classroom of students. VEDANTAM: That $300,000 figure is an estimate of how much more the kids in the class would earn over their lifetimes. It's the difference between the earnings from a class with a high-quality kindergarten teacher and a class with an average teacher. While Raj has found a way to quantify the economic value of a great kindergarten teacher, he has found it harder to identify what exactly makes a great kindergarten teacher. It turns out that credentials, like where a teacher went to college, are not very helpful in predicting whether someone's going to be a good teacher. So Raj looked instead at how teachers taught their students. CHETTY: It's less about, you know, you're very good at explaining certain mathematical concepts and something a little bit more nebulous about how well, for instance, you're able to manage a classroom of small children, some of whom might end up being disruptive. Are you able to keep people focused? Are you able to inspire people? How you go about measuring those things systematically, I think, is a very interesting question. And even more importantly, how can we then, perhaps, train teachers to do better on those dimensions? That would be incredibly valuable. But at the moment, I think the best summary is we don't quite know yet. VEDANTAM: Let's stick with this theory that in some ways, what's happening - the difference between the great teacher and the not-so-great teacher might not necessarily be, you know, is one teacher better at teaching the alphabet or teaching the children to count numbers? - but is communicating something else, something else that actually has, you know, not necessarily immediate benefits in the next year or two, but actually has potentially large benefits over the course of a lifetime. What kind of skills might those be? CHETTY: Yeah, so I think, you know, examples of those kinds of skills might be what we'd call noncognitive skills. Or sometimes they're called soft skills - so not the, you know, are you able to do what's measured commonly on standardized tests? But rather, how well do you get along with others? And how disciplined are you? How focused are you? So that's not just speculation. In fact, as part of this study, we have some evidence that supports exactly that kind of reasoning. So it turns out in this Tennessee STAR experiment, they took these students in eighth grade and had their teachers rate them on 28 different measures of noncognitive skills - so asking them, the teacher, does this student get along well with his or her peers? Is the student able to concentrate and so forth? And what's really interesting is that the students who had better kindergarten classrooms, they score significantly higher on these noncognitive measures. So you're seeing persistent gains that last for at least eight years on these noncognitive dimensions. And moreover, if you look at what correlates more strongly with later outcomes in adulthood, like earnings, employment rates, college attendance, it's actually these noncognitive measures that are more predictive than the traditional cognitive skills that we tend to focus on. That is, if I ask, which is more predictive of how much you will earn, someone who gets along well with their peers or someone who scores very high on math tests? - it's the person who gets along with other people that, on average, is doing better in adulthood. You know, putting all those pieces of evidence together, my reading is that early environments and classrooms, teachers and so on, matter not because of the technical skills you're learning but because of this broader set of skills that have big payoffs in the labor market. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: When we come back, we move from classrooms to neighborhoods, how the neighborhood you live in could be an engine for success or a brake on your ambitions. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)VEDANTAM: There's a core belief that's embedded in the story of America. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH MONTAGE)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The idea that if you're willing to work hard, it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from or what you look like. PRESIDENT GEORGE W BUSH: And together we will create an America that is open, so every citizen has access to the American dream. VEDANTAM: The American dream, this idea that it's possible for anyone to climb the economic ladder and have a stable, prosperous life, this idea has endured across generations. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH MONTAGE)PRESIDENT LYNDON B JOHNSON: A dream of a place where a free man could build for himself and raise his children to a better life. PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN: That dream is the heart and soul of America. It's the promise that keeps our nation forever good and generous. VEDANTAM: But increasingly, many people have come to question whether this dream is possible anymore. Both Republicans and Democrats have argued the American dream is unraveling. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH MONTAGE)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The American dream is dead. ELIZABETH WARREN: You and I may be the first generation in American history to see our kids do worse than we did. VEDANTAM: Raj Chetty says economic mobility has fallen in the U. S. compared to 50 years ago. Far fewer people today are doing better than their parents. But when you take a close look at the data, the picture that emerges is much more nuanced. CHETTY: So think about upward mobility in the context of the classic rags-to-riches kind of notion. Suppose you're a kid growing up in a low-income family, say, the bottom fifth of the income distribution. What are your odds of reaching the top fifth of the income distribution, making THAT leap from the bottom to the top? So it turns out, if you look at the U. S. as a whole, that number is 7. 5%. Seven-and-a-half percent of kids who start out in a relatively low-income family will end up reaching the top fifth on average. But if you then break that data down and ask, how does that vary depending upon which state or which county you're growing up in? - you see that it actually varies dramatically. So in certain parts of the U. S. - for example, in rural Iowa or much of the Great Plains or certain cities like Salt Lake City or San Francisco, for example - your odds of rising from the bottom fifth to the top fifth are something like 14 or 15 percent, twice as high as the national average. In contrast, if you look at the other end of the spectrum - look at cities like Charlotte, N. C. , Atlanta, Ga. , or more generally, much of the southeastern United States or places in the industrial Midwest, like Detroit or Cleveland - your odds of rising from the bottom to the top are below 5 percent, sometimes even only 3. 5 or 4 percent. Now, those differences that I just mentioned, they're quite substantial. They're basically saying that for a given child, your odds of making it to the middle class or to the upper-middle class are two or three times higher if you happen to be growing up in one place relative to another. And so what I often say is people ask, you know, is the American dream alive or not today? And I actually think the question itself is sort of ill-posed. The term the American dream - really, we should think of it as the Iowa dream or the Atlanta dream or the California dream because there's so much variation within this country. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: So one of the big insights of this work in some ways is that rather than looking at the nation as a whole, it's actually useful to look at these, you know, metropolitan areas or cities because in some ways, they paint very different pictures. But in your most recent work, you've actually taken this a step further and said you can actually look within cities and find even more granular details about the state of upward mobility. Talk to me about this work. CHETTY: Yeah, that's exactly right. So as we've been proceeding on this work, we've been taking the approach of kind of going to finer and finer levels of geography. So the Atlanta versus Salt Lake City or San Francisco contrast, I think, is interesting. But what was even more surprising to us is if I look within Atlanta or I look within Los Angeles, turns out you can essentially see the same amount of variation that you see in the U. S. as a whole when you look within a few miles in a given city. So to give you some specific examples again, let's focus on the city of Los Angeles, to take one case. So many people are familiar with certain neighborhoods in Los Angeles, like Compton and Watts, which have been known for many decades to be tough areas with high rates of crime, high rates of poverty and adverse outcomes due to various structural factors. Now, we showed that kids who grow up in those specific neighborhoods - so, for instance, kids who grow up in Watts, and black men in particular who grow up in that area - have very adverse outcomes. So for example, black men who grow up in low-income families in Watts on average have earnings of only $7,000 a year in their mid-30s. And that is the average, right? So that means that the vast majority of these men have incomes very close to zero. They're nonworking and so forth. Another somewhat shocking statistic - black men growing up in that particular census tract have something like a 45% chance of being incarcerated on any given day, which means that their lifetime chance of ever being incarcerated is much higher, you know, could well be something like 70 or 80%. VEDANTAM: Did you say on any given day? CHETTY: On a given day. On a given day - the date of the 2010 census, 45% of the black men who grew up in this tract in Watts - it's called the Nickerson Gardens public housing project. Forty-five percent of them are incarcerated. It's a shocking statement about, I mean, the United States, I think, that we have such high levels of incarceration in certain cases. But that is a fact about that tract. Now, you know, at some level, for people living in LA - maybe shocked by that magnitude, but maybe not surprised by the fact that there are very adverse outcomes for kids growing up in that area. Here's maybe something you didn't know, though. If you go a mile or two away, to Compton, you see that rates of incarceration for black men growing up there in families of comparable income are something like 6%. So still actually high - 6% is not a small number. But relative to 45%, it's dramatically lower. And so that's the sense in which when you look at these maps, which we've put out in the form of an interactive tool where you can look at your own address, look at any neighborhood in the United States - 70,000 different neighborhoods splitting up each of these cities into different areas - you see this tremendous variation across very short distances. For kids who grow up in families with comparable income, same racial background, where you're growing up really seems to matter. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Where you grow up really seems to matter. The question is, why? What explains the difference between Salt Lake City and Charlotte? CHETTY: So we don't know yet exactly what is the recipe to produce better outcomes in one place relative to another. But we've looked at a variety of different factors that economists and sociologists have talked about over the years as potentially driving differences in outcomes. And we've identified five or six different things that really seem like strong predictors of these differences. So the first is segregation. So cities that are more segregated by race or by income, where blacks and whites are not interacting as much or where low-income and high-income families are living separated from each other - segregated places like that tend to have much worse outcomes for people of all racial and ethnic groups. So that's one strong pattern in the data. VEDANTAM: Raj has found that upward mobility is less common in places that have a smaller middle class. He's also noticed some other patterns. CHETTY: We find that there's a very strong association between these outcomes and measures of family structure in a neighborhood. So in particular, one of the strongest patterns in the data is that areas where more kids are raised by two-parent families tend to have higher rates of upward mobility. Now, in interpreting that correlation, it's very important to note that it's not mechanically driven by the fact that growing up yourself in a two-parent family leads to better outcomes for a given kid. What we find is even if your own parents are married, if you grow up in an area where a lot of kids are being raised by single parents, you are less likely to climb the income ladder. So what that shows you is this is not the direct effect of your own parents' marital status. It's again something about community-level factors that are associated with the fraction of single parents in an area that's predictive of kids' outcomes. Now, somewhat related to that is the idea of social capital, a concept popularized by my Harvard colleague Bob Putnam. I think of the old adage that it takes a village to raise a child as a way to think about what social capital is. Will someone else help you out even if you're not doing well? Salt Lake City, with the Mormon Church, is thought to be a canonical example of a city with a lot of social capital and correspondingly has high rates of upward mobility. And so as best we can measure it, we find that places with higher levels of social capital tend to have higher levels of upward mobility. And then finally, I'll mention one last one. Coming back to our discussion about schools, as you might expect intuitively, places that have better schools tend to have higher rates of upward mobility. And I think that connection is particularly important to note because schools are something that I think fall clearly in the policy domain where we might be able to figure out how to make changes to improve the quality of schools. Some of the other factors I've been describing, while I think they're very important to study and interesting to understand, it's harder to figure out, what do you do to try to change social capital or family structures in an area? That's, I think, a little bit more complicated, at least to figure out from a policy point of view. VEDANTAM: So Raj established that where you grow up and the kind of school you attend can make a big difference in your life. So the obvious policy implication is move people from areas where outcomes are worse to places where outcomes are better. In the 1990s, the federal government tested this very idea with a program called Moving to Opportunity. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)BOB EDWARDS: This is Morning Edition. I'm Bob Edwards. The federal government is conducting an experiment. It's helping poor people from five cities move into middle-class neighborhoods. Volunteer families were transferred out of troubled sections of Los Angeles, Boston, New York, Chicago and Baltimore. With the help of rent subsidies, the families move to more affluent areas, often in the suburbs. VEDANTAM: Very much like the studies on the effects of great kindergarten teachers, the results from the Moving to Opportunity experiment were underwhelming. But Raj did exactly what he had done with the classroom studies. He asked whether researchers had studied the effects of this program long enough. CHETTY: The Moving to Opportunity study was, in some ways, a landmark study in this field because it said, let's take the perspective of a scientific experiment. We have some evidence where it looks like outcomes vary across these neighborhoods. And let's just go out there and really randomly assign families, effectively, by giving them vouchers to different neighborhoods and see if outcomes differ. And I think everyone who was involved in that study at that point was expecting to see that you'd find really big and immediate impacts on people's outcomes, and this would show that environment really matters. And we would go from there in developing affordable housing policy and so forth. And very disappointingly, the initial studies - and there were many of these - almost uniformly showed that Moving to Opportunity had no real detectable economic impact. There were, to be clear, improvements in the health of adults and other dimensions that we care about - you know, reports of how depressed people were feeling or even indicators of rates of diabetes, things like that. You did see changes there. But in terms of economic outcomes - employment rates, earnings and so forth - didn't find much of an effect. Now, all of those initial studies were looking at the impacts of Moving to Opportunity on adults or kids who were relatively old. They were in their teens at the point of the move. And there was a very simple reason for that. People were eager to evaluate the results of the intervention. And, of course, you couldn't look at young kids' outcomes very quickly after the point of the experiment in the mid-1990s because it would take time for the kids to grow up and then see their earnings in adulthood and so forth. So what we did is echoing, you know, some of the themes, actually, of what we talked about earlier with the Tennessee STAR experiment. We went back to the Moving to Opportunity data, linked that to tax records in order to be able to track people over a longer period of time. And we had a very clear hypothesis going into the study that maybe the reason people hadn't found effects in the Moving to Opportunity data is that it takes time for environment to have an impact. It's not that I just help you move to a different neighborhood, and tomorrow, you end up having completely different outcomes. Rather, it's related to exposure. You have to spend a lot of time, perhaps, growing up in a given place in order to see - really see measurable changes. And so what we found when we went back to the data is remarkably that that's exactly what's going on. If you look at kids who were relatively young - say, below age 12 at the point that they moved as part of this experiment - you see quite substantial gains as a result of moving to a lower-poverty, middle-class neighborhood - something like a 30% increase in earnings, 30% increase in college attendance rates, 25% reduction in the rate of having a teenage birth. So on a variety of outcomes, quite substantial gains. But if you do the exact same analysis for kids who moved at older ages, you see essentially no gain at all. And if you look at adults who moved as part of the experiment, verifying what earlier studies found, we see no gains at all. And so what that's very consistent with is the idea that there's sort of a dosage effect. Or every extra year you spend growing up in a better neighborhood helps you in the long run. But those effects really cumulate to something we're able to detect in the data only if people move young enough. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: If there is one theme that emerges from this kind of analysis, it is about the value of nuances. It is true that geography and education matter. But there are also social factors that have independent effects - a big one, race. CHETTY: Neighborhoods matter, but they're certainly not everything. I mean, I want to be very clear about that. And so race is a very good example where it illustrates that you shouldn't think about neighborhoods as being an environmental set of factors that applies to everyone equally. When we break the data down by race, we find very stark differences, in particular between black and white men growing up in a given neighborhood. For women, there actually aren't very large differences in rates of upward or downward mobility between black and white women. But for black versus white men, you see really stark differences in rates of mobility. A black man and a white man who grow up in families with comparable income, living on the same block, both two-parent families, similar levels of education, similar levels of wealth - so basically, control for all the family-level factors that you can sort of think of. You still see that the black man has much lower chances of climbing the income ladder than white men. And perhaps even more alarmingly, black men have much higher rates of downward mobility than white men. If you're born to an affluent family as a black man, you are much more likely to fall down the income ladder than white men are, who tend to persist near the top of the income distribution. The way I like to think about it is, if you think about upward mobility as climbing an income ladder for white men, it's more like being on a treadmill for black men. Even after you climb up in one generation, you tend to fall back down in the next generation. And that's true even among two kids who grow up in the same neighborhood, who go to the same school and so forth. VEDANTAM: So this presents, obviously, a puzzle. If you have two families, one black, one white - they both have, you know, a son and a daughter. What you're saying is, on average, the white boy is going to do significantly better than the black boy. But the white girl isn't going to do significantly better than the black girl. How do you explain this? CHETTY: You know, again, I think the explanation is something that remains to be fully resolved. But I can give you some sense of what we think might be going on. So when we then use this neighborhood-level data, this granular information, you can go and ask, are there some places in America where we actually see black men doing relatively well? And what might we be able to learn from those examples? So it turns out you can look at certain places - Silver Spring in Maryland, for example. More generally, there are a scattered set of areas across the United States where you see relatively good outcomes for black men. And they tend to have three characteristics, which I think shed some light on why these gaps prevail for men rather than women. So first, we find that these places tend to have relatively low poverty rates. So they have good resources. Second, as you might expect intuitively, they have low levels of racial bias among whites. We find that places with less racial bias have relatively good outcomes for black men relative to white men. And then the third factor we identify is that areas with high rates of father presence, where lots of kids again are being raised in two-parent families and, in particular, black kids are being raised in two-parent families, they tend to have particularly good outcomes for black boys relative to white boys. Now, importantly, that last correlation that I mentioned - that's true only for black boys. When black girls grow up in an area with greater presence of fathers, their outcomes look pretty similar. And so coming back to your question, what is driving these gender disparities? - my sense from this data, while it's not conclusive, it suggests that environmental factors are amplifying these disparities for black men in particular. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: When we come back, how Raj's insights can be applied to policy. You're listening to HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. This is NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)VEDANTAM: Raj Chetty has spent years mining vast troves of data to understand economic mobility and inequality in the United States. Increasingly, Raj and his team are moving from analysis to action. They are asking how the insights they have generated might improve, for example, the quality of education. CHETTY: My big-picture take is we should be doing everything we can to try to have the best teachers in American classrooms. And I think the systems that we currently have in place, for various reasons, don't really achieve that goal. So in most professions in the United States, if you're generating a lot of value for your company, people are going to be able to make changes to try to keep you, right? So you might get a pay raise. You might get a different portfolio of what you have to manage. You might get a promotion in various ways. In most schools, salaries are basically set in lockstep to experience, with no ability for the principals to have discretion to give teachers a bonus if they're doing extremely well or try to, you know, give a retention package to a teacher who has a really attractive offer from a private school or from a totally different employer. And so I think creating a little bit more of that flexibility to retain and recruit top talent in teaching, just like we do in the rest of the economy in the United States, could be incredibly valuable. But I think, you know, more broadly, what I see as the broader problem is teaching is often not viewed as the first profession you'd choose to pursue if you're a really talented kid in the United States. And I think that's really not a good state of affairs. Countries that have excellent educational systems that people point to - Finland, for example - you often hear that kids' aspiration, if they're doing really well in school, is to become a teacher. And so given the importance of teaching, as we've established, for kids' long-term outcomes broadly, I think it's extremely important that it's viewed as a high-status, very desirable profession to go into. VEDANTAM: I want to spend a moment just talking about the caution that might be needed in terms of sort of applying policy solutions. So for example, you'll find that when really good teachers move into some schools, they have measurable effects. They raise the test scores of students. And over time, this has measurable effects on the long-term outcomes of those students. So you would say, we should actually try and get the teachers who can boost test scores. But, of course, if you actually implemented that as policy, you would have schools and teachers now focused on just boosting test scores and teaching to the test. And presumably, you might not actually get the benefit of what you were hoping to get, which is great teaching, not just great test scores. CHETTY: No, that's quite right. And I mean, I think that's an important caution that you have to think about in this context. So if you use test-score-based measures to evaluate teachers, it's possible that you will get a lot of teaching to the test. Now, the way I view it, again, from a scientific point of view, is it's an empirical question. To what extent - when you have incentive systems where you reward teachers based on their productivity, as measured by tests, to what extent do you get unproductive behavior? And if you do, can you do things to combat that? So - give you a very simple example - if we're worried that teachers do things that lead to unproductive teaching to the test in the short run that just artificially boosts your test scores at the end of the current year but doesn't lead to persistent learning, one thing we might be able to do is look at your test scores then in the next grade or the year after and ask, does it seem like these students are continuing to do better, even in the years after they leave your classroom? And if they are, then maybe, you know, you are actually teaching them something that's valuable, and so we're going to reward the teachers who have these persistent impacts rather than the teachers who only have short-term impacts. All of that said, I don't think the policy solution here is some kind of, you know, algorithmic thing, where we just say, we're going to look at your students' test scores and determine your employment and promotion outcomes purely based on that. I view this more as useful information that principals or other managers - that they should incorporate into decisions that they're making and give them the leeway to do that. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Another policy domain that I asked Raj about is housing. For example, if younger kids do better than older kids when they move to new neighborhoods, should housing vouchers be focused on families with the youngest children? CHETTY: We are using our data to identify neighborhoods that would be affordable to low-income families but deliver much better outcomes for their kids. So think of these as places that are basically opportunity bargains. They are places that have good outcomes yet are still affordable. And so what we're doing is providing families, when they come in to apply for a housing voucher, information about these opportunity bargain areas. We're providing assistance to those families in the form of rental brokers - basically, helping them go to those places, look for housing in those places. And we're recruiting landlords in those areas to encourage them to rent their houses to tenants, simplifying the inspection process, simplifying the paperwork and so forth. And the whole goal of this is, without spending any extra money on the vouchers, try to basically achieve more bang for the buck by helping families move to those places. So, you know, the idea is to use the research to try to then make policy changes that will allow us to achieve better outcomes. Just one other, you know, angle on that which is important - this whole study is focused on families with young kids, given our finding that helping people move when they're much older really doesn't have much of an impact - and so another way in which you can see the research directly informing policy design. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering if one concern that is sometimes raised, in terms of sort of the geographic distribution of mobility and the policy solutions that might follow from it, is - you know, so let's say, for example, you look at the Los Angeles data you told me, and one of the policy implications that comes from this is, can we get the kid who's growing up in Watts to move a couple of miles to be growing up in Compton and potentially have better outcomes? And let's assume for a second that you actually had empirical data that showed you that this was actually possible to do, and the outcomes actually would be better. Is that actually solving the problem? Because it doesn't actually solve the problem of what's happening in Watts. It's great for the kids whom you're moving out, but what about for the kids who are left behind? CHETTY: So let me say - that's an excellent point. Let me say a few things on that. So first, I think we actually don't just need to assume that it would lead to better outcomes for the kids. We have direct data now looking at exactly those types of moves that shows very clearly the earlier a child moves from an environment like Watts to the nearby place with lower rates of incarceration, they're going to have a much lower probability of getting incarcerated themselves. Now, is that really solving the problem? Of course, it's solving the problem for that given child, but are you solving a problem societally? So I look at it in two steps. So first of all, many low-income families already move across neighborhoods in a given year. Something like 1 in 5 low-income families moves houses in a given year. So the way we should think about this is not so much that we're going to take a family that was going to stay in a given place permanently, uproot them and move them somewhere else. But rather, at the point that they're moving for whatever other reason, let's potentially encourage them to make a more informed choice that might improve their kids' outcomes in the long run. That, to me, seems like a natural thing to do, just enable people to make the best choices possible. But then the deeper problem you point to is that, are you really solving anything in places like Watts, where you have very adverse outcomes, simply by helping people move around? And I think the answer to that is, of course, no. The solution, at the end of the day - it's not a scalable solution to just move everyone. You're never going to move everyone out of Watts or, you know, a given city to another place. Nor should you try to. Ultimately, of course, you have to think about what you can do in a given place to improve outcomes. And so this is where a lot of where we're headed in the policy domain is not just the Moving to Opportunity approach that I described but actually partnerships with other organizations to evaluate and scale up programs that might improve outcomes in a given area. We're in conversations with groups that provide mentoring services. So think of programs like Big Brothers Big Sisters or My Brother's Keeper, which, specifically for black men, try to provide role models and mentoring. And there's a question of whether you can scale up and design those programs in a way that will really change outcomes in those particular areas. A third potential policy domain, given we're talking about incarceration, is changes in criminal justice that could potentially have significant effects in places like this. So I absolutely agree. You need to think about policy solutions both in place, in tandem with potentially giving families better opportunities to choose where to live. VEDANTAM: When it comes to higher education, which is, of course, where you work, you've found that some universities tend to be better than others in increasing income mobility amongst their students. Which schools are these, and what can we learn from them? Is there a policy prescription here? CHETTY: Yeah. So higher education, I think, is another domain. So just to connect these various pieces, the way I look at mobility is kind of a pipeline from birth to adulthood. And so we've spent a lot of time focusing on elementary education, kindergarten, neighborhood experiences as you grow up. And then, of course, you get to college. And college is a place where a lot of us, I think, have the intuition that it's this domain where you're going to mix with a new group of people. It's going to be a lot more diverse than the neighborhood in which you grow up and so forth. And so the starting point to note here is that that actually is not true in the United States. So colleges are just as segregated by income as the neighborhood in which you grow up is. That is, your chances of meeting someone from a different socio-economic background in your college are just about the same as your chances of meeting someone from a different socio-economic background in the high school that you go to. So certain colleges in America, especially the elite, private institutions, have a very high representation of extremely high-income students in their student body. Now, the consequence of that - coming back to the question about mobility - is you can't, in a mechanical sense, contribute a lot to upward mobility if you don't have a lot of low-income kids to begin with, right? Harvard, mechanically, cannot be helping a lot of low-income kids climb the income ladder because there aren't that many low-income kids at Harvard, Stanford, Princeton, Yale, et cetera to begin with. In contrast, if you look at a set of mid-tier public schools - think of places like the City University of New York or California state colleges - we find that these colleges, in an accounting (ph) sense, actually have the highest rates of socio-economic mobility. And as a result, if you ask how many kids are starting out in a poor family and moving up the income distribution, it's these mid-tier public schools where you see a lot of that happening. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: We began this conversation, Raj, by talking about your own life. And I actually want to end the conversation by going back to your own life, as well, because I think your own life story, in some ways, is very instructive about many of the ideas we've talked about today. You know, as I was preparing for the interview and I was reading up some things about your life, I remembered a story about the philosopher Bertrand Russell. He grew up in a family of writers, and he assumed when he was a kid that everyone wrote books. At one point, Russell meets someone. And if I'm remembering the story correctly, I think it's a gardener. And he's astonished to find the man is not an author. And I thought of that story when I heard that as prolific as you are, you were the last person in your family to get an academic paper published. Is that actually true? CHETTY: Yes, that is actually true. And I actually think I remember my father telling me the story about Bertrand Russell when I was a kid. So I come from a family of academics. I have two older sisters, both of whom are researchers, as well. And so I was the last one in my family to get a Ph. D. and publish a paper. And so it was definitely in the air, in the water, so to speak, around me. And as I've talked about, through various examples empirically, I think exposure, environment plays a huge role. And I absolutely see that in the work that I'm doing. VEDANTAM: And I think that is the deeper truth to the story - your own life story but also the work that you've been doing. You know, when we think about excellence, we think of, you know, Raj Chetty, MacArthur genius. We imagine the lonely climber on top of the mountain. But in reality, the story you're painting is much closer, you know, to the ideal - you know, Isaac Newton's ideal - if I've seen further, it's because I stand on the shoulders of giants. CHETTY: That's absolutely right. And I think, Shankar, that was made most evident to me, actually, in thinking about my extended family, where I see, you know, the many different experiences that we've had as a result of the environments in which we grew up. So in particular, as you might know, in Indian families, growing up - especially in villages in poverty, families often chose one child to educate. And so it so happened to be, in my father's family, he was the one who ended up getting higher education, ended up coming to the United States to University of Wisconsin-Madison to get a Ph. D. And my mom was one of the first women to become a doctor in our community in South India - again, the only person in her family to get a higher education. And what I've seen is how those decisions have manifested themselves through the generations in our family. So my cousins, many of whom actually have the same name as me - Raj, you know, named after my maternal grandfather - while they all are happy in their own ways and are leading fulfilling lives, the opportunities they've had have been dramatically different, with one of them living in Singapore to support his family in India and, you know, not able to be with his kids as they're growing up, another in - working in kind of a, you know, difficult job in New York City in kind of a manual-labor sort of position. And so again, I think the opportunities I've had - exactly as you said - are entirely a function of the environment that I happen to have been lucky to grow up in - and, you know, I think more broadly, have been studying how to replicate those opportunities for others. VEDANTAM: Raj Chetty is an economist at Harvard University. Raj, thank you for joining me today on HIDDEN BRAIN. CHETTY: My pleasure.

Our unsung hero this week is principal Ryan Junge at Keystone Elementary School in Iowa. When we were trying to figure out which kindergarten classroom we wanted to visit, we looked for a school in a part of the country that has one of the best records of upward mobility. That's how we found Keystone Elementary in a rural part of eastern Iowa. Principal Junge allowed us to hang out in one of his kindergarten classrooms. Now, it takes a lot to run a school. And having an audio producer running about isn't high on your list of priorities. But he got on board very quickly and figured out a way to make it possible. We are grateful.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) VEDANTAM: The week has just begun in Keystone, Iowa. We are here to bear witness to a family meeting - an intervention, if you will. RACHEL KRUSE: It got kind of rough towards the end of the week, didn't it? We didn't feel like such a family, did we? VEDANTAM: Rachel Kruse is running this meeting. The other participants are gathered around her in a circle. A couple of them fidget, but most listen attentively. KRUSE: So on Friday, we decided that today we needed to have a family meeting, all right? So this weekend, I found this book, and it's called \"It's Mine! \" So when I read this book, I want you to think about how last week went and how this week could go. VEDANTAM: This family meeting is taking place in a kindergarten classroom in a rural part of eastern Iowa. Rachel is the teacher, and the lesson she wants to share is one that could have a lasting impact on her students. The story is set on an island. KRUSE: (Reading) On the island lived three quarrelsome frogs named Milton, Rupert and Lydia. They quarreled and quibbled from dawn to dusk. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: They said, mine, mine. . . KRUSE: (Reading) Stay out of the pond, yelled Milton. The water is mine. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: That's not nice. KRUSE: (Reading) Get off the island, shouted Rupert. The Earth is mine. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: That's not nice. KRUSE: It's not, is it? VEDANTAM: Then, a flood swallows up the island. KRUSE: (Reading) There was only one rock left. And there the frogs huddled, trembling from cold and fright. But they felt better now that they were together, sharing the same fears and hopes. VEDANTAM: Eventually, the sky clears. The frogs swim together, hop after butterflies and rest in the weeds. KRUSE: Right, we can work together, can't we? Because at the beginning of the story, when they were saying, it's mine, it's mine, was anybody having fun? UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: No. KRUSE: No. VEDANTAM: The kids get it. The frogs are happier when they stop being selfish. This is what it looks like to teach what are sometimes called soft skills, the kind of skills that kids don't get asked about on tests. Of course, Rachel teaches the other things you'd expect - counting. . . KRUSE: Four, five. . . UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Four, five. . . VEDANTAM: . . . Reading and pronunciation. . . KRUSE: Fish. Fish. UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Fish. Fish. VEDANTAM: But lessons like this one about the selfish frogs might have the greatest impact. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: In fact, this impact can actually be quantified in dollars. Today, we ask some questions with big implications. Can you put an economic value on a great kindergarten teacher? How is it that two children living just a few blocks from each other can have radically different chances in life? What is it that gives Salt Lake City an edge over Cleveland when it comes to offering people a better life than their parents? The state of your American dream - this week on HIDDEN BRAIN. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: The stories we tell about ourselves, stories of success and stories of failure, often have their beginnings in the distant past - sometimes in our childhoods, sometimes before we were even born. My guest today has explored this idea using hard data drawn from tens of millions of people. It's difficult to describe the range of things he does, except to say that Raj Chetty, an economist at Harvard University, might be the foremost authority today on the state of the American dream. Raj, welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. RAJ CHETTY: Thank you, Shankar. It's a pleasure to be here. VEDANTAM: I want to begin by looking at snapshots in time, Raj. And these are moments from your own life that I think explain a great deal about your work. The first snapshot is when you're living in New Delhi in India, and you go to see the Taj Mahal. It's a few hours from your home in Delhi. What do you see? CHETTY: Well, it was the first time I'd been to the Taj Mahal. And, you know, of course, like everyone, it's overwhelming in its beauty and how impressive of a monument it is. But I think what I was most struck by is after then coming back out of the monument, which was very immaculately kept and maintained, seeing the abject poverty outside the Taj Mahal - people begging for money, kids who don't have clothes, who are on the street, you know, don't have adequate food. Certainly, I was exposed to inequality, you know, throughout childhood, but I think this was just such a vivid version of it that stuck in my mind for many years. VEDANTAM: A couple of years after you visit Taj Mahal, your family immigrates to the United States. You are in a private school in Milwaukee. You play tennis and chess, and so you visit other schools in the area for competitions. What do you see? CHETTY: So a similar experience, actually. So I went to a private school on the north side of Milwaukee called University School. And we'd compete with other schools in, as you said, in tennis and chess. And you'd just see, again, the remarkable differences in the physical structure of these schools. So the school that I went to was on something like a 150-acre campus with lots of college-level classes. And in contrast, you know, the schools we'd visit were public schools in the city of Milwaukee, which, as you might know, these are schools that have faced a lot of challenges. And that was just evident, you know, as a child, seeing the opportunities kids there had, talking to them about the types of classes they could take - again, just really seeing a world with tremendous inequity and wondering, you know, how did I end up in this position? And how did these kids, who, at some level, were very similar - we're sitting on different sides of the chessboard - how did they end up in a different position in terms of what they had and opportunities? VEDANTAM: So let's take these ideas from these snapshots - you know, questions related to inequality, to segregation and to opportunity - and dive into some of the research that you've conducted. You once did a study that determined the precise value of having a great kindergarten teacher. Tell me about that study and what the value is that you computed. CHETTY: Yeah. So social scientists have, for a long time, been studying and been interested in understanding how education affects kids' outcomes. Most prior studies that have been done look at impacts on outcomes like test scores. So if you have a better teacher, for instance, or if you're in a smaller classroom, do you do better as measured by standardized tests? Now, one of the puzzling findings from that earlier work is that you tend to find that if you're in what you might think of as a better classroom - let's take, as a concrete example, classroom with a smaller number of kids - you tend to see that kids in those types of classes tend to have higher test scores at the end of that school year, but those gains quickly fade away. So that is if I was in a better kindergarten classroom, I'm doing better at the end of kindergarten but only a little better at the end of first grade. And by the time I'm in second or third grade, my performance on standardized tests basically looks comparable to other kids who were in different classes. So that - I think that fade-out pattern, led to a lot of discouragement among education researchers, saying, oh, it looks like these interventions that we're all studying - reducing class size, trying to improve teacher quality, so forth - they seem to have some impacts, but these impacts don't seem to last. So, you know, is this kind of a losing cause in the long run? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: The fade-out effect was discouraging. But Raj had a hunch that maybe the long-term research had not tracked the kids long enough. He found data from an older experiment from Tennessee. The students in this experiment had been randomly assigned to different kindergarten classrooms within their schools. Some had small class sizes of about 15 students. Others were placed in classes that had about 25 students. Raj and his colleagues did something novel with the data to discover the long-term - the really long-term - effects of kindergarten classrooms on students. CHETTY: We take kind of a big-data approach and link the school district records for those 12,000 kids to income tax records and Social Security records many years later that basically allow us to ask, how did your earnings when you're, say, 25 or 30 years old, vary depending upon which kindergarten classroom you were assigned to? So what this allows you to do is go beyond asking, what are the impacts of these interventions on test scores? - and ask, what are the impacts on things we actually care about at the end of the day? - the types of jobs people end up getting, how much they're earning, whether they go to college or not, and so forth. And what you end up finding, in a nutshell, is actually quite striking, which is even though you see this fade-out pattern that I was describing in terms of test score achievement, the gains actually reemerge in adulthood. The children who were assigned to better teachers, to smaller classes, are doing significantly better as adults, showing that early childhood education does, in fact, have lasting impacts, even though, curiously, those impacts don't seem to last in terms of test scores. VEDANTAM: I mean, it's a remarkable finding because I think when most of us think about it, we sort of say, well, schooling is important. But if you were to ask me, does what happen in kindergarten affect you when you're 30 years old? - I would have to say it's probably really marginal. But that's not what you're finding. CHETTY: Yeah. And so, to be clear, it is one of many, many different things that matters, right? So I would not say the kindergarten classroom that you're in sort of determines your fate. It's one of a hundred things that influences your outcomes. However, if, on average, you're assigned to a better teacher or to a smaller class, we see measurable improvements in children's outcomes on the order of thousands of dollars of earnings per year. And so the kind of quantification of that, that we put out in that paper, is you can think of having a better kindergarten teacher as being worth something like $300,000 for a classroom of students. VEDANTAM: That $300,000 figure is an estimate of how much more the kids in the class would earn over their lifetimes. It's the difference between the earnings from a class with a high-quality kindergarten teacher and a class with an average teacher. While Raj has found a way to quantify the economic value of a great kindergarten teacher, he has found it harder to identify what exactly makes a great kindergarten teacher. It turns out that credentials, like where a teacher went to college, are not very helpful in predicting whether someone's going to be a good teacher. So Raj looked instead at how teachers taught their students. CHETTY: It's less about, you know, you're very good at explaining certain mathematical concepts and something a little bit more nebulous about how well, for instance, you're able to manage a classroom of small children, some of whom might end up being disruptive. Are you able to keep people focused? Are you able to inspire people? How you go about measuring those things systematically, I think, is a very interesting question. And even more importantly, how can we then, perhaps, train teachers to do better on those dimensions? That would be incredibly valuable. But at the moment, I think the best summary is we don't quite know yet. VEDANTAM: Let's stick with this theory that in some ways, what's happening - the difference between the great teacher and the not-so-great teacher might not necessarily be, you know, is one teacher better at teaching the alphabet or teaching the children to count numbers? - but is communicating something else, something else that actually has, you know, not necessarily immediate benefits in the next year or two, but actually has potentially large benefits over the course of a lifetime. What kind of skills might those be? CHETTY: Yeah, so I think, you know, examples of those kinds of skills might be what we'd call noncognitive skills. Or sometimes they're called soft skills - so not the, you know, are you able to do what's measured commonly on standardized tests? But rather, how well do you get along with others? And how disciplined are you? How focused are you? So that's not just speculation. In fact, as part of this study, we have some evidence that supports exactly that kind of reasoning. So it turns out in this Tennessee STAR experiment, they took these students in eighth grade and had their teachers rate them on 28 different measures of noncognitive skills - so asking them, the teacher, does this student get along well with his or her peers? Is the student able to concentrate and so forth? And what's really interesting is that the students who had better kindergarten classrooms, they score significantly higher on these noncognitive measures. So you're seeing persistent gains that last for at least eight years on these noncognitive dimensions. And moreover, if you look at what correlates more strongly with later outcomes in adulthood, like earnings, employment rates, college attendance, it's actually these noncognitive measures that are more predictive than the traditional cognitive skills that we tend to focus on. That is, if I ask, which is more predictive of how much you will earn, someone who gets along well with their peers or someone who scores very high on math tests? - it's the person who gets along with other people that, on average, is doing better in adulthood. You know, putting all those pieces of evidence together, my reading is that early environments and classrooms, teachers and so on, matter not because of the technical skills you're learning but because of this broader set of skills that have big payoffs in the labor market. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: When we come back, we move from classrooms to neighborhoods, how the neighborhood you live in could be an engine for success or a brake on your ambitions. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) VEDANTAM: There's a core belief that's embedded in the story of America. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH MONTAGE) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The idea that if you're willing to work hard, it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from or what you look like. PRESIDENT GEORGE W BUSH: And together we will create an America that is open, so every citizen has access to the American dream. VEDANTAM: The American dream, this idea that it's possible for anyone to climb the economic ladder and have a stable, prosperous life, this idea has endured across generations. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH MONTAGE) PRESIDENT LYNDON B JOHNSON: A dream of a place where a free man could build for himself and raise his children to a better life. PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN: That dream is the heart and soul of America. It's the promise that keeps our nation forever good and generous. VEDANTAM: But increasingly, many people have come to question whether this dream is possible anymore. Both Republicans and Democrats have argued the American dream is unraveling. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH MONTAGE) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The American dream is dead. ELIZABETH WARREN: You and I may be the first generation in American history to see our kids do worse than we did. VEDANTAM: Raj Chetty says economic mobility has fallen in the U. S. compared to 50 years ago. Far fewer people today are doing better than their parents. But when you take a close look at the data, the picture that emerges is much more nuanced. CHETTY: So think about upward mobility in the context of the classic rags-to-riches kind of notion. Suppose you're a kid growing up in a low-income family, say, the bottom fifth of the income distribution. What are your odds of reaching the top fifth of the income distribution, making THAT leap from the bottom to the top? So it turns out, if you look at the U. S. as a whole, that number is 7. 5%. Seven-and-a-half percent of kids who start out in a relatively low-income family will end up reaching the top fifth on average. But if you then break that data down and ask, how does that vary depending upon which state or which county you're growing up in? - you see that it actually varies dramatically. So in certain parts of the U. S. - for example, in rural Iowa or much of the Great Plains or certain cities like Salt Lake City or San Francisco, for example - your odds of rising from the bottom fifth to the top fifth are something like 14 or 15 percent, twice as high as the national average. In contrast, if you look at the other end of the spectrum - look at cities like Charlotte, N. C. , Atlanta, Ga. , or more generally, much of the southeastern United States or places in the industrial Midwest, like Detroit or Cleveland - your odds of rising from the bottom to the top are below 5 percent, sometimes even only 3. 5 or 4 percent. Now, those differences that I just mentioned, they're quite substantial. They're basically saying that for a given child, your odds of making it to the middle class or to the upper-middle class are two or three times higher if you happen to be growing up in one place relative to another. And so what I often say is people ask, you know, is the American dream alive or not today? And I actually think the question itself is sort of ill-posed. The term the American dream - really, we should think of it as the Iowa dream or the Atlanta dream or the California dream because there's so much variation within this country. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: So one of the big insights of this work in some ways is that rather than looking at the nation as a whole, it's actually useful to look at these, you know, metropolitan areas or cities because in some ways, they paint very different pictures. But in your most recent work, you've actually taken this a step further and said you can actually look within cities and find even more granular details about the state of upward mobility. Talk to me about this work. CHETTY: Yeah, that's exactly right. So as we've been proceeding on this work, we've been taking the approach of kind of going to finer and finer levels of geography. So the Atlanta versus Salt Lake City or San Francisco contrast, I think, is interesting. But what was even more surprising to us is if I look within Atlanta or I look within Los Angeles, turns out you can essentially see the same amount of variation that you see in the U. S. as a whole when you look within a few miles in a given city. So to give you some specific examples again, let's focus on the city of Los Angeles, to take one case. So many people are familiar with certain neighborhoods in Los Angeles, like Compton and Watts, which have been known for many decades to be tough areas with high rates of crime, high rates of poverty and adverse outcomes due to various structural factors. Now, we showed that kids who grow up in those specific neighborhoods - so, for instance, kids who grow up in Watts, and black men in particular who grow up in that area - have very adverse outcomes. So for example, black men who grow up in low-income families in Watts on average have earnings of only $7,000 a year in their mid-30s. And that is the average, right? So that means that the vast majority of these men have incomes very close to zero. They're nonworking and so forth. Another somewhat shocking statistic - black men growing up in that particular census tract have something like a 45% chance of being incarcerated on any given day, which means that their lifetime chance of ever being incarcerated is much higher, you know, could well be something like 70 or 80%. VEDANTAM: Did you say on any given day? CHETTY: On a given day. On a given day - the date of the 2010 census, 45% of the black men who grew up in this tract in Watts - it's called the Nickerson Gardens public housing project. Forty-five percent of them are incarcerated. It's a shocking statement about, I mean, the United States, I think, that we have such high levels of incarceration in certain cases. But that is a fact about that tract. Now, you know, at some level, for people living in LA - maybe shocked by that magnitude, but maybe not surprised by the fact that there are very adverse outcomes for kids growing up in that area. Here's maybe something you didn't know, though. If you go a mile or two away, to Compton, you see that rates of incarceration for black men growing up there in families of comparable income are something like 6%. So still actually high - 6% is not a small number. But relative to 45%, it's dramatically lower. And so that's the sense in which when you look at these maps, which we've put out in the form of an interactive tool where you can look at your own address, look at any neighborhood in the United States - 70,000 different neighborhoods splitting up each of these cities into different areas - you see this tremendous variation across very short distances. For kids who grow up in families with comparable income, same racial background, where you're growing up really seems to matter. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Where you grow up really seems to matter. The question is, why? What explains the difference between Salt Lake City and Charlotte? CHETTY: So we don't know yet exactly what is the recipe to produce better outcomes in one place relative to another. But we've looked at a variety of different factors that economists and sociologists have talked about over the years as potentially driving differences in outcomes. And we've identified five or six different things that really seem like strong predictors of these differences. So the first is segregation. So cities that are more segregated by race or by income, where blacks and whites are not interacting as much or where low-income and high-income families are living separated from each other - segregated places like that tend to have much worse outcomes for people of all racial and ethnic groups. So that's one strong pattern in the data. VEDANTAM: Raj has found that upward mobility is less common in places that have a smaller middle class. He's also noticed some other patterns. CHETTY: We find that there's a very strong association between these outcomes and measures of family structure in a neighborhood. So in particular, one of the strongest patterns in the data is that areas where more kids are raised by two-parent families tend to have higher rates of upward mobility. Now, in interpreting that correlation, it's very important to note that it's not mechanically driven by the fact that growing up yourself in a two-parent family leads to better outcomes for a given kid. What we find is even if your own parents are married, if you grow up in an area where a lot of kids are being raised by single parents, you are less likely to climb the income ladder. So what that shows you is this is not the direct effect of your own parents' marital status. It's again something about community-level factors that are associated with the fraction of single parents in an area that's predictive of kids' outcomes. Now, somewhat related to that is the idea of social capital, a concept popularized by my Harvard colleague Bob Putnam. I think of the old adage that it takes a village to raise a child as a way to think about what social capital is. Will someone else help you out even if you're not doing well? Salt Lake City, with the Mormon Church, is thought to be a canonical example of a city with a lot of social capital and correspondingly has high rates of upward mobility. And so as best we can measure it, we find that places with higher levels of social capital tend to have higher levels of upward mobility. And then finally, I'll mention one last one. Coming back to our discussion about schools, as you might expect intuitively, places that have better schools tend to have higher rates of upward mobility. And I think that connection is particularly important to note because schools are something that I think fall clearly in the policy domain where we might be able to figure out how to make changes to improve the quality of schools. Some of the other factors I've been describing, while I think they're very important to study and interesting to understand, it's harder to figure out, what do you do to try to change social capital or family structures in an area? That's, I think, a little bit more complicated, at least to figure out from a policy point of view. VEDANTAM: So Raj established that where you grow up and the kind of school you attend can make a big difference in your life. So the obvious policy implication is move people from areas where outcomes are worse to places where outcomes are better. In the 1990s, the federal government tested this very idea with a program called Moving to Opportunity. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) BOB EDWARDS: This is Morning Edition. I'm Bob Edwards. The federal government is conducting an experiment. It's helping poor people from five cities move into middle-class neighborhoods. Volunteer families were transferred out of troubled sections of Los Angeles, Boston, New York, Chicago and Baltimore. With the help of rent subsidies, the families move to more affluent areas, often in the suburbs. VEDANTAM: Very much like the studies on the effects of great kindergarten teachers, the results from the Moving to Opportunity experiment were underwhelming. But Raj did exactly what he had done with the classroom studies. He asked whether researchers had studied the effects of this program long enough. CHETTY: The Moving to Opportunity study was, in some ways, a landmark study in this field because it said, let's take the perspective of a scientific experiment. We have some evidence where it looks like outcomes vary across these neighborhoods. And let's just go out there and really randomly assign families, effectively, by giving them vouchers to different neighborhoods and see if outcomes differ. And I think everyone who was involved in that study at that point was expecting to see that you'd find really big and immediate impacts on people's outcomes, and this would show that environment really matters. And we would go from there in developing affordable housing policy and so forth. And very disappointingly, the initial studies - and there were many of these - almost uniformly showed that Moving to Opportunity had no real detectable economic impact. There were, to be clear, improvements in the health of adults and other dimensions that we care about - you know, reports of how depressed people were feeling or even indicators of rates of diabetes, things like that. You did see changes there. But in terms of economic outcomes - employment rates, earnings and so forth - didn't find much of an effect. Now, all of those initial studies were looking at the impacts of Moving to Opportunity on adults or kids who were relatively old. They were in their teens at the point of the move. And there was a very simple reason for that. People were eager to evaluate the results of the intervention. And, of course, you couldn't look at young kids' outcomes very quickly after the point of the experiment in the mid-1990s because it would take time for the kids to grow up and then see their earnings in adulthood and so forth. So what we did is echoing, you know, some of the themes, actually, of what we talked about earlier with the Tennessee STAR experiment. We went back to the Moving to Opportunity data, linked that to tax records in order to be able to track people over a longer period of time. And we had a very clear hypothesis going into the study that maybe the reason people hadn't found effects in the Moving to Opportunity data is that it takes time for environment to have an impact. It's not that I just help you move to a different neighborhood, and tomorrow, you end up having completely different outcomes. Rather, it's related to exposure. You have to spend a lot of time, perhaps, growing up in a given place in order to see - really see measurable changes. And so what we found when we went back to the data is remarkably that that's exactly what's going on. If you look at kids who were relatively young - say, below age 12 at the point that they moved as part of this experiment - you see quite substantial gains as a result of moving to a lower-poverty, middle-class neighborhood - something like a 30% increase in earnings, 30% increase in college attendance rates, 25% reduction in the rate of having a teenage birth. So on a variety of outcomes, quite substantial gains. But if you do the exact same analysis for kids who moved at older ages, you see essentially no gain at all. And if you look at adults who moved as part of the experiment, verifying what earlier studies found, we see no gains at all. And so what that's very consistent with is the idea that there's sort of a dosage effect. Or every extra year you spend growing up in a better neighborhood helps you in the long run. But those effects really cumulate to something we're able to detect in the data only if people move young enough. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: If there is one theme that emerges from this kind of analysis, it is about the value of nuances. It is true that geography and education matter. But there are also social factors that have independent effects - a big one, race. CHETTY: Neighborhoods matter, but they're certainly not everything. I mean, I want to be very clear about that. And so race is a very good example where it illustrates that you shouldn't think about neighborhoods as being an environmental set of factors that applies to everyone equally. When we break the data down by race, we find very stark differences, in particular between black and white men growing up in a given neighborhood. For women, there actually aren't very large differences in rates of upward or downward mobility between black and white women. But for black versus white men, you see really stark differences in rates of mobility. A black man and a white man who grow up in families with comparable income, living on the same block, both two-parent families, similar levels of education, similar levels of wealth - so basically, control for all the family-level factors that you can sort of think of. You still see that the black man has much lower chances of climbing the income ladder than white men. And perhaps even more alarmingly, black men have much higher rates of downward mobility than white men. If you're born to an affluent family as a black man, you are much more likely to fall down the income ladder than white men are, who tend to persist near the top of the income distribution. The way I like to think about it is, if you think about upward mobility as climbing an income ladder for white men, it's more like being on a treadmill for black men. Even after you climb up in one generation, you tend to fall back down in the next generation. And that's true even among two kids who grow up in the same neighborhood, who go to the same school and so forth. VEDANTAM: So this presents, obviously, a puzzle. If you have two families, one black, one white - they both have, you know, a son and a daughter. What you're saying is, on average, the white boy is going to do significantly better than the black boy. But the white girl isn't going to do significantly better than the black girl. How do you explain this? CHETTY: You know, again, I think the explanation is something that remains to be fully resolved. But I can give you some sense of what we think might be going on. So when we then use this neighborhood-level data, this granular information, you can go and ask, are there some places in America where we actually see black men doing relatively well? And what might we be able to learn from those examples? So it turns out you can look at certain places - Silver Spring in Maryland, for example. More generally, there are a scattered set of areas across the United States where you see relatively good outcomes for black men. And they tend to have three characteristics, which I think shed some light on why these gaps prevail for men rather than women. So first, we find that these places tend to have relatively low poverty rates. So they have good resources. Second, as you might expect intuitively, they have low levels of racial bias among whites. We find that places with less racial bias have relatively good outcomes for black men relative to white men. And then the third factor we identify is that areas with high rates of father presence, where lots of kids again are being raised in two-parent families and, in particular, black kids are being raised in two-parent families, they tend to have particularly good outcomes for black boys relative to white boys. Now, importantly, that last correlation that I mentioned - that's true only for black boys. When black girls grow up in an area with greater presence of fathers, their outcomes look pretty similar. And so coming back to your question, what is driving these gender disparities? - my sense from this data, while it's not conclusive, it suggests that environmental factors are amplifying these disparities for black men in particular. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: When we come back, how Raj's insights can be applied to policy. You're listening to HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. This is NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) VEDANTAM: Raj Chetty has spent years mining vast troves of data to understand economic mobility and inequality in the United States. Increasingly, Raj and his team are moving from analysis to action. They are asking how the insights they have generated might improve, for example, the quality of education. CHETTY: My big-picture take is we should be doing everything we can to try to have the best teachers in American classrooms. And I think the systems that we currently have in place, for various reasons, don't really achieve that goal. So in most professions in the United States, if you're generating a lot of value for your company, people are going to be able to make changes to try to keep you, right? So you might get a pay raise. You might get a different portfolio of what you have to manage. You might get a promotion in various ways. In most schools, salaries are basically set in lockstep to experience, with no ability for the principals to have discretion to give teachers a bonus if they're doing extremely well or try to, you know, give a retention package to a teacher who has a really attractive offer from a private school or from a totally different employer. And so I think creating a little bit more of that flexibility to retain and recruit top talent in teaching, just like we do in the rest of the economy in the United States, could be incredibly valuable. But I think, you know, more broadly, what I see as the broader problem is teaching is often not viewed as the first profession you'd choose to pursue if you're a really talented kid in the United States. And I think that's really not a good state of affairs. Countries that have excellent educational systems that people point to - Finland, for example - you often hear that kids' aspiration, if they're doing really well in school, is to become a teacher. And so given the importance of teaching, as we've established, for kids' long-term outcomes broadly, I think it's extremely important that it's viewed as a high-status, very desirable profession to go into. VEDANTAM: I want to spend a moment just talking about the caution that might be needed in terms of sort of applying policy solutions. So for example, you'll find that when really good teachers move into some schools, they have measurable effects. They raise the test scores of students. And over time, this has measurable effects on the long-term outcomes of those students. So you would say, we should actually try and get the teachers who can boost test scores. But, of course, if you actually implemented that as policy, you would have schools and teachers now focused on just boosting test scores and teaching to the test. And presumably, you might not actually get the benefit of what you were hoping to get, which is great teaching, not just great test scores. CHETTY: No, that's quite right. And I mean, I think that's an important caution that you have to think about in this context. So if you use test-score-based measures to evaluate teachers, it's possible that you will get a lot of teaching to the test. Now, the way I view it, again, from a scientific point of view, is it's an empirical question. To what extent - when you have incentive systems where you reward teachers based on their productivity, as measured by tests, to what extent do you get unproductive behavior? And if you do, can you do things to combat that? So - give you a very simple example - if we're worried that teachers do things that lead to unproductive teaching to the test in the short run that just artificially boosts your test scores at the end of the current year but doesn't lead to persistent learning, one thing we might be able to do is look at your test scores then in the next grade or the year after and ask, does it seem like these students are continuing to do better, even in the years after they leave your classroom? And if they are, then maybe, you know, you are actually teaching them something that's valuable, and so we're going to reward the teachers who have these persistent impacts rather than the teachers who only have short-term impacts. All of that said, I don't think the policy solution here is some kind of, you know, algorithmic thing, where we just say, we're going to look at your students' test scores and determine your employment and promotion outcomes purely based on that. I view this more as useful information that principals or other managers - that they should incorporate into decisions that they're making and give them the leeway to do that. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Another policy domain that I asked Raj about is housing. For example, if younger kids do better than older kids when they move to new neighborhoods, should housing vouchers be focused on families with the youngest children? CHETTY: We are using our data to identify neighborhoods that would be affordable to low-income families but deliver much better outcomes for their kids. So think of these as places that are basically opportunity bargains. They are places that have good outcomes yet are still affordable. And so what we're doing is providing families, when they come in to apply for a housing voucher, information about these opportunity bargain areas. We're providing assistance to those families in the form of rental brokers - basically, helping them go to those places, look for housing in those places. And we're recruiting landlords in those areas to encourage them to rent their houses to tenants, simplifying the inspection process, simplifying the paperwork and so forth. And the whole goal of this is, without spending any extra money on the vouchers, try to basically achieve more bang for the buck by helping families move to those places. So, you know, the idea is to use the research to try to then make policy changes that will allow us to achieve better outcomes. Just one other, you know, angle on that which is important - this whole study is focused on families with young kids, given our finding that helping people move when they're much older really doesn't have much of an impact - and so another way in which you can see the research directly informing policy design. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering if one concern that is sometimes raised, in terms of sort of the geographic distribution of mobility and the policy solutions that might follow from it, is - you know, so let's say, for example, you look at the Los Angeles data you told me, and one of the policy implications that comes from this is, can we get the kid who's growing up in Watts to move a couple of miles to be growing up in Compton and potentially have better outcomes? And let's assume for a second that you actually had empirical data that showed you that this was actually possible to do, and the outcomes actually would be better. Is that actually solving the problem? Because it doesn't actually solve the problem of what's happening in Watts. It's great for the kids whom you're moving out, but what about for the kids who are left behind? CHETTY: So let me say - that's an excellent point. Let me say a few things on that. So first, I think we actually don't just need to assume that it would lead to better outcomes for the kids. We have direct data now looking at exactly those types of moves that shows very clearly the earlier a child moves from an environment like Watts to the nearby place with lower rates of incarceration, they're going to have a much lower probability of getting incarcerated themselves. Now, is that really solving the problem? Of course, it's solving the problem for that given child, but are you solving a problem societally? So I look at it in two steps. So first of all, many low-income families already move across neighborhoods in a given year. Something like 1 in 5 low-income families moves houses in a given year. So the way we should think about this is not so much that we're going to take a family that was going to stay in a given place permanently, uproot them and move them somewhere else. But rather, at the point that they're moving for whatever other reason, let's potentially encourage them to make a more informed choice that might improve their kids' outcomes in the long run. That, to me, seems like a natural thing to do, just enable people to make the best choices possible. But then the deeper problem you point to is that, are you really solving anything in places like Watts, where you have very adverse outcomes, simply by helping people move around? And I think the answer to that is, of course, no. The solution, at the end of the day - it's not a scalable solution to just move everyone. You're never going to move everyone out of Watts or, you know, a given city to another place. Nor should you try to. Ultimately, of course, you have to think about what you can do in a given place to improve outcomes. And so this is where a lot of where we're headed in the policy domain is not just the Moving to Opportunity approach that I described but actually partnerships with other organizations to evaluate and scale up programs that might improve outcomes in a given area. We're in conversations with groups that provide mentoring services. So think of programs like Big Brothers Big Sisters or My Brother's Keeper, which, specifically for black men, try to provide role models and mentoring. And there's a question of whether you can scale up and design those programs in a way that will really change outcomes in those particular areas. A third potential policy domain, given we're talking about incarceration, is changes in criminal justice that could potentially have significant effects in places like this. So I absolutely agree. You need to think about policy solutions both in place, in tandem with potentially giving families better opportunities to choose where to live. VEDANTAM: When it comes to higher education, which is, of course, where you work, you've found that some universities tend to be better than others in increasing income mobility amongst their students. Which schools are these, and what can we learn from them? Is there a policy prescription here? CHETTY: Yeah. So higher education, I think, is another domain. So just to connect these various pieces, the way I look at mobility is kind of a pipeline from birth to adulthood. And so we've spent a lot of time focusing on elementary education, kindergarten, neighborhood experiences as you grow up. And then, of course, you get to college. And college is a place where a lot of us, I think, have the intuition that it's this domain where you're going to mix with a new group of people. It's going to be a lot more diverse than the neighborhood in which you grow up and so forth. And so the starting point to note here is that that actually is not true in the United States. So colleges are just as segregated by income as the neighborhood in which you grow up is. That is, your chances of meeting someone from a different socio-economic background in your college are just about the same as your chances of meeting someone from a different socio-economic background in the high school that you go to. So certain colleges in America, especially the elite, private institutions, have a very high representation of extremely high-income students in their student body. Now, the consequence of that - coming back to the question about mobility - is you can't, in a mechanical sense, contribute a lot to upward mobility if you don't have a lot of low-income kids to begin with, right? Harvard, mechanically, cannot be helping a lot of low-income kids climb the income ladder because there aren't that many low-income kids at Harvard, Stanford, Princeton, Yale, et cetera to begin with. In contrast, if you look at a set of mid-tier public schools - think of places like the City University of New York or California state colleges - we find that these colleges, in an accounting (ph) sense, actually have the highest rates of socio-economic mobility. And as a result, if you ask how many kids are starting out in a poor family and moving up the income distribution, it's these mid-tier public schools where you see a lot of that happening. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: We began this conversation, Raj, by talking about your own life. And I actually want to end the conversation by going back to your own life, as well, because I think your own life story, in some ways, is very instructive about many of the ideas we've talked about today. You know, as I was preparing for the interview and I was reading up some things about your life, I remembered a story about the philosopher Bertrand Russell. He grew up in a family of writers, and he assumed when he was a kid that everyone wrote books. At one point, Russell meets someone. And if I'm remembering the story correctly, I think it's a gardener. And he's astonished to find the man is not an author. And I thought of that story when I heard that as prolific as you are, you were the last person in your family to get an academic paper published. Is that actually true? CHETTY: Yes, that is actually true. And I actually think I remember my father telling me the story about Bertrand Russell when I was a kid. So I come from a family of academics. I have two older sisters, both of whom are researchers, as well. And so I was the last one in my family to get a Ph. D. and publish a paper. And so it was definitely in the air, in the water, so to speak, around me. And as I've talked about, through various examples empirically, I think exposure, environment plays a huge role. And I absolutely see that in the work that I'm doing. VEDANTAM: And I think that is the deeper truth to the story - your own life story but also the work that you've been doing. You know, when we think about excellence, we think of, you know, Raj Chetty, MacArthur genius. We imagine the lonely climber on top of the mountain. But in reality, the story you're painting is much closer, you know, to the ideal - you know, Isaac Newton's ideal - if I've seen further, it's because I stand on the shoulders of giants. CHETTY: That's absolutely right. And I think, Shankar, that was made most evident to me, actually, in thinking about my extended family, where I see, you know, the many different experiences that we've had as a result of the environments in which we grew up. So in particular, as you might know, in Indian families, growing up - especially in villages in poverty, families often chose one child to educate. And so it so happened to be, in my father's family, he was the one who ended up getting higher education, ended up coming to the United States to University of Wisconsin-Madison to get a Ph. D. And my mom was one of the first women to become a doctor in our community in South India - again, the only person in her family to get a higher education. And what I've seen is how those decisions have manifested themselves through the generations in our family. So my cousins, many of whom actually have the same name as me - Raj, you know, named after my maternal grandfather - while they all are happy in their own ways and are leading fulfilling lives, the opportunities they've had have been dramatically different, with one of them living in Singapore to support his family in India and, you know, not able to be with his kids as they're growing up, another in - working in kind of a, you know, difficult job in New York City in kind of a manual-labor sort of position. And so again, I think the opportunities I've had - exactly as you said - are entirely a function of the environment that I happen to have been lucky to grow up in - and, you know, I think more broadly, have been studying how to replicate those opportunities for others. VEDANTAM: Raj Chetty is an economist at Harvard University. Raj, thank you for joining me today on HIDDEN BRAIN. CHETTY: My pleasure.

Raj mentioned a tool that tracks economic mobility neighborhood by neighborhood. You can put in your address at opportnityatlas. org. Once again, that's opportunityatlasorg. Our unsung hero this week is principal Ryan Junge at Keystone Elementary School in Iowa. When we were trying to figure out which kindergarten classroom we wanted to visit, we looked for a school in a part of the country that has one of the best records of upward mobility. That's how we found Keystone Elementary in a rural part of eastern Iowa. Principal Junge allowed us to hang out in one of his kindergarten classrooms. Now, it takes a lot to run a school. And having an audio producer running about isn't high on your list of priorities. But he got on board very quickly and figured out a way to make it possible. We are grateful.

ADAM BRUMM: They were at least 40,000 years old, which was a very, very surprising discovery. KENNEDY: Adam Brumm is an archaeologist at Australia's Griffith University, and his team analyzed mineral deposits that formed over the works to figure out their age.

In 2017, they found something breathtaking. BRUMM: When you look up on the cave wall, you see all of these red paintings. KENNEDY: Tests showed that this is our species' oldest known figurative art. It's a staggering 44,000 years old. And it tells a complicated story. The work stretches across a cave wall for 16 feet and shows hunters surrounding buffaloes and pigs, and the hunters in the story don't exactly look human. BRUMM: They appear to be human, but they seem to have some features or characteristics of animals. KENNEDY: Brumm thinks the part human, part animal figures show not only artistic ability of these ancient people but suggests that they could imagine things that they haven't actually seen.

Thanks so much for being with us. CHUNG KUN SHIH: Thank you. SIMON: So how did you find out dinosaurs had lice? SHIH: Well, we tried very hard over many years. These lice are very small. We are talking about . 15 millimeter to . 25 millimeters. They are so small, they cannot be preserved in the compression fossil - that's a rock type of fossils - but in amber. Good thing is amber preserves even such a small insect. And finally, we are the first time people found and reported licelike insects in amber or in the early Cretaceous. SIMON: Was it widespread, lice among dinosaurs? SHIH: We suspect it is. We only found these two specimens from the fossil preservation. But we work with a feathered dinosaur expert, and we show him the amber feather. And then he conduct his study, and then he found out these are two feathers from two different feathered dinosaurs. And now, of course, we also know lice, they will go to other hosts. Like, from the parents - go to the young ones and try to propagate themselves. So at that time, I think there are many feathered dinosaurs having the lice. SIMON: And these - only feathered dinosaurs? SHIH: Yes. SIMON: And, of course, dinosaurs weren't in a good position to shampoo their feathers, were they? SHIH: (Laughter) That's correct, yes. And also, if we look at the structure of these licelike insects, they have the body structure to climb on the feather and prevent to being removed by the host. SIMON: Yuck. I gather you've done research on other insects that were bounded on dinosaurs, right? SHIH: Yes. We conducted flea studies, and these fleas compared to today - these fleas are much worse, much more nasty. The fleas at that time, it's about 2 centimeter or 2. 5 centimeter long. And. . . SIMON: That's a big flea. SHIH: Yes. And then also the flea, they have the sawlike mouth part. SIMON: A sawlike mouth part on a flea? SHIH: Yes. . . SIMON: Oh, my word. SHIH: . . . And then they used that to cut through the thick skin of a host and then suck the blood from the dinosaur. So compared to that, the lice chewing on feather is much milder. SIMON: Wow. Yes, I'd say so. Was a tough world, wasn't it? SHIH: Yes, it was a tough world. But today, it is also a very tough world. SIMON: That's very true.

We conducted flea studies, and these fleas compared to today - these fleas are much worse, much more nasty. The fleas at that time, it's about 2 centimeter or 2. 5 centimeter long. And. . . SIMON: That's a big flea. SHIH: Yes. And then also the flea, they have the sawlike mouth part. SIMON: A sawlike mouth part on a flea? SHIH: Yes. . . SIMON: Oh, my word. SHIH: . . . And then they used that to cut through the thick skin of a host and then suck the blood from the dinosaur. So compared to that, the lice chewing on feather is much milder. SIMON: Wow. Yes, I'd say so. Was a tough world, wasn't it? SHIH: Yes, it was a tough world. But today, it is also a very tough world. SIMON: That's very true. Chung Kun Shih, thank you very much for speaking with us about dinosaur lice. It's been an education and even a pleasure. Thank you, sir. SHIH: Thank you.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. Almost a century and a half ago, a young German philosopher named Hermann Ebbinghaus picked up a curious book at a used bookstore. It was called \"Elements Of Psychophysics\" and it described how to gather data on invisible mental processes. The book gave Ebbinghaus an idea. AYANNA THOMAS: And he thinks about, OK, well, we all have this experience of learning information and forgetting information. How can I study that? VEDANTAM: Psychologist Ayanna Thomas - she says Ebbinghaus wanted to answer a big question. How does memory work? THOMAS: He really wanted to understand memory at its most basic core. How quickly can we learn new information that we've never been exposed to? And how quickly does that information degrade? VEDANTAM: This was the late 1800s. There was no protocol on how to run a psychology experiment. Most insights about memory came from philosophers and theologians. So Ebbinghaus came up with a plan. He would run an experiment on himself. First, he needed something to memorize. He came up with the idea of nonsense syllables - three random letters strung together. He put them on some cards. THOMAS: So more than 2,000 of these. VEDANTAM: Then he shuffled the cards, divided them into groups and set about learning them in a variety of controlled conditions. Sometimes he read the cards aloud. . . UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As Hermann Ebbinghaus) Leg, muf, vok, dal, sen, cap, nud, suk (ph). . . VEDANTAM: . . . Forcing himself to read them at the exact same rate in the same soft tone of voice keeping time to a ticking metronome. (SOUNDBITE OF METRONOME)UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As Hermann Ebbinghaus) Dal, sen, kep, nud, suk, kas, leg (ph). . . VEDANTAM: He would read a group of cards aloud once, hide it, and then try to recite it from memory. Every time he made a mistake, he would stop, note it in his records. . . (SOUNDBITE OF WRITING)VEDANTAM: . . . And start over. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As Hermann Ebbinghaus) Leg, muf, vok. . . (SOUNDBITE OF WRITING)VEDANTAM: He kept doing this - stopping and starting over, stopping and starting over - until he could recite a group of syllables perfectly. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As Hermann Ebbinghaus) Suk, suk. . . VEDANTAM: He repeated this process periodically to see how much he could remember 20 minutes later, an hour later, nine hours, a day and so on. (SOUNDBITE OF WRITING)VEDANTAM: Stopping, starting over, stopping, starting over - for more than six months. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As Hermann Ebbinghaus) Vok, dal, sen, kep, nut (ph). . . VEDANTAM: The experiments were highly precise and monotonous and required a huge amount of self-discipline. His greatest enemy was boredom. Years later, Ebbinghaus told a group of psychologists about the tedium of his most celebrated accomplishment. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As Hermann Ebbinghaus) I shall not go into the agonies that months on end of such study engendered in me. I attempted to. . . Lek, muf, vok, dal, sen, kep, nut, muf, ton, gen (ph). . . And with that respect, the magnitude of the task seemed staggering to me. THOMAS: And you might ask, why would anyone want to do that? Well, his motivation was he wanted to see what information was remembered but also how much information was forgotten. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This week on HIDDEN BRAIN - the science of memory from the early ideas of Ebbinghaus to the latest discoveries of modern psychologists. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: How do our minds hold on to the events of the past? What are the most common ways our memories fail us? Can we ever really know for sure that our memories are telling us the truth? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: How we remember, why we forget and the simple lessons we can all learn to make our memories sharp and vivid. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Hermann Ebbinghaus remembered thousands of three-letter strings and then tried to see how many he remembered the same day, the next week, the next year. He discovered something that many of us experience. Over time, he started to forget things. But since he was running an experiment, it allowed him to actually measure how much he was forgetting and how quickly. It led him to discover something that is today called the forgetting curve. THOMAS: That forgetting curve, if you look at it, you see an exponential decline in what he can accurately remember as time passes. VEDANTAM: This, again, is Ayanna Thomas, a psychologist at Tufts University who studies memory. THOMAS: You see a really quick drop off, so by the time you get out to a week and then a month, there's a lot of information that's been lost. But I also think what's really neat is a month later, there's quite a bit of information that still has been retained. VEDANTAM: What I find really interesting about this story, Ayanna, is that it reveals two things that at some level feel intuitively true to us. All of us have this experience of remembering something and then finding a week later we can't remember what we remembered. And also realizing that if we try and relearn what it is that we have forgotten, it is quicker the second time around than the first. So at one level, he is telling us things that we all experience in our life. But was he also, in some ways, putting on the map the idea that you can actually study these things empirically, that there was a science to memory, that it was amenable to measurement and to precision? THOMAS: Indeed. He was the first to bring this in to a laboratory where he has a hypothesis about how memory is going to operate. And he operationalizes the construct of memory. So I think about memory as a really broad construct - a really broad term. And that term can encompass so many different things. Right now, I'm using memory to communicate with you, right? I'm bringing things up from my long-term memory and I'm using my working memory to communicate that information. But that's not how Ebbinghaus operationalized it. So he thinks about, OK, well, we all have this experience of learning information and forgetting information. How can I study that? And in order to study memory and what Ebbinghaus introduced us to is that we have to figure out what our construct is, we have to define that construct, and then we have to develop tasks that are appropriate to the definition of that construct. You can think about memory in a whole host of different ways. I know how to ride a bike, but I can't tell you exactly how to do it. I just know how to do it. That's still an element of memory and not the one that Ebbinghaus was studying. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: After Hermann Ebbinghaus, other researchers came along and said, OK, we can study memory systematically. Through careful observation and measurement, we can see how memory works and when it fails. In the 1930s, Frederic Bartlett set up an experiment that revealed a very interesting aspect of memory. The experiment revolved around a story - a Native American legend called \"The War Of The Ghosts. \"(SOUNDBITE OF RUNNING WATER)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: One night, two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals, and while they were there, it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war cries, and they thought, maybe this is a war party. They escaped to the shore and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe. . . VEDANTAM: Frederic Bartlett tested the volunteers on what they remembered of the story, sometimes hours later, sometimes days, even months and years later. THOMAS: And what he found was there were these systematic changes to the way these individuals were recalling. They forgot details that were foreign to them. So it was a native story about these ghosts warring during dreams. And so many of the subjects just didn't remember some of these elements that were foreign to their cultural understanding. Many of the subjects also made systematic changes where a word like canoe was changed to boat. And so what he found was that the subjects, when they were retelling this story, they were changing the story so that it aligned with their prior experiences because those prior experiences help us, generally, to remember information from our autobiography. But what those prior experiences are doing is they are putting those new experiences into a just-like story, where we have an idea of how things unfold, but we don't remember the specific details. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: In other words, the forgetting wasn't just random. Hermann Ebbinghaus had suggested that memory was like a sieve. You put stuff in and it falls out gradually over time. Frederic Bartlett said, no. There are certain things that get remembered and certain things that get forgotten. What you already know, what you're familiar with - that shapes what you remember, what you can recall and what gets forgotten. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Effectively, what the experiment showed is that when we recall something, what we remember is only partly about the thing we are remembering. Our memories are also shaped by all the other things we know. Things that are similar to what we already know are more likely to stick. Things that are less similar are likely to drop off or get modified so they fit better with what we already remember. Memory, in other words, is not a simple process of opening a mental file drawer and taking things out. It involves a process of reconstruction. THOMAS: And I always think about it like a paleontologist, where a paleontologist uncovers a fossil just as we uncover a memory. We remember a piece of an element. And we have a piece of the puzzle that we start putting together with other fossil pieces that have been uncovered. And we reconstruct a - and, you know, from the paleontologist perspective, maybe a skeleton of a dinosaur. From our perspective, we reconstruct a memory of a past event. But that paleontologist doesn't have all of the pieces. And what that individual has to do is fill in the gaps with best guesses and prior experience with that person's expertise on what could go there, just as we fill in the gaps of our - these memory holes with our best guess of what could go there. VEDANTAM: I mean, that is both wonderful and terrifying at the same time, Ayanna. THOMAS: Yeah, I think it's really interesting. I think it's really interesting to think about why we do these things, why we misrecollect our past, how those kinds of reconstruction errors occur. And I think about it in my own personal life - I share my memories with my partner. And many of us who have partners, we have these sort of collaborative ways in which we recollect. But those collaborations often result in my incorporating information into my memories that were suggested by this individual, but I never experienced. And so I might have this vivid recollection of something that only my partner experienced because we've shared that information so often. And so that's how we can distort memories in the laboratory. We can just get individuals to try and reconstruct events over and over and over again. And with each reconstructive process, they become more and more confident that that event has occurred. VEDANTAM: So I want to look at this process of mental paleontology a little more carefully. And there have been a number of experiments that have been conducted along these lines which ask people in some ways to place themselves emotionally in events. And these experiments find that we change what we remember as a result of these interventions. THOMAS: Yes, there have been so many experiments now - I guess we're talking about 25 years' worth of research - looking at how people come to believe in things that never occurred. And so we see that people can come to believe that they were lost or that they took a hot air balloon ride or spilled punch on the parents of a bride at a wedding when they were young. And generally, the way that these studies work is we get some sort of information about kinds of events that had happened to them or had not happened to them before the age of, let's say, 10. And then that individual goes through some sort of suggestion procedure. VEDANTAM: Researchers wanted to see if they could induce volunteers to develop false memories. In several studies, they described events to volunteers and then told them that they had drawn these accounts from conversations with their parents or siblings. Another study used a more high-tech method. THOMAS: One of my colleagues went as far as distorting pictures using Photoshop and inserting participants into the picture of a hot air balloon. . . VEDANTAM: Wow. THOMAS: . . . And finding that that resulted in, of course, creating this whole false memory of an event that never took place. And that's quite a distinct event - right? - taking a hot air balloon ride. Even - you would think you would remember that. And if you didn't remember that, you would think that probably never happened. So the fact that - this was Kim Wade and colleagues - the fact that she was able to distort individuals with this technique really demonstrates the suggestive nature of pictures. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)THOMAS: And so personally, you know, I have this experience when I look at old photo albums that my parents have collected that I go back and I'll look at these old pictures of myself and, you know, I'm at 5 graduating from kindergarten. And I'll see these pictures and I have no memory of these events. But you've had this experience. We've all had this experience where you see a picture and you start to think, oh, yeah, I kind of remember that. So it's like you're with your wife and she's suggesting something. Pictures are even more distorting from that perspective because we can mentally generate that image. And that mental generation is a big cue to us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: And in some ways, stories function the same way. I remember my parents telling me a story - and I don't have any personal recollection of this - but telling me a story when I was a very small child and there was a family gathering at our home and many people had come over. And as with many Asian households, people left their footwear at the door or at the entrance to the house before coming in. And apparently, I sort of wandered off from this gathering and I essentially stole everyone's left shoe or left slipper and basically took all the left shoes and left slippers and basically moved them to a new location. And I have obviously no recollection whatsoever of doing this, but I've heard the story so many times that, to me, I can actually sort of vaguely see myself doing this. And I feel also vaguely proud that even at the age of 2, I could pick out just the left slippers from the right ones. THOMAS: I think they're making that up. I don't see how a 2-year-old could have really done that. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). THOMAS: I think that you might have stolen a few shoes and this story has changed so much over the years. Can you imagine (laughter)? VEDANTAM: So that's very sad, Ayanna. You're ruining one of my precious childhood memories. THOMAS: Well, if it really did happen, that's pretty amazing. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) I'm going to go with that version. I'm going to go with that version. THOMAS: OK. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: What Ayanna and other researchers have found over and over again is that our memories are fallible. And the implications of this extend far beyond how we think about our own childhoods. They extend to serious settings like the criminal justice system, where we constantly ask people to make recollections or remember things under oath. Do people remember things accurately? In the early 1970s, Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer ran an experiment to find out. THOMAS: What they were really interested in was how people recollect a witnessed event and how the way in which questions are phrased influence our recollection. VEDANTAM: The researchers showed their volunteers short films of car accidents. Then they asked the volunteers some questions about what they had just seen. THOMAS: And there was a critical manipulation in the first experiment. What they did between groups of participants was they changed one word in the question. VEDANTAM: Some people were asked how fast were the cars going when they contacted each other? Others were asked a question with a more vivid verb, like, how fast were the cars going when they bumped into each other, smashed into each other or hit each other? The people who heard the words smashed or collided recalled that the cars were going faster than the people who heard the word bumped. So changing just one word in the question changed people's memory of the speed of the cars. Then there was something else. The volunteers were asked whether there was broken glass at the scene of the accident. The researchers found that volunteers were much more likely to remember seeing broken glass if the word smashed or hit had been used. THOMAS: And I think it's really important to note that there was no broken glass in any of the images that participants were shown in the study. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)THOMAS: So not only did it change their estimates of speed, which is subjective in and of itself, but participants distorted their recollection in the act of recalling because of the word that was used. And so with no broken glass being present, participants remembered broken glass because that question was posed in a particularly suggestive way. So this has really important implications for criminal justice and how we question witnesses, how we get information about investigations from witnesses. The way in which officers at the scene of a crime, investigators during the context of interviews - the ways in which they question witnesses, whether witnesses are questioned together, whether witnesses talk to one another after the fact and now in the age of social media, now witnesses being able to do their own online investigations - all of these elements are serving to introduce factors that can distort the recollection of witnesses. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: What is especially, you know, dangerous about this is that when people think back, they can't actually tell which of those memories is real and which was made up. After some time, I can't distinguish between the things I actually remember and the things that I have reconstructed. They both feel exactly the same. THOMAS: And I think you're hitting on one of the issues, right? You think that some memories that you have are, as you say, actually remembered. But they're all reconstructed. The question is, which reconstructed memories are more accurate? And can you learn to monitor that process? And I think people can. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Coming up, we delve more deeply into Ayanna's research to understand the many ways our memories can fail us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: The stories we tell ourselves about past events can also change the way we remember the past. Ayanna once brought volunteers into the lab and asked them to imagine doing both ordinary things, like bouncing a ball, and bizarre things, like kissing a magnifying glass. I asked her why she did this and what she found. THOMAS: We were really interested in whether people could accurately distinguish between what they imagined versus what they actually did. And we compared performance on very simple common kinds of activities that people would do in their daily lives - that they could easily think, of course I did that - as compared to things that they would never do. Like, we had kissing magnifying glasses and rubbing lotion on the chair - very strange things that people generally would not do in their daily lives. And so they did some of these things and they imagined some of these things. But critically, what we did was we brought them back in on a second session and we just had them imagine a bunch of - some of these activities over and over and over and over again. And what we found when we tested them two weeks later was that when people imagined these actions, whether they were sort of usual common kinds of actions, like bouncing the ball, or unusual actions, like kissing the magnifying glass, irregardless of the bizarreness of the act, the more times people imagined it, the more likely they were to say that actually they performed it on that first day. So we were able to get people to believe that they did these strange things when they only imagined them repeatedly. And so you can extrapolate and say, well, can you get people to believe they've done very strange things in their lives that they would never have done? And I think the answer is, yes. You can. VEDANTAM: Now, you did find that people were less likely to remember doing the bizarre things than the ordinary things. So it was easier to say, I remember bouncing the ball the first time I came in rather than I kissed the magnifying glass the first time I came in. But there were errors on both counts. THOMAS: Indeed. So it's easier to distort people's memories if the information is plausible. The more common, the more usual, the more easy it is for people to imagine themselves in this activity and maybe pull from their prior experience to distort their memory. And so the more unusual, the less plausible something is, the less likely it is for people to come to believe that these events took place or that they engaged in some particular activity. VEDANTAM: So it's interesting when I think back to that childhood memory of my taking everyone's left slippers, one of the things that I realize my brain is doing is that in my mental image of that scene, I'm painting a picture of myself dressed in the clothes that I've seen myself wear in a childhood photograph. And, of course, I have no idea whether I was wearing those clothes on the day that this particular event happened. And as you say, it might never have happened. But it's interesting that I'm fleshing out things that actually I have no idea about using different elements of what I know about the past, in a way, to create essentially this picture that makes sense of a past event that I don't actually remember. THOMAS: And those pictures of our - when we were children are highly suggestive of the way that we construct our childhood memories. I've seen myself in I think one or two outfits in pictures, and those are - that's pretty much how I imagine prior events. I must have been wearing this dress. Obviously, I had more than two dresses - or maybe I didn't - but I don't know. In fact, I remember very little from those early days. So, yeah, we use our pictures. We use those stories your family has embellished and you stole all the left shoes. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). THOMAS: And those all serve to create a really fun story to tell but maybe not an accurate depiction of what actually took place. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: The fact that memory often is not an accurate depiction of what took place can help us understand how two people can have very different recollections of the same event. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHUCK GRASSLEY: Can you affirm that the testimony you're about to give before the committee will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God? BRETT KAVANAUGH: I do. GRASSLEY: And. . . VEDANTAM: One of the things I wanted to ask you is, when you see stories breaking in the news that revolve around people's recollections of events, I'm wondering how you, as a memory researcher, process these stories? And the story that springs to mind is the one that occurred some time ago where Christine Blasey Ford accused now Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were both teenagers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD: I don't have all the answers, and I don't remember as much as I would like to, but the details about that night that bring me here today are the ones I will never forget. They have been seared. . . VEDANTAM: She said she had a very vivid memory of this happening. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)FORD: Brett and Mark came into the bedroom and locked the door behind them. There was music playing in the bedroom. VEDANTAM: He said that it did not happen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KAVANAUGH: I categorically and unequivocally deny the allegation against me by Dr. Ford. I never had any sexual or physical encounter of any kind with Dr. Ford. I never attended a gathering. . . VEDANTAM: And in some ways, the country was divided over these dueling memories. What would you have said if you were on the expert witness stand about how to understand these two very different recollections about an event? THOMAS: Well, I think that it's important to note that both individuals could be recalling that night as accurately as they could. But the interpretation of saying that this couldn't have happened because I would have remembered it is an inappropriate interpretation of how memory works. Of course, it could have happened and you have forgotten it because often we will remember things that are particularly salient to us. And so sometimes we forget things that maybe are really important to other people because they weren't that big of a deal to us. And so I use the analogy of my brother and I. My brother and I have lots of shared childhood memories. He's three years younger than me. And he will tell me stories that he remembers very well and I have no recollection. And it's because it wasn't that big of a deal to me, but it was a big deal to him. And so I think the important thing in the Blasey Ford and Kavanaugh case is they both - neither necessarily were lying about the - that past. It's just that memories are going to differentially degrade and differentially be distorted for different individuals. Do I know who was accurate in that retelling? I don't. Could both have been distorted? Most definitely. VEDANTAM: What was interesting to me, based on what you've told me for the last several minutes, is that I think many of us believe that the more vividly we recall something, the more it must have happened. And I think when a lot of people watched the disagreement unfold on national television, we said, well, she clearly believes it did happen and he clearly believes it didn't happen. And only one of them, therefore, must be true and the other one must be lying because if they both vividly recall this, clearly they both would have remembered something as astonishing as this happening or something as out of the ordinary as this happening. And in some ways, what you're suggesting is actually more difficult to stomach, which is that they both could have been telling the truth or they both could in some ways have been making up something without actually realizing it. THOMAS: Exactly. You know, you hear these people say, oh, I believe this individual or I believe this other individual. And the question is not about belief. Both have their own versions of the truth. And the - what people have to understand is that there is no getting at exactly what happened on a night 30 years ago or 40 years ago. There's just no way to get at that information. Unless there was some video recording, we do not know. I always think back to - have you ever seen that movie \"Rashomon? \"VEDANTAM: Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"RASHOMON\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character, non-English language spoken). THOMAS: \"Rashomon\" is a great movie to think about from this context because you have a retelling of an eyewitnessed event. And, you know, some of the witnesses to this crime have motivation to lie, but some don't. And they just tell a different version from their own perspective. And something, you know, these - this is really what's going on, generally. When we are telling about a past event, even if it's traumatic, we're telling it from our perspective. And that perspective alters our recollection. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Just as we are sometimes too confident about our memories, Ayanna says there are other times when we're too insecure - when we jump to the conclusion our memories are failing us. Take, for example, the experience that many older people report in forgetting where they left their keys or where they parked their car. THOMAS: And I used to think that older adults actually are demonstrating more of these memory failures than their younger counterparts. And to some extent, that's true. There is age-related decline in attention processes and memory encoding processes that likely result in these kinds of errors and will increase the frequency of these errors. But I also think that older adults are just more sensitive to these kinds of errors and are more likely to remember the error than their younger counterparts. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)THOMAS: Because many individuals, as they get older, become more sensitive to potential problems with their cognition and their aging, whenever they have these kinds of failures, those failures are more salient and so they remember them more. So I think there's also a bias in reporting, where there's underreporting for younger people and overreporting for older people. VEDANTAM: And you and others have also found that if you, in some ways, frame challenges as being about, you know, declining memory, you're more likely to see errors among older people in a phenomenon that's sometimes called stereotype threat. THOMAS: Right. And so - and I do this work in collaboration with my colleague Marie Mazerolle. And we were really interested in how when you either activate or alleviate threat in older adults, how that influences memory and other cognitive processes. And so what I mean by that is there is a negative stereotype associated with getting older. And implicit in that negative stereotype is that you're going to demonstrate these cognitive deficits. And in fact, the majority of time I bring people into the lab that are, let's say, over the age of 65, they're coming into the cognitive aging and memory lab. And the first thing they say to me or the researchers who are testing them is, well, you know, I have a terrible memory, or I'm really worried about my memory. They're already feeling threatened. . . VEDANTAM: Mmm hmm. THOMAS: . . . About their memory. And that psychological experience of just worrying about one's memory tends to negatively impact performance on memory tests. And so you - when you reduce that anxiety and you alleviate that threat, older individuals do better. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: When we come back, how all of us can improve our ability to remember things. Because memory works in predictable ways, it turns out there are specific things you can do to make your own memory better. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NELSON DELLIS: Four hearts, four of diamonds, jack of diamonds, six of hearts. . . VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DELLIS: . . . Clubs, eight of clubs, nine of clubs, two of hearts. . . VEDANTAM: What you're hearing is the voice of a man named Nelson Dellis. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DELLIS: . . . Six of clubs, eight of hearts. . . VEDANTAM: He's what's known as a memory athlete. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DELLIS: . . . Five of spades, eight of spades, seven of clubs. . . VEDANTAM: Memory athletes memorize huge quantities of information, like strings of numbers, lists of words and decks of cards. This is Nelson at a memory championship in 2014. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DELLIS: . . . Four of spades, jack of hearts, 10 of hearts. . . THOMAS: I really love watching memory competitions and watching these memory athletes be able to rehearse back long strings of numbers and recite back long passages from books. They are just like us. And we could do what they do. And what they're doing is they're using memory like a skill that can be honed and perfected. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: So how do memory athletes imprint all this information in their minds? One of the most popular techniques is called a memory palace. You create a mental image of a familiar location, like your house or the street where you grew up. Then you plan out a path through that space, creating conspicuous stops along the way. Once you've done that, place all the items you want to remember at each of those stops. This mental image - the location, the path, the stops with the items on it - this becomes your memory palace. Here's an example. Let's say you want to remember four things in a list. First, pick a location like your house. Now make a path with four stops along the way. You might start at the front door, then stop at your coat closet, followed by the kitchen then the bedroom. Now go back and mentally place the four things you want to remember at each of those locations. Once you've done this, remembering your list gets easier. Just walk through your house in your mind and look at the four things along the path. The memory palace is based on the idea that to remember things that are unfamiliar, you want to hook them onto things that are familiar. It's an ancient technique going back to Greek and Roman orators who often had to learn long speeches by heart. THOMAS: What individuals would be doing when they were giving speeches is they would associate elements of the speech to different individuals seated in the room. If people were sitting in the same place in specific rooms, they would be able to associate, let's say, the first line of the speech with a person sitting in the first row on the right and so on and so forth. And so all of - all these speakers would have to do is look across the room to be able to remember the different elements of the speech. VEDANTAM: What's so fascinating about what you're saying, Ayanna, in some ways is that the very same processes that in some ways can contaminate memory, which is our past experiences - the things that we know well can contaminate the things that we learn, the things that happen to us because memory is reconstructed - you can actually use this now to actually improve your memory. You can actually use it to remember things that happened by associating them with other things in your past that you're familiar with. THOMAS: Yes. So we talked about how prior experience can distort memory. But prior experience can also scaffold memory and we can use it to learn new information. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering if I can give you a list of five things to try and remember and have you essentially put them on a familiar path and have you do this sort of live so we can see how this works? Would you be game to do that? THOMAS: (Laughter) We can try. I will maybe fail miserably. VEDANTAM: Well, we - remember the stereotype threat research, though. You shouldn't tell yourself that you're going to fail miserably. THOMAS: (Laughter) Yes. VEDANTAM: All right. So the five items I want you to try and remember are milk, eggs, olive oil, garlic and pink cake frosting. So can you build a memory palace or one of these walks where you're familiar with where you place these five items? And I can tell you them - I can tell each of them to you as you go along the path so that you will remember them in the future. Again, milk, eggs, olive oil, garlic and pink cake frosting. THOMAS: OK. I will try. VEDANTAM: Do you want to try and tell us what you are doing in your head so that we can follow along with you, whatever the path is that you're setting up? THOMAS: Well, for me, actually, I'm thinking about what I would cook with these elements. So I'm making all of these elements interact. And you threw a little curveball in there with garlic. But fortunately, garlic is a distinctive element in that list because I can make a cake with most of what you've - what you already talked about. VEDANTAM: Uh-huh. THOMAS: So that helps because now the four elements that were potentially unassociated are now associated. . . VEDANTAM: Uh-huh. THOMAS: . . . Into one unit. So I've made something distinctive - a pink frosted garlic cake. It sounds terrible. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) It does sound terrible. But what's so interesting here, in some ways, is you're employing imagination to boost memory. And we talked earlier about how imagination can undermine memory. Isn't it fascinating that it can play these dual roles? THOMAS: Yeah. Our imaginations are highly effective in allowing us to remember these disparate pieces of information. And so it is associations that allow us to remember information. And when we are able to make associations and when we're able to rely on interactive, unusual imagery, we're able to remember unrelated lists of items. VEDANTAM: So the analogy that's springing to my mind is that to think of, you know, memories - individual memories are like islands. We consolidate those memories but also potentially contaminate them by essentially building bridges to those islands from other islands that we are more familiar with. Some people talk about this as the difference between learning somebody's name is Baker (ph) and that's someone's profession is baker. If you ask that person to remember, you know, do you remember the person's name or do you remember the person's profession, it's usually easier to remember the person's profession two weeks later than to remember that somebody had a name Baker. Talk about this idea, that in some ways the context that matters enormously in terms of what it is that we're remembering and some things just come with more context than others. THOMAS: I really like the analogy of thinking about memory as islands. We think about it as - memories as nodes, right? So you have a particular concept, like baker. And when I say baker, a number of related concepts that are connected to those nodes or connected to those islands, those associative bridges that you're talking about, are activated. So you think about bread and you think about maybe the time of day that you might go to the bakery and you think about your time in France, which I just got back from. So now I'm thinking about France. And you think about all of these contextual elements that allow you to strengthen that memory representation. But those nodes and those associations can also lead to error. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Ayanna has also studied ways in which students can get better at retaining information. One of the most effective methods - taking practice tests. Closing your books and forcing yourself to recall information turns out to be a powerful way to remember things you've learned. Another insight - space out learning and avoid trying to cram everything the last night before an exam; also try to get some sleep. THOMAS: Memory consolidation occurs during sleep, and you have to have specific high-quality sleep in order to consolidate these kinds of memories. It's interesting. I just read a recent article about sleep and consolidation and how - and during the context of sleep cycles, we actually select particularly salient memories. And that gets preferential consolidation treatment while we're sleeping. VEDANTAM: And in some ways, there is an analogy here with physical activity as well, right? Physical - your trainers will tell you, yes, you know, try and come in more than once a week. But they will also tell you if you try and do four hours of physical activity on one day rather than, you know, half an hour every day, you're not giving your body time to rest and actually build up strength and stamina and everything else, that actually the rest is actually part of what makes the physical activity pay off. THOMAS: Right. So it seems that our body requires a balance in order to engage in the variety of interconnected processes that are going to result in physical change. And a memory and memory formation is a physical change in the brain. And memory retrieval is the act of reconstructing some of those changes and bringing them back together to make a conscious experience of a recalled event. VEDANTAM: All right. So I am going to try and see if you remember that list of things that I gave you maybe about 15 or 20 minutes ago. And let's see if you can use your recipe technique, Ayanna, to remember the five items on that grocery list. THOMAS: Yeah. I'll tell you, I actually thought you were going to ask me this pretty soon. And so I mentally retrieved it right about the time we were talking, and I was like, do I have it? I think I do. So it was milk, eggs, olive oil, garlic and pink cake frosting. VEDANTAM: That's spectacular. And I'm sure in years to come, we will both remember the time that you made some delicious garlic cake for us both. THOMAS: (Laughter) I'm very happy with myself.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: I'm Shankar Vedantam, and this is NPR. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST:  From NPR, this is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. Almost a century and a half ago, a young German philosopher named Hermann Ebbinghaus picked up a curious book at a used bookstore. It was called \"Elements Of Psychophysics\" and it described how to gather data on invisible mental processes. The book gave Ebbinghaus an idea. AYANNA THOMAS: And he thinks about, OK, well, we all have this experience of learning information and forgetting information. How can I study that? VEDANTAM: Psychologist Ayanna Thomas - she says Ebbinghaus wanted to answer a big question. How does memory work? THOMAS: He really wanted to understand memory at its most basic core. How quickly can we learn new information that we've never been exposed to? And how quickly does that information degrade? VEDANTAM: This was the late 1800s. There was no protocol on how to run a psychology experiment. Most insights about memory came from philosophers and theologians. So Ebbinghaus came up with a plan. He would run an experiment on himself. First, he needed something to memorize. He came up with the idea of nonsense syllables - three random letters strung together. He put them on some cards. THOMAS: So more than 2,000 of these. VEDANTAM: Then he shuffled the cards, divided them into groups and set about learning them in a variety of controlled conditions. Sometimes he read the cards aloud. . . UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As Hermann Ebbinghaus) Leg, muf, vok, dal, sen, cap, nud, suk (ph). . . VEDANTAM: . . . Forcing himself to read them at the exact same rate in the same soft tone of voice keeping time to a ticking metronome. (SOUNDBITE OF METRONOME) UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As Hermann Ebbinghaus) Dal, sen, kep, nud, suk, kas, leg (ph). . . VEDANTAM: He would read a group of cards aloud once, hide it, and then try to recite it from memory. Every time he made a mistake, he would stop, note it in his records. . . (SOUNDBITE OF WRITING) VEDANTAM: . . . And start over. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As Hermann Ebbinghaus) Leg, muf, vok. . . (SOUNDBITE OF WRITING) VEDANTAM: He kept doing this - stopping and starting over, stopping and starting over - until he could recite a group of syllables perfectly. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As Hermann Ebbinghaus) Suk, suk. . . VEDANTAM: He repeated this process periodically to see how much he could remember 20 minutes later, an hour later, nine hours, a day and so on. (SOUNDBITE OF WRITING) VEDANTAM: Stopping, starting over, stopping, starting over - for more than six months. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As Hermann Ebbinghaus) Vok, dal, sen, kep, nut (ph). . . VEDANTAM: The experiments were highly precise and monotonous and required a huge amount of self-discipline. His greatest enemy was boredom. Years later, Ebbinghaus told a group of psychologists about the tedium of his most celebrated accomplishment. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As Hermann Ebbinghaus) I shall not go into the agonies that months on end of such study engendered in me. I attempted to. . . Lek, muf, vok, dal, sen, kep, nut, muf, ton, gen (ph). . . And with that respect, the magnitude of the task seemed staggering to me. THOMAS: And you might ask, why would anyone want to do that? Well, his motivation was he wanted to see what information was remembered but also how much information was forgotten. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This week on HIDDEN BRAIN - the science of memory from the early ideas of Ebbinghaus to the latest discoveries of modern psychologists. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: How do our minds hold on to the events of the past? What are the most common ways our memories fail us? Can we ever really know for sure that our memories are telling us the truth? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: How we remember, why we forget and the simple lessons we can all learn to make our memories sharp and vivid. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Hermann Ebbinghaus remembered thousands of three-letter strings and then tried to see how many he remembered the same day, the next week, the next year. He discovered something that many of us experience. Over time, he started to forget things. But since he was running an experiment, it allowed him to actually measure how much he was forgetting and how quickly. It led him to discover something that is today called the forgetting curve. THOMAS: That forgetting curve, if you look at it, you see an exponential decline in what he can accurately remember as time passes. VEDANTAM: This, again, is Ayanna Thomas, a psychologist at Tufts University who studies memory. THOMAS: You see a really quick drop off, so by the time you get out to a week and then a month, there's a lot of information that's been lost. But I also think what's really neat is a month later, there's quite a bit of information that still has been retained. VEDANTAM: What I find really interesting about this story, Ayanna, is that it reveals two things that at some level feel intuitively true to us. All of us have this experience of remembering something and then finding a week later we can't remember what we remembered. And also realizing that if we try and relearn what it is that we have forgotten, it is quicker the second time around than the first. So at one level, he is telling us things that we all experience in our life. But was he also, in some ways, putting on the map the idea that you can actually study these things empirically, that there was a science to memory, that it was amenable to measurement and to precision? THOMAS: Indeed. He was the first to bring this in to a laboratory where he has a hypothesis about how memory is going to operate. And he operationalizes the construct of memory. So I think about memory as a really broad construct - a really broad term. And that term can encompass so many different things. Right now, I'm using memory to communicate with you, right? I'm bringing things up from my long-term memory and I'm using my working memory to communicate that information. But that's not how Ebbinghaus operationalized it. So he thinks about, OK, well, we all have this experience of learning information and forgetting information. How can I study that? And in order to study memory and what Ebbinghaus introduced us to is that we have to figure out what our construct is, we have to define that construct, and then we have to develop tasks that are appropriate to the definition of that construct. You can think about memory in a whole host of different ways. I know how to ride a bike, but I can't tell you exactly how to do it. I just know how to do it. That's still an element of memory and not the one that Ebbinghaus was studying. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: After Hermann Ebbinghaus, other researchers came along and said, OK, we can study memory systematically. Through careful observation and measurement, we can see how memory works and when it fails. In the 1930s, Frederic Bartlett set up an experiment that revealed a very interesting aspect of memory. The experiment revolved around a story - a Native American legend called \"The War Of The Ghosts. \" (SOUNDBITE OF RUNNING WATER) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: One night, two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals, and while they were there, it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war cries, and they thought, maybe this is a war party. They escaped to the shore and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe. . . VEDANTAM: Frederic Bartlett tested the volunteers on what they remembered of the story, sometimes hours later, sometimes days, even months and years later. THOMAS: And what he found was there were these systematic changes to the way these individuals were recalling. They forgot details that were foreign to them. So it was a native story about these ghosts warring during dreams. And so many of the subjects just didn't remember some of these elements that were foreign to their cultural understanding. Many of the subjects also made systematic changes where a word like canoe was changed to boat. And so what he found was that the subjects, when they were retelling this story, they were changing the story so that it aligned with their prior experiences because those prior experiences help us, generally, to remember information from our autobiography. But what those prior experiences are doing is they are putting those new experiences into a just-like story, where we have an idea of how things unfold, but we don't remember the specific details. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: In other words, the forgetting wasn't just random. Hermann Ebbinghaus had suggested that memory was like a sieve. You put stuff in and it falls out gradually over time. Frederic Bartlett said, no. There are certain things that get remembered and certain things that get forgotten. What you already know, what you're familiar with - that shapes what you remember, what you can recall and what gets forgotten. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Effectively, what the experiment showed is that when we recall something, what we remember is only partly about the thing we are remembering. Our memories are also shaped by all the other things we know. Things that are similar to what we already know are more likely to stick. Things that are less similar are likely to drop off or get modified so they fit better with what we already remember. Memory, in other words, is not a simple process of opening a mental file drawer and taking things out. It involves a process of reconstruction. THOMAS: And I always think about it like a paleontologist, where a paleontologist uncovers a fossil just as we uncover a memory. We remember a piece of an element. And we have a piece of the puzzle that we start putting together with other fossil pieces that have been uncovered. And we reconstruct a - and, you know, from the paleontologist perspective, maybe a skeleton of a dinosaur. From our perspective, we reconstruct a memory of a past event. But that paleontologist doesn't have all of the pieces. And what that individual has to do is fill in the gaps with best guesses and prior experience with that person's expertise on what could go there, just as we fill in the gaps of our - these memory holes with our best guess of what could go there. VEDANTAM: I mean, that is both wonderful and terrifying at the same time, Ayanna. THOMAS: Yeah, I think it's really interesting. I think it's really interesting to think about why we do these things, why we misrecollect our past, how those kinds of reconstruction errors occur. And I think about it in my own personal life - I share my memories with my partner. And many of us who have partners, we have these sort of collaborative ways in which we recollect. But those collaborations often result in my incorporating information into my memories that were suggested by this individual, but I never experienced. And so I might have this vivid recollection of something that only my partner experienced because we've shared that information so often. And so that's how we can distort memories in the laboratory. We can just get individuals to try and reconstruct events over and over and over again. And with each reconstructive process, they become more and more confident that that event has occurred. VEDANTAM: So I want to look at this process of mental paleontology a little more carefully. And there have been a number of experiments that have been conducted along these lines which ask people in some ways to place themselves emotionally in events. And these experiments find that we change what we remember as a result of these interventions. THOMAS: Yes, there have been so many experiments now - I guess we're talking about 25 years' worth of research - looking at how people come to believe in things that never occurred. And so we see that people can come to believe that they were lost or that they took a hot air balloon ride or spilled punch on the parents of a bride at a wedding when they were young. And generally, the way that these studies work is we get some sort of information about kinds of events that had happened to them or had not happened to them before the age of, let's say, 10. And then that individual goes through some sort of suggestion procedure. VEDANTAM: Researchers wanted to see if they could induce volunteers to develop false memories. In several studies, they described events to volunteers and then told them that they had drawn these accounts from conversations with their parents or siblings. Another study used a more high-tech method. THOMAS: One of my colleagues went as far as distorting pictures using Photoshop and inserting participants into the picture of a hot air balloon. . . VEDANTAM: Wow. THOMAS: . . . And finding that that resulted in, of course, creating this whole false memory of an event that never took place. And that's quite a distinct event - right? - taking a hot air balloon ride. Even - you would think you would remember that. And if you didn't remember that, you would think that probably never happened. So the fact that - this was Kim Wade and colleagues - the fact that she was able to distort individuals with this technique really demonstrates the suggestive nature of pictures. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) THOMAS: And so personally, you know, I have this experience when I look at old photo albums that my parents have collected that I go back and I'll look at these old pictures of myself and, you know, I'm at 5 graduating from kindergarten. And I'll see these pictures and I have no memory of these events. But you've had this experience. We've all had this experience where you see a picture and you start to think, oh, yeah, I kind of remember that. So it's like you're with your wife and she's suggesting something. Pictures are even more distorting from that perspective because we can mentally generate that image. And that mental generation is a big cue to us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: And in some ways, stories function the same way. I remember my parents telling me a story - and I don't have any personal recollection of this - but telling me a story when I was a very small child and there was a family gathering at our home and many people had come over. And as with many Asian households, people left their footwear at the door or at the entrance to the house before coming in. And apparently, I sort of wandered off from this gathering and I essentially stole everyone's left shoe or left slipper and basically took all the left shoes and left slippers and basically moved them to a new location. And I have obviously no recollection whatsoever of doing this, but I've heard the story so many times that, to me, I can actually sort of vaguely see myself doing this. And I feel also vaguely proud that even at the age of 2, I could pick out just the left slippers from the right ones. THOMAS: I think they're making that up. I don't see how a 2-year-old could have really done that. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). THOMAS: I think that you might have stolen a few shoes and this story has changed so much over the years. Can you imagine (laughter)? VEDANTAM: So that's very sad, Ayanna. You're ruining one of my precious childhood memories. THOMAS: Well, if it really did happen, that's pretty amazing. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) I'm going to go with that version. I'm going to go with that version. THOMAS: OK. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: What Ayanna and other researchers have found over and over again is that our memories are fallible. And the implications of this extend far beyond how we think about our own childhoods. They extend to serious settings like the criminal justice system, where we constantly ask people to make recollections or remember things under oath. Do people remember things accurately? In the early 1970s, Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer ran an experiment to find out. THOMAS: What they were really interested in was how people recollect a witnessed event and how the way in which questions are phrased influence our recollection. VEDANTAM: The researchers showed their volunteers short films of car accidents. Then they asked the volunteers some questions about what they had just seen. THOMAS: And there was a critical manipulation in the first experiment. What they did between groups of participants was they changed one word in the question. VEDANTAM: Some people were asked how fast were the cars going when they contacted each other? Others were asked a question with a more vivid verb, like, how fast were the cars going when they bumped into each other, smashed into each other or hit each other? The people who heard the words smashed or collided recalled that the cars were going faster than the people who heard the word bumped. So changing just one word in the question changed people's memory of the speed of the cars. Then there was something else. The volunteers were asked whether there was broken glass at the scene of the accident. The researchers found that volunteers were much more likely to remember seeing broken glass if the word smashed or hit had been used. THOMAS: And I think it's really important to note that there was no broken glass in any of the images that participants were shown in the study. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) THOMAS: So not only did it change their estimates of speed, which is subjective in and of itself, but participants distorted their recollection in the act of recalling because of the word that was used. And so with no broken glass being present, participants remembered broken glass because that question was posed in a particularly suggestive way. So this has really important implications for criminal justice and how we question witnesses, how we get information about investigations from witnesses. The way in which officers at the scene of a crime, investigators during the context of interviews - the ways in which they question witnesses, whether witnesses are questioned together, whether witnesses talk to one another after the fact and now in the age of social media, now witnesses being able to do their own online investigations - all of these elements are serving to introduce factors that can distort the recollection of witnesses. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: What is especially, you know, dangerous about this is that when people think back, they can't actually tell which of those memories is real and which was made up. After some time, I can't distinguish between the things I actually remember and the things that I have reconstructed. They both feel exactly the same. THOMAS: And I think you're hitting on one of the issues, right? You think that some memories that you have are, as you say, actually remembered. But they're all reconstructed. The question is, which reconstructed memories are more accurate? And can you learn to monitor that process? And I think people can. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Coming up, we delve more deeply into Ayanna's research to understand the many ways our memories can fail us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: The stories we tell ourselves about past events can also change the way we remember the past. Ayanna once brought volunteers into the lab and asked them to imagine doing both ordinary things, like bouncing a ball, and bizarre things, like kissing a magnifying glass. I asked her why she did this and what she found. THOMAS: We were really interested in whether people could accurately distinguish between what they imagined versus what they actually did. And we compared performance on very simple common kinds of activities that people would do in their daily lives - that they could easily think, of course I did that - as compared to things that they would never do. Like, we had kissing magnifying glasses and rubbing lotion on the chair - very strange things that people generally would not do in their daily lives. And so they did some of these things and they imagined some of these things. But critically, what we did was we brought them back in on a second session and we just had them imagine a bunch of - some of these activities over and over and over and over again. And what we found when we tested them two weeks later was that when people imagined these actions, whether they were sort of usual common kinds of actions, like bouncing the ball, or unusual actions, like kissing the magnifying glass, irregardless of the bizarreness of the act, the more times people imagined it, the more likely they were to say that actually they performed it on that first day. So we were able to get people to believe that they did these strange things when they only imagined them repeatedly. And so you can extrapolate and say, well, can you get people to believe they've done very strange things in their lives that they would never have done? And I think the answer is, yes. You can. VEDANTAM: Now, you did find that people were less likely to remember doing the bizarre things than the ordinary things. So it was easier to say, I remember bouncing the ball the first time I came in rather than I kissed the magnifying glass the first time I came in. But there were errors on both counts. THOMAS: Indeed. So it's easier to distort people's memories if the information is plausible. The more common, the more usual, the more easy it is for people to imagine themselves in this activity and maybe pull from their prior experience to distort their memory. And so the more unusual, the less plausible something is, the less likely it is for people to come to believe that these events took place or that they engaged in some particular activity. VEDANTAM: So it's interesting when I think back to that childhood memory of my taking everyone's left slippers, one of the things that I realize my brain is doing is that in my mental image of that scene, I'm painting a picture of myself dressed in the clothes that I've seen myself wear in a childhood photograph. And, of course, I have no idea whether I was wearing those clothes on the day that this particular event happened. And as you say, it might never have happened. But it's interesting that I'm fleshing out things that actually I have no idea about using different elements of what I know about the past, in a way, to create essentially this picture that makes sense of a past event that I don't actually remember. THOMAS: And those pictures of our - when we were children are highly suggestive of the way that we construct our childhood memories. I've seen myself in I think one or two outfits in pictures, and those are - that's pretty much how I imagine prior events. I must have been wearing this dress. Obviously, I had more than two dresses - or maybe I didn't - but I don't know. In fact, I remember very little from those early days. So, yeah, we use our pictures. We use those stories your family has embellished and you stole all the left shoes. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). THOMAS: And those all serve to create a really fun story to tell but maybe not an accurate depiction of what actually took place. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: The fact that memory often is not an accurate depiction of what took place can help us understand how two people can have very different recollections of the same event. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHUCK GRASSLEY: Can you affirm that the testimony you're about to give before the committee will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God? BRETT KAVANAUGH: I do. GRASSLEY: And. . . VEDANTAM: One of the things I wanted to ask you is, when you see stories breaking in the news that revolve around people's recollections of events, I'm wondering how you, as a memory researcher, process these stories? And the story that springs to mind is the one that occurred some time ago where Christine Blasey Ford accused now Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were both teenagers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD: I don't have all the answers, and I don't remember as much as I would like to, but the details about that night that bring me here today are the ones I will never forget. They have been seared. . . VEDANTAM: She said she had a very vivid memory of this happening. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FORD: Brett and Mark came into the bedroom and locked the door behind them. There was music playing in the bedroom. VEDANTAM: He said that it did not happen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAVANAUGH: I categorically and unequivocally deny the allegation against me by Dr. Ford. I never had any sexual or physical encounter of any kind with Dr. Ford. I never attended a gathering. . . VEDANTAM: And in some ways, the country was divided over these dueling memories. What would you have said if you were on the expert witness stand about how to understand these two very different recollections about an event? THOMAS: Well, I think that it's important to note that both individuals could be recalling that night as accurately as they could. But the interpretation of saying that this couldn't have happened because I would have remembered it is an inappropriate interpretation of how memory works. Of course, it could have happened and you have forgotten it because often we will remember things that are particularly salient to us. And so sometimes we forget things that maybe are really important to other people because they weren't that big of a deal to us. And so I use the analogy of my brother and I. My brother and I have lots of shared childhood memories. He's three years younger than me. And he will tell me stories that he remembers very well and I have no recollection. And it's because it wasn't that big of a deal to me, but it was a big deal to him. And so I think the important thing in the Blasey Ford and Kavanaugh case is they both - neither necessarily were lying about the - that past. It's just that memories are going to differentially degrade and differentially be distorted for different individuals. Do I know who was accurate in that retelling? I don't. Could both have been distorted? Most definitely. VEDANTAM: What was interesting to me, based on what you've told me for the last several minutes, is that I think many of us believe that the more vividly we recall something, the more it must have happened. And I think when a lot of people watched the disagreement unfold on national television, we said, well, she clearly believes it did happen and he clearly believes it didn't happen. And only one of them, therefore, must be true and the other one must be lying because if they both vividly recall this, clearly they both would have remembered something as astonishing as this happening or something as out of the ordinary as this happening. And in some ways, what you're suggesting is actually more difficult to stomach, which is that they both could have been telling the truth or they both could in some ways have been making up something without actually realizing it. THOMAS: Exactly. You know, you hear these people say, oh, I believe this individual or I believe this other individual. And the question is not about belief. Both have their own versions of the truth. And the - what people have to understand is that there is no getting at exactly what happened on a night 30 years ago or 40 years ago. There's just no way to get at that information. Unless there was some video recording, we do not know. I always think back to - have you ever seen that movie \"Rashomon? \" VEDANTAM: Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"RASHOMON\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character, non-English language spoken). THOMAS: \"Rashomon\" is a great movie to think about from this context because you have a retelling of an eyewitnessed event. And, you know, some of the witnesses to this crime have motivation to lie, but some don't. And they just tell a different version from their own perspective. And something, you know, these - this is really what's going on, generally. When we are telling about a past event, even if it's traumatic, we're telling it from our perspective. And that perspective alters our recollection. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Just as we are sometimes too confident about our memories, Ayanna says there are other times when we're too insecure - when we jump to the conclusion our memories are failing us. Take, for example, the experience that many older people report in forgetting where they left their keys or where they parked their car. THOMAS: And I used to think that older adults actually are demonstrating more of these memory failures than their younger counterparts. And to some extent, that's true. There is age-related decline in attention processes and memory encoding processes that likely result in these kinds of errors and will increase the frequency of these errors. But I also think that older adults are just more sensitive to these kinds of errors and are more likely to remember the error than their younger counterparts. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) THOMAS: Because many individuals, as they get older, become more sensitive to potential problems with their cognition and their aging, whenever they have these kinds of failures, those failures are more salient and so they remember them more. So I think there's also a bias in reporting, where there's underreporting for younger people and overreporting for older people. VEDANTAM: And you and others have also found that if you, in some ways, frame challenges as being about, you know, declining memory, you're more likely to see errors among older people in a phenomenon that's sometimes called stereotype threat. THOMAS: Right. And so - and I do this work in collaboration with my colleague Marie Mazerolle. And we were really interested in how when you either activate or alleviate threat in older adults, how that influences memory and other cognitive processes. And so what I mean by that is there is a negative stereotype associated with getting older. And implicit in that negative stereotype is that you're going to demonstrate these cognitive deficits. And in fact, the majority of time I bring people into the lab that are, let's say, over the age of 65, they're coming into the cognitive aging and memory lab. And the first thing they say to me or the researchers who are testing them is, well, you know, I have a terrible memory, or I'm really worried about my memory. They're already feeling threatened. . . VEDANTAM: Mmm hmm. THOMAS: . . . About their memory. And that psychological experience of just worrying about one's memory tends to negatively impact performance on memory tests. And so you - when you reduce that anxiety and you alleviate that threat, older individuals do better. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: When we come back, how all of us can improve our ability to remember things. Because memory works in predictable ways, it turns out there are specific things you can do to make your own memory better. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NELSON DELLIS: Four hearts, four of diamonds, jack of diamonds, six of hearts. . . VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DELLIS: . . . Clubs, eight of clubs, nine of clubs, two of hearts. . . VEDANTAM: What you're hearing is the voice of a man named Nelson Dellis. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DELLIS: . . . Six of clubs, eight of hearts. . . VEDANTAM: He's what's known as a memory athlete. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DELLIS: . . . Five of spades, eight of spades, seven of clubs. . . VEDANTAM: Memory athletes memorize huge quantities of information, like strings of numbers, lists of words and decks of cards. This is Nelson at a memory championship in 2014. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DELLIS: . . . Four of spades, jack of hearts, 10 of hearts. . . THOMAS: I really love watching memory competitions and watching these memory athletes be able to rehearse back long strings of numbers and recite back long passages from books. They are just like us. And we could do what they do. And what they're doing is they're using memory like a skill that can be honed and perfected. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: So how do memory athletes imprint all this information in their minds? One of the most popular techniques is called a memory palace. You create a mental image of a familiar location, like your house or the street where you grew up. Then you plan out a path through that space, creating conspicuous stops along the way. Once you've done that, place all the items you want to remember at each of those stops. This mental image - the location, the path, the stops with the items on it - this becomes your memory palace. Here's an example. Let's say you want to remember four things in a list. First, pick a location like your house. Now make a path with four stops along the way. You might start at the front door, then stop at your coat closet, followed by the kitchen then the bedroom. Now go back and mentally place the four things you want to remember at each of those locations. Once you've done this, remembering your list gets easier. Just walk through your house in your mind and look at the four things along the path. The memory palace is based on the idea that to remember things that are unfamiliar, you want to hook them onto things that are familiar. It's an ancient technique going back to Greek and Roman orators who often had to learn long speeches by heart. THOMAS: What individuals would be doing when they were giving speeches is they would associate elements of the speech to different individuals seated in the room. If people were sitting in the same place in specific rooms, they would be able to associate, let's say, the first line of the speech with a person sitting in the first row on the right and so on and so forth. And so all of - all these speakers would have to do is look across the room to be able to remember the different elements of the speech. VEDANTAM: What's so fascinating about what you're saying, Ayanna, in some ways is that the very same processes that in some ways can contaminate memory, which is our past experiences - the things that we know well can contaminate the things that we learn, the things that happen to us because memory is reconstructed - you can actually use this now to actually improve your memory. You can actually use it to remember things that happened by associating them with other things in your past that you're familiar with. THOMAS: Yes. So we talked about how prior experience can distort memory. But prior experience can also scaffold memory and we can use it to learn new information. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering if I can give you a list of five things to try and remember and have you essentially put them on a familiar path and have you do this sort of live so we can see how this works? Would you be game to do that? THOMAS: (Laughter) We can try. I will maybe fail miserably. VEDANTAM: Well, we - remember the stereotype threat research, though. You shouldn't tell yourself that you're going to fail miserably. THOMAS: (Laughter) Yes. VEDANTAM: All right. So the five items I want you to try and remember are milk, eggs, olive oil, garlic and pink cake frosting. So can you build a memory palace or one of these walks where you're familiar with where you place these five items? And I can tell you them - I can tell each of them to you as you go along the path so that you will remember them in the future. Again, milk, eggs, olive oil, garlic and pink cake frosting. THOMAS: OK. I will try. VEDANTAM: Do you want to try and tell us what you are doing in your head so that we can follow along with you, whatever the path is that you're setting up? THOMAS: Well, for me, actually, I'm thinking about what I would cook with these elements. So I'm making all of these elements interact. And you threw a little curveball in there with garlic. But fortunately, garlic is a distinctive element in that list because I can make a cake with most of what you've - what you already talked about. VEDANTAM: Uh-huh. THOMAS: So that helps because now the four elements that were potentially unassociated are now associated. . . VEDANTAM: Uh-huh. THOMAS: . . . Into one unit. So I've made something distinctive - a pink frosted garlic cake. It sounds terrible. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) It does sound terrible. But what's so interesting here, in some ways, is you're employing imagination to boost memory. And we talked earlier about how imagination can undermine memory. Isn't it fascinating that it can play these dual roles? THOMAS: Yeah. Our imaginations are highly effective in allowing us to remember these disparate pieces of information. And so it is associations that allow us to remember information. And when we are able to make associations and when we're able to rely on interactive, unusual imagery, we're able to remember unrelated lists of items. VEDANTAM: So the analogy that's springing to my mind is that to think of, you know, memories - individual memories are like islands. We consolidate those memories but also potentially contaminate them by essentially building bridges to those islands from other islands that we are more familiar with. Some people talk about this as the difference between learning somebody's name is Baker (ph) and that's someone's profession is baker. If you ask that person to remember, you know, do you remember the person's name or do you remember the person's profession, it's usually easier to remember the person's profession two weeks later than to remember that somebody had a name Baker. Talk about this idea, that in some ways the context that matters enormously in terms of what it is that we're remembering and some things just come with more context than others. THOMAS: I really like the analogy of thinking about memory as islands. We think about it as - memories as nodes, right? So you have a particular concept, like baker. And when I say baker, a number of related concepts that are connected to those nodes or connected to those islands, those associative bridges that you're talking about, are activated. So you think about bread and you think about maybe the time of day that you might go to the bakery and you think about your time in France, which I just got back from. So now I'm thinking about France. And you think about all of these contextual elements that allow you to strengthen that memory representation. But those nodes and those associations can also lead to error. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Ayanna has also studied ways in which students can get better at retaining information. One of the most effective methods - taking practice tests. Closing your books and forcing yourself to recall information turns out to be a powerful way to remember things you've learned. Another insight - space out learning and avoid trying to cram everything the last night before an exam; also try to get some sleep. THOMAS: Memory consolidation occurs during sleep, and you have to have specific high-quality sleep in order to consolidate these kinds of memories. It's interesting. I just read a recent article about sleep and consolidation and how - and during the context of sleep cycles, we actually select particularly salient memories. And that gets preferential consolidation treatment while we're sleeping. VEDANTAM: And in some ways, there is an analogy here with physical activity as well, right? Physical - your trainers will tell you, yes, you know, try and come in more than once a week. But they will also tell you if you try and do four hours of physical activity on one day rather than, you know, half an hour every day, you're not giving your body time to rest and actually build up strength and stamina and everything else, that actually the rest is actually part of what makes the physical activity pay off. THOMAS: Right. So it seems that our body requires a balance in order to engage in the variety of interconnected processes that are going to result in physical change. And a memory and memory formation is a physical change in the brain. And memory retrieval is the act of reconstructing some of those changes and bringing them back together to make a conscious experience of a recalled event. VEDANTAM: All right. So I am going to try and see if you remember that list of things that I gave you maybe about 15 or 20 minutes ago. And let's see if you can use your recipe technique, Ayanna, to remember the five items on that grocery list. THOMAS: Yeah. I'll tell you, I actually thought you were going to ask me this pretty soon. And so I mentally retrieved it right about the time we were talking, and I was like, do I have it? I think I do. So it was milk, eggs, olive oil, garlic and pink cake frosting. VEDANTAM: That's spectacular. And I'm sure in years to come, we will both remember the time that you made some delicious garlic cake for us both. THOMAS: (Laughter) I'm very happy with myself.

We hear a song, and our thoughts travel back in time - where we were, who we were with, how we felt. Now researchers have quantified just how quickly our brains recognize a familiar tune. And as NPR's Patti Neighmond reports, the findings may reinforce using music therapy to help people with dementia. PATTI NEIGHMOND, BYLINE: The connection between music and memory was a life-changing experience for Nancy Gustafson, a retired opera singer who's now an advocate for using music therapy to help patients with dementia. Her mother suffered dementia for a number of years when the family decided she needed 24/7 care and moved her into a memory care unit at an assisted living facility. Gustafson lives out of state. And when she visited her mom for the first time, she was devastated. NANCY GUSTAFSON: She was sitting in her wheelchair with her head down. She was sitting - I'll never forget - at a breakfast table looking so sad and looking so lost and so confused. NEIGHMOND: She answered yes and no to questions. But Gustafson thinks she didn't really understand the question and answered just to be polite. Her mother, she says, couldn't put two words together and did not recognize her. Gustafson visited every month. And as an opera singer, she had some ideas about how she might make a connection. So when she visited her in October, she wheeled her mom next to the piano in the living room of the care facility and started to play and sing. GUSTAFSON: I start playing the piano with her. It might have been \"Hark The Herald Angels Sing\" or \"Deck The Halls\" or \"Angels We Have Heard On High. \" And I start playing, singing along with her. And immediately, she starts singing with me. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"DECK THE HALLS\")GUSTAFSON: (Singing) Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. And I caught her out of the corner of my eye. And I just wanted to jump up and run out of the memory care unit to call my sister immediately saying, Mom is singing with me. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"DECK THE HALLS\")GUSTAFSON: (Singing) . . . Our gay apparel. Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. So I kept playing songs. And she kept singing along. And after 15 minutes, I turned. And I looked at her. And her first words were, you know, that's not very good. Well, I laughed so hard because that's exactly what my mother would have said to me with no Alzheimer's. She would have said that 30 years ago, 40 years before that. NEIGHMOND: Now, Gustafson's a professional singer but admits her piano playing just isn't that great. She promised her mom to try harder and not hit the wrong chords. GUSTAFSON: As we finished, I turned and looked at her. And she said, that's much better. And I was so excited. I looked at my mom, and I said, Mom, you know, we're really getting good. If we practiced enough - you know, this is October. We've got two months. If we practice enough before Christmastime, we could go into the shopping center, put out a cup and earn some money. And she laughed and said, the Gustafson Family Singers. NEIGHMOND: And at that moment, she says, her mom's life and hers changed. GUSTAFSON: Because all of a sudden, not only was she relating to me and was she cracking a joke, but she knew our last name. And she knew that I was related to her. NEIGHMOND: Researchers say familiar music can be a portal into memory. Nina Kraus is a researcher and neuroscientist at Northwestern University. NINA KRAUS: There is a very tight inherent connection between the memory systems in our brain and our auditory brain such that just listening to sounds and listening to familiar sounds will evoke memory. NEIGHMOND: And it's incredibly common, she says, for music to evoke memories that have been lost. KRAUS: Sound is evolutionarily ancient. And it is deeply, deeply rooted in our nervous system. So the memories that we make, the sound-to-meaning connections that we have and that we've made throughout our lives are always there. And it's a matter of being able to access them. NEIGHMOND: And new research shows memories of music are deeply embedded in the brain. Maria Chait with University College London Ear Institute. MARIA CHAIT: We all have these intuitive experiences where we switch stations in the radio, and it seems like we're able to recognize familiar music very quickly. NEIGHMOND: Chait wanted to know just how quickly. She did a small study. Ten people each picked their favorite song. Participants were between 18 and 35. But the songs spanned decades. CHAIT: \"The Way We Were\" by Barbra Streisand, \"Detroit Rock City\" by Kiss, \"You Never Can Tell\" by Chuck Berry, \"Dead Inside\" by The Muse (ph). NEIGHMOND: Chait found brain responses to familiar songs were much faster and stronger than responses to unfamiliar songs - within just one-tenth to one-third of a second. CHAIT: Our results confirm that memory for music has a deep hold over us and is maintained in the brain very robustly. NEIGHMOND: Which may explain, she says, why patients with dementia respond to music. A few weeks after Gustafson and her mom sang Christmas carols together, she visited again. And this time, she and her siblings took their mom to the shopping mall for lunch. GUSTAFSON: We took her to Fashion Island in front of the koi pond. And she loves the koi pond. And she sat there and stayed connected with us verbally. She would sit in front of the pond, and she said, what a beautiful place. What a beautiful day. I mean, vocabulary came back to her after she sang for an hour and a half. NEIGHMOND: And when they got back to the memory care unit. . . GUSTAFSON: And she took my face in her hands, and she said, thank you for a wonderful day and kissed my forehead. NEIGHMOND: After that, the family hired a music therapist to visit once a week and a young singer to come sing with her mom for 45 minutes, seven days a week. Gradually, her mother started to communicate again. Music therapy is increasingly common in assisted living facilities - just not common enough, says Kraus. Music, she says, should be a standard of care for dementia. Patti Neighmond, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"HARK THE HERALD ANGELS SING\")GUSTAFSON: (Singing) Hark the herald angels sing.

(SOUNDBITE OF CHAINSAW RUNNING)IRINA ZHOROV, BYLINE: On Joey Clawson's Christmas tree farm outside Boone, N. C. , four workers, chain saws in hand, pick their way through neat rows of Fraser firs.

JOEY CLAWSON: It's four, five months that I'm out here weekly with a magnifying glass checking bunches of trees in every field. ZHOROV: If Clawson spots an outbreak, he'll spray with insecticide, all in the name of a perfect Christmas tree. CLAWSON: Because it's all about creating family memories. ZHOROV: About 4 million Fraser firs from North Carolina will grace people's homes this Christmas. But in the wild, a bug called the balsam woolly adelgid has been killing trees. Growers like Clawson can control the pests on their farms, but the bug has been spreading for decades in the forest. Biologist Howard Neufeld says the bug arrived during reforestation efforts of logged areas in the early 1900s. HOWARD NEUFELD: They imported trees from Europe, and one of them was silver fir. And the silver fir had this adelgid on it, and no one saw it. ZHOROV: Slowly, the tiny adelgid began to attack native firs. It injects a toxin into the trees that triggers abnormal growth and makes the trees unable to take up water, which eventually kills them. By the '70s and '80s, die-offs spread rapidly. NEUFELD: It's had a devastating effect here. ZHOROV: In some fir forests, the adelgid has killed more than 90% of the trees. On Roan Mountain in Tennessee, Scott Cory, Ph. D. student studying Fraser firs, walks up a road littered with coyote scat, then climbs into the forest. (SOUNDBITE OF LEAVES CRUNCHING)ZHOROV: He points to trees killed by the adelgid. They're barkless and sun-bleached. SCOTT CORY: Actually, there's one - a dead one. There is. There's a dead one. ZHOROV: But on this mountain section, it's just a patch. All around us, healthy firs still stand. CORY: This is classic spruce fir forest - dense, dense number of stems in here, super dark in the understory, everything's mossy. ZHOROV: Is there a difference between these trees that we're looking at and the trees on the farms? CORY: So genetically, they're the same. But as far as what they do, you know, for their ecosystem, totally different. ZHOROV: The Fraser firs here clean the air and water, store carbon from the atmosphere and provide habitat for animals. Some flora and fauna, like a tiny endangered tarantula called the spruce-fir moss spider, live only here. During the last glaciation about 10,000 years ago, Cory says this area was a lot colder, and the firs lived all up and down the mountains. CORY: But as it warmed up, the trees had to move further and further to the top of the mountain. ZHOROV: Today, the firs live on just seven mountain peaks in the southern Appalachians, and Roan Mountain is one of them. Cory has been studying what makes the trees survive, or not, due to environmental conditions. He points to some saplings under the dead trees, possible signs of recovery. He hopes people will be able to see Fraser firs on the mountains, not just in their homes, for years to come. For NPR News, I'm Irina Zhorov. AILSA CHANG, HOST:  In North Carolina, Christmas trees are a nearly $90 million industry. Most of the trees are Fraser firs. They have soft needles which don't shed as much as other evergreens, and they have limbs that are strong enough for ornaments. But it turns out that Fraser firs are having a harder time in the wild. Irina Zhorov takes us to the North Carolina high country. (SOUNDBITE OF CHAINSAW RUNNING) IRINA ZHOROV, BYLINE: On Joey Clawson's Christmas tree farm outside Boone, N. C. , four workers, chain saws in hand, pick their way through neat rows of Fraser firs. Takes just a few seconds to saw down a tree. (SOUNDBITE OF CHAINSAW RUNNING) ZHOROV: Clawson says workers have spent nearly a decade fertilizing each tree by hand, shaping them one by one with giant machetes and looking for pests.

It is the tallest active geyser in the entire world. And this year, it has erupted more times than ever before. This streak of activity has thrilled both casual tourists as well as committed geyser gazers. Scientists have been watching as well to try to figure out what exactly is going on. Here's NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Steamboat has become a geyser superstar, eclipsing even Old Faithful in terms of public attention. Erin White is Yellowstone's Park hydrologist. ERIN WHITE: There are people that camp on the sidewalks, you know, spend all of their days, all of their time off sitting next to Steamboat. GREENFIELDBOYCE: In videos, you can hear people's excitement when all that waiting pays off. (SOUNDBITE OF PEOPLE CHEERING)GREENFIELDBOYCE: White remembers when she got to see Steamboat. Last winter, she was driving past and stopped when she spotted a column of steam. WHITE: And had the very unique experience of being the only person standing next to Steamboat while it was vigorously releasing steam. It is incredibly powerful. It's like standing next to a jet engine. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Steamboat's had a record year - more than 45 eruptions. That beats the record set last year - 32 eruptions. And in the three years before that, there were zero eruptions. This geyser is not dependable like Old Faithful. The frequency of its eruptions is highly variable. Its sometimes goes quiet for a long time. WHITE: In the 1960s, there was another period where there were more than 20 eruptions per year. And then prior to that, you know, there were dormant periods of more than 50 years. GREENFIELDBOYCE: So what changed in 2018 to make this geyser start erupting every seven to 10 days? Scientists wish they knew. White says they've long understood the basic ingredients needed to make a geyser. WHITE: You need to have a source of water. You need a source of heat. And you need structure - a geologic structure that is constrained or confined in some way to develop pressure that will generate an eruption. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That combination is rare. The planet has fewer than a thousand geysers. About half are in Yellowstone, where an ancient volcano's magma heats water in underground cavities. You might think scientists would have detailed maps of what's going on beneath Steamboat, but White says they don't. WHITE: What is the subsurface architecture? What is the volume of water that is available for every eruption? GREENFIELDBOYCE: They do have temperature sensors deployed around the geyser. And there's been recent research using arrays of seismic sensors. Michael Manga is a researcher at the University of California Berkeley. MICHAEL MANGA: People always ask, well, why is Steamboat such a tall geyser? And we can't answer that question. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Not yet, anyway. Recent results show that Steamboat's liquid is stored at depths of about 65 to 130 feet. Manga says the deeper water is stored, the warmer it will be. The heat provides the energy that drives the eruption. MANGA: At other geysers, that storage seems to be more shallow. And our hypothesis is - for the reason why Steamboat is such a huge guys are and so tall is that the water's stored deeper. The deeper the water's stored, the more energy it can have. And the more energy you have, the bigger the eruption can be. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Some of the first studies of geysers were done back in the 1800s. by Robert Bunsen - you know, the same guy who developed the Bunsen burner used in chemistry class. Scientists who put video cameras in geysers and built artificial geysers in the lab. Still, many fundamental questions remain unanswered, like what makes some geysers so predictable? Manga says take one of his favorite geysers in Chile. MANGA: When we were studying it, it erupted thousands of times. And the time between eruptions varied by less than about a second. GREENFIELDBOYCE: When I started asking Manga about the geyser scientific community, he seemed kind of amused. MANGA: It's interesting you say - expression geyser scientific community because it's a community of almost nobody. GREENFIELDBOYCE: In fact, a couple of years ago, when he and a colleague wrote a review of geyser research for a science journal. . . MANGA: We could cite just about every paper ever written about geysers, and there's very few fields where you can do that. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He thinks the mystery is part of the allure of geysers like Steamboat. People like that there are fundamental things about the earth that we still don't understand.

NPR's Scott Neuman tells the story. SCOTT NEUMAN, BYLINE: The year was 1884. After decades of delays, the Washington Monument was almost complete.

SADOWAY: Within two or three years of that moment, the price of aluminum was plummeting. NEUMAN: Aluminum is the most abundant metal on earth. The problem is it bonds tightly to other elements. SADOWAY: The bond is very strong, and it takes enormous energy could break that bond and pull the aluminum metal out of the compound. NEUMAN: It wasn't until 1886 that an efficient way to do that was discovered, and that changed everything for aluminum. In five years, the price fell nearly 90%.

We asked NPR science correspondent Joe Palca what were the three biggest science stories of the year, and here's what he said. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: It's not really fair to say black holes are camera-shy. They're just far away, fairly small by celestial standards and, well, black because they suck in everything, including light. No single telescope on Earth is powerful enough to see a black hole, so to make their image, astronomers created something called the Event Horizon Telescope, a virtual telescope that digitally tied together eight telescopes around the world. Earlier this year, I visited one of those telescopes - the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, high in the Chilean Andes. On the day I was there, the control room was mostly empty. Astronomer Ignacio Toledo says that's normal. IGNACIO TOLEDO: I think that the last time I saw it crowded was for the first of the observations of the Event Horizon telescope. PALCA: The Atacama Array consists of 66 radio dishes. Toledo says radio telescopes don't make pictures so much as take in data, so there's really not much to see in the control room. Still, people packed in the day several years ago when all eight telescopes around the world were pointed at the same massive black hole some 55 million light years away. TOLEDO: We didn't know if we were going to be successful in creating the image of the black hole. But it was amazing to have all these observatories coordinating, getting the data and delivering that to the science team. PALCA: It took years to crunch all the data, but science team leader Sheperd Doeleman was able to announce success at a news conference this past April. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SHEPERD DOELEMAN: We have seen what we thought was unseeable. We have seen and taken a picture of a black hole. PALCA: The picture shows a very dark circle surrounded by a bright ring of light - stunning to an astronomer, a bit like a heavenly doughnut floating in a sea of black coffee to the untrained eye. A new biological tool called CRISPR also made news in 2019. The tool was developed earlier in the decade by some scientists who were essentially studying the rather arcane topic of how bacteria fight off the flu. University of California, Berkeley researcher Jennifer Doudna says the bacteria do that by targeting the DNA of an invading virus and then making a precise cut in it. She and some colleagues realized they might be able to hijack that same mechanism to find and cut any sequence of DNA. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)JENNIFER DOUDNA: I remember really feeling sort of the hairs on the back of my neck, you know, because I thought, wow, if this could work in animal or plant cells, this could be a very, very useful and very powerful tool. PALCA: She and others have shown it could work in animal cells, including human cells. And this year, scientists began testing CRISPR-modified cells in patients suffering from sickle cell disease. Other therapies are in the pipeline. Finally, 2019 may be the year that the reality of climate change began to sink in with people who were once skeptics. Severe storms and historic flooding can be very persuasive. My colleague Nate Rott asked people their feelings about climate change as they watched a rain-swollen river surge under a bridge in Arkansas.

Turns out actual scientific research on beards is patchy. Earlier this year, researchers got to know how beards are perceived by children. And since it's the time of year for big family gatherings, we thought we would revisit this report by NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: For most of human evolution, dudes had beards. NICOLE NELSON: Until very recent history, beards were a very prominent element of men's faces. And so we must have expectations related to those. And it turns out that adults do. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Nicole Nelson studies face perception at the University of Queensland in Australia. She says past work by her colleague Barnaby Dixson has shown that beards make men look older, stronger and more masculine, at least to adults. NELSON: And so we were wondering whether or not all of those expectations emerge in adulthood or if they're there throughout our lives. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Her team tested this in over 400 kids, from toddlers to teenagers. Researchers would show kids two photos side by side; a man with a beard and the same man clean-shaven. NELSON: And then we just ask kids, so which man looks stronger? Which man looks older? Which man looks best? GREENFIELDBOYCE: It turns out that even little kids associated beards with being older and stronger. But when asked which face was best, young kids were strongly anti-beard. NELSON: As early as you know, 1 year, 9 months, they dislike beards. And kids, as they got older, up to about 13 years, continued to dislike beards even more. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Interestingly, around the age of puberty, young people changed. They started to like beards more and judged them more like adults do. And experience seems to count too. Kids whose fathers had beards felt more warmly towards facial hair. The study appears in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior. Nelson says for men, beards offer certain advantages. NELSON: I think it's a good move if you want to kind of boost your manliness, right? - if you want to look a little more dominant, you want to look a little bit older.

NPR science correspondent Joe Palca reports that as with so many things in life, the answer is timing. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Whale biologist David Cade, who recently graduated from Stanford University, says there's no question humpback whales enjoy a tasty meal of anchovies, but they're not always successful at getting one. DAVID CADE: We've noticed that when a humpback whale approaches a fish school, sometimes that whole fish school disperses, and the fish all escape. And sometimes, the whale can catch a lot of those fish. And so we were trying to figure out what's going on. What is the triggering mechanism that makes an anchovy respond to an oncoming threat? PALCA: To answer that question, Cade brought some anchovies into a lab at the Hopkins Marine Station. CADE: So what we did is we had some anchovies in a tank. And we would playback basically an oncoming stimulus. It's basically like an expanding dot, like, coming towards your face. And fish would get scared at a certain point. PALCA: And once scared, the anchovies would head for the hills - or maybe that's not the best metaphor, but you get the point. The thing is, most of the time, humpback whales seem to have a pretty good idea about just when that scary point is. So Cade says when the whales come across a school of anchovies out in the ocean, if they open their mouths and time their last-second lunge at the school just right, they can gobble up a whole mess of anchovies. CADE: So there's a really narrow window in which the humpback whale can successfully time the mouth opening in order to catch the most fish. PALCA: Cade reports his findings in the latest issue of the journal PNAS. This ability to eat anchovies and other prey fish instead of just depending on a steady diet of krill might help explain a puzzle about humpbacks. Ari Friedlander is at the Institute for Marine Science at the University of California, Santa Cruz. ARI FRIEDLANDER: One of the things that we've noticed in the scientific community is that humpback whales are repopulating around the world at really fast rates. And this is, you know, recovery from commercial whaling 100 years ago. PALCA: So if you like the fact that humpbacks are making a comeback, thank an anchovy. Joe Palca, NPR News.

That is according to an announcement today from China's official news agency, Xinhua. NPR health correspondent Rob Stein joins us now with more. Hey, Rob. ROB STEIN, BYLINE: Hey, there. CHANG: Can you just remind us - who is this scientist? And what exactly did he claim he did? STEIN: Yeah, his name is He Jiankui. He's 35, and he was based at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China. You might remember he shocked the world about a year ago when he announced he had created twin girls from embryos whose DNA he had edited in the lab. . . CHANG: Yeah. STEIN: . . . Using the powerful gene-editing technique called CRISPR. He said he did it to try to protect them from getting infected with the AIDS virus. But his claim sparked outrage around the world for a couple reasons. The first one was, no one knows if this sort of thing would be safe for any kids produced this way. And it also raises big concerns about opening the door for so-called designer babies. CHANG: Right. OK. So what exactly happened today? What did the Chinese government do? STEIN: Right. So as you mentioned, China's news agency announced that He and two of his colleagues had been put on trial and had pleaded guilty to a variety of things, including conspiring to forge ethical review documents to deceive authorities about their - what they called illegal medical practices. It also said they had rashly done what they did for personal profit. And He, who's also known as J. K. - he was sentenced to three years in prison and fined the equivalent of about $430,000. And two of his colleagues who work with him also received lesser sentences and smaller fines. And the announcement also revealed for the first time that a third baby who had - scientists had created this way had already been born to another woman. CHANG: So I mean, I remember when He announced what he did, there were a lot of people in the scientific community who were outraged. And a lot of people want to see him face consequences. But was prison what they had in mind? STEIN: Yeah. So, you know, I've been in touch with a number of scientists and bioethicists today in several different countries. And they're all pretty much saying the same thing - that they hoped this would act as a powerful deterrent to anyone else trying this sort of thing again. And one bioethicist who's advising the World Health Organization about how to regulate this technology says the sentence does seem pretty much in line with what would happen in other countries if other scientists. . . CHANG: Really? STEIN: . . . Did the same sort of thing. Yeah. And I also heard from a bioethicist from Stanford who had gotten to know J. K. pretty well and had even warned him against doing what he did. And he said he felt sorry for him and his family. You know, J. K - he's married and has two young children. But he, too, hoped the case would be kind of a wake-up call about the potential dangers of the latest genetic technologies. CHANG: So is anything being done in the larger scientific community to try to prevent this kind of thing from happening again? STEIN: Yeah. So this case - it prompted a huge, a really intense debate that's still underway in the scientific community around the world. And one big issue is that a number of scientists either strongly suspected what He was doing or actually knew what he was doing, and they didn't sound any alarms about it. One researcher at Rice University is still under investigation for possibly - actually being actively involved in this project. And then at the same time, there are commissions that have been formed - two different commissions who were trying to come up with better ways to police this technology and actually come up with ways that scientists could ethically use these powerful new gene-editing techniques because there's widespread agreement that gene editing - it could provide important new ways to treat many diseases. And it's already showing promise for that. And some scientists think it may even someday be ethical to try to create genetically modified babies to prevent terrible genetic diseases. But others - they argue that's unnecessary and would just open up a Pandora's box, so we should never go there. But this debate is far from over. In fact, there's a scientist in Russia who says he wants to create more gene-edited babies to try to do things like prevent deafness. CHANG: Wow. As you say, the debate is far from over.
