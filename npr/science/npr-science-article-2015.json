Not too many frogs lived nearby, but he managed to find them. JIM MCGUIRE: There was a place near the railroad tracks, and there were Pacific tree frogs there.

Mireya Mayor is a primatologist and correspondent for National Geographic. Her job plays out like an adventure movie - diving with great whites, rappelling down cliffs, even being charged by guerrillas. But you'd never guess what Mayor was up to before her life of extreme reporting. MIREYA MAYOR: While I was in college, I was an NFL cheerleader for the Miami Dolphins. And I took this anthropology class really by accident, because I had to take a science requirement. I was on a very different path to becoming a lawyer. And anthropology was available and fit my schedule. And it was during that class that I realized that that's what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I left cheerleading and headed straight to South America. I mean, literally, I cheered at my last football game and then a week later, was on a plane to Guyana. You know, had to give up the pom-poms and trade them for field boots. (Laughter). It was just this beautiful, natural, green abyss of impenetrable forest. Monkeys jumping everywhere and macaws flying overhead, and we would park this canoe at night on the side of the riverbank, climb out and basically machete our way in. And at the time I - not only did I not have a passport, I'd never been camping. About four months into the expedition, I started noticing that my hands were swelling. And then spontaneous wounds started appearing and red streaks started going up my leg. I had a systemic blood infection, and if I didn't get out, I was going to die. So I had to literally hack my way through forests, and I was able to get back to Miami just in time, because I basically had a few more hours to live. But after 10 days of being in the hospital and on IV antibiotics, I spent those 10 days planning my next expedition. So that tells you something. I was in Madagascar studying the larger-bodied lemurs with a colleague of mine. And we decided to set out these small mammal traps to see what else was in the area. So we were doing a biodiversity survey as well. And one rainy morning, I took one of the mammal traps in and I peeked inside of it and these two giant eyes stared back at me with this tiny, little body. I mean, it's basically all eyes. It looked familiar because there were two species of mouse lemurs known at the time. But this was just a very different looking critter. And lo and behold, it was a brand new species to science - world's smallest mouse lemur, weighs less than two ounces, fits in the palm of your hands. I mean, it was complete elation. First of all, when you go into the field of science, you secretly have a dream that you might discover something someday, but you don't really expect to. I was now armed to be able to request a meeting with the prime minister and the president of Madagascar. And this tiny little mouse lemur got me in the door. I was able to bring in maps of the area and point out that it lives in this very remote area, and only there. And we were in urgent need of protecting that forest. And they agreed to have the government of Madagascar be so supportive and declare the area a national park. This tiny little creature became a huge ambassador for all things wild in Madagascar. That's a pretty big break. (Laughter). RATH: Primatologist Mireya Mayor. You don't have to discover new species to have a big break. Send us your story - mybigbreak@NPR. org.

You can't compost it, so it's got to go somewhere, often in violation of the law - that means a dump in the developing world, like the region of Agbogbloshie in the West African nation of Ghana. Not so long ago, Agbogbloshie was a lush mangrove swamp. In the current Atlantic, reporter Yepoka Yeebo describes what Agbogbloshie looks like today. YEPOKA YEEBO: It looks like hell. It's this massive blackened field. And the first thing you notice is this pool of thick black smoke that burns. It's this choking smoke. And I sort of coughed and splattered my way through my first few minutes like right in the middle of the dump. And it's dotted with these little hills of old electronics and scrap bites or piles of CPUs, heaps of car doors, stacks of old televisions, and hundreds of people work there. RATH: And you describe this awful type of smoke that you're walking through there. What's burning? YEEBO: It's mostly the boys, the sort of people who process the scrap, burning huge bundles of copper wire to strip the plastic off. And so they sort of - they get the bundle of copper wire or whatever else they're melting - sometimes they melt down old air-conditioners. They throw on a tire or the old insulation foam from old refrigerators, and they set that alight. So what's really burning is the tire and the fires get big and hot and sometimes they change color. When it's copper they turn green. And it lets off all this smoke. And this melts down whatever's in the bundle. And so you see pools of aluminum. You see pools of like bits of melted plastic. And then they're left with these bundles. It's an incredibly inefficient way to process anything. And it's incredibly dangerous, too. RATH: Tell us more about these trash pickers that you spent time with. You used the word boys. How old are these kids? YEEBO: The boys I hung out with were 13 and 14. Kwesi was the older, slightly more experienced kid who knew everything about the way the scrap business worked in Agbogbloshie. And Inusa was sort of younger and slightly more naive. And during the week, these kids were both, like, regular school kids in spotless uniforms out of school down the road. And they came down to this place on evenings and weekends to just earn little bits of money to help pay their school fees or buy shoes. RATH: Why are kids that young having to pay school fees? YEEBO: Education is supposed to be free, but beyond the basic level, beyond primary school, it's not. And they don't have to pay school fees, they have to pay for lunches. They have to pay for exams. They have to pay for books. All these little sums of money add up. And Kwesi wanted to join the army and Inusa wanted to join the air force. And in Ghana, the armed forces are incredibly prestigious, so there's a lot of competition to get in. And the only way they can get in is to finish school. And without paying their fees, that will never happen. RATH: There's a lot of toxic stuff in electronic waste. And you also mention that the fires from things like plastic and other things - that can't be good. Can you talk about the health risks these kids face? YEEBO: So there's the choking smoke. It's burning tires. It's thick and it's black and it's visible from, like, the main road, which is a good long walk away. There's also the fact that these are just open fires of bundles of metal. So at one point in the story, I talk about sort of this explosion and this burning aerosol can flying through the air and landing on the ground near us. That could quite easily have hit someone. I hung out at the sort of shed where both Kwesi and Inusa sell most of the scrap they pick up. And I watched as this tiny kid basically sliced his toe in half stepping on a piece of glass from what looked like a smashed TV screen. There are hazards all over the place. And there are also environmental campaigners who say that the boys who've been there for a while are starting to die really young. So people tend to have respiratory problems, and they also say that some of the older boys are dying of cancer. RATH: And how does this stuff, the electronic waste from the developed world, end up in this digital graveyard there? YEEBO: A great deal of it is foreign. A great deal of it is stuff that was supposed to be formally recycled that sort of falls into a shady world of recycling companies that export the stuff to the Third World. And there've been a couple of prosecutions in the UK. And so most of it, at least in the past, turned up in shipping containers at the port either disguised as secondhand electronics or hidden behind functional electronics or just sort of illegally shipped in. And it gets trucked into a place like this. And a lot of it is also from the market district where there are sort of auto repair shops and places that sell motors and air conditioners. And when the stuff doesn't sell or it gets too old, it gets dumped back there where people can process it into metal. RATH: Yepoka Yeebo is a reporter and photographer based in West Africa. Her feature about Ghana's urban mine ran in The Atlantic this week. Yepoka, thank you very much. YEEBO: Thank you so much for having me.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Time now for some number crunching from our data expert Mona Chalabi from fivethirtyeight. com. She has given us this number of the week. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: 44. MARTIN: And that is the percentage of Americans that said last month they were likely to make a New Year's resolution for the year 2015. And what do they want? To lose weight, live healthier lives, become better people. Mona Chalabi joins us from our studios in New York to talk more about this. Hey, Mona. MONA CHALABI: Hi, Rachel. Happy New Year. MARTIN: Happy New Year to you. So we know lots of Americans make resolutions for the new year, but do we know how many Americans are successful in keeping them? CHALABI: Yes we do. Our number of the week comes from a survey that asked over a thousand adults if they'd be making a resolution for this year. And it also asked them if they managed to keep the resolutions they made last year. MARTIN: Mhmm. CHALABI: Only 41 percent said they had managed to stick to their resolutions for 2014. MARTIN: Oh. I mean, 41 percent. That's not horrible but it's not so great. CHALABI: No. MARTIN: Do we know anything about how long people are able to keep them? I mean, how long does it take them to break the resolution? CHALABI: Well, there's a professor of psychology who has been researching the way that people make and keep resolutions since the late eighties. Now one study from this professor - his name's John Norcross at the University of Scranton - contacted people who had made a New Year's resolution every couple of weeks by phone to see how they were doing. By mid-January, 29 percent of respondents were no longer following their resolutions. By February, it was 36 percent. And by June, over half had given up. MARTIN: Oh, man. CHALABI: I know. And maybe those numbers are a bit of an underestimate because if I had a researcher calling me every few weeks to see how I was doing, I think I'd make an extra effort with my New Year's resolution. (LAUGHTER)MARTIN: That's true, right. So it sounds like people get off track pretty quickly. Does that mean if you give up on your resolutions for one year, does that make you less likely to make them again the following year? CHALABI: It doesn't look like it. People seem completely undeterred. That survey I mentioned about New Year's resolutions has actually been conducted since 1995. Every year, about two in five people say they failed in their previous resolution and about two in five say they will be making a resolution for the year ahead. Of course, they might not be the same two people but it still seems remarkably consistent. And actually, there's another source of evidence that we don't give up - our Internet search history. MARTIN: What do you mean? CHALABI: So using Google trends, I looked at how people have searched for the words gym and diet over the past ten years. And sure enough, every January 1, people start Googling those words in huge numbers. MARTIN: What? What do you mean? I never do that. I don't know what you're talking about. CHALABI: By February, the number of people looking for diets and gyms trails off. And by December, it's about a third lower. And then you see it pick up all over again the next January. MARTIN: Funny how that works. So a diet and exercise. What other kind of resolutions do people make typically? CHALABI: It's a pretty diverse wish list. So about four percent of interviewed people said they wanted to go back to school in 2015. Another four percent said they wanted to be closer to God. And nine percent said they wanted to be a better person. But again, the most popular New Year's resolutions by far were to lose weight and exercise more. About a quarter of people chose one of those. MARTIN: See, I have to say, planning to be a better person - that one you're asking for failure. I think the key is to make them specific so they're achievable. That's just my two cents. I mean, there is value in just trying, though, right. I mean, at least naming change that you want to see in your life? CHALABI: I'd agree with that. It all depends on what you want from these resolutions, right. So I mean, I've been using the word failure here but a lack of success isn't necessarily failure. I have this friend who each January 1 quits smoking. Even if she's frustrated when she starts up again each February, she always says to me that those four weeks without cigarettes are better than none. So if you want to change your life and change it for good, then my advice would be if at first you don't succeed, don't try and try again each January. Just keep trying whenever you can. MARTIN: Good advice. I like it. OK, so a moment of truth. Do you do this? Do you make resolutions, Mona? CHALABI: Um, yeah. I actually told myself that I'd try to start telling more positive stories with data. And it looks like I failed in a pretty ironic way this year. But I'll try again. I'll try again for the next number of the week, I promise. MARTIN: It only took you, like, seven days to break that resolution. CHALABI: Oh, what can you do? MARTIN: Mona Chalabi of fivethirtyeight. com. Thanks so much, Mona. CHALABI: Thanks, Rachel. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: 52. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: 452. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: 25.

Every year, about two in five people say they failed in their previous resolution and about two in five say they will be making a resolution for the year ahead. Of course, they might not be the same two people but it still seems remarkably consistent. And actually, there's another source of evidence that we don't give up - our Internet search history. MARTIN: What do you mean? CHALABI: So using Google trends, I looked at how people have searched for the words gym and diet over the past ten years. And sure enough, every January 1, people start Googling those words in huge numbers. MARTIN: What? What do you mean? I never do that. I don't know what you're talking about. CHALABI: By February, the number of people looking for diets and gyms trails off. And by December, it's about a third lower. And then you see it pick up all over again the next January. MARTIN: Funny how that works. So a diet and exercise. What other kind of resolutions do people make typically? CHALABI: It's a pretty diverse wish list. So about four percent of interviewed people said they wanted to go back to school in 2015. Another four percent said they wanted to be closer to God. And nine percent said they wanted to be a better person. But again, the most popular New Year's resolutions by far were to lose weight and exercise more. About a quarter of people chose one of those. MARTIN: See, I have to say, planning to be a better person - that one you're asking for failure. I think the key is to make them specific so they're achievable. That's just my two cents. I mean, there is value in just trying, though, right. I mean, at least naming change that you want to see in your life? CHALABI: I'd agree with that. It all depends on what you want from these resolutions, right. So I mean, I've been using the word failure here but a lack of success isn't necessarily failure. I have this friend who each January 1 quits smoking. Even if she's frustrated when she starts up again each February, she always says to me that those four weeks without cigarettes are better than none. So if you want to change your life and change it for good, then my advice would be if at first you don't succeed, don't try and try again each January. Just keep trying whenever you can. MARTIN: Good advice. I like it. OK, so a moment of truth. Do you do this? Do you make resolutions, Mona? CHALABI: Um, yeah. I actually told myself that I'd try to start telling more positive stories with data. And it looks like I failed in a pretty ironic way this year. But I'll try again. I'll try again for the next number of the week, I promise. MARTIN: It only took you, like, seven days to break that resolution. CHALABI: Oh, what can you do? MARTIN: Mona Chalabi of fivethirtyeight. com. Thanks so much, Mona. CHALABI: Thanks, Rachel.", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2015 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Well, that's sort of what happened to Dan Barber. DAN BARBER: It was very fatty. And I got to say, I really loved it. And I told everyone about it. RAZ: Dan's a chef in New York. BARBER: I am the chef and co-owner of Blue Hill and Blue Hill at Stone Barns. RAZ: And that fatty, delicious thing he found was a fish. It happened while he was searching the world for delicious and sustainable foods. He wrote about in his book, \"The Third Plate. \" And that fish had temporarily changed his life, as Dan explained from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BARBER: It was a beautiful fish - flavorful, textured, meaty - a best-seller on the menu. Even better, it was farm-raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability. So you can feel good about selling it. One day, the head of the company called and asked if I'd speak at an event about the farm's sustainability. Absolutely, I said. Here is a company trying to do it right. I wanted to support them. The day before the event, I called the head of PR for the company. Let's call him Don. Don, I said, just to get the facts straight, you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea you don't pollute? That's right, he said. We're so far out, the waste from our fish gets distributed, not concentrated. That feed conversion ratio? 2. 5-to-1, he said - best in the business. 2. 5 what? What are you feeding? Sustainable proteins, he said. Great, I said - got off the phone. And that night, I was lying in bed and I thought, what the hell is a sustainable protein? (LAUGHTER)BARBER: So the next day, just before the event, I called Don. I said, Don, what are some examples of sustainable proteins? He said he didn't know. He would ask around. Well, I got on the phone with the head biologist. Let's call him Don, too. (LAUGHTER)BARBER: Don, I said, what are some examples of sustainable proteins? Well, he mentioned some algae and some fish meals. And then, he said chicken pellets - feathers, skin, bone meal, scraps dried and processed into feed. I said, what percentage of your feed is chicken? Well, it's about 30 percent, he said. I said, Don, what's sustainable about feeding chicken to fish? (LAUGHTER)BARBER: There was a long pause on the line. And he said there's just too much chicken in the world. (LAUGHTER)BARBER: OK. I fell out of love with this fish. (LAUGHTER)BARBER: No, not because I'm some self-righteous, goody-two-shoes foodie. I actually am. (LAUGHTER)BARBER: No, I fell out of love with this fish because, I swear to God, after that conversation, the fish tasted like chicken. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)RAZ: So you must have thought, like, my God, I've been totally deluding myself. BARBER: Right. For a guy whose craft is based on what my tongue is telling me is real about what I'm tasting, that was upsetting. It's like I couldn't taste it. You know, and I'd been duped at my own game. RAZ: So admittedly, that was a big blow for Dan. But it was okay because he kept searching for that delicious, sustainable fish. And one day, he finally found it. BARBER: I tasted something that was so delicious. I was so greedy to get that for my own. RAZ: And it happened at a restaurant. BARBER: Yeah. I was at a - just a kind of random restaurant. RAZ: In Spain. BARBER: Yeah. RAZ: Where Dan ordered a piece of fish. It was a farm-raised fish. And it looked overcooked. BARBER: Pretty bitterly. RAZ: But when he cut into it. . . BARBER: It wasn't dry. RAZ: It wasn't a dry. And the taste - it was amazing. It totally blew him away. BARBER: Well, it was the skin that got me first because I generally take the skin off the fish. But here was the skin that was as crackling as a piece of thin glass. I mean, it was incredible. And the flavor was just so crisp and sweet. It was really sweet and tasted of the sea. So I was wildly impressed right there. And then, by the time I had devoured this little six-ounce piece of fish, I just thought, this is something I've never had before. RAZ: He had to know where it came from. So he decided he'd go look for it. And he went to a fish farm unlike any other he'd ever been to. It's called Veta La Palma, in the southwestern corner of Spain. BARBER: What struck me first was just the enormity of it. It's tens of thousands of acres of what is essentially wetlands that are punctuated by these systematically connected canals. And as far as your eye can see in every direction, it's quite stunning. RAZ: And that's where Dan met Miguel, a biologist. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BARBER: He's an amazing guy - like, three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee. (LAUGHTER)BARBER: OK. There we are, slogging through the wetland, and I'm panting and sweating. I got mud up to my knees. And Miguel is calmly conducting a biology lecture. So I interrupt him. I said, Miguel, what makes your fish taste so good? He pointed at the algae. I know, dude - the algae, the phytoplankton, the relationships. It's amazing. But what are your fish eating? He goes on to tell me it's such a rich system that the fish are eating what they'd be eating in the wild - the plant biomass, the phytoplankton, the zoo plankton. It's what feeds the fish. The system is so healthy it's totally self-renewing. Ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals? At that moment, we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight - thousands and thousands of pink flamingos. That's success, he said. Look at their bellies - pink. They're feasting. Miguel, aren't they feasting on your fish? (LAUGHTER)BARBER: Yes, he said. We lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds. I said, Miguel, isn't a thriving bird population, like, the last thing you want on a fish farm? (LAUGHTER)BARBER: He shook his head. No, he said, this is an ecological network. Flamingos eat the shrimp. The shrimp eat the phytoplankton. So the pinker the belly, the better the system. And then I realized the water that flows through that farm comes in from the Guadalquivir River. It's a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days. And when it works its way through the system, the water is cleaner than when it entered, and not just for those fish but for you and me, as well. Because when that water leaves, it dumps out into the Atlantic. A drop in the ocean, I know. But I'll take it, and so should you. Because this love story is also instructive. You might say it's a recipe for the future of good food. RAZ: Wow. So, I mean, you have found the holy grail for what you, like, what you just said, like, for the future of good food. BARBER: Well, I've had sort of a late-inning revelation around that kind of question. I mean, I tend to - and in the writing of this book, what I set out to do was look at single ingredients and go back and research - well, what's the recipe that made them so delicious? So those were all holy grails in one way or another. I mean, the overriding search was for this incredible cuisine that I could create around these superlative products. But ultimately, I think that was shortsighted. I think the holy grail is to think about systems thinking. And have yet to find a delicious piece of fish, steak, carrot - that, if I discover that, I invariably discover great ecological decisions that are behind them. In other words, a great-tasting carrot doesn't come from denuded soils or bad landscapes or from a bad seed or from a thoughtless farmer. The continuity between great-tasting food and the responsible way with which we use our land is pretty absolute. RAZ: Is being on the search - is that an inherent part of who you are? BARBER: I'm pretty curious, I guess, for sure. But, I mean, there's a kind of part of human nature, I think, that evolved with a forced curiosity about food, in part because it could kill us. Or it could make us exceedingly healthy and therefore stronger and therefore have more children and what not. That's kind of a basic, sort of evolutionary look at a very complicated question. And we've forgotten it because we have been so removed from the nuts and bolts of farming and agriculture that we forget that one of the basic human needs isn't just food, it's a story and a connectedness to where the food is coming from.

I'm Guy Raz. So one night in 1968 Seth Shostak was searching for stars. SETH SHOSTAK: At a radio observatory behind the Sierra Nevada mountains in California, here in California. RAZ: Seth was gathering data for his Ph. D. in astrophysics. SHOSTAK: In those days, the radio observatory - the staff - went home at 5 o'clock and so I was here at 3 in the morning. And it's dark outside and you can hear the coyotes and, you know, it's a very tedious thing, you're just mostly sitting there occasionally punching a button. RAZ: And that night, he happened to be reading a book by a Russian astronomer named Iosif Shklovsky who had a theory for interstellar communication. SHOSTAK: And it kind of dawned on me that the very instruments that I was using for my research work, which was to study galaxies in fact, could also be used to pick up signals from extraterrestrial beings. RAZ: So that became his goal, not just to search for galaxies, but to find life among them. And almost 30 years later - this is in 1997 - that search was about to come to an end. Seth was eating dinner with his family at home when the phone rang, and on the line was his boss. SHOSTAK: And he said Seth, I think you ought to come over to the institute because we've got a signal going on and it looks pretty good. RAZ: The institute is a place called SETI, it stands for search for extraterrestrial intelligence. It's based in Mountain View, California. And the researchers there monitor signals from outer space, hoping that one of them might be a message. And the way they describe the process is like when you're driving late at night, far away from a city and you're trying to find something on the radio. And most of the time, you're just tuning through static. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO STATIC)RAZ: But suddenly. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"STAR LIGHT, STAR BRIGHT\")PETE SEEGER: (Singing) Star light, star bright. First star I see tonight. RAZ: . . . A signal pops through and you know something is out there. And that's what happened at SETI that night in 1997. SHOSTAK: So I came here and I found, you know, half a dozen of the employees here seated around computer monitors all watching this signal that looked like the real deal. RAZ: It seemed more promising than anything they'd ever heard - the possibility of alien life reaching out across the cosmos. And all night the signals kept coming in. SHOSTAK: You know, this went on and on, and it still looked good. We'd do various tests and it still looked good, and we did more tests and it was still looking good. RAZ: Your adrenaline must've been racing. SHOSTAK: What I did feel was very nervous because I thought, you know, this is going to wreck up my whole week. I've got dinners planned and, you know, meetings and so forth, and now suddenly we found E. T. RAZ: You guys were like, about to change history. What happened? SHOSTAK: Well, we found out that it was interference. Actually, we had tracked it down. It was due to a satellite around the earth that happened to be - its signal was bouncing around the steelwork of our antennae in just the right way. RAZ: You must've been so disappointed. SHOSTAK: Well, of course. When it turned out that it was only interference, then this other feeling came over me - that darn it, you know, too bad, just too bad. But we'll keep going. RAZ: What's it like to search for something that you might never find that might not even exist? Today on the show, \"In Search Of. \" Looking for that elusive thing, from aliens, to love, to mythical sea monsters. And ideas about why the search is almost always more important than what you find. So why the search? Here's Seth Shostak's explanation from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SHOSTAK: Now, a lot of people think that this is kind of idealistic, ridiculous, maybe even hopeless. But I just want to talk to you a little bit about why I think that the job I have is actually a privilege, OK, and give you a little bit of the motivation for my getting into this line of work, if that's what you call it. Now, we still haven't heard anything. In fact, we don't know about any life beyond Earth, but, I'm going to suggest you that that's going to change rather soon. And the part of the reason, in fact, the majority of the reason, why I think that's going to change is that the equipment's getting better. So this means that over the course of the next two dozen years, we'll be able to look at a million star systems. A million star systems looking for signals that would prove somebody's out there. Recent results suggest that virtually every star has planets, and more than one. They're like, you know, kittens. You know, you get a litter. You don't get one kitten, you get a bunch. OK. That's a lot of real estate, but of course, most of these planets are going to be kind of worthless, like, you know, Mercury or Neptune. Neptune's probably not very big in your life. OK. So the question is what fraction of these planets are actually suitable for life? The smart money is suggesting that the fraction of planets that might be suitable for life is maybe 1 in 1,000, 1 in 100, something like that. Well, even taking the pessimistic estimate that it's 1 in 1,000, that means that there are at least a billion cousins of the earth just in our own galaxy. RAZ: Statistically, it's actually probably impossible that we are alone, right? Just if you just think about the number of planets in our own galaxy, like, at least a hundred-billion or more. SHOSTAK: That's correct. That's an argument based on large numbers, of course. And you can't say 100 percent that it's impossible. It's not impossible. It's just highly improbable because that would make us very, very special. That would make what's happened here on the earth a miracle. And you know, a lot of people like to believe in miracles, but if, you know, you look at the history of humanity or certainly the history of astronomy - you know, Aristotle thought the earth was the center of everything - every time we thought we were special, we were wrong. I think that it's a lot safer bet to assume that we're not a miracle than that we are. RAZ: Yeah. How convinced are you that we're going to know in the next few decades? SHOSTAK: Well, I bet people cups of coffee on that. So Guy, if you want a cup of coffee. . . RAZ: Yeah. SHOSTAK: . . . (Laughter). Within a couple of decades I think we will find life in space. And I think unless life is very rare or very hard to detect, we will succeed relatively soon. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SHOSTAK: Now, let me tell you about some aspect of this that people don't think about, and that is - what happens? Suppose, you know, that what I say is true. I mean, who knows, but suppose it happens? Suppose some time in the next few dozen years we pick up a faint line that tells us we have some cosmic company. What is the effect? What's the consequence? And the answer absolutely is we don't know the answer. We don't know what that's going to do, not in the long term, and not even very much in the short term. I mean, that would be a bit like asking Chris Columbus in 1491, hey Chris, you know, what happens if it turns out that there's a continent between here and Japan where you're sailing to? What will be the consequences for humanity if that turns out to be the case? I mean, Chris would probably offer you some answer that you might not have understood, but it probably wouldn't have been right. And I think that to predict what finding E. T. is going to mean, we can't predict that either. But here are a couple things that I can say. To begin with, it's going to be a society that's way in advance of our own. You're not going to hear from alien Neanderthals, they're not building transmitters. They're going to be ahead of us. Maybe by a few thousand years, maybe by a few million years. But substantially ahead of us. And that means, if you can understand anything that they're going to say, then you might be able to short-circuit history by getting information from a society that's way beyond our own. Now, you might find that a bit hyperbolic. And maybe it is, but nonetheless it's conceivable that this will happen. And, you know, you could consider this, like, I don't know giving Julius Caesar English lessons and the key to the Library of Congress. It would change his day. RAZ: What is it about you that pushes you to keep looking? Like, to keep searching for something that most people would never devote their lives to? SHOSTAK: Well, first off, it's very interesting. It's curiosity. A lot of it is curiosity. People who are not scientists don't always understand why scientists will beaver away on some fairly arcane question for an entire career, not appreciating that they're doing it simply because they're curious, they want to be the first to know something about nature. This a little bit unlike many jobs in the sense that you're dealing with a very big-picture question. There's no guarantee you're going to succeed, but if you do, it's really interesting and potentially very important. RAZ: I mean, is the search just as important as the goal? SHOSTAK: In some sense I think that it is. I think just doing the search is important. I tend to liken this to the existence of Terra Australis, the continent that was hypothesized to exist at the bottom of the globe, what we call Antarctica now. Because for a long time, up until the 1800s, nobody really had seen the place. They just thought, well, it's kind of reasonable there might be something there, but then again maybe not. And you could just drink a whole lot of beer and talk about in the bars till early in the morning, and that would never answer the question. To answer that question you have to do the experiment. Somebody has to build some ships, fund them, send them down there and take a look. And that's sort of where we are with SETI. You know, you can argue they're likely to be there, they're not likely to be there. But in the end, doing the experiment is the important thing. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SHOSTAK: SETI, I think, is important because it's exploration. And it's not only exploration, it's comprehensible exploration. Now, I got to tell you, you know, I'm always reading books about explorers. I find exploration very interesting. Arctic exploration, you know, people like Magellan, Amundsen, Shackleton, you see Franklin down there, Scott - all these guys. It's really nifty, exploration. And they're just doing it because they want to explore. And you might say, oh, that's kind of a frivolous opportunity. But that's not frivolous, it's not a frivolous activity because I mean, think of ants. You know, most ants are programmed to follow one another along in a long line. But there are a couple of ants, maybe 1 percent of those ants, that are what they call pioneer ants. And they're the ones that wander off, they're the ones you find on the kitchen countertop - you've got to get them with your thumb before they find the sugar or something. OK. But those ants - even though most of them get wiped out - those ants are the ones that are essential to the survival of the hive. So exploration is important. RAZ: What if you never find that thing that you're searching for? SHOSTAK: Well, that's sort of an interesting question because the fact that you didn't find it, does that mean anything? Is that significant in some sense? And the answer to that is probably it's not. Because you can never prove that they're not out there. I mean, who hasn't stood outside at night, looked up at the stars and wondered, you know, do you think there's anybody up there that's looking up back this way? I'm sure cavemen would've asked that question. I don't think that's a new question. I think we're kind of hardwired to be interested in other creatures that are at least as clever as we are because aliens, they represent the tribe on the other side of the hill. RAZ: Seth Shostak is an astronomer at SETI. He's also the author of \"Confessions Of An Alien Hunter. \" Watch his full talk at ted. npr. org. Just promise me one thing. SHOSTAK: OK. RAZ: If they do land on Earth, can you please promise me you will at least take them to In-N-Out Burger? SHOSTAK: (Laughter). There's one right nearby. RAZ: Coming up on the show, writer and comedian John Hodgman is here. JOHN HODGMAN: Yes, I have not been taken away by aliens. That would be a fun ending to this radio appearance. RAZ: Don Hodgman's own story of searching for life from another world, that's coming up later. And while you're waiting, if you don't subscribe to our podcast, it's really easy. Go to iTunes, search for TED Radio Hour and click subscribe. I'm Guy Raz and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. So one night in 1968 Seth Shostak was searching for stars. SETH SHOSTAK: At a radio observatory behind the Sierra Nevada mountains in California, here in California. RAZ: Seth was gathering data for his Ph. D. in astrophysics. SHOSTAK: In those days, the radio observatory - the staff - went home at 5 o'clock and so I was here at 3 in the morning. And it's dark outside and you can hear the coyotes and, you know, it's a very tedious thing, you're just mostly sitting there occasionally punching a button. RAZ: And that night, he happened to be reading a book by a Russian astronomer named Iosif Shklovsky who had a theory for interstellar communication. SHOSTAK: And it kind of dawned on me that the very instruments that I was using for my research work, which was to study galaxies in fact, could also be used to pick up signals from extraterrestrial beings. RAZ: So that became his goal, not just to search for galaxies, but to find life among them. And almost 30 years later - this is in 1997 - that search was about to come to an end. Seth was eating dinner with his family at home when the phone rang, and on the line was his boss. SHOSTAK: And he said Seth, I think you ought to come over to the institute because we've got a signal going on and it looks pretty good. RAZ: The institute is a place called SETI, it stands for search for extraterrestrial intelligence. It's based in Mountain View, California. And the researchers there monitor signals from outer space, hoping that one of them might be a message. And the way they describe the process is like when you're driving late at night, far away from a city and you're trying to find something on the radio. And most of the time, you're just tuning through static. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO STATIC) RAZ: But suddenly. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"STAR LIGHT, STAR BRIGHT\") PETE SEEGER: (Singing) Star light, star bright. First star I see tonight. RAZ: . . . A signal pops through and you know something is out there. And that's what happened at SETI that night in 1997. SHOSTAK: So I came here and I found, you know, half a dozen of the employees here seated around computer monitors all watching this signal that looked like the real deal. RAZ: It seemed more promising than anything they'd ever heard - the possibility of alien life reaching out across the cosmos. And all night the signals kept coming in. SHOSTAK: You know, this went on and on, and it still looked good. We'd do various tests and it still looked good, and we did more tests and it was still looking good. RAZ: Your adrenaline must've been racing. SHOSTAK: What I did feel was very nervous because I thought, you know, this is going to wreck up my whole week. I've got dinners planned and, you know, meetings and so forth, and now suddenly we found E. T. RAZ: You guys were like, about to change history. What happened? SHOSTAK: Well, we found out that it was interference. Actually, we had tracked it down. It was due to a satellite around the earth that happened to be - its signal was bouncing around the steelwork of our antennae in just the right way. RAZ: You must've been so disappointed. SHOSTAK: Well, of course. When it turned out that it was only interference, then this other feeling came over me - that darn it, you know, too bad, just too bad. But we'll keep going. RAZ: What's it like to search for something that you might never find that might not even exist? Today on the show, \"In Search Of. \" Looking for that elusive thing, from aliens, to love, to mythical sea monsters. And ideas about why the search is almost always more important than what you find. So why the search? Here's Seth Shostak's explanation from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SHOSTAK: Now, a lot of people think that this is kind of idealistic, ridiculous, maybe even hopeless. But I just want to talk to you a little bit about why I think that the job I have is actually a privilege, OK, and give you a little bit of the motivation for my getting into this line of work, if that's what you call it. Now, we still haven't heard anything. In fact, we don't know about any life beyond Earth, but, I'm going to suggest you that that's going to change rather soon. And the part of the reason, in fact, the majority of the reason, why I think that's going to change is that the equipment's getting better. So this means that over the course of the next two dozen years, we'll be able to look at a million star systems. A million star systems looking for signals that would prove somebody's out there. Recent results suggest that virtually every star has planets, and more than one. They're like, you know, kittens. You know, you get a litter. You don't get one kitten, you get a bunch. OK. That's a lot of real estate, but of course, most of these planets are going to be kind of worthless, like, you know, Mercury or Neptune. Neptune's probably not very big in your life. OK. So the question is what fraction of these planets are actually suitable for life? The smart money is suggesting that the fraction of planets that might be suitable for life is maybe 1 in 1,000, 1 in 100, something like that. Well, even taking the pessimistic estimate that it's 1 in 1,000, that means that there are at least a billion cousins of the earth just in our own galaxy. RAZ: Statistically, it's actually probably impossible that we are alone, right? Just if you just think about the number of planets in our own galaxy, like, at least a hundred-billion or more. SHOSTAK: That's correct. That's an argument based on large numbers, of course. And you can't say 100 percent that it's impossible. It's not impossible. It's just highly improbable because that would make us very, very special. That would make what's happened here on the earth a miracle. And you know, a lot of people like to believe in miracles, but if, you know, you look at the history of humanity or certainly the history of astronomy - you know, Aristotle thought the earth was the center of everything - every time we thought we were special, we were wrong. I think that it's a lot safer bet to assume that we're not a miracle than that we are. RAZ: Yeah. How convinced are you that we're going to know in the next few decades? SHOSTAK: Well, I bet people cups of coffee on that. So Guy, if you want a cup of coffee. . . RAZ: Yeah. SHOSTAK: . . . (Laughter). Within a couple of decades I think we will find life in space. And I think unless life is very rare or very hard to detect, we will succeed relatively soon. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SHOSTAK: Now, let me tell you about some aspect of this that people don't think about, and that is - what happens? Suppose, you know, that what I say is true. I mean, who knows, but suppose it happens? Suppose some time in the next few dozen years we pick up a faint line that tells us we have some cosmic company. What is the effect? What's the consequence? And the answer absolutely is we don't know the answer. We don't know what that's going to do, not in the long term, and not even very much in the short term. I mean, that would be a bit like asking Chris Columbus in 1491, hey Chris, you know, what happens if it turns out that there's a continent between here and Japan where you're sailing to? What will be the consequences for humanity if that turns out to be the case? I mean, Chris would probably offer you some answer that you might not have understood, but it probably wouldn't have been right. And I think that to predict what finding E. T. is going to mean, we can't predict that either. But here are a couple things that I can say. To begin with, it's going to be a society that's way in advance of our own. You're not going to hear from alien Neanderthals, they're not building transmitters. They're going to be ahead of us. Maybe by a few thousand years, maybe by a few million years. But substantially ahead of us. And that means, if you can understand anything that they're going to say, then you might be able to short-circuit history by getting information from a society that's way beyond our own. Now, you might find that a bit hyperbolic. And maybe it is, but nonetheless it's conceivable that this will happen. And, you know, you could consider this, like, I don't know giving Julius Caesar English lessons and the key to the Library of Congress. It would change his day. RAZ: What is it about you that pushes you to keep looking? Like, to keep searching for something that most people would never devote their lives to? SHOSTAK: Well, first off, it's very interesting. It's curiosity. A lot of it is curiosity. People who are not scientists don't always understand why scientists will beaver away on some fairly arcane question for an entire career, not appreciating that they're doing it simply because they're curious, they want to be the first to know something about nature. This a little bit unlike many jobs in the sense that you're dealing with a very big-picture question. There's no guarantee you're going to succeed, but if you do, it's really interesting and potentially very important. RAZ: I mean, is the search just as important as the goal? SHOSTAK: In some sense I think that it is. I think just doing the search is important. I tend to liken this to the existence of Terra Australis, the continent that was hypothesized to exist at the bottom of the globe, what we call Antarctica now. Because for a long time, up until the 1800s, nobody really had seen the place. They just thought, well, it's kind of reasonable there might be something there, but then again maybe not. And you could just drink a whole lot of beer and talk about in the bars till early in the morning, and that would never answer the question. To answer that question you have to do the experiment. Somebody has to build some ships, fund them, send them down there and take a look. And that's sort of where we are with SETI. You know, you can argue they're likely to be there, they're not likely to be there. But in the end, doing the experiment is the important thing. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SHOSTAK: SETI, I think, is important because it's exploration. And it's not only exploration, it's comprehensible exploration.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today - in search of ideas about looking for that elusive thing, and Edith Widder does most of her searching underwater. EDITH WIDDER: Often in the dark, and always wondering, you know, how many animals are there out there just beyond the reach of my vision, or my lights, that I can't see, but they can see me? RAZ: Edith is a marine biologist. She's made a career out of searching for rare, deep-sea creatures, and the most elusive - the giant squid. WIDDER: Giant squid aren't aren't rare. Based on the number of beaks that have been found in the stomachs of sperm whales, it's thought that there are actually millions of them in the ocean, and yet, we haven't seen them. RAZ: Millions of them. WIDDER: Yep. RAZ: Wow. But up until a few years ago, no one had ever filmed one alive until Edith Widder found a way to do it. She tells the story on the TED stage. (APPLAUSE)(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WIDDER: The Kraken - a beast so terrifying it was said to devour men and ships and whales and so enormous it could be mistaken for an island. In assessing the merits of such tales, it's probably wise to keep in mind that all sailors saw that the only difference between a fairytale and a sea story is a fairytale begins upon a time and a sea story begins this ain't no [bleep]. (LAUGHTER)WIDDER: Every fish that gets away grows with every telling of the tale. Nevertheless, there are giants in the ocean and we now have video proof, as those of you that saw the Discovery Channel documentary are no doubt aware. I was one of the three scientists on this expedition that took place last summer off Japan. RAZ: And that expedition, by the way, wasn't the first attempt to film the giant squid. There were dozens of attempts before, but the problem had always been the technology. And before Edith came along, most of the technology used in deep dives was noisy, with bright lights. WIDDER: That are going to scare any sensible animal away. RAZ: So for that giant squid hunt, Edith designed a special machine that fixed both of those problems. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WIDDER: No thrusters, no motors, just a battery-powered camera and the only illumination coming from red light that's invisible to most deep-sea animals that are adapted to see primarily blue. That's visible to our eye up, but it's the equivalent of infrared in the deep-sea. So this camera platform, which we called the Medusa, could just be thrown off the back of the ship, attached to a float at the surface with over 2,000 feet of line. It would just float around passively carried by the currents and the only light visible to the animals in the deep would be the blue light of the optical lure. RAZ: Edith and the other two scientists headed to the waters just southeast of Japan with a documentary crew from the Discovery Channel. And they were hoping that this new approach would work. Did you have any doubts that you would find it, that you would get this footage? WIDDER: I had a lot of doubts that we'd get a giant squid. I thought I'd probably get some pretty interesting footage, but you just don't know what you're going to find when you're out in the ocean and it's a very, very big ocean. When we first got to the Ogasawara Islands off mainland Japan, my first dive was devastating to me because there was nothing in that water column, and I thought, oh, this is a disaster. (SOUNDBITE OF EXHIBITION)WIDDER: That looked like luminescence maybe. I saw a flash. RAZ: This is audio from that exhibition. WIDDER: And then on the second deployment of my camera system. . . (SOUNDBITE OF EXHIBITION)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Oh, my god. Oh, OK, so this is. . . WIDDER: Oh, my god. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Oh. WIDDER: We got the first imagery of a giant squid coming in on camera and stroking the optical lure. (LAUGHTER)(SOUNDBITE OF EXHIBITION)(SOUNDBITE OF EXHIBITION)WIDDER: All right. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Oh, man. WIDDER: And everybody just went crazy. (SOUNDBITE OF EXHIBITION)WIDDER: It's coming in again. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Laughter). WIDDER: Oh, that is so cool. WIDDER: It was just the most thrilling moment, I think, of most of our careers to actually see that footage. And what a gorgeous, gorgeous creature it turned out to be. It was bronze and silver and it would change back and forth and it had this absolutely fantastic eye that was looking right at us. It was just amazing. RAZ: That was the first time anybody had seen this giant squid alive in the ocean. WIDDER: Yeah, and it was actually kind of cool that there were television cameras rolling all the time, and so they caught that moment, you know, the thrilling moment why many of us become scientists. It's just that moment of discovery. I still get goosebumps every time I see it. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WIDDER: It was absolutely breathtaking. And had this animal had its feeding tentacles intact and fully extended it would have been as tall as a two-story house. How could something that big live in our ocean and yet remain un-filmed until now? We've only explored about 5 percent of our ocean. There are great discoveries yet to be made down there - fantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution and possibly bioactive compounds that could benefit us in ways that we can't even yet imagine. RAZ: Do you think that, like, the search or, like, the chase is the thing that, like, that keeps you at it? I mean, why do you explore? WIDDER: Exploring is an innate part of being human. We're all explorers when we're born. Unfortunately, it seems to get drummed out of many of us as we get older, but it's there, I think, in all of us. And for me that moment of discovery is just so thrilling, on any level, that I think anybody that's experienced it is pretty quickly addicted to it. RAZ: Is there something that you have a hunch about that might be down there that we don't know for sure that you're looking for? WIDDER: No, the one thing I've learned (laughter) exploring the deep is you just can't even begin to imagine some of the bizarre creatures that are down there. I don't have any hunches at all except that we're going to be amazed. RAZ: Marine biologist and deep-sea explorer Edith Widder.

A. Mills was undercover in China, looking into treatment of bears. J. A. MILLS: I mainly pretended that I was a student of traditional Chinese medicine to try to figure out not only what was being traded but why it was being traded. RATH: Around then, rumors of a tiger farm surfaced, and Mills was sent to investigate. She uncovered China's first tiger farm, complete with a paper ledger filled with orders for tiger bone, used for traditional remedies and luxury wine. Today, there are many more tiger farms in China. J. A. Mills tells the story in her new book \"Blood Of The Tiger. \" She says that while China banned the trade of tiger bone in 1993, today, demand for tiger parts still thrives. And there are 6,000 tigers on farms in the country. MILLS: The problem with tiger farming is that it stimulates demand for tiger products, which in turn stimulates poaching of wild tigers because tiger products from wild tigers are considered superior, more prestigious and exponentially more valuable. Some people are even buying tiger products as an investment, much as they would, say, rare art or antique jewelry. And if even a tiny fraction of China's 1. 4 billion people seek wild tiger products, we could lose the last 3,000 wild tigers before we know it. RATH: You write in the book - and it sounds confusing on the face of it - that - something that I wasn't aware of - that traditional Chinese medicine - a lot of the authorities have actually kind of sworn off using tiger products, but there's still this trade. What's going on? What's driving it now? MILLS: This is a very important point. A tiger farm is basically a feed lot for tigers where they're bred like cattle for their parts to make luxury goods such as tiger bone wine and tiger skin rugs. This is about wealth, not health. Traditional Chinese medicine no longer uses or wants to use tiger bone. And polls repeatedly show that most Chinese people don't want tiger products or tiger farming. This is about a handful of investors poised to launch a multibillion-dollar-a-year luxury goods market. This is about products looking for a market rather than a market looking for products. RATH: I'm trying to understand also how you farm an animal that's not domesticated. How are these tigers kept? MILLS: Well, that's one of the things that really disturbs people who have seen wild tigers or know wild tigers well. Tigers in the wild are solitary, of course, except when they have - when they're mothers with cubs. These tigers are basically kept in cages. They are speed-bred. Cubs are taken from their mothers almost right after birth so the mothers can breed again. And the males run around in packs. It's something you would never ever see in the wild. RATH: And of the trade in tiger parts right now, do we have of an idea of how much of that is farmed tigers versus ones that are poached from the wild? MILLS: No. It's very difficult to get a handle on it. And part of the reason it is so difficult is that China's State Forestry Administration, which is in charge of the farms, is very opaque at what is going on. In fact, there has been a gradual reopening of trade despite the ban. And everyone from the United Nations to World Wildlife Fund to me personally have been trying to figure out, you know, what exactly is going on and what it means. And we just don't know. And without a DNA database, there's just no way we can tell what's from a farm and what's from the wild. RATH: Your book and your work - it doesn't just cover what's happened with wild tigers. You talk about elephants and rhinos. And I just want to ask you because I have the opportunity here - you've been working on this for decades - do you feel confident that in 100 years, there will be wild tigers and wild elephants? MILLS: Well, I will say that the same forces are driving the slaughter of elephants for their ivory and rhinos for their horn. It all involves organized criminals supplying investors hoping to profit from extinction. Unfortunately, what's happened in the United Nations in the context of the treaty that governs trade - international trade and endangered species - is that everyone's gone silent. So my main worry is that everyone will remain silent and things will continue as they are unless we address this phenomenon that's stimulating demand, primarily within China. We may lose these animals. And so the only thing we can do is to speak out, and that's why I wrote this book. RATH: That's author and wildlife investigator J. A. Mills. Her book is called \"Blood Of The Tiger,\" and it's out right now. Thank you so much. MILLS: Thank you, Arun. ARUN RATH, HOST:  In 1991, a World Wildlife Fund investigator named J. A. Mills was undercover in China, looking into treatment of bears. J. A. MILLS: I mainly pretended that I was a student of traditional Chinese medicine to try to figure out not only what was being traded but why it was being traded. RATH: Around then, rumors of a tiger farm surfaced, and Mills was sent to investigate. She uncovered China's first tiger farm, complete with a paper ledger filled with orders for tiger bone, used for traditional remedies and luxury wine. Today, there are many more tiger farms in China. J. A. Mills tells the story in her new book \"Blood Of The Tiger. \" She says that while China banned the trade of tiger bone in 1993, today, demand for tiger parts still thrives. And there are 6,000 tigers on farms in the country. MILLS: The problem with tiger farming is that it stimulates demand for tiger products, which in turn stimulates poaching of wild tigers because tiger products from wild tigers are considered superior, more prestigious and exponentially more valuable. Some people are even buying tiger products as an investment, much as they would, say, rare art or antique jewelry. And if even a tiny fraction of China's 1. 4 billion people seek wild tiger products, we could lose the last 3,000 wild tigers before we know it. RATH: You write in the book - and it sounds confusing on the face of it - that - something that I wasn't aware of - that traditional Chinese medicine - a lot of the authorities have actually kind of sworn off using tiger products, but there's still this trade. What's going on? What's driving it now? MILLS: This is a very important point. A tiger farm is basically a feed lot for tigers where they're bred like cattle for their parts to make luxury goods such as tiger bone wine and tiger skin rugs. This is about wealth, not health. Traditional Chinese medicine no longer uses or wants to use tiger bone. And polls repeatedly show that most Chinese people don't want tiger products or tiger farming. This is about a handful of investors poised to launch a multibillion-dollar-a-year luxury goods market. This is about products looking for a market rather than a market looking for products. RATH: I'm trying to understand also how you farm an animal that's not domesticated. How are these tigers kept?

They're flower pollinators, and they devour nuisance insects. But millions of bats have been killed by a disease called white-nose syndrome. But as North Country Public Radio's Brian Mann reports, some bats are bouncing back. BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: When I first visited Aeolus Cave in Vermont's Green Mountains six years ago, the floor was carpeted with tiny bodies and delicate bones. Scientists like Scott Darling with Vermont's Fish and Wildlife Service were shaken by the carnage. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SCOTT DARLING: This is just far more than I expected. It's way more - so many more dead bats here. MANN: That was 2009. Scientists say a quarter-million animals died here, many of their tiny faces crusted with the white fungus that gives this disease its name. So on my latest trip to the cave, the first bit of good news is that bats are still living here. The population is much smaller. But as I crawled through the gap of mud and rock into darkness, my headlamp falls again and again on living bats, clinging to the roof. JONATHAN REICHARD: It's a little bit of a curveball to be here today, you know, six years after being here and seeing all the dead bats, to think that there are still bats in there. MANN: Jonathan Reichard is national assistant coordinator for white-nose syndrome for the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Like a lot of scientists, he feared that this disease might exterminate the animals entirely, sweeping them from large parts of North America. On this night, Reichard is part of the team catching bats, inspecting them. Listen closely, and you can hear the flutter of their wings, their tiny squeaks. To guys like Reichard, that's the sound of hope, especially for a type of bat known as the little brown. REICHARD: The declines in that species have slowed down or even reversed in some cases. There's evidence that colonies may even be increasing at a slight tick. MANN: There's other good news. While researchers study the tough little holdouts here in Vermont, a wildlife veterinarian at the University of Wisconsin has been cracking the code on how exactly white-nose syndrome kills these animals. The study's lead author, Michelle Verant, says the fungus causes bats' bodies to overheat, burning energy too quickly. MICHELLE VERANT: The amount of fat energy that bats affected with white-nose syndrome used was twice as much as the healthy bat. MANN: Verant says hibernating bats begin to starve. Some flee into the deadly cold, searching for more food. Verant thinks her work, funded by the U. S. Geological Survey, could help point the way toward helping more bats, like the ones in Aeolus Cave, survive. Scientists are scrambling to develop targeted fungicides that might kill white-nose outright. In the meantime, Verant says wildlife managers need to make sure bats are healthy and plump before they go into the caves for the winter. VERANT: The best thing that we can do right now is supporting bats with good habitat and reducing those additional stressors. MANN: As this disease spreads west, Verant's findings will play big part in the debate over the federal government's response. The U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service is now deciding whether one type of bat, called the northern long-eared, should be added to the endangered species list. That would mean more protections for the forests and caves that bats rely on when building their stores of fat. Last month, Canada's government did just that, adding three types of bats to their list of endangered animals. For NPR News, I'm Brian Mann.

NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports that researchers recently did an unusual study to see how the birds tackle this high-altitude challenge. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: There's one report of these geese flying over Mount Everest. That's unconfirmed, but these birds do fly high. CHARLES BISHOP: You know, they're traveling through some of the most difficult terrain on Earth in temperatures of minus 20 or minus 30 through 500 kilometers of steep, beautiful, but ice- and snow-covered mountains. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Charles Bishop studies bird flight at Bangor University in the United Kingdom. He wanted to know how the geese do it. BISHOP: My interest is kind of understanding how animals actually work; how much energy does it take to fly; how high do they go; how difficult are their journeys? GREENFIELDBOYCE: To find out, a team headed to Mongolia. They captured geese on a lake and did a little bit of avian surgery. They implanted tubes filled with sensors to record the birds' altitude, how quickly they beat their wings and their heart rates. The next year, after the migration, the researchers managed to recapture some of the birds and get the data. Bishop says they had thought the geese might climb to a high altitude and then stay up there, like an airplane. BISHOP: We know that they've been spotted occasionally at very high altitudes over 7,000 meters by climbers. GREENFIELDBOYCE: To their surprise, the geese actually flew up and down, up and down, like a roller coaster. BISHOP: They climb, get over an obstacle, and they go back down again. And they just seem to be tracking the terrain. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Bishop and his colleagues figured out that flying high up in thin air is really hard. The geese have to flap their wings a little faster. This makes their heart rates go way up. So they drop back down as soon as they can. Doug Altshuler is a flight researcher at the University of British Columbia. DOUG ALTSHULER: What's so amazing about this is that they're actually able, by doing this, to transverse, you know, one of the hardest migration passages of any bird and yet do so within a physiological zone that's comfortable for them.

JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Good morning, everyone. Looks like another no-hassle day on the ant highways. Traffic is moving smoothly on Jungle Route 17 near the split. Ants are traveling at speed coming in on 95 through the savanna, heavy volume but no slowdowns on Parkside Drive near the picnic basket. Now, you may have noticed something a little surprising about this traffic report - no traffic jams. Physicist Apoorva Nagar at the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology says it turns out, for the most part, ants don't have traffic jams. Nagar wanted to know why that was and whether human traffic engineers could learn a thing or two from ants about how to avoid jams. I reached Nagar via Skype in his office in Kerala, India. He says there are basically three reasons ants don't jam up when running together in a single direction. Number one, ants don't have egos. They don't show off by zooming past slowpokes. APOORVA NAGAR: They do not want to overtake each other. PALCA: No aggressive drivers on an ant highway. NAGAR: The second thing is that they do not mind a few accidents or collisions. PALCA: So unless there's a serious pileup, they just keep going. And the third reason? NAGAR: Ants seem to get more disciplined as the density increases. PALCA: More discipline means no rubbernecking or distracted driving. Nagar felt this kind of behavior could be explained by something called the Langevin equation, an equation physicists use when describing the movement of liquids or how individual atoms behave in a lattice. I wasn't entirely familiar with the Langevin equation, so I turned to Thomas Donnelly, a physics professor at Harvey Mudd College. THOMAS DONNELLY: This is basically a reworking of Newton's famous F=MA equation. PALCA: Oh, yes, of course. Force equals mass times acceleration. DONNELLY: So it's all Newton, but they're using a sort of special description of the forces, which includes a random component. PALCA: OK, I think that's as far as I'm going to go in explaining that. But the bottom line is when Nagar made a mathematical model of the ants' traffic patterns using the Langevin equation and compared what his model predicted with what experiments with ants running in a line showed. . . NAGAR: And they sort of seemed to fit very well with the experiment. PALCA: So he wrote up his results, and they will appear in an upcoming issue of the journal Physical Review E. Nagar is not sure how relevant his model will be for human traffic engineers. After all, he agrees allowing cars to bump into each other at 60 miles an hour may be a nonstarter. Although greater discipline and less ego should help keep traffic flowing smoothly. There's one other tiny problem. Nagar is a physicist, not an ant man. I've talked with ant researchers who say when the volume of ants is high enough, ants do jam up. But I suppose you could solve that problem by building more ant highways. Joe Palca, NPR News.

I'm Arun Rath. The United States work force has more women than ever, more people of color than ever, more gay and transgender employees than ever. So more than ever, researchers are examining diversity and bias in the workplace. Michelle Duguid is a professor at Washington University in St. Louis. She decided to test the validity of a common belief - that requiring the use of politically correct language in the workplace also stifles creativity. It makes sense intuitively. MICHELLE DUGUID: People should be able to freely think, throw any crazy ideas, and any constraint would actually dampen creativity. RATH: But Duguid and her co-authors set up an experiment to see if that notion held up to scientific scrutiny. So they sat down students in groups of three to brainstorm ideas on how to use a vacant space on campus. Some of the groups were all men, some all women, others mixed. Control groups got to start right away with the brainstorming, but the test groups were primed with this script. DUGUID: We're interested in gathering examples from college undergraduates of political correct behavior on campus. As a group, please list examples of political correctness that you have either heard of or directly experienced on this campus. And they did that for 10 minutes. RATH: In the same-sex trios, the old notion held true. Groups of three men or three women who were instructed to think about political correctness were less creative than the control group. But in the mixed-gender groups that got the PC drill, creativity went up. DUGUID: They generated more ideas, and those ideas were more novel. Whether it was two men and one woman or two women and one man, the results were consistent. RATH: Here's how Duguid interprets those results. DUGUID: Men are uncertain about, you know, what may be seen maybe as sexist or inappropriate. And women, they're uncertain about, you know, can I speak up because will my ideas be valued. But in both cases, by reducing this uncertainty, people were much more open - both men and women - to share more ideas and more novel ideas; ideas that were kind of out-of-the-box that would be associated with uncertainty. RATH: Duguid and her colleagues started another experiment, one that looked at stereotypes. They tested whether educating people about stereotypes would in turn reduce stereotyping. DUGUID: But we found that by telling, publicizing that everyone stereotypes - we'd say the vast majority of people stereotype in our study - that it actually creates a norm for stereotyping. People feel more comfortable expressing stereotypes or acting in ways that would be seen as inappropriate because it has set up this norm where everyone does it, so I might not be punished or isn't that bad. RATH: Duguid and her co-author tinkered with their message. Rather than telling the group that everyone was guilty of stereotyping, they simply told them this. DUGUID: The vast majority of people put effort into not stereotyping. RATH: Here's what they found. DUGUID: And by telling them the vast majority of people put effort into not stereotyping, actually had great effects, and it was the same as telling them that few people stereotyped. So that actually reduced stereotyping, and it was better - significantly better than telling them nothing at all. RATH: For Michelle Duguid, the good news from her study is this. DUGUID: I think most people want to be unbiased. And there are ways that we can try to make that happen. RATH: Professor Michelle Duguid of Washington University.

Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. CORNISH: Yes, and nice work leaving Pluto out. It's now off the list, considered a dwarf planet. SIEGEL: But in the future there may be a whole new yet-to-be-named planet in its place. Scientists suspect the outer reaches of our solar system may have an undiscovered planet the size of Earth or even larger. CORNISH: NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce has the latest on the search for Planet X. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: You may have thought that by now astronomers would surely have found all the major planets in our solar system. Well, think again. KEVIN LUHMAN: There is a huge volume of space in the outer solar system. We know almost nothing about what might be out there. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Kevin Luhman is an astronomer at Penn State University. He says for over a century, scientists have observed various things that they thought could be explained by the presence of an unknown planet - Planet X. LUHMAN: Planet X is kind of a catchall name given to any speculation about an unseen companion orbiting the sun. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Some conspiracy-minded folks even think that Planet X has already been discovered. LUHMAN: There are a lot of these people on the Internet who think that, for instance, NASA knows about an unseen planet, but it's on a collision course with Earth and it's going to destroy us, but they don't tell us about it. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Nobody's told him anyway. So to search for Planet X, he recently scanned the sky using a NASA space telescope that detects infrared light. It would have found anything the size of Jupiter or Saturn because gas giants like these are big enough and warm enough that they produce a lot of infrared light. He didn't see any planet like that - not that everyone believes him. LUHMAN: I got a few emails after that, just from random people in the public. I shouldn't be admitting that on a recording. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Still, there may be smaller, cooler planets out there. Astronomer Scott Sheppard says for a long time, there was just no way to go look. SCOTT SHEPPARD: Up until a year or two ago, we just didn't have the technology to do this because we didn't have large cameras and large telescopes. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says any planet out there would be very faint because light would have to travel billions of miles from the sun to the planet, bounce off and then travel all the way back to our telescopes. SHEPPARD: And because of that, it's actually - if you put an object twice as far away, it becomes 16 times fainter, so things get very faint very fast. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Sheppard and his colleagues have been searching for very faint objects using a massive camera on a powerful telescope in Chile. Last year, they announced that they had found one - a dwarf planet, a little, pink ice ball that's far beyond Pluto. There's a framed photo of it hanging on the wall of Sheppard's office at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D. C. And that wall could soon have other photos. SHEPPARD: We believe there's probably a lot of objects bigger than Pluto still out there. And there could easily be objects as big as Mars or even Earth, out beyond in the very far distant solar system. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He's already found hints of something big. When he looks at the orbits of his dwarf planet and some other small, icy bodies, he sees a pattern. SHEPPARD: And you wouldn't expect that. You expect the orbits to be completely random. GREENFIELDBOYCE: One possible explanation is that they are all being influenced by the force of a large, unknown planet - or maybe more than one. Scientists will have a good shot at finding out once they have something called the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. It will scan huge swaths of sky for faint objects. The building site for it is already being prepared on top of a mountain in Chile, and construction will begin in earnest this year. Scott Kenyon is an astrophysicist at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Mass. SCOTT KENYON: With the next generation of telescopes, or if we're lucky with the current generation of telescopes, it will be possible to detect the light from this planet. If we can see it and pinpoint its position, then everybody will get excited. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says finding a new planet would be like meeting a new neighbor.

K. is on its way to become the first country to allow a procedure that uses genes from three adults to create babies. Lawmakers approved regulations allowing the procedure today, but it's been the subject of intense debate. The process is aimed at trying to help women have healthy children. NPR's Rob Stein has been following this story, and, Rob, begin by telling us why exactly scientists want the go-ahead to do this. ROB STEIN, BYLINE: You know, every single one of our cells have structures inside of them known as mitochondria. And these are like the batteries inside your cellphone. They provide all the energy that cells  need to function. And each of these mitochondria have their own set of genes. And if there are defects in these genes they can cause diseases known as mitochondrial diseases. And these can be pretty terrible diseases. Babies can die within the first few days or weeks of being born. And if they survive they can go on to have terrible complications that leave them disabled or they end up dying prematurely, and these diseases can occur generation after generation in certain families. CORNISH: Now, this procedure is aimed at preventing those conditions. Explain exactly how it works. STEIN: Yeah, so mitochondria are only passed down from women to their babies through their eggs. So the idea is to fix the defective DNA in these eggs in the women in these families. And here's what they do - they take healthy mitochondrial DNA from eggs donated by women without these diseases and they use that to replace the defective DNA in the eggs of women in these families. And the idea is that the resulting embryo would have the regular DNA of the woman trying to have the healthy baby, the regular DNA from her male partner and the healthy DNA from the woman who donated her egg. CORNISH: And this has raised a lot of ethical questions, right? I mean, describe some of the big ones. STEIN: Yeah, well, one of them is what I just said - that any babies born this way would have DNA from three different people. And another big controversy about this is it would be doing something that's never been done before. It's been considered taboo in science, which is making changes in human DNA that would be passed down for generations, and there are lots of concerns about that. The first one is scientists could make a mistake. They could introduce some new disease that then would become a permanent part of the human genetic blueprint. Another concern is that this could be sort of a slippery slope towards designer babies, where people could use similar techniques to make changes, to pick the traits of their children, like how smart they are or how tall they are, whether they're good athletes - that sort of thing. CORNISH: Now, how much of this came up before the vote today in the British House of Commons? STEIN: All these issues came up and it got pretty emotional. So let's hear a bit of the debate. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)THEONA BRUCE: Once the gene is out of the bottle there will be no going back for society. FRANK DOBSON: But the thing to remember is mitochondrial disease is horrible. There is. . . ROBERT FLELLO: And if this was genetically modified crops, we'd be all up in arms. That's was happening here. STEIN: Yeah, so as you can hear, it got pretty intense. And those were members of Parliament - Robert Flello, Frank Dobson and Theona Bruce. And in the end, the House of Commons voted overwhelmingly to let this go ahead - 382 in favor, 128 against. CORNISH: What happens next? STEIN: Well, it still has to be approved by the House of Lords, but most people think it will. This fall I visited some of the scientists at Newcastle University who want to do this, to see how it's actually done in the lab, and they say as soon as they got the greenlight they're going to go ahead and try this. So that could happen as early as sometime later this year, so the first baby could be born this way early next year. CORNISH: Meanwhile, there are scientists in the U. S. who want to try something similar, right? STEIN: Right, at least two groups of U. S. scientists want to try this. And the Food and Drug Administration had an expert panel take a look at this not too long ago, and they raised some serious safety concerns about this. And subsequent to that the Food and Drug Administration asked the National Academy of Sciences to take a look at some of these ethical issues and they just got started on that. CORNISH: That's NPR's Rob Stein on the vote today the U. K. to allow babies to be created using genes from three people. Rob, thanks so much. STEIN: Oh, sure, nice to be here.

And here's what they do - they take healthy mitochondrial DNA from eggs donated by women without these diseases and they use that to replace the defective DNA in the eggs of women in these families. And the idea is that the resulting embryo would have the regular DNA of the woman trying to have the healthy baby, the regular DNA from her male partner and the healthy DNA from the woman who donated her egg. CORNISH: And this has raised a lot of ethical questions, right? I mean, describe some of the big ones. STEIN: Yeah, well, one of them is what I just said - that any babies born this way would have DNA from three different people. And another big controversy about this is it would be doing something that's never been done before. It's been considered taboo in science, which is making changes in human DNA that would be passed down for generations, and there are lots of concerns about that. The first one is scientists could make a mistake. They could introduce some new disease that then would become a permanent part of the human genetic blueprint. Another concern is that this could be sort of a slippery slope towards designer babies, where people could use similar techniques to make changes, to pick the traits of their children, like how smart they are or how tall they are, whether they're good athletes - that sort of thing. CORNISH: Now, how much of this came up before the vote today in the British House of Commons? STEIN: All these issues came up and it got pretty emotional. So let's hear a bit of the debate. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) THEONA BRUCE: Once the gene is out of the bottle there will be no going back for society. FRANK DOBSON: But the thing to remember is mitochondrial disease is horrible. There is. . . ROBERT FLELLO: And if this was genetically modified crops, we'd be all up in arms. That's was happening here. STEIN: Yeah, so as you can hear, it got pretty intense. And those were members of Parliament - Robert Flello, Frank Dobson and Theona Bruce. And in the end, the House of Commons voted overwhelmingly to let this go ahead - 382 in favor, 128 against. CORNISH: What happens next? STEIN: Well, it still has to be approved by the House of Lords, but most people think it will. This fall I visited some of the scientists at Newcastle University who want to do this, to see how it's actually done in the lab, and they say as soon as they got the greenlight they're going to go ahead and try this. So that could happen as early as sometime later this year, so the first baby could be born this way early next year. CORNISH: Meanwhile, there are scientists in the U. S. who want to try something similar, right? STEIN: Right, at least two groups of U. S. scientists want to try this. And the Food and Drug Administration had an expert panel take a look at this not too long ago, and they raised some serious safety concerns about this. And subsequent to that the Food and Drug Administration asked the National Academy of Sciences to take a look at some of these ethical issues and they just got started on that. CORNISH: That's NPR's Rob Stein on the vote today the U. K. to allow babies to be created using genes from three people. Rob, thanks so much.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: We see the Earth now almost as a disc. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Roger. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: We have a beautiful view of Florida now, and at the same time we can see Africa. SIEGEL: The three astronauts aboard Apollo 8 were the first to see earth that way. But if all goes well later this year, everyone will have access to that view. The image will come from a spacecraft called DSCOVR, and we'll hear more about that spacecraft now from NPR's Joe Palca. He's been working on a series of stories about science and invention called Joe's Big Idea, and today it's the curious history of DSCOVR. As Joe tells us, the mission scheduled for launch this Sunday was first proposed by Vice President Al Gore way back in 1998. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Al Gore was pretty smitten with the view of earth you can only get from space. There was a giant photograph of the Earth taken by the Apollo 17 astronauts in his West Wing office. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)AL GORE: Wouldn't it be nice to have that image continuous, live, 24 hours a day? PALCA: That's Gore speaking in 1998. He had the idea that it would be nice for everyone to get that view, a way to inspire and humble us, a kind of reminder that we earthlings are all in this together. So he proposed sending a probe to a spot a million miles from Earth, a probe named Triana, that would point a telescope with a color camera back at our planet. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GORE: And send images down to students by way of the Internet. PALCA: NASA was game to build and launch Triana, but Roger Launius says the space agency officials weren't crazy about the idea of a satellite that had only one instrument on board. Launius was NASA's chief historian when Gore proposed Triana. ROGER LAUNIUS: They certainly wanted to make it a more scientifically viable project than maybe was envisioned initially by Mr. Gore. PALCA: So NASA added instruments to measure the solar wind and radiant energy coming from the Earth. But then Al Gore lost an election to George W. Bush. The new president and the Republicans in Congress weren't interested in Democrat Gore's pet project. They mockingly called it GoreSat. Launius says NASA wasn't about to expend any political capital trying to keep Triana live. LAUNIUS: Most of the time, you're not going to the wall on any one project, especially if it's a relatively small project that is not your first priority to start with. PALCA: So even though it was built and almost ready for launch, NASA shipped Triana to building 29 at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD, where it just sat. Then something happened. In 2009, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, also known as NOAA, decided it needed a new space weather satellite. The agency was relying on a NASA satellite way past its prime for the data needed for space weather forecasts. NOAA wanted a replacement, and the scientific instruments NASA added to Triana made it just the thing NOAA was looking for. So Triana was rechristened DSCOVR. Its instruments got a tune-up, and the spacecraft was made ready for launch. Now, you may be thinking, space weather forecasts? What - the crew of the space station is worried about rain and snow? No, it's not that. Tom Berger is head of NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center. TOM BERGER: A weather satellite in deep space is going to give us advance notice of storms coming from the sun that impact the earth and the earth's magnetosphere. PALCA: Every so often, the sun burps out a cloud of charged particles that hurdle through space at a million miles an hour or faster. Berger says since DSCOVR will orbit at a point a million miles from Earth. . . BERGER: It's our buoy in space, if you will, that warns us of that solar tsunami coming towards the earth. And we can get about an hour's warning, at best, to prepare for the impact. PALCA: These storms can cause havoc on the electric power grid. But with warning, utilities can make adjustments. The military is also interested in early warning, so interested that the Air Force is actually paying to launch DSCOVR. Col. Jason Cothern is in charge of the Air Force aspects of the DSCOVR mission. JASON COTHERN: There are things that we can do to put our spacecraft or other systems in safe states to minimize the damage that could be caused by any form of space weather. So having that heads-up would be very helpful. PALCA: So the revival of Triana is making the Air Force happy. It's making NOAA happy. It's making NASA happy. I was wondering how one other person was feeling about the mission. I reached him by home phone in his Nashville office. And how do you feel now, 17 years after you first talked about it, that this spacecraft is actually going to go into space? GORE: (Laughter) I'm extremely happy, as you might imagine. In fact, I'm going to be at Cape Canaveral for the launch. PALCA: So even though GoreSat may have been the butt of some jokes, it looks like Mr. Gore will get the last laugh. And, oh, by the way, DSCOVR will still provide that picture of Earth Gore first had in mind, a picture that will be available to students and anyone else by way of the Internet. Joe Palca, NPR News.

I'm Guy Raz, and on the show today - the Seven Deadly Sins. And in preparation for this episode, we kind of fell down an Internet rabbit hole because if you spend enough time looking, you'll find a surprising number of Internet conspiracy theories that claim that many of the most beloved film and TV characters are based on those seven sins. (SOUNDBITE OF \"GILLIGAN'S ISLAND\" THEME SONG)THE WELLINGTONS: (Singing) Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale, a tale of a fateful trip. . . RAZ: For example, \"Gilligan's Island. \" Apparently it's one long parable with Gilligan representing sloth. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"GILLIGAN'S ISLAND\")ALAN HALE: (As Jonas The Skipper Grumby) Gilligan? BOB DENVER: (As Gilligan) What's the matter? HALE: (As Jonas The Skipper Grumby) I can't fall asleep with all that snoring going on. RAZ: The Skipper is wrath. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"GILLIGAN'S ISLAND\")HALE: (As Jonas The Skipper Grumby) When we find him, I'll pick him up in my arms and break every bone in his body for worrying us like this. (LAUGHTER)RAZ: Ginger, what else? She's lust. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"GILLIGAN'S ISLAND\")TINA LOUISE: (As Ginger Grant) Gilligan? DENVER: (As Gilligan) Yeah? LOUISE: (As Ginger Grant) Come here. DENVER: (As Gilligan) But you've never been so friendly to me before. LOUISE: (As Ginger Grant) There's always a first time for everything. RAZ: The professor is pride. Mary Anne is envy because well, she is sort of second fiddle to Ginger; greed, of course, Thurston Howell III; his wife - better known as Lovey - is gluttony. And the thing is, it kind of sounds plausible, doesn't it? And there are lots of other theories like this. \"Charlie And The Chocolate Factory\" is supposedly a seven deadly sins metaphor. So is \"SpongeBob SquarePants,\" the cast of \"Friends,\" \"Winnie The Pooh. \" True or not, there is clearly something to this idea that these seven transgressions can be neatly arranged into a clean and elegant list, seven behaviors that are deeply embedded into our very nature. So today on the show, we're going to try something a little different - seven TED speakers, each with an idea about one of the seven deadly sins. So first up. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MARVIN GAYE SONG, \"LET'S GET IT ON\")CHRISTOPHER RYAN: (Laughter). Well, hey, it's got to be lust, right? (LAUGHTER)RAZ: Now is probably a good time to tell you - just as a heads up - that this segment contains some discussion about sex and sexual behaviors that exist. So then - to Christopher Ryan. RYAN: I'm the co-author of \"Sex At Dawn,\" which I co-authored with my wife, Cacilda Jetha. RAZ: Christopher's idea is a provocative one, and not without critics, but it might change the way you think about monogamy and most importantly, lust. RYAN: Lust is sort of a - very interesting because the other sins I can see an argument as to how they are destructive and - but with lust, if you look at the famous Old Testament line, thou shall not covet thy neighbor's wife, like, we all think that's about respecting their marriage, right? But if you read it in context it says nor his house, nor his servants, nor his ox, nor his sheep. In other words, keep your hands off your neighbor's property. And his wife is just one part of his property that you shouldn't interfere with. So that's what sexual monogamy is. Sexual monogamy is an institution designed to protect the property of the father or the husband. It's not a response to any sort of evolved tendencies. RAZ: OK. So Christopher's not only suggesting that monogamy is basically a human invention, but that by being monogamous, by resisting the sin of lust, we might be acting in a way that undermines our very nature, even our survival. Here's his TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)RYAN: Now, since Darwin's day, there's been what Cacilda and I have called the standard narrative of human sexual evolution, and you're all familiar with it, even if you haven't read this stuff. The idea is that, as part of human nature, from the beginning of our species' time, men have sort of leased women's reproductive potential by providing them with certain goods and services. Generally we're talking about meat, shelter, status, protection - things like that, right? And in exchange, women have offered fidelity or at least a promise of fidelity. Now, this sets men and women up in oppositional relationship, right? What Cacilda and I have argued is that no, this economic relationship, this oppositional relationship, is actually an artifact of agriculture, which only arose about 10,000 years ago at the earliest. So we've argued that human sexuality essentially evolved, until agriculture, as a way of establishing and maintaining the complex, flexible social systems -networks - that our ancestors were very good at. And that's why our species has survived so well. Now, this makes some people uncomfortable and so I always need to take a moment in these talks to say, listen, I'm saying our ancestors were promiscuous. But I'm not saying they were having sex with strangers. There were no strangers, right? A hunter-gatherer band - there are no strangers. You've known these people your entire life. So I'm saying, yes, there were overlapping sexual relationships, that our ancestors probably had several different sexual relationships going on at any given moment in their adult lives. But I'm not saying they were having sex with strangers. I'm not saying that they didn't love the people they were having sex with. And I am not saying there was no pair-bonding going on. I'm just saying it wasn't sexually exclusive. And those of us who have chosen to be monogamous - my parents, for example, have been married for 52 years monogamously - I'm not criticizing this, and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with this. What I'm saying is that to argue that our ancestors were sexual omnivores is no more a criticism of monogamy than to argue that our ancestors were dietary omnivores is a criticism of vegetarianism. You can choose to be a vegetarian, but don't think that just because you've made that decision, bacon suddenly stopped smelling good, OK? So this is my point. (LAUGHTER)RYAN: That one took a minute to sink, huh? RAZ: OK so just to clarify, you're basically arguing that we are designed - that humans are basically lustful, promiscuous animals, right? RYAN: Well, in \"Sex At Dawn\" essentially what we argue is that a casual, friendly promiscuity is the natural, most deeply resonate human behavior. And that's why we have so much lust, right? The fact that human beings think about sex so much is - we're off the scale. Most mammals only have sex when the female's ovulating. And when I say most, I mean virtually all. The number of mammals who have sex regularly when the female's not ovulating are just a handful - humans, chimps, bonobos and dolphins, which you'll notice are all highly social, highly intelligent animals. And in all those species, what's happened is that sexuality has become useful for social purposes, for establishing and maintaining social bonds and social networks of trust and intimacy. So, you know, when someone says, oh, you know, that person is like an animal sexually. No, animals aren't anything like humans sexually. They're embarrassed by us, right? It's sort of the opposite of what most people think. RAZ: So in your book, you're arguing that it's not only OK to feel lust all the time, but also to act on it? RYAN: Not really, no. It's not a guidebook. We're not advocating that everyone should be swingers or polyamorous or, you know, promiscuous or anything. In fact that's the main complaint about \"Sex At Dawn. \" People write and say, you left me hanging. You didn't say what I should do now, because I don't know what you should do, right? And, you know, it's not a particularly sexy book. It's a popular science book. But what's happening is that they're feeling a sense of liberation. There's nothing wrong with me that I'm thinking about sex. There's nothing wrong with me that I love my boyfriend, but I'm attracted to other men, right? There's nothing wrong with my marriage that my wife thinks about other people and I think about other people. There's a sense of forgiveness and acceptance that we're very gratified by. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LET'S GET IT ON\")MARVIN GAYE: (Singing) Trying to hold back this feeling for so long. RAZ: OK so we have this list of seven sins. And I guess you would argue that this one doesn't belong. Like, you could just strike it off? RYAN: Strike it off the list, you know? All the others - wrath, pride, envy - they're all harmful in some way. Lust isn't harmful necessarily. Lust can be lust for life. Who doesn't feel lust for life? And how can we tell someone not to feel lust? (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LET'S GET IT ON\")GAYE: (Singing) Let's love baby. RAZ: Christopher Ryan, his book is \"Sex At Dawn. \" His full talk is at ted. com. On the show today - the Seven Deadly Sins. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR.

And, you know, it's not a particularly sexy book. It's a popular science book. But what's happening is that they're feeling a sense of liberation. There's nothing wrong with me that I'm thinking about sex. There's nothing wrong with me that I love my boyfriend, but I'm attracted to other men, right? There's nothing wrong with my marriage that my wife thinks about other people and I think about other people. There's a sense of forgiveness and acceptance that we're very gratified by. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LET'S GET IT ON\") MARVIN GAYE: (Singing) Trying to hold back this feeling for so long. RAZ: OK so we have this list of seven sins. And I guess you would argue that this one doesn't belong. Like, you could just strike it off? RYAN: Strike it off the list, you know? All the others - wrath, pride, envy - they're all harmful in some way. Lust isn't harmful necessarily. Lust can be lust for life. Who doesn't feel lust for life? And how can we tell someone not to feel lust? (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LET'S GET IT ON\") GAYE: (Singing) Let's love baby.

We're not talking about your next car, but your next solar panel. The number of U. S. homes with solar panels has risen dramatically in just a few years, and one big reason for that is many leasing programs require little or no money up front. Here's NPR's Jeff Brady. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: In northern New Jersey, two neighbors followed different paths to get their solar panels. ELIZABETH EBINGER: I'm Elizabeth Ebinger. I live in Maplewood, N. J. , and I bought the solar panels on my roof. TIM ROEBUCK: And I'm Elizabeth's neighbor, and we leased the panels on our roof. BRADY: And your name? ROEBUCK: Is Tim Roebuck. BRADY: Elizabeth Ebinger chose to buy partly because she enjoys the nitty-gritty of owning solar panels, everything from figuring out her eligibility for government incentives to crunching the numbers. EBINGER: I have to confess that I do maintain a spreadsheet that analyzes the details of our expenses and our paybackBRADY: Her system cost $35,000. A mix of federal and state subsidies helped reduce that price tag. And then there's the savings on her utility bill each month. Ebinger has calculated how long it will take to recoup her investment. EBINGER: We're currently looking at a less-than-10-year payback on the system. And we're hoping that the panels will last through their warranty, which is 25 years. BRADY: If all works out as planned, Ebinger will have 15 years of free electricity. Next door, Tim Roebuck took a less hands-on approach to installing solar panels. He signed a 20-year lease. ROEBUCK: I pay $69. 25 per month for those panels. BRADY: That payment replaces his monthly electricity bill. Roebuck says the lease payment will go up, but he's betting his power bill would've gone up even more. So he expects to save money too, just not as much as his neighbor. ROEBUCK: And I didn't have to do anything and battle with the tax credits and that sort of thing. BRADY: The company that installed his panels gets to keep the government incentives, but it also maintains his panels. Roebuck says if paying up front for solar were the only option, he probably wouldn't do it. And down the road, if he wants to buy the panels, he can at a discounted price. ROEBUCK: It was a very simple, easy thing for me to do. It was a low-risk thing because I didn't have to pay anything, so that's it; that's why we did it. BRADY: So Ebinger bought her panels because she could save more money over the long term, and she enjoys navigating the details. Roebuck chose to lease because it was simpler and didn't require cash up front. Those are pretty much the reasons most people choose to buy or lease, says John Farrell. He's with the Institute for Local Self Reliance in Minneapolis. JOHN FARRELL: But I think I, in general, would say I favor ownership, simply because it means keeping more of the dollars over the lifetime of that solar panel in the pocket of the owner. BRADY: Farrell's group has a calculator on its website to help you figure out the cost of owning versus leasing solar panels. FARRELL: For example, in Chicago, Ill. , not particularly the sunniest city around, but you could save over the 30-year life of a solar panel about $6,200 where you'd own that system outright. BRADY: A lease still saves that Chicago resident about $4,000FARRELL: So both are good deals from the standpoint of saving money, but ownership is about a 50 percent better deal. BRADY: If you don't have the cash, Farrell says you can borrow money for solar panels. He plans to take out a home equity loan for panels on his house in Minnesota. He also points out that leases aren't available everywhere. They're mostly in sunny states that have generous subsidies. Now back to our original question - is buying or leasing solar panels better? Farrell's advice - consider buying first. But if that's a barrier, then leasing is a good alternative. Jeff Brady, NPR News.

It's light, durable and lots of stuff can be made out of it. But it's also transforming the oceans, and not in a good way. A lot of plastic ends up there. As NPR's Christopher Joyce reports, scientists are just now getting a handle on how much plastic has gone to sea. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Scientists have been trying to figure out how much plastic is in the ocean. The best they can do is make a rough estimate. After all, the oceans cover 70 percent of the planet. But another way to figure out what's out there is to measure what's coming off the land. And that's what engineer Jenna Jambeck at the University of Georgia decided to do. She was a good fit for the job. JENNA JAMBECK: My thing is really waste management. That's what I fell in love with. JOYCE: And love would not be an overstatement. JAMBECK: I take photos of the way people manage waste all over the world, take pictures of garbage cans - yeah. And I met my husband at the landfill. At least he understands me. JOYCE: Jambeck undertook a unique project - to study waste streams in 192 countries. She gathered data on how much waste each country generates and how it's managed. She calculated how much is plastic and how much exists within 30 miles of an ocean. Researchers inventoried what was on the beaches, and here's what she found. JAMBECK: In 2010 there was 8 million metric tons of plastic entering the ocean, globally. JOYCE: Plastic bottles, candy wrappers, laundry baskets, syringes. Jambeck calculates that's like putting five bags of plastic trash on every foot of coastline in the world. She published her findings in the Journal of Science. She calls it an order of magnitude estimate - not exact, but in the ballpark. As to how the plastic gets there? JAMBECK: So if you have waste that's free in the environment on the landmass that's in a close proximity to the ocean, it's going to be blown or be washed into the ocean. It also could be washed into rivers and then flow from there. JOYCE: Americans generate a lot of plastic trash, but Jambeck found that fast-growing economies like China and Indonesia are bigger sources of ocean plastic. They don't have as much recycling or managed landfills as the U. S. , and they have long coastlines. This plastic tsunami worries the Ocean Conservancy, an environmental group that funded Jambeck's research. Nick Mallos runs the Conservancy's Trash Free Seas program. He says plastic affects over 600 species of marine animals. NICK MALLOS: That ranges from mussels - both farmed and wild - to fin fish, to sea turtles, all the way up to fin whales, both through risks of entanglement but also through ingestion. JOYCE: Mallos notes that plastic can absorb chemicals in the ocean which could get passed on to fish that eat the plastic. MALLOS: There are a lot of questions about what that means for the future of the food chain. JOYCE: Mallos says there are biodegradable materials that can replace plastic wrapping or containers, and recycling tends to increase as economies flourish. In the meantime, there are landfills - not ideal, but you might find true love at one. Christopher Joyce, NPR News. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  Plastic transformed the world.

Last year, the Navy sponsored a massive study that used several seagliders together with buoys and other probes to look at a big patch of Arctic ice. The sensors tracked the ice over the summer as it broke apart and melted. JEFFRIES: It was the largest experiment of its kind, namely an experiment that relied to a great extent on robotic technologies and autonomous observing. Nothing like it had ever been done in the Arctic Ocean. BRUMFIEL: This kind of big scientific study is something new for the Navy. For decades, it's run its submarines underneath the Arctic ice. But it didn't really care what was happening on the surface. JEFFRIES: The Arctic essentially has been a closed ocean because of the ice cover which did not retreat so much in the summer. BRUMFIEL: But climate change is causing the Arctic Ocean to thaw. In the summer of 2007, a lot of ice covering the ocean melted. And in 2012, even more ice disappeared.

MCBRIDE: Even if it's ice-free, there will be times and places where the temperatures are extremely low. And things break in ways that you wouldn't necessarily expect.

And many of them are frustrated by a lack of action. NPR's Joe Palca introduces us now to a climate scientist who says even people who acknowledge the problem seem to be complacent, and the scientist has an unusual plan to change that. This report is part of Joe's Big Idea, a series of stories about the mind and motivation of scientists and inventors. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: A decade ago, physicist Robert Davies wasn't all that interested in the Earth's climate. His field was quantum optics. But while he was working at the University of Oxford in England, he became intrigued by what was going on at Oxford's Environmental Change Institute that was just down the road from his lab. ROBERT DAVIES: And just started going to some seminars and was just taken by the broad gap between what science understands about climate change and what the public understands, and took that as simply just a problem of science communication. PALCA: So he decided to do something about it. He gave public lectures on the looming dangers of climate change and what it would mean for the sustainability of life on this planet. The results weren't what he expected. DAVIES: The audiences would understand it, you know, on an intellectual level. The science is pretty self-explanatory and very compelling. But it was still very difficult to connect with. PALCA: It was a little bit like informing people about the dangers of smoking and then watching them go out afterwards and light up a cigarette. Davies became passionately interested in finding ways to change people's behavior when it comes to climate change. But he wasn't sure how. He left Oxford and quantum optics for Logan, Utah, and a job at the Utah State University Climate Center. And then one day it occurred to him. DAVIES: What if we do this as a performance? PALCA: Davies figured music had always freed his mind up to see the world in different ways. So he had the idea of creating a hybrid event - a kind of informational lecture/music performance. DAVIES: We have this amazing professional string quartet - the Fry Street Quartet - as artists in residence at the Caine College of the Arts here. And so I approached them to see if they would be interested in participating in this experiment. And they really jumped that it. And so, together, we developed this performance as a means of helping an audience get the information not just intellectually, but viscerally, to really connect with it. PALCA: They called the performance the Crossroads Project. In addition to the music, there are evocative images taken by nature photographers and projections of the paintings inspired by nature displayed behind the musicians. The team commissioned composer Laura Kaminsky to write a piece of music for the project. It's called \"Rising Tide. \"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"RISING TIDE\")PALCA: Rebecca McFaul is a violinist in the quartet. REBECCA MCFAUL: I was just thrilled at the thought of being able to use my art form - the medium of the string quartet - in some way that was relevant to this topic that I was so concerned about. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"RISING TIDE\")PALCA: McFaul says although the music is intended to make people think about things like water and glaciers and warming temperatures, in the end it is what it is. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"RISING TIDE\")MCFAUL: It can take on so many different meanings for the listener. There is no right or wrong answers for it. And the idea is just to - to live through it and sit with it and contemplate it. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"RISING TIDE\")MCFAUL: If you're going to be open to it and sit through it, you go places that you wouldn't otherwise go. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"RISING TIDE\")PALCA: Robert Davies says the performance gives audiences a chance to form an emotional connection with the information. DAVIES: That's what they don't get in the science lecture, but they do get in a performance of our Crossroads Project. PALCA: Davies says the point isn't to convert skeptics. DAVIES: It's not real  ly about convincing people who don't believe we have these problems. It's about convincing people who already believe we have these problems to start behaving like it. PALCA: People are bound to be affected by the Crossroads Project. Psychologists know that adding emotion to a message makes that message more memorable. Whether it will have the impact on behavior Davies is hoping for is another question. Joe Palca, NPR News.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"RISING TIDE\") PALCA: McFaul says although the music is intended to make people think about things like water and glaciers and warming temperatures, in the end it is what it is. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"RISING TIDE\") MCFAUL: It can take on so many different meanings for the listener. There is no right or wrong answers for it. And the idea is just to - to live through it and sit with it and contemplate it. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"RISING TIDE\") MCFAUL: If you're going to be open to it and sit through it, you go places that you wouldn't otherwise go. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"RISING TIDE\") PALCA: Robert Davies says the performance gives audiences a chance to form an emotional connection with the information. DAVIES: That's what they don't get in the science lecture, but they do get in a performance of our Crossroads Project. PALCA: Davies says the point isn't to convert skeptics. DAVIES: It's not real  ly about convincing people who don't believe we have these problems. It's about convincing people who already believe we have these problems to start behaving like it. PALCA: People are bound to be affected by the Crossroads Project. Psychologists know that adding emotion to a message makes that message more memorable. Whether it will have the impact on behavior Davies is hoping for is another question. Joe Palca, NPR News.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, The Unknown Brain - the mystery of how billions of neurons make us who we are. SUZANA HERCULANO-HOUZEL: You know, when I was starting this whole thing and just creating the method, the lab I worked at had a blender - a kitchen blender just sitting there on top of a shelf. And I remember walking in and looking at that and thinking, am I really going to throw a human brain into a blender? RAZ: This is Suzana. HERCULANO-HOUZEL: Suzana Herculano-Houzel. RAZ: She's a neuroscientist. HERCULANO-HOUZEL: And a professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. RAZ: And that blender? HERCULANO-HOUZEL: Just sitting there on a top of a shelf. RAZ: What led her to the blender was a question that had never really been answered - why us? What does a human brain have that no other brain does? Why did we become the dominant species on Earth? HERCULANO-HOUZEL: The human brain must be special in some way compared to every single other brain on earth. RAZ: But how? Well, one popular idea was a number. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: There are 100 billion neurons in the adult human brain. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: One hundred billion neurons. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: A hundred. . . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: One hundred. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: One hundred billion. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Billion. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Billion neurons. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: One hundred billion neurons. RAZ: One hundred billion neurons. And we'd always thought that was more than any other brain on the planet. But believe it or not, no one had ever actually counted them before until Suzana did. So how'd you do it? HERCULANO-HOUZEL: Not in the blender. (Laughter). What you use is. . . RAZ: OK, so a blender would be a little crude. Instead, she used a special detergent to dissolve a brain. . . HERCULANO-HOUZEL: Turn it into soup. RAZ: But leave the remnants of cells behind to count, not one by one of course, but using an equation. And. . . HERCULANO-HOUZEL: How many nuclei you find in the given volume. RAZ: OK, so what's the answer? How many? HERCULANO-HOUZEL: We found an average of 86 billion neurons. RAZ: Eighty-six billion neurons in the human brain, which is pretty close to that 100 billion estimate. HERCULANO-HOUZEL: But I like to point out the 14 billion that are missing are an entire baboon brain. RAZ: Oh, wow. HERCULANO-HOUZEL: That's a lot of neurons. If we had the mythical 100 billion neurons, we would be leaning towards the extraordinary really. But, like I said, that's an entire baboon brain away. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Eighty-six billion neurons didn't explain what makes us special. In fact, it seemed to suggest, compared to our primate cousins, we're pretty ordinary. Here's Suzana's TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HERCULANO-HOUZEL: So the human brain may be remarkable, yes. But it is not special in its number of neurons. It is just a large primate brain. But let's play along. If all brains were made the same way and you were to compare animals with brains of different sizes, larger brains should always have more neurons than smaller brains, and the larger the brain, the more cognitively able its owner should be. So the largest brain around should also be the most cognitively able. And here comes the bad news; our brain - not the largest one around. It seems quite vexing. Our brain weighs between 1. 2 and 1. 5 kilos, but elephant brains weigh between 4 and 5 kilos, and whale brains can weigh up to 9 kilos. That's because the size of the brain usually follows the size of the body. So the main reason for saying that our brain is larger than it should be actually comes from comparing ourselves to great apes. Gorillas can be two to three times larger than we are, so their brain should also be larger than ours. But instead it's the other way around. Our brain is three times larger than a gorilla brain. The human brain also seems special in the amount of energy that it uses. Although it weighs only 2 percent of the body, it alone uses 25 percent of all the energy that your body requires to run per day. That's 500 calories out of a total of 2,000 calories just to keep your brain working. So the human brain is larger than it should be; it uses much more energy than it should; so it's special. And this is where the story started to bother me. RAZ: So Suzana asked another question. Why does our brain burn so much energy? And what she found is that it's not about how many neurons we have, but where those neurons are located. Sixteen of our 86 billion neurons are clustered in a part of the brain known as the cerebral cortex. HERCULANO-HOUZEL: So the cerebral cortex is really responsible for all those things that we like to think of as superior cognitive abilities - the ability to plan ahead, to look back, to learn from your mistakes. So what is so remarkable about the human brain is that we manage to have a number of neurons in the cerebral cortex that is many times larger than any other animal has. RAZ: Wow, so 16 billion neurons in our cerebral cortex. How many - I don't know. Like, how many does a mouse have? HERCULANO-HOUZEL: A mouse has about 30 million. RAZ: And an elephant? HERCULANO-HOUZEL: An elephant has 5. 6 billion neurons. RAZ: Wow. What about, like, an ape? HERCULANO-HOUZEL: Nine billion neurons in the cerebral cortex. RAZ: So how did we get, like, almost twice as many as an ape? HERCULANO-HOUZEL: Well, the answer is that to add more neurons to your brain, you need more energy. A brain with more neurons costs more energy. And gorillas and orangutans eat raw foods - leaves, fruit, bark. They spent around eight and a half hours per day every single day collecting food, eating food and looking for food. And with the amount of energy that they get from that food, they can just sustain the large bodies that they have and the number of neurons that they have. Now, what about humans? With the brain that we have today, we would have to spend more than nine and a half hours per day looking for food and eating food. So somewhere back in our history - in our evolutionary history, our ancestors must have found a way to modify what we eat in a way that gives you many more calories than just raw food. RAZ: Yeah. HERCULANO-HOUZEL: And what we know that does that beautifully is cooking. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Cooking. HERCULANO-HOUZEL: Cooking. RAZ: We are who we are because of cooking. HERCULANO-HOUZEL: We learned to modify the food that we eat, and that allowed us to just cram more neurons inside the brain. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HERCULANO-HOUZEL: To cook is to use fire to predigest foods outside of your body. Cooked foods are softer, so they're easier to chew and to turn completely into mush in your mouth. So that allows them to be completely digested and absorbed in your gut, which makes them yield much more energy in much less time. So cooking frees time for us to do much more interesting things with our day and with our neurons than just thinking about food, looking for food, and gobbling down food all day long. So because of cooking, what once was a major liability - this large, dangerously expensive brain with a lot of neurons - could now become a major asset now that we could both afford the energy for a lot of neurons and the time to do interesting things with them. So I think this explains why the human brain grew to become so large so fast in evolution, all the while remaining just a primate brain. RAZ: This just, like, completely changes the way I'm going to see \"Top Chef\" from now on. HERCULANO-HOUZEL: I know. It completely changed the way I look at my kitchen. RAZ: Yeah. HERCULANO-HOUZEL: It's - the act of cooking has become something of not a miracle, but something to be revered. RAZ: Yeah, yeah. So how does this, like - how does this change the way you think about what it means to be human? HERCULANO-HOUZEL: I think it's very humbling. We're animals. We're just another species. It so happens that we were able to pack so much processing power in our cerebral cortex that we're even at that point now of looking at ourselves and gaining insight on how we work. RAZ: That's amazing that we are studying essentially this thing that runs us. HERCULANO-HOUZEL: Right, which I think is a lot of fun that some philosophers used to say that, you know, it's impossible. How can you ever use your very brain to understand how your brain works? And, well, neuroscience has proven them wrong. RAZ: That's neuroscientist Suzana Herculano-Houzel. Check out her full talk at ted. npr. org. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR.

But it's consciousness, the subjective experience of the mind, that allows us to ask the question in the first place. And where consciousness comes from - that is an entirely separate question. DAVID CHALMERS: Well, I like to distinguish between the easy problems of consciousness and the hard problem. RAZ: This is David Chalmers. He's a philosopher who coined this term, the hard problem of consciousness. CHALMERS: Well, the easy problems are ultimately a matter of explaining behavior - things we do. And I think brain science is great at problems like that. It can isolate a neural circuit and show how it enables you to see a red object, to respondent and say, that's red. But the hard problem of consciousness is subjective experience. Why, when all that happens in this circuit, does it feel like something? How does a bunch of - 86 billion neurons interacting inside the brain, coming together - how does that produce the subjective experience of a mind and of the world? RAZ: Here's how David Chalmers begins his TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CHALMERS: Right now, you have a movie playing inside your head. It has 3-D vision and surround sound for what you're seeing and hearing right now. Your movie has smell and taste and touch. It has a sense of your body, pain, hunger, orgasms. It has emotions, anger and happiness. It has memories, like scenes from your childhood, playing before you. This movie is your stream of consciousness. If we weren't conscious, nothing in our lives would have meaning or value. But at the same time, it's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe. Why are we conscious? RAZ: Why is consciousness more than just the sum of the brain's parts? CHALMERS: Well, the question is, you know, what is the brain? It's this giant complex computer, a bunch of interacting parts with great complexity. What does all that explain? That explains objective mechanism. Consciousness is subjective by its nature. It's a matter of subjective experience. And it seems that we can imagine all of that stuff going on in the brain without consciousness. And the question is, where is the consciousness from there? It's like, if someone could do that, they'd get a Nobel Prize, you know? RAZ: Right. CHALMERS: So here's the mapping from this circuit to this state of consciousness. But underneath that is always going be the question, why and how does the brain give you consciousness in the first place? (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CHALMERS: Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions. So we may need one or two ideas that initially seem crazy before we can come to grips with consciousness, scientifically. The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental. Physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental building blocks - space and time and mass - and you build up the world from there. Well, I think that's the situation we're in. If you can't explain consciousness in terms of the existing fundamentals - space, time - the natural thing to do is to postulate consciousness itself as something fundamental - a fundamental building block of nature. The second crazy idea is that consciousness might be universal. This view is sometimes called panpsychism - pan, for all - psych, for mind. Every system is conscious. Not just humans, dogs, mice, flies, but even microbes. Even a photon has some degree of consciousness. The idea is not that photons are intelligent or thinking. You know, it's not that a photon is wracked with angst because it's thinking, oh, I'm always buzzing around near the speed of light. I never get to slow down and smell the roses. No, not like that. But the thought is, maybe photons might have some element of raw subjective feeling, some primitive precursor to consciousness. RAZ: So this is a pretty big idea - right? - like, that not just flies, but microbes or photons all have consciousness. And I mean we, like, as humans, we want to believe that our consciousness is what makes us special, right - like, different from anything else. CHALMERS: Well, I would say yes and no. I'd say the fact of consciousness does not make us special. But maybe we've a special type of consciousness 'cause you know, consciousness is not on and off. It comes in all these rich and amazing varieties. There's vision. There's hearing. There's thinking. There's emotion and so on. So our consciousness is far richer, I think, than the consciousness, say, of a mouse or a fly. But if you want to look for what makes us distinct, don't look for just our being conscious, look for the kind of consciousness we have. For example, we're self-conscious. We're conscious of ourselves. That's not something which, probably, an earthworm has. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CHALMERS: It's also natural to ask about consciousness in other systems, like computers. What about the artificially intelligent system in the movie, \"Her,\" Samantha? Is she conscious? Well, if you take the informational panpsychist's view, she certainly has complicated information processing and integration, so the answer is very likely yes, she is conscious. If that's right, it raises pretty serious ethical issues about both the ethics of developing intelligent computer systems and the ethics of turning them off. Finally, you might ask about the consciousness of whole groups. The planet, or at a more local level, there's an integrated group, like the audience at a TED conference. Are we, right now, having a collective consciousness, an inner movie for this TED group, which is distinct from the inner movies of each of our parts? I don't know the answer to that question, but I think it's at least one worth taking seriously. RAZ: So if consciousness could be collective, I mean, couldn't it mean that it might not live in the brain? CHALMERS: Yeah, it's a tricky question. I mean, I think you could say that, you know, if consciousness, for example, is a universal - if it attaches to particles - then, you know, when an electron has consciousness, the consciousness is somehow attached to that particle. It's not like it's somewhere else. I sometimes get attracted by the idea that, you know, consciousness is like what the thing is like on the inside. RAZ: Yeah. CHALMERS: Physics studies all this stuff from the outside - their interactions with each other, their relations to each other. But they've got to have an intrinsic nature. It's got to be something, and physics doesn't tell us about that. Maybe that's consciousness, and maybe when we're introspecting our own consciousness, this is actually getting some insight into the intrinsic nature of the matter inside our brains. RAZ: Is this the biggest mystery of the brain? CHALMERS: I think it's the biggest mystery in the universe, if you ask me. But it's certainly the biggest mystery of the brain. Where does consciousness come from? Nobody knows. Nobody understands it. You know, I mean, a few hundred years ago, we were there with, like, you know, space and time. What on earth are they? Where do they come from? Now we understand those pretty well. And we're filling in the scientific picture of the world pretty well at some level, but then consciousness just sticks out like a sore thumb. No one's got a good theory of it. It makes you say, you know, is it just the brain, or is there something more? RAZ: David Chalmers teaches philosophy at New York University. You can hear his entire talk at ted. com.

The second crazy idea is that consciousness might be universal. This view is sometimes called panpsychism - pan, for all - psych, for mind. Every system is conscious. Not just humans, dogs, mice, flies, but even microbes. Even a photon has some degree of consciousness. The idea is not that photons are intelligent or thinking. You know, it's not that a photon is wracked with angst because it's thinking, oh, I'm always buzzing around near the speed of light. I never get to slow down and smell the roses. No, not like that. But the thought is, maybe photons might have some element of raw subjective feeling, some primitive precursor to consciousness. RAZ: So this is a pretty big idea - right? - like, that not just flies, but microbes or photons all have consciousness. And I mean we, like, as humans, we want to believe that our consciousness is what makes us special, right - like, different from anything else. CHALMERS: Well, I would say yes and no. I'd say the fact of consciousness does not make us special. But maybe we've a special type of consciousness 'cause you know, consciousness is not on and off. It comes in all these rich and amazing varieties. There's vision. There's hearing. There's thinking. There's emotion and so on. So our consciousness is far richer, I think, than the consciousness, say, of a mouse or a fly. But if you want to look for what makes us distinct, don't look for just our being conscious, look for the kind of consciousness we have. For example, we're self-conscious. We're conscious of ourselves. That's not something which, probably, an earthworm has. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) CHALMERS: It's also natural to ask about consciousness in other systems, like computers. What about the artificially intelligent system in the movie, \"Her,\" Samantha? Is she conscious? Well, if you take the informational panpsychist's view, she certainly has complicated information processing and integration, so the answer is very likely yes, she is conscious. If that's right, it raises pretty serious ethical issues about both the ethics of developing intelligent computer systems and the ethics of turning them off. Finally, you might ask about the consciousness of whole groups. The planet, or at a more local level, there's an integrated group, like the audience at a TED conference. Are we, right now, having a collective consciousness, an inner movie for this TED group, which is distinct from the inner movies of each of our parts? I don't know the answer to that question, but I think it's at least one worth taking seriously. RAZ: So if consciousness could be collective, I mean, couldn't it mean that it might not live in the brain? CHALMERS: Yeah, it's a tricky question. I mean, I think you could say that, you know, if consciousness, for example, is a universal - if it attaches to particles - then, you know, when an electron has consciousness, the consciousness is somehow attached to that particle. It's not like it's somewhere else. I sometimes get attracted by the idea that, you know, consciousness is like what the thing is like on the inside. RAZ: Yeah. CHALMERS: Physics studies all this stuff from the outside - their interactions with each other, their relations to each other. But they've got to have an intrinsic nature. It's got to be something, and physics doesn't tell us about that. Maybe that's consciousness, and maybe when we're introspecting our own consciousness, this is actually getting some insight into the intrinsic nature of the matter inside our brains. RAZ: Is this the biggest mystery of the brain? CHALMERS: I think it's the biggest mystery in the universe, if you ask me. But it's certainly the biggest mystery of the brain. Where does consciousness come from? Nobody knows. Nobody understands it. You know, I mean, a few hundred years ago, we were there with, like, you know, space and time. What on earth are they? Where do they come from? Now we understand those pretty well. And we're filling in the scientific picture of the world pretty well at some level, but then consciousness just sticks out like a sore thumb. No one's got a good theory of it. It makes you say, you know, is it just the brain, or is there something more? RAZ: David Chalmers teaches philosophy at New York University. You can hear his entire talk at ted. com.

But until pretty recently, scientists weren't really sure how those neurons worked together. Was the brain like a utility knife, one tool that did many different things? Or was it more like a Swiss Army knife with specific mechanisms for specific tasks? So take one specific task, for example, one that your brain performs pretty much every single day - and that is recognizing someone else's face. NANCY KANWISHER: Well, there's a bunch of different things that happen when you see a face. RAZ: This is Nancy Kanwisher. KANWISHER: I'm a cognitive neuroscientist at MIT. RAZ: And just think, she says, about all the different variables your brain has to grapple with when you look at another person. KANWISHER: Right, like, every time you see a person, they look different, from different viewpoints - a profile and a front view are totally different - from the way their hair falls on their face, the expression on their face, the lighting. RAZ: What about, you know, like when you see a face and you know it but you can't place it? KANWISHER: Right, you get a signal like, I know that person. RAZ: Yeah. KANWISHER: But that's a different thing than which particular person is it in terms of, what else do I know about them; where did I meet them? And that in turn is a different thing than what is their name. RAZ: And the thing is, it's possible for your brain to get hung up anywhere along that chain. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Just look at my face and tell me what happens when I do this, all right? RAZ: So this is a video that Nancy pointed us to. . . KANWISHER: An incredible video. RAZ: . . . That was made by some colleagues of hers. KANWISHER: Josef Parvizi and Kalanit Grill-Spector. RAZ: Two neurologists who were treating a man with epilepsy. And they wanted to find the source of his seizures, so they placed electrodes on the surface of his brain. But by chance, what they found was a pulse from those electrodes. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Nothing. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Nothing. RAZ: . . . In just the right place. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: OK. RAZ: . . . Had an unintended effect on their patient. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: I'm going to do it one more time. KANWISHER: And the guy was looking at the surgeon when they stimulated that region. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Look at my face. One, two, three. KANWISHER: And he said. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: You just turned in to somebody else. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: The doctor's face instantly became unrecognizable. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Your nose got saggy, went to the left. You almost like somebody I had seen before, but somebody different. That was a trip. RAZ: The effect of that pulse had accidentally recreated a condition that actually exists in real life, a condition where you can't remember faces. It's called face blindness. . . KANWISHER: That's right. RAZ: . . . Or prosopagnosia. KANWISHER: So prosopagnosia, which has been known for a long time, is that people can selectively lose their ability to recognize faces. RAZ: How does that happen? KANWISHER: They have brain damage usually from a stroke or from a - you know, a physical injury to the brain. And if it's very, very focal in just a tiny part of the brain, then you are perfectly normal at absolutely everything else, but you can't recognize faces. RAZ: Which raised a big question for Nancy and her colleagues at MIT. Here's her TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KANWISHER: We wanted to know if there was a special part of the brain for recognizing faces. So I was the first subject. I went into the scanner. I lay on my back. I held my head as still as I could while staring at pictures of faces and objects and faces and objects for hours. So as somebody who has pretty close to the world record of total number of hours spent inside an MRI scanner, I can tell you that one of the skills that's important for MRI research is bladder control. (LAUGHTER)KANWISHER: When I got out of the scanner, I did a quick analysis of the data, looking for any parts of my brain that produced a higher response when I was looking at faces than when I was looking at objects. And here's what I saw. That region right there, that little blob, it's about the size of an olive, and it's on the bottom surface of my brain about an inch straight in, OK? And what that part of my brain is doing is producing a higher MRI response, that is higher neural activity, when I was looking at faces than when I was looking at objects. So that's pretty cool. But how do we know this isn't a fluke? Well, the easiest way is to just do the experiment again. RAZ: So you have your brain scanned, and then, like, the part that's responding to facial recognition is, like, lighting up. And you do this, like, several, several. . . KANWISHER: Oh, I've done it hundreds of times. I like it in there. (Laughter). RAZ: What's it like? KANWISHER: Oh, it's peaceful. I go in there, and I think, oh, we're going to get this great data. I have these wonderful students. I can't wait to see what my brain is doing when I do this task, so let's find the face region. And we found it right away. I remember I was just so excited. I remember like a week later it was like, oh, let's try it again. I can remember running out to this - we have this computer right outside the scanner. I was, like, do a quick analysis. I was like, oh, it's not going to still be there. It's not going to still be there. Oh, there it is. RAZ: Wow. KANWISHER: We did that, like, 10 times before we kind of really believed that the thing was for real. RAZ: Like, when we talk about regions of the brain that light up. . . KANWISHER: Yeah. RAZ: . . . We're still talking about an area that encompasses billions and billions of neurons and trillions of synaptic connections, right? KANWISHER: That's right. So the smallest unit in my data is usually called a voxel. It's like a three-dimensional pixel. It's a teeny, little cube that's 2 or 3 millimeters on a side. And so it's either - you know, it has some magnitude of response, some brightness, that's our basic unit. But that teeny, little voxel has half a million neurons in it. RAZ: Wow. KANWISHER: So that just tells you a lot of the stuff we can't see. We see this just drastically blurred version of the actual neural code. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Now, to try and get a better grasp of what that blurry image means, Nancy and other scientists are asking why is it that some tasks don't seem to have their own special real estate in the brain when other tasks, like recognizing faces or processing colors or even identifying body parts, do? (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KANWISHER: Do we also have specialized brain regions for other senses, like hearing? Yes, we do. Here's a region that we reported just a couple of months ago, and this region responds strongly when you hear sounds with pitch, like these. . . (SOUNDBITE MONTAGE OF SOUNDS)KANWISHER: OK. In contrast, that same region does not respond strongly when you hear perfectly familiar sounds that don't have a clear pitch, like these. . . (SOUNDBITE MONTAGE OF SOUNDS)KANWISHER: OK. What's important to me about this work is not the particular locations of these brain regions, but the simple fact that we have selective, specific components of mind and brain in the first place. I mean, it could have been otherwise. The brain could have been a single general-purpose processor, more like a kitchen life than a Swiss Army knife. Instead, what brain imaging has delivered is this rich and interesting picture of the human mind. It's early days in this enterprise. The most fundamental questions remain unanswered. How are all these things connected in the brain? How does all of this very systematic structure get built, both over development in childhood and over the evolution of our species? This is, I think, the greatest scientific quest of all time. RAZ: I mean, there's some process that is happening right now as I'm speaking to you and you're speaking to me and we're stringing these words together and having a conversation. And it's just. . . KANWISHER: It's the damnedest thing, isn't it? RAZ: Yeah. KANWISHER: Yeah. I mean, that whole question of how you take a thought and a bunch of sounds come out your mouth. . . RAZ: Right. KANWISHER: Like, what? RAZ: Yeah. KANWISHER: How does that ever happen? RAZ: How does it happen? KANWISHER: Well, I think we want to know these things to know who we are. That's why I work in this field, is I want to know who we are. And I think modern human cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience are starting to give us an answer to that, at least who we are as thinkers. And who we are as thinkers is these machines that have a bunch of highly specialized components, some very general-purpose machinery. And now we're starting to know what those components are, which each one does. Like, that's the beginning of a depiction of what a human mind is. I think that's an incredibly exciting thing to have.

I'm Guy Raz, and on the show today, The Unknown Brain, the mystery of how billions of neurons make us who we are. And the one brain that you think you might know, your own, that might be the biggest mystery of all. Could you ever have imagined that your brain would be the one that would kind of define your life and your career? JILL BOLTE-TAYLOR: (Laughter). No. RAZ: This is Dr. Jill Bolte-Taylor. BOLTE-TAYLOR: I'm a trained neuroanatomist. RAZ: And about 20 years ago, Jill was doing lab work at Harvard. She had been researching other people's brains for years, particularly brains with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, brains that just didn't seem to function properly. And she was widely recognized as a rising star in the field. But then, one morning - it was the morning of December 10, 1996 - something happened to Jill's own brain. BOLTE-TAYLOR: Once I awoke, I could not walk, talk, read, write. I could not recall any of the details of my life. (SOUNDBITE OF AMBULANCE SIREN)BOLTE-TAYLOR: Jill Bolte-Taylor died that day. (SOUNDBITE OF AMBULANCE SIREN)RAZ: Jill was having a massive stroke on the left side of her brain. And soon, she'd be rushed to the emergency room. Jill told the story on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BOLTE-TAYLOR: I'm riding in an ambulance across Boston to Mass. General Hospital. And I curl up into a little fetal ball. And just like a balloon with the last, last bit of air just (exhaling) right out of the balloon, I just felt my energy lift. And just - I felt my spirit surrender. And in that moment, I knew that I was no longer the choreographer of my life. And either the doctors rescue my body and give me a second chance at life, or this was perhaps my moment of transition. RAZ: Jill's stroke wiped out almost everything she could do and who she was. As she later wrote in her book, in an instant, she became a woman trapped inside the body of an infant. And yet, today. . . BOLTE-TAYLOR: If I could go back to that day and have the stroke or not have the stroke, I am so grateful that I had the stroke experience. RAZ: The thing is, on that morning of the stroke, even though she was a brain scientist at Harvard, Jill, at least initially, didn't know what was happening to her. BOLTE-TAYLOR: I woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eye. And it was the kind of pain, caustic pain, that you get when you bite into ice cream. And it just gripped me. And then it released me. And then it just gripped me. And then it released me. And it was very unusual for me to ever experience any kind of pain. So I thought, OK, I'll just start my normal routine. So I got up, and I jumped onto my cardio glider, which is a full-body, full-exercise machine. (LAUGHTER)BOLTE-TAYLOR: And I'm jamming away on this thing. And I'm realizing that my hands look like primitive claws grasping onto the bar. And I thought, that's very peculiar. And I looked down at my body and I thought, whoa, I am a weird-looking thing. And it was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal perception of reality, where I'm the person on the machine having the experience, to some esoteric space where I'm witnessing myself having this experience. And it was all very peculiar, and my headache was just getting worse. So I get off the machine. And I'm walking across my living room floor. And I realize that everything inside of my body has slowed way down. And every step is very rigid. There's no fluidity to my pace. And there's this constriction in my area perception. So I'm just focused on internal systems. And I'm standing in my bathroom, getting ready to step into the shower. And I could actually hear the dialogue inside of my body. I heard a little voice saying, OK, you muscles, you've got to contract. And you muscles, you relax. And then, I lost my balance. And I'm propped up against the wall. And I look down at my arm, and I realize that I can no longer define the boundaries of my body because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall. And all I could detect was this energy, energy. And I'm asking myself, what is wrong with me? What is going on? RAZ: Knowing what you knew about the brain, were you almost, like, mapping it in real time? BOLTE-TAYLOR: Yes, on the morning of the stroke, it was a pure mapping experience. So as soon as I was having a problem with the volume of the way that the water hit the tub and there's this incredible amplification of the sound. . . (SOUNDBITE OF RUNNING WATER)BOLTE-TAYLOR: Well, you know, I immediately have a visualization of the circuit of the sound system in understanding amplification and knowing that I'm passing information through my brain stem. And I'm having problems at that level. And brain stem is the potential for death. This is now a do-or-die situation. So, yes, I'm mapping as I'm losing circuit by circuit. At the same time, I'm going, what is wrong with me - because of course I've never had a stroke before. RAZ: What's amazing to me is - and in some ways what makes it even more terrifying to hear is how. . . BOLTE-TAYLOR: Remarkable, Guy, remarkable - not terrifying, remarkable. RAZ: That's the thing, I mean. . . BOLTE-TAYLOR: (Laughter). RAZ: . . . You, like, the way you describe it is that you had control. Like, you were calm. You were rational. BOLTE-TAYLOR: Well, I didn't know how severe it was. And, you know, people always ask me, was it to your advantage to be a brain scientist or not? And I think that on the morning of the stroke, it may not have been an advantage because I was fascinated instead of panicking. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BOLTE-TAYLOR: So it's like OK, OK. I've got a problem, but then I immediately drifted right back out into the consciousness. And I affectionately refer to this space as Lalaland, but it was beautiful there. Imagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you to the external world. So here I am in this space. And my job and any stress related to my job - it was gone, and I felt lighter in my body. And imagine what it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage. (LAUGHTER)BOLTE-TAYLOR: Oh, I felt euphoria, euphoria. And in that moment my right arm went totally paralyzed by my side. Then I realized, oh, my gosh, I'm having a stroke. I'm having a stroke. And then the next thing my brain says to me is, wow, this is so cool. (LAUGHTER)BOLTE-TAYLOR: This is so cool. How many brain scientists have the opportunity to study their own brain from the inside out? (LAUGHTER)BOLTE-TAYLOR: And then it crosses my mind - but I'm a very busy woman. (LAUGHTER)BOLTE-TAYLOR: I don't have time for a stroke. (SOUNDBITE OF AMBULANCE SIREN)RAZ: Jill of course didn't really have a choice. She was rushed to surgery. The doctors took a blood clot the size of a golf ball out of her brain. And when she woke up, it was as if her brain was like a computer that was booting up for the first time. BOLTE-TAYLOR: For example, my mother would ask me what I wanted for lunch, and it was file opening time. She would say, you know, do you want to have a peanut butter sandwich? And I'd go hunting, you know, where's peanut butter? Is there a file in my brain that understands peanut butter? And if there was, then I would say OK. And then she would say how about tuna fish? And I'd go hunting for the file in my brain that understood what tuna fish was. And as soon as we hit a file that I couldn't go in and hunt for and find some kind of association to, then we would relive that. So then she would give me tuna fish so that I would have that experience. And I had to learn everything. We didn't know if I would have language again because of where the hemorrhage had happened, this blood clot that was pushing on the fibers running between my ability to create sound - create language - as well as to place meaning on language. But I had to learn vocabulary from the beginning. I had to learn what emotions were. I had to be able to describe to my mother what I was feeling inside of my body. It took her constant care and, boy, it took a lot of sleep, and that was key for my healing. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: It took eight long years of rehabilitation before Jill felt anything like the person she'd been before. And by the end of it, she realized her stroke taught her more about the brain than years of research in her lab at Harvard, and not just about its resilience, but about how our brain makes us who we are in ways we might never fully understand. Are you a different person? Like, are you the same person you were before December 10, 1996? BOLTE-TAYLOR: I'm - OK, so the way I look at this is a new character has come online. My color scheme that I like to dress in is different. Before, you would look in my closet and all you would see is red, white and black - stripes, polka dots, any version. But it would be red, white and black because every day I would get up and I would want to wear red, white or black, so why even keep the other stuff in the closet? Today I'm sitting here. I'm in blue jeans, which I never wore before. I always wore corduroys, and now I'm in fluorescent green. I love the florescent colors. RAZ: (Laughter). BOLTE-TAYLOR: So this never would have happened with that other character. So, no, I see myself as a very different person with a very different value structure than I had before. And there was a lot of pain in my past that got relieved. And wasn't that a lovely thing to be able to hit the reset button on my emotional circuitry so that I'm then capable of functioning fresh and new without any antagonism towards anybody? I didn't know if there was anybody I was supposed be mad at because it was all gone. RAZ: So you said earlier that you were grateful for your stroke? BOLTE-TAYLOR: Yeah. You know, there are hundreds, thousands of scientists who can do the work that I was doing in the lab, but for me to be able to have this internal experience of watching my own brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information and then to go through the experience of surgery and recovery has given me such an insight into my own workings of my brain, and fortunately an insight into what does it take in order for a person to actually recover from a brain trauma? Now we understand that there is neurogenesis. We do grow some new neurons. We know that there is neuroplasticity. People are capable of recovering from brain trauma. And that's a completely different perspective than 15 years ago. RAZ: Jill Bolte-Taylor. Her book about all this is called \"My Stroke Of Insight. \" You can see her full talk, one of the most popular ever, at ted. com. On the show today, The Unknown Brain. RAZ: Are there mysteries of the brain that are better left unsolved? BOLTE-TAYLOR: I don't think so. RAZ: Stay with us. I'm Guy Raz. And this is the TED Radio Hour from NPR. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz, and on the show today, The Unknown Brain, the mystery of how billions of neurons make us who we are. And the one brain that you think you might know, your own, that might be the biggest mystery of all. Could you ever have imagined that your brain would be the one that would kind of define your life and your career? JILL BOLTE-TAYLOR: (Laughter). No. RAZ: This is Dr. Jill Bolte-Taylor. BOLTE-TAYLOR: I'm a trained neuroanatomist. RAZ: And about 20 years ago, Jill was doing lab work at Harvard. She had been researching other people's brains for years, particularly brains with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, brains that just didn't seem to function properly. And she was widely recognized as a rising star in the field. But then, one morning - it was the morning of December 10, 1996 - something happened to Jill's own brain. BOLTE-TAYLOR: Once I awoke, I could not walk, talk, read, write. I could not recall any of the details of my life. (SOUNDBITE OF AMBULANCE SIREN) BOLTE-TAYLOR: Jill Bolte-Taylor died that day. (SOUNDBITE OF AMBULANCE SIREN) RAZ: Jill was having a massive stroke on the left side of her brain. And soon, she'd be rushed to the emergency room. Jill told the story on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) BOLTE-TAYLOR: I'm riding in an ambulance across Boston to Mass. General Hospital. And I curl up into a little fetal ball. And just like a balloon with the last, last bit of air just (exhaling) right out of the balloon, I just felt my energy lift. And just - I felt my spirit surrender. And in that moment, I knew that I was no longer the choreographer of my life. And either the doctors rescue my body and give me a second chance at life, or this was perhaps my moment of transition. RAZ: Jill's stroke wiped out almost everything she could do and who she was. As she later wrote in her book, in an instant, she became a woman trapped inside the body of an infant. And yet, today. . . BOLTE-TAYLOR: If I could go back to that day and have the stroke or not have the stroke, I am so grateful that I had the stroke experience. RAZ: The thing is, on that morning of the stroke, even though she was a brain scientist at Harvard, Jill, at least initially, didn't know what was happening to her. BOLTE-TAYLOR: I woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eye. And it was the kind of pain, caustic pain, that you get when you bite into ice cream. And it just gripped me. And then it released me. And then it just gripped me. And then it released me. And it was very unusual for me to ever experience any kind of pain. So I thought, OK, I'll just start my normal routine. So I got up, and I jumped onto my cardio glider, which is a full-body, full-exercise machine. (LAUGHTER) BOLTE-TAYLOR: And I'm jamming away on this thing. And I'm realizing that my hands look like primitive claws grasping onto the bar. And I thought, that's very peculiar. And I looked down at my body and I thought, whoa, I am a weird-looking thing. And it was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal perception of reality, where I'm the person on the machine having the experience, to some esoteric space where I'm witnessing myself having this experience. And it was all very peculiar, and my headache was just getting worse. So I get off the machine. And I'm walking across my living room floor. And I realize that everything inside of my body has slowed way down. And every step is very rigid. There's no fluidity to my pace. And there's this constriction in my area perception. So I'm just focused on internal systems. And I'm standing in my bathroom, getting ready to step into the shower. And I could actually hear the dialogue inside of my body. I heard a little voice saying, OK, you muscles, you've got to contract. And you muscles, you relax. And then, I lost my balance. And I'm propped up against the wall. And I look down at my arm, and I realize that I can no longer define the boundaries of my body because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall. And all I could detect was this energy, energy. And I'm asking myself, what is wrong with me? What is going on? RAZ: Knowing what you knew about the brain, were you almost, like, mapping it in real time? BOLTE-TAYLOR: Yes, on the morning of the stroke, it was a pure mapping experience. So as soon as I was having a problem with the volume of the way that the water hit the tub and there's this incredible amplification of the sound. . . (SOUNDBITE OF RUNNING WATER) BOLTE-TAYLOR: Well, you know, I immediately have a visualization of the circuit of the sound system in understanding amplification and knowing that I'm passing information through my brain stem. And I'm having problems at that level. And brain stem is the potential for death. This is now a do-or-die situation. So, yes, I'm mapping as I'm losing circuit by circuit. At the same time, I'm going, what is wrong with me - because of course I've never had a stroke before. RAZ: What's amazing to me is - and in some ways what makes it even more terrifying to hear is how. . . BOLTE-TAYLOR: Remarkable, Guy, remarkable - not terrifying, remarkable. RAZ: That's the thing, I mean. . . BOLTE-TAYLOR: (Laughter). RAZ: . . . You, like, the way you describe it is that you had control. Like, you were calm. You were rational. BOLTE-TAYLOR: Well, I didn't know how severe it was. And, you know, people always ask me, was it to your advantage to be a brain scientist or not? And I think that on the morning of the stroke, it may not have been an advantage because I was fascinated instead of panicking. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) BOLTE-TAYLOR: So it's like OK, OK. I've got a problem, but then I immediately drifted right back out into the consciousness. And I affectionately refer to this space as Lalaland, but it was beautiful there. Imagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you to the external world. So here I am in this space. And my job and any stress related to my job - it was gone, and I felt lighter in my body. And imagine what it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage. (LAUGHTER) BOLTE-TAYLOR: Oh, I felt euphoria, euphoria. And in that moment my right arm went totally paralyzed by my side. Then I realized, oh, my gosh, I'm having a stroke. I'm having a stroke. And then the next thing my brain says to me is, wow, this is so cool. (LAUGHTER) BOLTE-TAYLOR: This is so cool.

I'm Guy Raz. And today on the show, we're asking. . . REBECCA SAXE: How patterns of electrical pulses passing between cells in an organ in your body can be thought. RAZ: Or, you know, how does the brain work, make us who we are? SAXE: (Laughter). RAZ: An almost impossible question maybe, but one that totally. . . SAXE: Totally. RAZ: . . . Excites Rebecca Saxe. SAXE: Could you think of anything better? RAZ: Rebecca is a neuroscientist at MIT. She's actually worked with Nancy Kanwisher there, who we just heard from. But while Nancy studies how the brain recognizes faces. . . SAXE: I study, how does the brain figure out what somebody else is thinking? RAZ: So how does it happen? SAXE: (Laughter). Well, here's one way of thinking about it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SAXE: You're watching \"Romeo And Juliet. \"RAZ: OK. SAXE: And you see Juliet wakes up. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS: (As Juliet) Oh, comfortable friar. SAXE: She can't see Romeo yet. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS: (As Juliet) Where is my lord? SAXE: So right now, what's going on in her mind? She knows that she's in a mausoleum. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS: (As Juliet) I do remember well where I should be, and there I am. SAXE: She knows she's not dead, but that everybody thinks she's dead. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS: (As Juliet) Where is my Romeo? SAXE: And right now what she thinks is everything's worked out. The whole plan has worked. RAZ: Yeah. SAXE: So now imagine you're in the audience watching that, and you see Juliet. You know what she's thinking - everything's going to be fine. I get to marry Romeo and run away, and it all worked. But you also know that she's totally devastatingly wrong. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Friar Lawrence) Lady, come from this nest of death, contagion and unnatural sleep. SAXE: Romeo is already dead. It's already too late. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Friar Lawrence) Come, come away. Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead. SAXE: So huge parts of your brain are devoted to solving just those problems - knowing where the girl is, knowing what words she's saying, knowing what those sentences mean. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS: (As Juliet) Cup closed in my true love's hand? Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end. SAXE: But all of that gets processed and processed through many, many, many different brain regions until you distill it down to this one more complicated problem, above and beyond the words and the images, is the set of meanings that are about her thoughts and feelings. So how does the brain do that? RAZ: Yeah? SAXE: Fifteen years ago, when I started in this field, it wasn't clear you could ask that question as a scientist and that, to me, that's kind of the miraculous thing. It's not that there is an answer, it's that the very limited tools we have now for studying the brain are enough to let us make a little bit of progress. RAZ: And Rebecca is slowly making progress on the central question of her work - how can one brain know another? Here she is on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SAXE: And put another way, the crux of the problem is the machine that we use for thinking about other minds, our brain, is made up of pieces, brain cells, that we share with all other animals, with monkeys and mice and even sea slugs. And yet, you put them together in a particular network and what you get is the capacity to write \"Romeo And Juliet. \" Or to say as Alan Greenspan did, I know you think you understand what you thought I said, but I'm not sure you realize that what you heard is not what I meant. (LAUGHTER)SAXE: So first, the first thing I want to tell you is that there's a brain region in the human brain, in your brains, whose job it is to think about other people's thoughts. It's called the right temporoparietal junction. It' above and behind your right ear, and you don't use it for solving any other kinds of logical problems. The second thing I want to say about this brain system is that although we human adults are really good at understanding other minds, we weren't always that way. It takes children a long time to break into this system, and I'm going to show you a little bit of that long, extended process. The first thing I'm going to show you is a change between age 3 and 5, as kids learn to understand that somebody else can have beliefs that are different from their own. So I'm going to show you a 5-year-old who's getting a standard kind of puzzle that we call the false belief task. RAZ: The false belief task is a way of measuring how well a child can think about someone else's thoughts. Rebecca showed us a video of the task, which involves a 5-year-old and a puppet show starring two pirates. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)SAXE: This is the first pirate. His name is Ivan. And you know what pirates really like? UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: What? SAXE: Pirates really like cheese sandwiches. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Cheese? I love cheese. SAXE: Yeah. RAZ: Oh, yes. SAXE: Yeah, all pirates love cheese sandwiches. RAZ: Yes. SAXE: (Laughter). So. . . RAZ: Anyway, here's what's happening. The first pirate, Ivan, puts his cheese sandwich down on a treasure chest. But then he realizes he forgot his drink to go with the sandwich. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)SAXE: And so Ivan goes to get a drink. And while Ivan is away, the wind comes (imitates wind), and it blows the sandwich down onto the grass. And now here comes the other pirate. This pirate is called Joshua. See? And Joshua also really loves cheese sandwiches. RAZ: OK. So then Joshua, the second pirate, he also has a cheese sandwich - his own sandwich. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)SAXE: And he says, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum. I love cheese sandwiches. RAZ: But he puts his down on the treasure chest as well. SAXE: So now we have two cheese sandwiches. Ivan's, which is now on the ground, and Joshua's, which is now sitting on top of the treasure chest. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: So that one is his. SAXE: That one's Joshua's. That's right. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: And then his went on the ground. SAXE: Yeah, that's exactly right. Now. . . UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: So he won't know which one is his. RAZ: And then. . . SAXE: The key thing that happens is. RAZ: . . . The first pirate. . . SAXE: Actually I can't remember who's the first pirate. Is the first one Ivan? RAZ: I think Ivan. . . SAXE: Or Joshua? RAZ: I think Ivan's the first one. SAXE: (Laughter). Sorry. RAZ: Ivan is the first one, yes. Ivan, the first pirate, he comes back. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)SAXE: And he says, I want my cheese sandwich. So which one do you think Ivan's going to take? UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: I think he's going to take that one. SAXE: Yeah, you think he's going to take that one? All right, let's see. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: I told you. SAXE: Oh, yeah. You we're right. He took that one. RAZ: Ivan, of course, takes the clean sandwich on the chest 'cause that's where he left it. SAXE: That's what he thinks. RAZ: That's what he thinks. SAXE: Right. RAZ: And that's the conclusion you'd reach if you're 5 or 10 or 50. SAXE: But a 3-year-old can't quite work that out. RAZ: In fact, if you are 3, you fail this test. SAXE: Yeah. RAZ: Because you can't quite understand what the first pirate was thinking. SAXE: Can't work out that he could have beliefs different from reality. RAZ: Your average 3-year-old can't quite process the idea that another person can think different thoughts, but a 5-year-old can. And although we know that something happens between the ages of 3 and 5 in that little patch of brain that Rebecca studies, we still don't know what. SAXE: That little patch of brain is made up of millions of neurons. But it's like if you were looking down at Iowa from an airliner. There's all these fields. And inside the fields are plants. And the individual plants are growing their individual ears of corn. Well, you can't see the ears of corn. You can't see the plants. But you can see the fields. And you can see that some of the fields are a little brighter green and some of them are a little darker green. So we're looking at the brain from an airliner, and we can see the difference that in some kids, you can see - OK, bright patch over there, darker patch over there. And in other kids, it's pretty much all the same color all over the fields. RAZ: And so the challenge of modern neuroscience is to try and figure out how we can see the kernels of corn in those fields, not just the colors they add up to. But Rebecca says even knowing where those fields are, that's a huge leap forward in what we know about the brain. SAXE: Yeah, because this science is so hard. Most ideas don't work for a million reasons, that when you have a theory and a prediction and a method and you think, if I'm on to something, I know what to expect here, and that happens, that's kind of amazing. RAZ: Rebecca Saxe runs Saxelab. It's a neuroscience lab at MIT. Her full talk is at ted. com. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And today on the show, we're asking. . .

(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) SAXE: And he says, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum. I love cheese sandwiches. RAZ: But he puts his down on the treasure chest as well. SAXE: So now we have two cheese sandwiches. Ivan's, which is now on the ground, and Joshua's, which is now sitting on top of the treasure chest. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: So that one is his. SAXE: That one's Joshua's. That's right. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: And then his went on the ground. SAXE: Yeah, that's exactly right. Now. . . UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: So he won't know which one is his. RAZ: And then. . . SAXE: The key thing that happens is. RAZ: . . . The first pirate. . . SAXE: Actually I can't remember who's the first pirate. Is the first one Ivan? RAZ: I think Ivan. . . SAXE: Or Joshua? RAZ: I think Ivan's the first one. SAXE: (Laughter). Sorry. RAZ: Ivan is the first one, yes. Ivan, the first pirate, he comes back. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) SAXE: And he says, I want my cheese sandwich. So which one do you think Ivan's going to take? UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: I think he's going to take that one. SAXE: Yeah, you think he's going to take that one? All right, let's see. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: I told you. SAXE: Oh, yeah. You we're right. He took that one. RAZ: Ivan, of course, takes the clean sandwich on the chest 'cause that's where he left it. SAXE: That's what he thinks. RAZ: That's what he thinks. SAXE: Right. RAZ: And that's the conclusion you'd reach if you're 5 or 10 or 50. SAXE: But a 3-year-old can't quite work that out. RAZ: In fact, if you are 3, you fail this test. SAXE: Yeah. RAZ: Because you can't quite understand what the first pirate was thinking. SAXE: Can't work out that he could have beliefs different from reality. RAZ: Your average 3-year-old can't quite process the idea that another person can think different thoughts, but a 5-year-old can. And although we know that something happens between the ages of 3 and 5 in that little patch of brain that Rebecca studies, we still don't know what. SAXE: That little patch of brain is made up of millions of neurons. But it's like if you were looking down at Iowa from an airliner. There's all these fields. And inside the fields are plants. And the individual plants are growing their individual ears of corn. Well, you can't see the ears of corn. You can't see the plants. But you can see the fields. And you can see that some of the fields are a little brighter green and some of them are a little darker green. So we're looking at the brain from an airliner, and we can see the difference that in some kids, you can see - OK, bright patch over there, darker patch over there. And in other kids, it's pretty much all the same color all over the fields. RAZ: And so the challenge of modern neuroscience is to try and figure out how we can see the kernels of corn in those fields, not just the colors they add up to. But Rebecca says even knowing where those fields are, that's a huge leap forward in what we know about the brain. SAXE: Yeah, because this science is so hard. Most ideas don't work for a million reasons, that when you have a theory and a prediction and a method and you think, if I'm on to something, I know what to expect here, and that happens, that's kind of amazing.

Planetary scientist Jim Bell takes us through the amazing human stories behind the 40-year history of the Voyager spacecraft mission in his book \"The Interstellar Age. \" I asked him to rank the Voyager missions in terms of the history of human exploration. JIM BELL: Oh my gosh, that's - Voyagers are one of the grandest, most remarkable, incredible voyages of exploration that humans have ever taken. It just so happens that we're taking that voyage through the eyes of robotic travelers. RATH: And this is a story about those robotic voyagers. But in many ways it's also a personal memoir. Your own life is intertwined with the robots. BELL: It is. Voyagers were launched in 1977. I was born in '65. And I remember learning about them and hearing about their launches and seeing them pass Jupiter and Saturn in '79 and '80. My entrance into planetary science, which is my career now, came through getting involved with the Voyager missions as an undergraduate and a graduate student. RATH: You described it as being almost brilliant divine luck. BELL: It really was. You know, we have to remember that back in those days, you know, there was no Internet. And so in order to see what was happening, you know, you had to be there. And there was the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. And I was an undergraduate at Cal Tech, also in Pasadena, and was working for just an amazing guy named Ed Danielson, who was part of the Voyager camera team. He arranged to get me into the room where all of this action was happening, where all of these pictures were coming down in real time. And there was nowhere like that on the planet. RATH: There are these scenes in those rooms, which are just kind of amazing, where you're receiving new information about the freaking cosmos, and you're getting it before anybody else. It's just, like, coming into you. BELL: Yeah, and they were very stressful times and stressful places because, you know, the Voyagers were flyby spacecraft. They're not - they're not orbiters or rovers. They can't redo something, so you only get one shot. You know, if you didn't set the exposure level right on the camera, too bad. And so that stress was tangible. RATH: Jim, I still have some of my old kids' science books from the - going back to the early '70s. And they're shocking to look at now. There're no decent pictures of anything much farther than our own moon, and so much that's just wrong. Can you give us a sense of how much the Voyager missions increased our knowledge of our own solar system? BELL: You know, the Voyagers have literally changed the textbooks. All of these spectacular pictures that we've seen - the Great Red Spot of Jupiter, the rings of Saturn view from behind Saturn - none of that was known. They were all points of light, even in the world's largest telescopes before the 1980s. So all of a sudden - and we really felt this - we were going to transition for the first time to see these places as worlds of their own - not just dots up in the sky, but as real worlds with geology and atmospheres and histories. And as my calling colleague Larry Soderblom, who I quote in the book said, you know, you can only discover the solar system for the first time once. And that's what Voyager did. RATH: Now, these Voyager spacecrafts, they have certainly accomplished enough in terms of what they've told us about our solar system. But the mission has now shifted. It's now the Voyager Interstellar Mission. Can you tell us about the moment when you realized Voyager may have left the solar system? BELL: Yeah, that's right. Voyager 1 and 2 are now more than 10 billion - with a B - miles away from the Earth. And they're traveling at about 10 miles per second, about 38,000 miles per hour. They're the fastest things humans have ever sent anywhere. And you could try to imagine one of the spacecrafts passing through your neighborhood at 10 miles per second. RATH: Right. BELL: Wow, that thing is really moving. And yet, at those speeds, it's taken 40 years to get out near the edge of our solar system. In late 2012, the instruments saw this dramatic, sudden change like they popped out of the bubble. And all of a sudden, Voyager 1's in interstellar space. And for the first, we're making measurements and getting scientific data on what it's like between the stars - not close to a star, but between the stars. And we're still in contact with both spacecraft every day, for many hours every day. Voyager 2 is not far behind. It's predicted to pop out of the bubble almost any time. I tried to get Ed Stone to arrange for it to happen right when my book comes out, but it hasn't happened yet. But we'll see. But it's just very exciting to be able to literally enter interstellar space. And along with the spacecrafts, we've all entered the interstellar age because of that - because now we have interstellar travelers.

His new book is called \"The Interstellar Age: Inside The 40 Year Voyager Mission. \" Jim, this is fascinating, such a pleasure speaking with you. Thank you.

What do you smell? Does that smell evoke an emotion or a memory? Our sense of smell is a powerful trigger that captivates both scientists and a burgeoning subculture here in Los Angeles. Reporter Chloe Prasinos takes us inside. CHLOE PRASINOS, BYLINE: Scent Bar in central Los Angeles is home to about 700 niche fragrances - perfumes that you can't find in department stores. It looks more like an art gallery than a pub, but Scent Bar has its regulars, just like any bar. What is your full name? MARK MILLER: Mark \"Fightshark\" Miller. PRASINOS: Yeah, you heard right, Mark \"Fightshark\" Miller. He was a professional mixed martial arts fighter for 22 years. He's covered in tattoos. His nails are painted red and he has a kind of grizzly, weathered air about him. And he loves perfume. MILLER: My collection is ridiculous, yes. PRASINOS: How many bottles? MILLER: Forty or 50. I gave up, you know, drinking and drugs, so I have many other vices now. (Laughter). PRASINOS: Steve Gontarski, the manager of Scent Bar, says that you can't predict who will become obsessed by smell. STEVE GONTARSKI: There are not more women than men. I'd say it's balanced. In fact, the hard-core regulars - we have more men. It's not gay or straight. It's not professional versus working. What unites everyone is this hard-core fascination with scent. PRASINOS: Amanda Wallace comes to Scent Bar a few times a month, which is an expensive habit to have. The average bottle of perfume costs about $150, but they range from $45 and go all the way up to about one grand. AMANDA WALLACE: We spend so much money on this stuff. You know, but it's a great world to be in. It takes me very fun places in my mind. GONTARSKI: It's not functional. It's fantasy. PRASINOS: Gontarski says that when he wears perfume, he feels like a different person. GONTARSKI: I think a good scent transports you. And all the magic is kind of invisible. PRASINOS: Across town, at the Institute for Art and Olfaction, amateur perfumers learn to mix magic themselves. I went to an open session where a few rookie perfumers sat huddled over a long stainless steel table, delicately dipping pipettes into small vials of fragrances, trying to create their own blends. SASKIA WILSON-BROWN: Exactly. So you go like, OK, 10 drops of cactus flower, 3 drops of galbanum. Write it down. That's your recipe. PRASINOS: That's Saskia Wilson-Brown. She opened the Institute for people who wanted to experiment with scent but didn't know where to start. The perfume industry is a difficult one to break into, full of trade secrets and closed doors. Historically, you had to be born into a French perfuming family and deemed a nose in order to work with perfume. But the Institute has an open door policy. WILSON-BROWN: Why shouldn't some kid from East LA have access to these things? It's science and it's our human right to like work with scent. PRASINOS: And she's realized people react to the same scent in very different ways. WILSON-BROWN: There is this sort of personal filter that everyone places on scent that goes through memories, that goes through culture. There's all these filters that people bring to scent that make it very hard to find a common language in perfumery. PRASINOS: When I asked people to describe different perfumes, I got answers like this. WALLACE: It's like when I was a little girl - the bad strawberry candy. DAN: If I smell it, I picture myself in a proper Englishman's adventurers club sitting in a large leather chair. SHELBY JONES: It smells like the garden district in New Orleans after a really heavy rainstorm when everything's kind of a little bit rotting but also a little bit blooming. That's what it smells like. PRASINOS: There's a physiological reason that smells can jog such vivid associations. Avery Gilbert is a smell scientist and author of the book \"What The Nose Knows. \"AVERY GILBERT: Every other sense, the information has to take a detour through the thalamus to reach the cerebral cortex. And smell has a privileged fast lane right to the cortex. PRASINOS: Via this fast lane, smell reaches two centers in the brain that are critical for making memories and emotion - the amygdala and the hippocampus. GILBERT: Right away, even just by the sheer wiring diagram of smell, we're talking about emotion and memory. PRASINOS: You've probably experienced what Gilbert refers to as an odor flashback memory - a stark, detailed memory triggered instantaneously by some unexpected smell. We don't remember smells the way we struggle to memorize a phone number or someone's name. The brain records smell in the background, so to speak. GILBERT: And then years later, when that smell triggers those associations and it pops back up, it seems very magical, because we don't remember trying to remember. PRASINOS: According to Gilbert, olfactory flashbacks are often heavy with emotion, specifically nostalgia. GILBERT: For me once, it was passing a garage that was full of solvents and oils and stuff, and instantly I was transported back to my grandfather's workshop in his garage. And, you know, it was 15 years earlier. It was full of the memories of him, of the mood and everything else. I could remember details in great visual vividness. PRASINOS: But when you smell something that takes you back, the original scent is usually far away. GILBERT: It's either years in the past or miles and miles away. And so a smell brings a kind of wistful absence, even as it evokes this very full memory. PRASINOS: And so the men and women of LA's perfume community are not just eccentrics, indulging in luxury. They're coloring their days with scent, intentionally creating olfactory snapshots of a time and place. For NPR News, I'm Chloe Prasinos. ARUN RATH, HOST:  Take a moment and inhale with me.

The animals have even turned up in New York, Chicago and other cities. Less understood are the coyotes of the American South. A new study across South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama is aimed at helping us understand how coyotes live in the deep South. Grant Blankenship reports from Georgia Public Broadcasting. GRANT BLANKENSHIP, BYLINE: The hunt for coyotes starts in Dan Eaton's truck. Eaton's a pro trapper - has been since he was a kid - long enough to be nonchalant about the dead beaver in the truck bed, which he sometimes uses to attract coyote. We're headed to trap line Eaton has set on private hunting land outside Augusta, Ga. DAN EATON: Everybody wants you to trap coyotes for free until you tell them you're collaring them and letting them go. BLANKENSHIP: Eaton's been releasing coyotes lately to include them in a new University of Georgia study. Biologists want to know how coyotes are thriving in the South and how they are different from those in the West and North. One thing scientists and southern deer hunters already know is that, unlike out west, southern coyotes are deer hunters too. Most landowners don't like to compete. They want the coyotes gone. EATON: I told them after the study I'll come back if they're still on their property and I'll catch those coyotes and take care of them. BLANKENSHIP: We turn off a busy road onto gravel, a field on one side and piney woods on the other. This is the trap line. EATON: Well, Jake, these aren't paying off, buddy. BLANKENSHIP: The first couple of traps are a bust. We drive through a muddy hole and then, success. EATON: Oh, we got a coyote. BLANKENSHIP: The coyote works silently to free herself. The trap holds but doesn't crush her foot. Eaton gets his choke stick ready. You've seen dog catchers use these things. Then Eaton goes to work. He calls to the animal. EATON: Come here, buddy. BLANKENSHIP: Then he zips up her neck with the choke stick, and it's back up the road. WILL GULSBY: So that's actually the collar transmitting to the receiver here. BLANKENSHIP: That's Will Gulsby. He and Michael Chamberlain are the two biologists leading the study. They take blood samples, weigh, measure and fit the coyote with a tracking collar. She's motionless and silent except for her labored breathing. Biologist, Michael Chamberlain. MICHAEL CHAMBERLAIN: They understand that they've been beaten, so they kind of lost the battle. BLANKENSHIP: This coyote is one of about 160 Chamberlain wants for the study, a bit smaller than one in Chicago. CHAMBERLAIN: The idea with this study is to expand it to a much broader landscape. BLANKENSHIP: That broader landscape is a mosaic of agriculture and woods, but little wilderness. GPS collars will let biologists watch for two years as the coyotes either hang around a tiny range or go further away, whether they're hunting alone like they do out west or more like wolves in groups. A third year will be for crunching data. CHAMBERLAIN: There's a lot of uncertainty about how they're interacting with other species. There's a lot of uncertainty about how we will deal with this animal as human beings moving forward. BLANKENSHIP: The trapper and the biologist find the coyote average - adult female, about 30 pounds. CHAMBERLAIN: Pounds. EATON: Thirty-one pounds? Have you checked the frequency already? CHAMBERLAIN: I have. BLANKENSHIP: She's calm as Eaton carries her up the road for release. She finally fights back when her feet hit the ground. Eaton unzips the choke stick. She leaps into the air then sprints back into the woods, stopping about 30 yards away. Michael Chamberlain. CHAMBERLAIN: I've watched them many times. They'll stop and stare back at you and then they'll go about their way. BLANKENSHIP: Then she's gone. If all goes well, researchers will still track her with that GPS collar.

The animals have even turned up in New York, Chicago and other cities. Less understood are the coyotes of the American South. A new study across South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama is aimed at helping us understand how coyotes live in the deep South. Grant Blankenship reports from Georgia Public Broadcasting. GRANT BLANKENSHIP, BYLINE: The hunt for coyotes starts in Dan Eaton's truck. Eaton's a pro trapper - has been since he was a kid - long enough to be nonchalant about the dead beaver in the truck bed, which he sometimes uses to attract coyote. We're headed to trap line Eaton has set on private hunting land outside Augusta, Ga. DAN EATON: Everybody wants you to trap coyotes for free until you tell them you're collaring them and letting them go. BLANKENSHIP: Eaton's been releasing coyotes lately to include them in a new University of Georgia study. Biologists want to know how coyotes are thriving in the South and how they are different from those in the West and North. One thing scientists and southern deer hunters already know is that, unlike out west, southern coyotes are deer hunters too. Most landowners don't like to compete. They want the coyotes gone. EATON: I told them after the study I'll come back if they're still on their property and I'll catch those coyotes and take care of them. BLANKENSHIP: We turn off a busy road onto gravel, a field on one side and piney woods on the other. This is the trap line. EATON: Well, Jake, these aren't paying off, buddy. BLANKENSHIP: The first couple of traps are a bust. We drive through a muddy hole and then, success. EATON: Oh, we got a coyote. BLANKENSHIP: The coyote works silently to free herself. The trap holds but doesn't crush her foot. Eaton gets his choke stick ready. You've seen dog catchers use these things. Then Eaton goes to work. He calls to the animal. EATON: Come here, buddy. BLANKENSHIP: Then he zips up her neck with the choke stick, and it's back up the road. WILL GULSBY: So that's actually the collar transmitting to the receiver here. BLANKENSHIP: That's Will Gulsby. He and Michael Chamberlain are the two biologists leading the study. They take blood samples, weigh, measure and fit the coyote with a tracking collar. She's motionless and silent except for her labored breathing. Biologist, Michael Chamberlain. MICHAEL CHAMBERLAIN: They understand that they've been beaten, so they kind of lost the battle. BLANKENSHIP: This coyote is one of about 160 Chamberlain wants for the study, a bit smaller than one in Chicago. CHAMBERLAIN: The idea with this study is to expand it to a much broader landscape. BLANKENSHIP: That broader landscape is a mosaic of agriculture and woods, but little wilderness. GPS collars will let biologists watch for two years as the coyotes either hang around a tiny range or go further away, whether they're hunting alone like they do out west or more like wolves in groups. A third year will be for crunching data. CHAMBERLAIN: There's a lot of uncertainty about how they're interacting with other species. There's a lot of uncertainty about how we will deal with this animal as human beings moving forward. BLANKENSHIP: The trapper and the biologist find the coyote average - adult female, about 30 pounds. CHAMBERLAIN: Pounds. EATON: Thirty-one pounds? Have you checked the frequency already? CHAMBERLAIN: I have. BLANKENSHIP: She's calm as Eaton carries her up the road for release. She finally fights back when her feet hit the ground. Eaton unzips the choke stick. She leaps into the air then sprints back into the woods, stopping about 30 yards away. Michael Chamberlain. CHAMBERLAIN: I've watched them many times. They'll stop and stare back at you and then they'll go about their way. BLANKENSHIP: Then she's gone. If all goes well, researchers will still track her with that GPS collar.

And that includes news about houseplants. This morning, ferns. NPR science correspondent Geoff Brumfiel reports on some new findings that have fern researchers, as Jeff puts it, frontic. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Get it? Frontic instead of frantic because ferns grow fronds instead of leaves. Yeah. Anyway, Carl Rothfels is at the University of British Columbia. He's devoted his entire career to studying ferns, and he's heard all the bad fern puns before. CARL ROTHFELS: Frondly persuasion, things like that, anything that uses frondly or friendly. BRUMFIEL: But it's been worth it because Rothfels and his fellow researchers have made a remarkable discovery about a very odd fern. ROTHFELS: It's something called Cystocarpium roskamianum. BRUMFIEL: It's found in France, and it's fairly common. You can even buy it at some European garden centers. But to fern researchers, it looks weird. ROTHFELS: Yes, it looks really weird. I mean, on one level it looks like a fern. . . BRUMFIEL: Quick aside - to me, it looks like a normal fern. But Rothfels says this fern appears to have come from two parents that you wouldn't expect to be a couple. One lives on rocky outcrops. The other is found on the floors of forests. The two are different species from different places, and yet somehow they get together to make this hybrid. ROTHFELS: It is pretty much exactly in between the two parents. BRUMFIEL: The team's DNA analysis confirmed it. This crazy hybrid has fern researchers talking. But the reason I'm talking about it on NPR is even crazier. The genetics show the parent species are really far apart. ROTHFELS: These two ferns had been evolving independently for about 60 million years before they got back together again and were able to form this hybrid. BRUMFIEL: Sixty million years, and they could still make a baby fern. That's a record. And to put it in perspective - humans and lemurs have been evolving separately for 60 million years. We definitely cannot make little baby Leemans. ROTHFELS: Another, at least, approximately comparable example would be an elephant mating with a manatee. BRUMFIEL: Which would be an elephanatee? ROTHFELS: Yeah, right. I don't know what would happen. That's well done, though. That was almost as good as the fern puns. BRUMFIEL: How is it even possible that ferns can do this? Truth is, Rothfels isn't sure. All ferns do share a similar reproductive process, so it could be that a rock-fern sperm can't tell the difference between the egg of a rock-fern and one of a forest-fern, which, he says, raises an interesting possibility - perhaps more distant hybrids would be possible with other species if they just gave it a try. Are you saying that if we did get an elephant and a manatee together. . . ROTHFELS: We'd get an elephanatee? I think most people would say that that's impossible. BRUMFIEL: But it might be possible that other ferns could get together, and their hybrids might teach researchers about how evolution and reproduction work. Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: It's not even a question, right? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: It's black and blue. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: The real dress is black and blue. SIEGEL: For the record, I see white and gold. A woman posted a photo of a dress, the dress in question, on Tumblr. This was on Tuesday and she wanted help because she and her friends saw the colors of the dress differently. By last night, the dress was an Internet phenomenon, pitting friend against friend, colleague against colleague, family member against family member. Why is it that people see the colors of the dress so differently? Now, we assume many of you have seen this thing, but just in case, it's on our Facebook page - NPR ATC. And here to settle this debate once and for all, we hope, is Dr. Bevil Conway, professor of neuroscience at Wellesley College. Thanks for joining us. BEVIL CONWAY: My pleasure. SIEGEL: So you've seen the picture of the dress. Is it white gold, as I see it, or black and blue, as others do? CONWAY: Well, I represent the third camp. I see it as orange and blue, which I think is probably the most accurate in terms of the representation in the digital image. If you look at the colors of each pixel, they actually report as orange and blue. SIEGEL: Did you zoom way, way in on this to arrive at that conclusion? CONWAY: I - no. When I was contacted initially about this, someone showed me the dress and said, what color is it? And I said it's orange and blue. And then we did the diagnostics on the image to figure it out. But, of course, that explain why so many people see it in so many different ways. SIEGEL: Yes. Why is it that one image can be seen so differently? I think we all know the names of the colors here. This is a matter of colorblindness, is it? We just see it differently. CONWAY: Yeah. I think that's exactly right. So it's got very little to do, if anything, with what's happening in the eye itself. It's got to do with how the brain that sits behind the eye is interpreting the signals that hit the retina. And there are, you know, many, many neurons - billions of neurons that are trying to interpret what hits the retina. And that interpretation is required because the stimulus that hits the retina is inherently ambiguous. It could be lots of different things. And because of people's particular prejudices about what they think they may see and because of the peculiar color combination, which is orange and blue, which sits on what we call the daylight axis. It's the colors of the naturally occurring luminance. It sets the stage for a very ambiguous situation that some people are going to interpret in one way and other people are going to interpret, equally validly actually, in another way. SIEGEL: Still, let the record show, orange is - I understand you see it that way, but that one's off the charts here for us. But. . . CONWAY: (Laughter). SIEGEL: . . . Would we all see the same colors if we saw the dress in person? CONWAY: So if you saw the dress in person, then you would have a lot more information. You could move around the dress. You would get much more information about how the lighting interacted not only with the dress, but with other objects in the environment. And I've been told the designer says it's blue and black. SIEGEL: (Laughter) I see. But that - for that, you went to the primary source to find that out. CONWAY: Right, right, yes. For me, though, I think that what's really important about this particular image and the controversy that's erupted is what it tells us about how important color is for us. We really care about color much more so, I think, than anybody actually anticipated. It's kind of like an identity. We identify with the colors we see, and when someone challenges us on those colors, then, you know, we feel it's like a violation of our core identity. SIEGEL: I think I'm on the concluding thought. I still want to say, funny, it doesn't look bluish. CONWAY: (Laughter). SIEGEL: Dr. Conway, thank you very much for talking with us about this. CONWAY: My absolute pleasure.

It's a world with hundreds of plants and animals that live nowhere else. It's also a vital stop-over for birds migrating from North America. As NPR's Christopher Joyce reports, biologists are eager to explore and protect green Cuba. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: One of the things that makes Cuba unique is the sound of its music, the syncopated rhythm of the changui, for example. There's no other music quite like it. There are other sounds though, that are uniquely Cuban and rarely ever heard. For example, the song of the yellow-browed woodpecker called Fernandina's Flicker.

(BIRD CHIRPING)JOYCE: Inigo-Elias says Cuba has about 750 species of birds and one quarter are found nowhere else on Earth. But the native birds are only half the story. There are also the North American birds that visit the island every year, from backyard warblers to big raptors like the osprey. As Cornell lab ornithologist Greg Budney explains, they need Cuba to survive. GREG BUDNEY: There are literally millions of birds, migratory birds, that are making use of Cuba as a stopping point as they cross the Caribbean. JOYCE: They rest and regroup. They eat. And that's why biologists want to know more about the state of Cuba's environment. INIGO-ELIAS: We have a gap in Cuba. We have a gap in the Caribbean that is huge. And for us it's so important as a scientist to know where these birds are. What are the survival rates in the environment in Cuba? What are the trends that are occurring there? JOYCE: But it's been hard to find out. Not many U. S. researchers have gone. Inigo-Elias and Budney are among a few that have. Even when they get there, it's tough doing fieldwork. Cuban scientists welcome them, but. . . INIGO-ELIAS: They don't have money to buy gas, to be able to move or they don't have the trucks to go to the field.

JOYCE: A midnight phone call to the minister of environment ensued. The team was briefly detained, then authorities realized they were just lost birders. But there could be a lot more American scientists wondering in Cuban forests soon. Doug Rader is a marine biologist with the Environmental Defense Fund who's been to Cuba over 30 times. He says he's getting a lot of phone calls from U. S. colleagues lately. DOUG RADER: The normalizing of relationships will unleash a tide of scientists champing at the bit to get back in. JOYCE: And they're not just birders by any means. Cuba has got it all - unique plants, amphibians, reptiles. The Cuban archipelago is also a nursery for fish, like snapper and giant grouper. They spawn in Cuba's numerous coral reefs. One reason for all the diversity is that it's the biggest island in the Caribbean. It's got lots of room and lots of different habitats, which is a recipe for the evolution of lots of species. And economic sanctions by the U. S. slowed development that otherwise might have mowed down forests and mangroves. The result - a biological treasure trove. RADER: There are peaks that are more than 6,000 feet high, plunging deeply into the sea that goes 20,000 feet deep. There are cloud forests that house an incredible array of painted snails and lizards and birds. JOYCE: Scientists who know Cuba say the government does have strong environmental laws.

As the last surviving member of his species, he had become a conservation icon, the wrinkled, green face of extinction. Millions made the pilgrimage to his home in the Galapagos Islands while he was alive. And his death back in 2012 was international news. And that inspired NPR science reporter Adam Cole to compose a musical memoir. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LONESOME GEORGE\")ADAM COLE, BYLINE: (Singing) He was just a giant tortoise, the last one of his kind, a hundred-year-old reptile, not even past his prime. SIEGEL: As Adam was writing this song, George's caretakers in the Galapagos were taking steps to create a different kind of memorial. They froze his body and sent him to New Jersey to be prepared for display. And Adam recently went up to meet him. COLE: I'm in Woodland Park, crunching through the snow towards a plain storefront between a plumber shop and a glass company. Hello. I'm here to see George. Is that you? GEORGE DANTE: That's me. COLE: That's not Lonesome George. It's George Dante. He's run this taxidermy business, Wildlife Preservations, since he was in high school, and his shop is filled with artfully posed animals. DANTE: Everything from some zebra, kudu, sable, antelope right there, we have. COLE: Is that a whale fin or what is that? DANTE: That is the right flipper of a blue whale. COLE: And there, in the back room, surrounded by cardboard walls, stands Lonesome George. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LONESOME GEORGE\")COLE: (Singing) Everybody knew his name, but he left this world alone. He saw love all around him, but no love to call his own. DANTE: So what you're seeing when you look at George here is this very regal pose. COLE: His long neck is stretched up to its full length, making him about four feet tall. His battered tortoise face is fixed in an expression of disapproval. Dante says this was a particularly difficult project. He didn't just have to preserve a scientifically accurate Galapagos tortoise. He had to preserve George in all his George-ness. So his first step was to talk to the scientists who knew the tortoise when he was alive. DANTE: Everyone you talked to had a different story about George. And they knew every wrinkle on this animal. They knew every personality trait. He was kind of - kind of grumpy and, you know, maybe had his, you know, had his own mindset about the way he enjoyed living his life. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LONESOME GEORGE\")COLE: (Singing) Oh, he didn't fall to pieces. No, he didn't fall apart. But beneath that sturdy tortoise shell, beat a broken tortoise heart. George was the last of the tortoises who once called the Galapagos' Pinta Island their home. After decades of being hunted by European sailors, they were presumed extinct. But then, in 1971, scientists found George. They were thrilled. Maybe this was a chance to bring back Pinta Island tortoises. The trouble was, there weren't any female tortoises left on Pinta, so they tried to get George interested in a mate from a different species. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LONESOME GEORGE\")COLE: (Singing) George, they brought you ladies, but they weren't your type. You tried to make some babies, but it didn't feel right. One of George's potential mates finally laid eggs in 2008. But, alas, they never hatched. And four years later, George died. He was in the prime of his tortoise life - a mere hundred years old. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LONESOME GEORGE\")COLE: (Singing) Lonesome George - he's gone his lonesome way, nevermore to walk the shore beside Tortuga Bay. Dante has reconstructed George's skeleton, sculpted clay muscles and then patiently tailored the tortoise's actual skin onto the armature. George got a pair of custom glass eyes and his natural colors were restored with paint and pigments. DANTE: When you get to stand there face-to-face with him, there's an undeniable connection you make. I hate to see him leave. COLE: Soon, George will head back home to the Galapagos to become the centerpiece of an exhibit about threatened species. Millions of visitors will be able to stand face-to-face with the tortoise who died alone. Adam Cole, NPR News.

It's a jawbone with several teeth, and it's old - really old. NPR's Christopher Joyce reports the fossil could fill an important gap in the history of human evolution. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: It's risky to say you've got the first or oldest of anything. But Brian Villmoare is sure he's got the earliest specimen of Homo - the human genus. BRIAN VILLMOARE: Oh, Yes. Absolutely - it definitely is. JOYCE: Villmoare is a paleoanthropologist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. VILLMOARE: I mean, we were looking for it. And by miraculous chance, we did happen to find it. JOYCE: His team found a lower jaw with five teeth in a region of Ethiopia called Afar. They were working a hill that was full of fossils. VILLMOARE: I was on the other side of the hill. And they say, Brian, Brian, come here. JOYCE: And it was just on the surface? VILLMOARE: Yeah. JOYCE: Several dating methods confirmed its age - about 2. 8 million years old. That's nearly half-a-million years older than the previous record for a human-related fossil. Here's why that's a big deal. There's this big gap in human history that has puzzled scientists. It starts 3 million years ago in East Africa. The place was home to a variety of 4-foot-tall ape-like creatures called Australopithecus. The famous Lucy is the best-known. Over the next half-million years, these creatures disappeared. Then, our genus, Homo, appears in Africa about 2 million years ago. Scientists believe that during that million-year gap, Homo evolved from Australopithecus. But there hasn't been physical evidence of that. This jaw from Ethiopia could be it. The first human branch in the big primate family tree. The jaw is primitive but definitely different from the ape-like jaws of Australopithecus. VILLMOARE: The general story is it's a reduction. You know, it's becoming less. The teeth are not these big, blocky, rectangular things. They become slender. JOYCE: Villmoare doesn't know anything about this creature's brain. But he says its jaw and teeth clearly have human traits. And Richard Potts agrees. Potts runs the Human Origins Program at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History. RICHARD POTTS: This new jaw really seems to confirm that by 2 3/4 million years ago, we certainly had a lineage branching off. JOYCE: And what defined the new branch was its mouth as much as its brain size. POTTS: You have this fragment of a jaw that shows that the leading edge of the origin of the genus Homo was our teeth. JOYCE: And apparently, changes in the mouth continued as humans kept evolving. Fred Spoor at the Max Planck Institute in Germany has been making computerized scans of the skulls of early humans. By two million years ago, early humans were established and had split into at least two species - Homo habilis and Homo rudolfensis. What made those two different from each other - mostly their jaws and teeth. FRED SPOOR: They all seem to have a brain size that is pretty much the same. So it is not brain size that actually distinguishes these species. But it is the face. It's the way the jaws are built. JOYCE: Villmoare and Spoor published their findings in the journals Science and Nature, respectively. Together, the research suggests that human evolution was partly driven by an ongoing remodeling of the jaws and teeth. What made that possible? Well, you don't need big jaws and teeth if you have stone tools to process food - pound it or grind it up before you eat it. Maybe it was these very first human ancestors who invented stone tools. But to prove that, scientists will have to find some tools as old as this earliest Homo. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

I'm Guy Raz. Back in 2009, this guy named Randall Munroe volunteered to teach a weekend class at MIT to a bunch of high school students. RANDALL MUNROE: They have a program where people can come in and teach classes on whatever subjects they're interested in, and a bunch of students come and sign up and take them. And I had some friends do classes on root beer tasting and other ones do a class on, you know, programming. RAZ: So Randall decided to teach the one subject he knew a little something about. MUNROE: So I did a class on the physics of energy. RAZ: Because he'd studied physics in college. But on the first day of that class, he was teaching, when he was giving his first lecture. . . MUNROE: Well, I was talking about how you can define this quantity called potential energy, and you can calculate if you lift an object that weighs, you know, 5 kilograms through a distance of 2 meters, then it will have about 95 or, you know, 100 joules of potential energy. RAZ: This approach, of course - well, not a big hit with the kids. MUNROE: The students got kind of bored, just like I always did in physics lectures. RAZ: And at that moment, it occurred to Randall that he was just throwing numbers at these kids that did not apply to anything in their world. MUNROE: And it's just as abstract for me. You know, I never run into a 5 kilogram weight in my life. You know, I run into, like, gallons of milk or, you know, a cat might weigh 5 kilograms. RAZ: And then, standing in front of his class that day. . . MUNROE: I realized that part of what makes math and science so exciting is having questions you want to answer. RAZ: So he thought, what kind of question would you want to answer if you're the kind of high school kid who signs up to take a class on the physics of energy on the weekend? MUNROE: And at that point, I had a moment where I thought, wait a minute. . . (SOUNDBITE OF JOHN WILLIAMS SONG, \"STAR WARS MAIN THEME\")MUNROE: \"The Empire Strikes Back. \"(SOUNDBITE OF JOHN WILLIAMS SONG, \"STAR WARS MAIN THEME\")RAZ: Specifically, this question. MUNROE: When Yoda lifts Luke's X-wing out of the swamp, how much energy did that take? (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"STAR WARS: EPISODE V THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK\")FRANK OZ: (As Yoda) Use the force, yes. RAZ: Right, that scene where Luke's fighter plane's trapped in the water. MUNROE: And it's a really straightforward calculation. If you can figure out the mass of the X-wing. . . (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"STAR WARS: EPISODE V THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK\")MARK HAMILL: (As Luke Skywalker) Right, I'll give it a try. MUNROE: . . . You know, and how high he lifts it. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"STAR WARS: EPISODE V THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK\")OZ: (As Yoda) Try not - do or do not. MUNROE: And what the strength of gravity on Dagobah is. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"STAR WARS: EPISODE V THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK\")OZ: (As Yoda): There is no try. MUNROE: And the students suddenly got really interested in figuring out, OK, how much does an X-wing weigh? Is there a canonical value for the gravity on Dagobah? Like, oh, well, there's a Star Wars Wikipedia, we can look up the weight of the X-wing there. And they were suddenly, like, kind of running ahead of me and figuring things out before I could even get to them. Then I realized, like, oh, this is the missing piece. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"STAR WARS: EPISODE V THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK\")OZ: (Yoda) Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? MUNROE: Answering these interesting questions. (SOUNDBITE OF JOHN WILLIAMS SONG, \"STAR WARS MAIN THEME\")RAZ: All right, it's time to embrace your inner nerd because today on the show, we're solving for X - stories and ideas about how numbers shape our world and our lives. HANNAH FRY: How people talk about themselves, how people interact with each other, how people present themselves when they're looking for a partner. CLAYTON CAMERON: When I listen to other musicians say, man, he really sounds good when he does that, you know, what is that? KEVIN SLAVIN: How do we even get our heads around the algorithms that are used online when we create mathematical models of such complexity? RAZ: And most importantly, the question Randall Munroe asked that day in class - how do you make math interesting? MUNROE: I think that a lot of the time it's easy to get the impression that math is sort of supposed to be interesting for its own sake. But really, to me, what's exciting is the answers that the math can get you to. You know, I don't care what X is. Like, an equation doesn't mean anything until it's representing a real thing. RAZ: By the way, after crunching the numbers, Randall and his physics students eventually calculated that it took Yoda 19. 2 kilowatts of energy to lift that X-wing fighter, or about what it takes to power a small tractor. Later in the show, Randall answers more questions that I promise have never occurred to you. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz.

MUNROE: And the students suddenly got really interested in figuring out, OK, how much does an X-wing weigh? Is there a canonical value for the gravity on Dagobah? Like, oh, well, there's a Star Wars Wikipedia, we can look up the weight of the X-wing there. And they were suddenly, like, kind of running ahead of me and figuring things out before I could even get to them. Then I realized, like, oh, this is the missing piece. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"STAR WARS: EPISODE V THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK\") OZ: (Yoda) Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? MUNROE: Answering these interesting questions. (SOUNDBITE OF JOHN WILLIAMS SONG, \"STAR WARS MAIN THEME\") RAZ: All right, it's time to embrace your inner nerd because today on the show, we're solving for X - stories and ideas about how numbers shape our world and our lives. HANNAH FRY: How people talk about themselves, how people interact with each other, how people present themselves when they're looking for a partner. CLAYTON CAMERON: When I listen to other musicians say, man, he really sounds good when he does that, you know, what is that? KEVIN SLAVIN: How do we even get our heads around the algorithms that are used online when we create mathematical models of such complexity? RAZ: And most importantly, the question Randall Munroe asked that day in class - how do you make math interesting? MUNROE: I think that a lot of the time it's easy to get the impression that math is sort of supposed to be interesting for its own sake. But really, to me, what's exciting is the answers that the math can get you to. You know, I don't care what X is. Like, an equation doesn't mean anything until it's representing a real thing. RAZ: By the way, after crunching the numbers, Randall and his physics students eventually calculated that it took Yoda 19. 2 kilowatts of energy to lift that X-wing fighter, or about what it takes to power a small tractor. Later in the show, Randall answers more questions that I promise have never occurred to you.", "section": "TED Radio Hour", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2015 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, we're solving for X, the hidden numbers that shape everything around us like, say, for example, when you flip through the radio dial. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: (Singing) Taking over from one to 10. KEVIN SLAVIN: When I hear music these days, I wonder. . . (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: (Singing) Number one. SLAVIN: . . . Why I'm hearing this particular song. . . (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Singing) One, two, three, four - get it. RAZ: This is Kevin Slavin. SLAVIN: . . . What it is in my behavior or the behavior of others or whatever produced this particular track at this particular time. RAZ: Kevin runs a research group at MIT that's obsessed with algorithms, and he thinks that we're now living in a sort of age of algorithms. SLAVIN: Our lives are made up of a series of decisions. What time does the train arrive? And what's on the radio? And what's happening to my retirement stock? And more and more, those decisions are made automatically by machines, increasingly without human supervision. RAZ: So here's an example from Kevin's life. SLAVIN: So yesterday, I had to make my way from New York to Boston, so I needed to take a flight. And so I went online to one of the sites that just sort of lists, you know, what all the prices are and what's the price of that ticket. RAZ: A chain of complex calculations figured out. . . SLAVIN: Routing and where the fuel depots are, projected seat fill, weather patterns, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. RAZ: And once Kevin arrived in Boston, he decided. . . SLAVIN: I'm going to call for a car, and so I use Uber. RAZ: But then, an algorithm decided. . . SLAVIN: What's that going to cost? Is it going to cost whatever it costs? Or is it going to cost 1. 2 times that? Is it going to cost 3. 9 times that, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. RAZ: Then, once he got home. . . SLAVIN: My wife and I are expecting a child. . . RAZ: Oh, wow. SLAVIN: . . . So we were ordering. . . RAZ: Is this your first child? SLAVIN: It is, yeah. RAZ: Congratulations. SLAVIN: Thank you. So we're sort of looking to see, OK, which crib? RAZ: And if you shop on Amazon like Kevin does. . . SLAVIN: A lot of sellers on Amazon aren't actually setting the prices themselves, they're actually just using small algorithms that are looking at the prices of other cribs on there. RAZ: And that changes - and that changes all the time. SLAVIN: Yeah, it changes many times in a second. So the price that we paid may never have been actually approved or even considered by human at any point. RAZ: In fact, Kevin says, you can find these kinds of things wherever you look. Here he is on the TED stage back in 2011. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SLAVIN: And so Netflix has gone through several different algorithms over the years. They started with Cinematch, and they've tried a bunch of others. There's Dinosaur Planet. There's Gravity. They're using Pragmatic Chaos now. Pragmatic Chaos is, like all of Netflix's algorithms, trying to do the same thing. It's trying to get a grasp on you, on the firmware inside the human skull, so that it can recommend what movie you might want to watch next, which is a very, very difficult problem. But the difficulty of the problem and the fact that we don't really quite have it down, it doesn't take away from the effects that Pragmatic Chaos has. Pragmatic Chaos, like all Netflix algorithms, determines, in the end, 60 percent of what movies end up being rented, right? So one piece of code with one idea about you is responsible for 60 percent of those movies. So if you need to have some image of what's happening in the stock market right now, what you can picture is a bunch of algorithms, and that's 70 percent of the United States stock market, 70 percent of the operating system formerly known as your pension. . . (LAUGHTER)SLAVIN: . . . Your mortgage. And what could go wrong? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: A stunning and dramatic crash on Wall Street yesterday appears to be the result. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SLAVIN: What could go wrong is, is that a year ago, 9 percent of the entire market just disappears. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: In a matter of minutes. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Nearly 1,000-point drop. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SLAVIN: And they called it The Flash Crash. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Flash Crash, which many people. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: Flash Crash, as it was described. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SLAVIN: Flash Crash of 2:45. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #5: Stocks go do-oop - boink (ph). (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SLAVIN: All of a sudden, 9 percent just goes away. (CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #6: It's a fast market. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #7: The market was down 900 points, we're now down 688. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SLAVIN: And nobody to this day can even agree on what happened. And that's the thing - right? - is that we're writing things, we're writing these things that we can no longer read. And it's - we've rendered something kind of illegible, and we've lost the sense of what's actually happening in this world that we've made. RAZ: That's - but - that's crazy. SLAVIN: It is crazy, right? And so one of the questions is, when we create mathematical models of such complexity - and let's remember that any given algorithm within the stock market is impossibly complex and then it is the interaction of all of these complex algorithms with one another. This is far beyond what any human could ever, ever hope to understand. And it doesn't leave a forensic trail that provides an explanation; it just provides a bunch of data. RAZ: But you're saying that, actually, increasingly we're solving problems in a way that we don't really even understand? SLAVIN: That's exactly the point. I think that's one of the most important aspects of what's happening, and I think that characterizes our time. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SLAVIN: So let me take it back to Wall Street, OK, because the algorithms of Wall Street are dependent on one quality above all else, which is speed. And they operate on milliseconds and microseconds. And just to give you a sense of what microseconds are, it takes you 500,000 microseconds just to click a mouse. But if you're a Wall Street algorithm and you're 5 microseconds behind, you're a loser. (LAUGHTER)SLAVIN: So if you were an algorithm, you'd look for an architect like the one that I met in Frankfurt who was hollowing out a skyscraper - throwing out all the furniture, all the infrastructure for human use and just running steel on the floors to get ready for the stacks of servers to go in - all so that an algorithm could get close to the Internet. And you think of the Internet as this kind of distributed system - and of course it is - but it's distributed from places, right? In New York, this is where it's distributed from - the Carrier Hotel, located on Hudson Street. And this is really where the wires come right up into the city. And the reality is that the further away you are from that, you're a few microseconds behind. But if you zoom out, you would see an 825-mile trench between New York City and Chicago. It's been built over the last few years by a company called Spread Networks. This is a fiber-optic cable that was laid between those two cities to just be able to traffic one signal 37 times faster than you can click a mouse - just for these algorithms. And when you think about this, that we're running through the United States with dynamite and rock saws so that an algorithm can close the deal 3 microseconds faster, all for communications framework that no human will ever know, that's a kind of manifest destiny. And we'll always look for a new frontier. RAZ: So - I mean, so basically, you could argue that our lives are controlled by algorithms. SLAVIN: I think it's more - the word that I use is shaped. The rough edges of what determines our sense of the day are, in fact, sort of hinted by these mathematical models that are all around us. You know, there's still an awful lot of things that happen in the world that can't nobody predict and probably won't ever be able to. And I think that's great and that's fine. I just think that those unpredictable elements are - have this weird kind of frisson with an increasingly predictable set of models that are sort of at every level of our lives. RAZ: So there's a limit to all this? SLAVIN: Yeah, and it may be - so there is a limit, but I think it's also - it's not just that there's a humility in being reminded that there's a limit, there's also a value in realizing that there's a limit. I think that it's a reasonable dream to have that we can take a fundamentally mathematic model to everything in the world and then just solve all the problems in it, but it's also fundamentally impossible. And I think that there's a great value in recognizing the idea of striving toward something impossible but also the impossibility of the task.

He has a physics background, but he now mainly writes and illustrates a really popular web comic. It's called \"What If? \" And the way it works is every week people write in questions for Randall to answer in the form of a comic. So for example, what if you were playing baseball - right? - and you were the batter? What would happen if the pitcher threw the baseball impossibly fast, like 90 percent the speed of light? (SOUNDBITE OF CHARGE ANTHEM)RAZ: Here's Randall's answer. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)RANDALL MUNROE: So I did some calculations. RAZ: . . . From the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MUNROE: Now, normally when an object flies through the air, the air will flow around the object. But in this case, the ball would be going so fast that the air molecules wouldn't have time to move out of the way. The ball would smash right into and through them. And the collisions with these air molecules would knock away the nitrogen, carbon and hydrogen from the ball, fragmenting it off into tiny particles, triggering waves of thermonuclear fusion in the air around it. This would result in a flood of x-rays that would spread out in a bubble along with exotic particles centered on the pitcher's mound. Now at this point, about 30 nanoseconds in, the home plate is far enough away that light hasn't had time to reach it, which means the batter still sees the pitcher about to throw and has no idea that anything is wrong. (LAUGHTER)MUNROE: Now after 70 nanoseconds, the ball will reach home plate, or at least the cloud of expanding plasma that used to be the ball. And it will engulf the bat and the batter and the plate and the catcher and the umpire and start disintegrating them all. . . (LAUGHTER)MUNROE: . . . Followed by a blast wave spreading out, shredding trees and houses as it moves away from the stadium and then eventually a mushroom cloud rising up over the ruined city. (LAUGHTER)MUNROE: So the Major League Baseball rules are little bit hazy, but. . . (LAUGHTER)MUNROE: . . . Under rules 6. 02 and 5. 09, I think that in this situation, the batter would be considered hit by pitch and would be eligible to take first base if it still existed. RAZ: This is the kind of question Randall answers every week in his web comic \"What If? \" Questions like, how fast could you visit all 50 states, or how long would a staircase to space take to climb, or what would happen if all the rain in a thunderstorm dropped at once in the form of a single raindrop? Short answer there - nothing good. MUNROE: In the case of the raindrop that's this big and falling this fast, when the bottom hits, there's so much more water coming and it's coming so quickly that there isn't enough time for the first part of the splash to get out of the way before the next part of the raindrop is already there. And this causes a thin jet to shoot outward along the ground, away from the point of contact. And - in sort of all directions you'll get these jets of water moving at, you know, much higher than the speed of sound. Yeah, you would want to watch this from a safe distance away. Yeah. . . RAZ: Like from a mountaintop. MUNROE: Yeah, make sure to have a mountaintop. And even if you've got a mountain between you and the raindrop, you'd want to make sure you are not downstream of that raindrop. RAZ: How do you think - how do you think you approach something unknown differently than other people do? MUNROE: Well, I have always had a little bit of trouble managing my time and just clicking random Wikipedia links or reading random papers. And then before I know it, I've spent like three hours trying to solve a question that I'm not even going to write an article about. And I once drew a comic about how you could sort of use this maliciously, this tendency science people have where - I had a comic about someone who sat outside an engineering building by the side of the road. And when the physics professor was halfway across the road, they would hold up a sign with an interesting problem on it. And the physics professor would stop immediately to like - and start thinking about OK, how do I solve this? Take the square root of - and then wham, they get hit by a car. And so I invented this sport that I called nerd sniping. But part of what I did with my idea with \"What If? \" is that I'm nerd sniping myself. I'm getting all of these questions sent to me that then I will have no choice but to try to answer. RAZ: Like a couple of years ago, when he got the following question - say all of the world's known data were stored on punch cards - you know, those paper cards with holes that used to be fed into giant computers? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: A card punch translates words and numbers into the same information in the form of holes in cards. A typist with very little extra training can operate the card punch. RAZ: Anyway, the question was if we still stored data that way, how much physical space would Google need to store all the data that Google has? Google, of course, wasn't going to tell Randall how much data they do have, so Randall came up with an answer he thought was plausible. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MUNROE: I came up with my estimate, which I felt pretty good about, that was about - about 10 exabytes of data across of all Google's operations. And then another maybe five exabytes or so of offline storage in, like, tape drives, which it turns out Google is about the world's largest consumer of. So I came up with this estimate, and this is a staggering amount of data. It's quite a bit more than any other organization in the world has as far as we know. There's a couple of other contenders, especially - everyone always thinks of the NSA. Adding all of this up, I came up with the other thing that we can answer, which is how many punch cards would this take? And so a punch card can hold about 80 characters and you can fit about, you know, 2,000 or so cards into a box. And you put them in, say, my home region of New England, it would cover the entire region up to a depth of a little less than five kilometers, which is about three times deeper than the glaciers during the last ice age about 20,000 years ago. So this is impractical, but I didn't expect to get an answer from Google because of course they've been so secretive. They didn't answer any of my questions. And so I just put it up and said, well, I guess we'll never know. But then a little while later, I got a message a couple of weeks later from Google saying, hey, someone here has an envelope for you. So I go and get it, open it up, and it's punch cards. . . (LAUGHTER)MUNROE: . . . Google-branded punch cards. And on these punch cards, there are a bunch of holes, you know? And I said thank you, thank you. And I was - OK, so what's on here? So I get some software and start reading it and scan them. And it turns out it's a puzzle. There's a bunch of code. And I get some friends to help and we cracked the code. And then inside that is another code. And there are some equations. And then we solve those equations and then finally - and out pops a message from Google, which is their official answer to my article. And it said no comment. (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)MUNROE: So - and I love calculating these kind of things. I just - and it's not that I love doing the math. I do a lot of math, but I don't really like math for its own sake. What I love is that it lets you take some things that you know and just by doing these, you know, moving symbols around on a piece of paper, find out something that you didn't know that's very surprising. You know, and I have a lot of stupid questions and I love that math gives the power to answer them sometimes - and sometimes not. This is a question I got from a reader - an anonymous reader - and the subject line just said urgent. And this was the entire email. If people had wheels and could fly, how would we differentiate them from airplanes? Urgent. (LAUGHTER)MUNROE: And I think there are some questions that math just cannot answer. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Randall Munroe. His talk is a ted. com and his web comic is at xkcd. com. On the show today we're solving for X, how numbers shape the world. Next up, how one equation might help you find true love. HANNAH FRY: WT+1 = w+RWWT+IHM(HD). But this only maximizes your chances of finding the perfect person for you. It doesn't guarantee it.

(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) MUNROE: Now, normally when an object flies through the air, the air will flow around the object. But in this case, the ball would be going so fast that the air molecules wouldn't have time to move out of the way. The ball would smash right into and through them. And the collisions with these air molecules would knock away the nitrogen, carbon and hydrogen from the ball, fragmenting it off into tiny particles, triggering waves of thermonuclear fusion in the air around it. This would result in a flood of x-rays that would spread out in a bubble along with exotic particles centered on the pitcher's mound. Now at this point, about 30 nanoseconds in, the home plate is far enough away that light hasn't had time to reach it, which means the batter still sees the pitcher about to throw and has no idea that anything is wrong. (LAUGHTER) MUNROE: Now after 70 nanoseconds, the ball will reach home plate, or at least the cloud of expanding plasma that used to be the ball. And it will engulf the bat and the batter and the plate and the catcher and the umpire and start disintegrating them all. . . (LAUGHTER) MUNROE: . . . Followed by a blast wave spreading out, shredding trees and houses as it moves away from the stadium and then eventually a mushroom cloud rising up over the ruined city. (LAUGHTER) MUNROE: So the Major League Baseball rules are little bit hazy, but. . . (LAUGHTER) MUNROE: . . . Under rules 6. 02 and 5. 09, I think that in this situation, the batter would be considered hit by pitch and would be eligible to take first base if it still existed. RAZ: This is the kind of question Randall answers every week in his web comic \"What If? \" Questions like, how fast could you visit all 50 states, or how long would a staircase to space take to climb, or what would happen if all the rain in a thunderstorm dropped at once in the form of a single raindrop? Short answer there - nothing good. MUNROE: In the case of the raindrop that's this big and falling this fast, when the bottom hits, there's so much more water coming and it's coming so quickly that there isn't enough time for the first part of the splash to get out of the way before the next part of the raindrop is already there. And this causes a thin jet to shoot outward along the ground, away from the point of contact. And - in sort of all directions you'll get these jets of water moving at, you know, much higher than the speed of sound. Yeah, you would want to watch this from a safe distance away. Yeah. . . RAZ: Like from a mountaintop. MUNROE: Yeah, make sure to have a mountaintop. And even if you've got a mountain between you and the raindrop, you'd want to make sure you are not downstream of that raindrop. RAZ: How do you think - how do you think you approach something unknown differently than other people do? MUNROE: Well, I have always had a little bit of trouble managing my time and just clicking random Wikipedia links or reading random papers. And then before I know it, I've spent like three hours trying to solve a question that I'm not even going to write an article about. And I once drew a comic about how you could sort of use this maliciously, this tendency science people have where - I had a comic about someone who sat outside an engineering building by the side of the road. And when the physics professor was halfway across the road, they would hold up a sign with an interesting problem on it. And the physics professor would stop immediately to like - and start thinking about OK, how do I solve this? Take the square root of - and then wham, they get hit by a car. And so I invented this sport that I called nerd sniping. But part of what I did with my idea with \"What If? \" is that I'm nerd sniping myself. I'm getting all of these questions sent to me that then I will have no choice but to try to answer. RAZ: Like a couple of years ago, when he got the following question - say all of the world's known data were stored on punch cards - you know, those paper cards with holes that used to be fed into giant computers? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: A card punch translates words and numbers into the same information in the form of holes in cards. A typist with very little extra training can operate the card punch. RAZ: Anyway, the question was if we still stored data that way, how much physical space would Google need to store all the data that Google has? Google, of course, wasn't going to tell Randall how much data they do have, so Randall came up with an answer he thought was plausible. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) MUNROE: I came up with my estimate, which I felt pretty good about, that was about - about 10 exabytes of data across of all Google's operations. And then another maybe five exabytes or so of offline storage in, like, tape drives, which it turns out Google is about the world's largest consumer of. So I came up with this estimate, and this is a staggering amount of data. It's quite a bit more than any other organization in the world has as far as we know. There's a couple of other contenders, especially - everyone always thinks of the NSA. Adding all of this up, I came up with the other thing that we can answer, which is how many punch cards would this take? And so a punch card can hold about 80 characters and you can fit about, you know, 2,000 or so cards into a box. And you put them in, say, my home region of New England, it would cover the entire region up to a depth of a little less than five kilometers, which is about three times deeper than the glaciers during the last ice age about 20,000 years ago. So this is impractical, but I didn't expect to get an answer from Google because of course they've been so secretive. They didn't answer any of my questions. And so I just put it up and said, well, I guess we'll never know. But then a little while later, I got a message a couple of weeks later from Google saying, hey, someone here has an envelope for you. So I go and get it, open it up, and it's punch cards. . . (LAUGHTER) MUNROE: . . . Google-branded punch cards. And on these punch cards, there are a bunch of holes, you know? And I said thank you, thank you. And I was - OK, so what's on here? So I get some software and start reading it and scan them. And it turns out it's a puzzle. There's a bunch of code. And I get some friends to help and we cracked the code. And then inside that is another code. And there are some equations. And then we solve those equations and then finally - and out pops a message from Google, which is their official answer to my article. And it said no comment. (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE) MUNROE: So - and I love calculating these kind of things. I just - and it's not that I love doing the math. I do a lot of math, but I don't really like math for its own sake. What I love is that it lets you take some things that you know and just by doing these, you know, moving symbols around on a piece of paper, find out something that you didn't know that's very surprising. You know, and I have a lot of stupid questions and I love that math gives the power to answer them sometimes - and sometimes not. This is a question I got from a reader - an anonymous reader - and the subject line just said urgent. And this was the entire email. If people had wheels and could fly, how would we differentiate them from airplanes? Urgent. (LAUGHTER) MUNROE: And I think there are some questions that math just cannot answer. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) RAZ: Randall Munroe. His talk is a ted. com and his web comic is at xkcd. com. On the show today we're solving for X, how numbers shape the world. Next up, how one equation might help you find true love. HANNAH FRY: WT+1 = w+RWWT+IHM(HD). But this only maximizes your chances of finding the perfect person for you. It doesn't guarantee it.

TERRY MOORE: X is the unknown. RAZ: But why X? Why not another letter? Terry Moore wanted to find out. MOORE: Yes, exactly. RAZ: Terry directs an organization that promotes mathematics. And he told the story of why X is X on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MOORE: About six years ago, I decided that I would learn Arabic, which turns out to be a supremely logical language. To write a word or a phrase or a sentence in Arabic is like crafting an equation because every part is extremely precise and carries a lot of information. That's one of the reasons so much of what we've come to think of as Western science and mathematics and engineering was really worked out in the first few centuries of the Common Era by the Persians and the Arabs and the Turks. This includes the little system in Arabic called al-jabra. Al-jabra roughly translates to the system for reconciling disparate parts. Al-jabra finally came into English as algebra. The Arabic texts containing this mathematical wisdom finally made their way to Europe - which is to say Spain - in the 11th and 12th century. And when they arrived, there was tremendous interest in translating this wisdom into a European language. RAZ: Ok, so they start translating algebra from Arabic into Spanish. So what's the unknown in Arabic? What's the X? MOORE: It was originally the word sheiun (ph), which means something. RAZ: Something. MOORE: Something - some undefined thing. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MOORE: The problem for the medieval Spanish scholars who were tasked with translating this material is that the word sheiun can't be rendered into Spanish because Spanish doesn't of that S-H - that sh sound. So by convention, they created a rule in which they borrowed the C-K sound - the cuh sound - from the classical Greek in the form of the letter Chi. Later, when this material was translated into a common European language - which is to say Latin - they simply replaced the Greek Chi with the Latin X. And once that happened, once this material was in Latin, it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks for almost 600 years. But now we have the answer to our question. Why is it that X is the unknown? X is the unknown because you can't say shh in Spanish. (LAUGHTER)MOORE: And I thought that was worth sharing. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: So this was kind of like a big misunderstanding, really. Like, it could've been Y. Or it could've been Q or B. MOORE: It's certainly possible. And to some degree, it was arbitrary. But the origin is that Arabic sheiun, which means something. Had they chosen a different word, we probably would be referring to the unknown quantity by some other letter. RAZ: Yeah. What if X was B? Then everything would be B. We'd have like, the B-Men and Malcolm B and B-marks-the-spot and the B-Files. MOORE: That's right. And Project B. RAZ: That would ruin everything. Thank the gods it was the X. MOORE: Well, we're used to that now. RAZ: Do you like algebra? MOORE: Yes, I love algebra. RAZ: Why? MOORE: Because it's beautiful. RAZ: How, how? I keep hearing that. I hear mathematicians say it's beautiful. And then, you, like, see these movies about these crazy geniuses and they're scrawling on the chalkboards. It is kind of nice, actually. But I still don't get it. MOORE: I think that's a matter of temperament. There're some people to whom a mathematical proof appears as a thing of beauty. It speaks of a higher truth. It speaks of a harmony to knowledge. The fact that it works at all - let alone that we can understand it - speaks to a larger category of existence and knowledge.

HANNAH FRY: Well, this is like, a massive issue. RAZ: It's a big issue. FRY: People get really properly angry about it. There is a kind of joke in the U. K. where people say math and then someone just goes (makes S sound). RAZ: This is Hannah Fry. She's a maths-matician. FRY: As far as I'm concerned, I struggle to find anything in the world that you can't get an interesting perspective on by using maths. RAZ: Including perhaps the most mysterious, inexplicable part of life, which is of course love. Do you think that there's a connection between math and love? Like, it can explain love, in part? FRY: Well, so the thing is, is that in people's love lives, as in all of life, there are certain patterns in the way that people behave. And maths is perfectly placed to be able to take those patterns and translate them, and then give them back to you with a little bit of insight wrapped up. RAZ: That's so romantic. FRY: (Laughter). All right, good point. RAZ: Hannah has written about this in a book called \"The Mathematics Of Love,\" and it's full of lessons about how numbers can actually help us find love, including. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FRY: How to win at online dating. RAZ: Here's Hannah's Ted Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FRY: OK. So, my favorite online dating website is OKCupid, not least because it was started by a group of mathematicians. Now, because they're mathematicians, they have been collecting data on everybody who uses their site for almost a decade. And they've been trying to search for patterns in the way that we talk about ourselves and the way that we interact with each other on an online dating website. And they've come up with some seriously interesting findings. But my particular favorite is that it turns out that on an online dating website, how attractive you are does not dictate how popular you are. Let me show you how this works. OK so, in a thankfully voluntary section of OKCupid, you are allowed to rate how attractive you think people are on a scale between 1 and 5. Now, if we compare this score, the average score, to how many messages a selection of people receive, you can begin to get a sense of how attractiveness links to popularity on an online dating website. And the important thing to note is that it's not totally true that the more attractive you are, the more messages you get. But the question arises then of what is it about people up here who are so much more popular than people down here, even though they have the same score of attractiveness? And the idea is that if you're looking through people's profiles on OKCupid and you find someone, and they're super, super beautiful, in your head you're thinking they probably get loads of messages, there's not really much point in me humiliating myself by sending them a message, they're never going to reply. And you move on to the next profile. But then you see someone and you think they're really beautiful, but you also think that perhaps not everyone is going to think that they're beautiful. So, maybe they've got loads of tattoos or a crazy color hair or whatever. In that way, it's sort of less competition for you and it's an extra incentive for you to get in touch. RAZ: OK. All right, so, if you want to get like, more attention and like, more messages to you, you want to play up the things that make you like, a little weird or different, right? FRY: Yeah because the people who like you anyway are still going to like you, and the people who don't only serve to your advantage. RAZ: So, in some ways you could argue that mathematicians like, have an unfair advantage when it comes to online dating? FRY: (Laughter) Yeah. I mean, mathematicians are famously brilliant at finding lovers. RAZ: Are they really? FRY: Yeah. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. RAZ: Really? Who knew? FRY: (Laughter) I'm joking. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FRY: So let's imagine then that you're a roaring success on the dating scene. But the question arises of how do you then convert that success into longer-term happiness and in particular, how do you decide when is the right time to settle down? Now, generally it's not advisable to just cash-in and marry the first person who comes along and shows you any interest at all. But equally, you don't really want to leave it too long if you want to maximize your chances of long-term happiness. So the question is then, how do you know when is the right time to settle down, given all the people that you could date in your lifetime? Now, thankfully there's a rather delicious bit of mathematics that we can use to help us out here called optimal stopping theory. OK so, let's imagine then that you start dating when you're 15, and ideally, you'd like to be married by the time that you're 35. And there's a number of people that you could potentially date of course in your lifetime, and they'll be at kind of varying levels of goodness. Now, the rules are that once you cash-in and get married, you can't look ahead to see what you could've had. And equally, you can't go back and change your mind. OK so, the math says then, that what you should do in the first 37 percent of your dating window, you should just reject everybody as serious marriage potential (laughter). And then you should pick the next person that comes along that is better than everybody that you've seen before. RAZ: Hannah says using this idea from math, it's called optimal stopping theory, can dramatically increase your odds of finding the perfect partner. So, say you dated like, 20 people in your life. Well, if you just picked one of those 20 people at random to marry, there's a 5 percent chance you'd have found your perfect partner. FRY: Which is like, not very good odds, really. RAZ: But, if you dated the same 20 people and you flat-out rejected the first third? FRY: You then can up your chances of finding the perfect person to almost 40 percent. RAZ: Wow. FRY: So, from going from 1 in 20 to more than a third, you've just massively changed your chances of finding them. RAZ: But, this is all a matter of probability. There's a chance you could reject your soul mate in that 37 percent window. FRY: Yeah, I mean there are risks involved, right? So, your perfect person could come along in your rejection phase and you could get rid of them and then spend the rest of your life regretting the fact that you didn't just marry them. This only maximizes your chances of finding the perfect person for you, it doesn't guarantee it. RAZ: Ah - math. FRY: Yeah, [expletive]. RAZ: It ruins everything. FRY: (Laughter) I think it makes everything brilliant. RAZ: OK. So, let's say you've made it through your rejection phase, found that perfect person within your 37 percent window. How do you know if it's going to last? FRY: And that's something that, it turns out, you can write a really beautifully simple set of equations to look at. RAZ: Beautifully simple if you're a mathematician. FRY: So the equation is W T plus one equals little W plus R W W T, plus I H M brackets H T. RAZ: Mathematicians came up with this equation for love by studying how couples argue. A group of psychologists spent years filming couples having conversations. FRY: And the asked them, for 15 minutes or so, I want you to talk about the most contentious issue in your relationship. RAZ: Things like who does what around the house, working late, missing important events, money, in-laws. And during those conversations, the researchers monitored the couples' heart rates, their facial expressions, how much they were sweating. FRY: And they worked out a way to give them scores - so positive or negative scores based on everything that happened in their interaction. RAZ: And then those numbers, they got plugged into the set of equations Hannah just mentioned. FRY: We call it a coupled set of equations because you have one equation for the husband and one equation for the wife. RAZ: So for the wife, better known as. . . FRY: W, T plus 1. RAZ: How she will handle talking about a contentious issue with her husband is based on. . . FRY: Her general mood, little W, plus her general mood when she's with her husband, R W W T, plus how she reacts to the last thing that her husband says in that exact conversion, I H M brackets H T. RAZ: With this information, and a lot of calculations. . . FRY: They could predict whether or not people are going to get divorced with a 90 percent accuracy. RAZ: Wow, how do you know? FRY: So, there's a few things that are really big indicators, and these are patterns that only come out when you look at this mathematically. It's not just about - because everybody - every couple argue, right? Every couple are a little bit negative to each other at some point, but it's about how that negativity can spiral into something really out of control and about how likely that is to happen. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FRY: For the really important term in this equation is the influence that people have on one another, in particular, something called the negativity threshold. Now, the negativity threshold you can think of as how annoying the husband can be before the wife starts getting really [expletive] off, mostly, and vice versa. Now, I always thought that good marriages were about compromise and understanding and allowing the person to have space to be themselves. So I would've thought that perhaps the most successful relationships were ones where there was a really high negativity threshold, where couples let things go and only brought things up if they really were a big deal. But actually, the mathematics and subsequent findings by the team have shown the exact opposite is true. The best couples, or the most successful couples, are the ones with a really low negativity threshold. These are the couples that don't let anything go unnoticed and allow each other some room to complain. These are the couples that are continually trying to repair their own relationship, that have a much more positive outlook on their marriage, couples that don't let things go and couples that don't let trivial things end up being a really big deal. It's quite interesting to know that there is really mathematical evidence to say that you should never let the sun go down on your anger. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: This is very reassuring to know. That's pretty cool that, you know, with an equation, you can just predict if you're destined for a life of bliss. FRY: Well, maybe that's not quite true. It's more like, these equations give us a language to be able to talk about conflict in long-term relationships in a way that you can't do if you just think really qualitatively. RAZ: Yeah, I mean, most people don't think of math as a language, right? FRY: No, I know. And it just absolutely is. And so Galileo says that - talks about the universe as though it's a book that's been written by God, and everything in the universe is contained within this book. And then he says that the language of that book has to be mathematics. And it's just absolutely true. You can just describe everything around you, everything in the human world, everything in the natural world, everything in the physical world. At some level, you can use math to describe it.

But the question arises of how do you then convert that success into longer-term happiness and in particular, how do you decide when is the right time to settle down? Now, generally it's not advisable to just cash-in and marry the first person who comes along and shows you any interest at all. But equally, you don't really want to leave it too long if you want to maximize your chances of long-term happiness. So the question is then, how do you know when is the right time to settle down, given all the people that you could date in your lifetime? Now, thankfully there's a rather delicious bit of mathematics that we can use to help us out here called optimal stopping theory. OK so, let's imagine then that you start dating when you're 15, and ideally, you'd like to be married by the time that you're 35. And there's a number of people that you could potentially date of course in your lifetime, and they'll be at kind of varying levels of goodness. Now, the rules are that once you cash-in and get married, you can't look ahead to see what you could've had. And equally, you can't go back and change your mind. OK so, the math says then, that what you should do in the first 37 percent of your dating window, you should just reject everybody as serious marriage potential (laughter). And then you should pick the next person that comes along that is better than everybody that you've seen before. RAZ: Hannah says using this idea from math, it's called optimal stopping theory, can dramatically increase your odds of finding the perfect partner. So, say you dated like, 20 people in your life. Well, if you just picked one of those 20 people at random to marry, there's a 5 percent chance you'd have found your perfect partner. FRY: Which is like, not very good odds, really. RAZ: But, if you dated the same 20 people and you flat-out rejected the first third? FRY: You then can up your chances of finding the perfect person to almost 40 percent. RAZ: Wow. FRY: So, from going from 1 in 20 to more than a third, you've just massively changed your chances of finding them. RAZ: But, this is all a matter of probability. There's a chance you could reject your soul mate in that 37 percent window. FRY: Yeah, I mean there are risks involved, right? So, your perfect person could come along in your rejection phase and you could get rid of them and then spend the rest of your life regretting the fact that you didn't just marry them. This only maximizes your chances of finding the perfect person for you, it doesn't guarantee it. RAZ: Ah - math. FRY: Yeah, [expletive]. RAZ: It ruins everything. FRY: (Laughter) I think it makes everything brilliant. RAZ: OK. So, let's say you've made it through your rejection phase, found that perfect person within your 37 percent window. How do you know if it's going to last? FRY: And that's something that, it turns out, you can write a really beautifully simple set of equations to look at. RAZ: Beautifully simple if you're a mathematician. FRY: So the equation is W T plus one equals little W plus R W W T, plus I H M brackets H T. RAZ: Mathematicians came up with this equation for love by studying how couples argue. A group of psychologists spent years filming couples having conversations. FRY: And the asked them, for 15 minutes or so, I want you to talk about the most contentious issue in your relationship. RAZ: Things like who does what around the house, working late, missing important events, money, in-laws. And during those conversations, the researchers monitored the couples' heart rates, their facial expressions, how much they were sweating. FRY: And they worked out a way to give them scores - so positive or negative scores based on everything that happened in their interaction. RAZ: And then those numbers, they got plugged into the set of equations Hannah just mentioned. FRY: We call it a coupled set of equations because you have one equation for the husband and one equation for the wife. RAZ: So for the wife, better known as. . . FRY: W, T plus 1. RAZ: How she will handle talking about a contentious issue with her husband is based on. . . FRY: Her general mood, little W, plus her general mood when she's with her husband, R W W T, plus how she reacts to the last thing that her husband says in that exact conversion, I H M brackets H T. RAZ: With this information, and a lot of calculations. . . FRY: They could predict whether or not people are going to get divorced with a 90 percent accuracy. RAZ: Wow, how do you know? FRY: So, there's a few things that are really big indicators, and these are patterns that only come out when you look at this mathematically. It's not just about - because everybody - every couple argue, right? Every couple are a little bit negative to each other at some point, but it's about how that negativity can spiral into something really out of control and about how likely that is to happen. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) FRY: For the really important term in this equation is the influence that people have on one another, in particular, something called the negativity threshold. Now, the negativity threshold you can think of as how annoying the husband can be before the wife starts getting really [expletive] off, mostly, and vice versa. Now, I always thought that good marriages were about compromise and understanding and allowing the person to have space to be themselves. So I would've thought that perhaps the most successful relationships were ones where there was a really high negativity threshold, where couples let things go and only brought things up if they really were a big deal. But actually, the mathematics and subsequent findings by the team have shown the exact opposite is true. The best couples, or the most successful couples, are the ones with a really low negativity threshold. These are the couples that don't let anything go unnoticed and allow each other some room to complain. These are the couples that are continually trying to repair their own relationship, that have a much more positive outlook on their marriage, couples that don't let things go and couples that don't let trivial things end up being a really big deal. It's quite interesting to know that there is really mathematical evidence to say that you should never let the sun go down on your anger. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: This is very reassuring to know. That's pretty cool that, you know, with an equation, you can just predict if you're destined for a life of bliss. FRY: Well, maybe that's not quite true. It's more like, these equations give us a language to be able to talk about conflict in long-term relationships in a way that you can't do if you just think really qualitatively. RAZ: Yeah, I mean, most people don't think of math as a language, right? FRY: No, I know. And it just absolutely is. And so Galileo says that - talks about the universe as though it's a book that's been written by God, and everything in the universe is contained within this book. And then he says that the language of that book has to be mathematics. And it's just absolutely true. You can just describe everything around you, everything in the human world, everything in the natural world, everything in the physical world. At some level, you can use math to describe it.

NPR science reporter Adan Cole got the scoop and this year's bracket.

HINDE: And so when it bites it can actually, in some species, apparently, can cause anaphylactic shock.

Over the past month, environmentalists and a Democratic congressman have probed the ties between prominent climate skeptics and industry. They say their work is needed to expose links between skeptics and major oil and gas companies. But as NPR's Geoff Brumfiel reports, some climate scientists worry those investigations will make the fight over the science even uglier. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: The first target was Willie Soon, a solar physicist at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Soon claims the sun, not people, is causing climate change. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)WILLIE SOON: You would think that if you want to talk about the sun and the climate, don't you think that when you write the report you ought to at least have somebody who knows something about the sun, please? BRUMFIEL: That was Soon criticizing a major scientific report on climate change at a conference last July. Soon's views are way out there. Almost all scientists believe humans are changing the climate. His position makes him an ally of climate skeptics and an enemy of environmental groups. Kert Davies is executive director of the nonprofit Climate Investigation Center. He decided to look at Soon's funding and found the astronomer was getting money from the fossil fuel industry. KERT DAVIES: We got the contract, Soon's proposals to get the money from these various oil companies and power companies and also his year-end reports. BRUMFIEL: In several year-end reports to the utility Southern Company, Davies found that Soon listed peer-reviewed scientific articles. DAVIES: He is telling them here's what I did for you. I wrote peer-reviewed science. BRUMFIEL: Publishing those letters without disclosing Southern Company's funding is a big no-no in science. Several journals and his employer have launched investigations. Soon did not respond to an NPR request for an interview, but in a written statement, he calls the accusations, quote, \"underhanded and unscientific. \" Shortly after Soon's links were exposed, another scientist named Roger Pielke, Jr. , was on his way to a conference in Berlin. When Pielke landed in Germany, he turned on his phone. . . ROGER PIELKE JR. : And learned that I was being investigated by a member of Congress. BRUMFIEL: Pielke's views aren't like Willie Soon's. He does believe humans are changing the climate, but he doesn't necessarily believe climate change will be catastrophic. PIELKE: To try to scare people into taking action is ultimately going to backfire because the science just isn't there to support those strong claims. BRUMFIEL: That contrarian view was enough to get the attention of Democratic Congressman Raul Grijalva. Grijalva's letters cited the case of Willie Soon and asked for details about who pays for Pielke's work. PIELKE: It's quite simple for me to respond to this because I have absolutely no corporate connections, consulting, anything. I mean, I am as clean as they come. BRUMFIEL: Pielke says that the letter sends a chilling message to scientists. PIELKE: If you come and testify before the U. S. Congress and someone doesn't like what you're saying, they can make your life pretty miserable. BRUMFIEL: Congressman Grijalva from Arizona sent letters inquiring about six other scientists as well. He says he wasn't trying to target scientists simply because they disagree with his views on climate change. CONGRESSMAN RAUL GRIJALVA: But I also want to make sure that if - if that is the basis for formation of policy, that it's clean and that it's empirical. BRUMFIEL: Now, in a strange twist, the seven scientists Grijalva's looking at are getting support from mainstream researchers who do believe in climate change - researchers like Eric Steig. ERIC STEIG: It's real. It's happening. The science has been in for about a hundred years. BRUMFIEL: Steig is at the University of Washington. He thinks environmentalists were right to expose Willie Soon's hidden funding, but the investigation of Pielke reminds him of something else. STEIG: There was a request - actually, very much like the one that has gone out to these seven scientists - that went to the University of Washington requesting a huge amount of information about me and five or six other people. BRUMFIEL: Steig says it came from a conservative think tank. In the past, some Republican politicians who oppose action against climate change have sought emails and data from climate scientists in an effort to discredit them. To Steig, these latest letters suggests liberals have started using a similar strategy against scientists who disagree with them. And if that's what's going on, he doesn't like it. STEIG: It was wrong when it was done by Republicans or by right-wing think tanks, and it's wrong when it's done by Democrats or left-wing think tanks. BRUMFIEL: Several big scientific societies have also been critical of the letters. Congressman Grijalva says he's willing to discuss details of his requests to make sure they're fair. Few think these tactics are going to disappear, though. In the fall, world leaders meet in Paris to try and reach a deal on climate. I asked Eric Steig whether he thinks the climate for climate scientists will get even hotter in the run-up to the summit. STEIG: Will it get uglier? I think that perhaps even those who seem to enjoy harassing people may be tired of it (laughter). BRUMFIEL: Do you really believe that or is that just wishful thinking? STEIG: I think it's wishful thinking (laughter). BRUMFIEL: Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News, Washington. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:   There's been an escalation in the political war over climate change. Over the past month, environmentalists and a Democratic congressman have probed the ties between prominent climate skeptics and industry. They say their work is needed to expose links between skeptics and major oil and gas companies. But as NPR's Geoff Brumfiel reports, some climate scientists worry those investigations will make the fight over the science even uglier. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: The first target was Willie Soon, a solar physicist at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Soon claims the sun, not people, is causing climate change. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WILLIE SOON: You would think that if you want to talk about the sun and the climate, don't you think that when you write the report you ought to at least have somebody who knows something about the sun, please? BRUMFIEL: That was Soon criticizing a major scientific report on climate change at a conference last July. Soon's views are way out there. Almost all scientists believe humans are changing the climate. His position makes him an ally of climate skeptics and an enemy of environmental groups. Kert Davies is executive director of the nonprofit Climate Investigation Center. He decided to look at Soon's funding and found the astronomer was getting money from the fossil fuel industry. KERT DAVIES: We got the contract, Soon's proposals to get the money from these various oil companies and power companies and also his year-end reports. BRUMFIEL: In several year-end reports to the utility Southern Company, Davies found that Soon listed peer-reviewed scientific articles. DAVIES: He is telling them here's what I did for you. I wrote peer-reviewed science. BRUMFIEL: Publishing those letters without disclosing Southern Company's funding is a big no-no in science. Several journals and his employer have launched investigations. Soon did not respond to an NPR request for an interview, but in a written statement, he calls the accusations, quote, \"underhanded and unscientific. \" Shortly after Soon's links were exposed, another scientist named Roger Pielke, Jr. , was on his way to a conference in Berlin.

They're the most common form of life - insects, spiders, crustaceans and centipedes, to name a few. And now scientists have the remains of one of the first arthropods ever. It lived 480 million years ago. And as NPR's Christopher Joyce reports, it was big and strange. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: The fossil was discovered in Morocco. Scientists spent 500 hours scraping away its rocky casing. The thing that emerged is, well, a man sized swimming centipede? A 7-foot lobster without claws? PETER VAN ROY: It is one of the very biggest arthropods to have ever existed. JOYCE: In fact, says Peter Van Roy, it was the biggest animal on the planet at the time. Van Roy is the paleontologist at Yale University who spent the 500 hours preparing it. It's called - and you better grab a pencil here, because I don't think I can say it twice - an anomalocaridid. It evolved at a special time during the Ordovician geological period. Scientists call it the Great Ordovician Biological Diversification, when the forms of life in the ocean exploded. VAN ROY: The biggest diversification in marine animal life that we've ever known. JOYCE: That was a bonanza for this creature. A lot of this new life was plankton, and the animal evolved a way to eat it. It developed a comb-like appendage to scoop up plankton the way whales do now. It also developed flaps on its body that later evolved into arthropod limbs. Becoming a filter feeder did pose some risks. VAN ROY: If you're filter-feeding, of course, you probably are not going to be able to defend yourself. You're not going to have, like, big fangs or anything. So one way of escaping from predation is just by growing so big - so massive - that there's just simply nothing else that can tackle you.

That mathematical constant denoted by the Greek letter pi, the number you get when you divide the circumference of a circle by its diameter. Back in 1988 on March 14, a physicist called Larry Shaw organized the first Pi Day celebration. It was at the Exploratorium in San Francisco, and youngsters marched around one of their circular rooms there and wound up eating fruit pies. Ever since, March 14 has been Pi Day. Celebratory events are organized across the United States and other parts of the world. But why March 14? Our own math guy Keith Devlin of Stanford University joins us. Keith, thanks so much for being with us. KEITH DEVLIN: Thanks for having me on, Scott, and happy Pi Day to you. SIMON: Happy Pi Day to you. Why March 14? DEVLIN: OK, so it goes from the - when you take pi and you try to write it down as a decimal, the first thing to notice is you can't actually do that. If you start to enumerate the decimals of pi, it starts out 3. 1415926 yada, yada, yada, and actually goes on forever without repeating or settling into some sort of nice pattern. So it's what mathematicians call an irrational number. But if you take the first two decimal places, you get 3. 14. If you're American and you give dates in this crazy fashion that we do on this side of the Atlantic, as the month before the day, then you get 3/14 for 3. 14. So that's March the 14. In fact, this year is a really, really special Pi Day. . . SIMON: Yeah. DEVLIN: . . . Because it's 2015. So you actually have 3/14/15, so today is a very unusual Pi Day in that it gives us the year as well. SIMON: Oh, mercy.

And as soon as you start talking about pi, that actually connects to almost all of mathematics and all of science and engineering because pi. . . SIMON: Or radio, radio. DEVLIN: Yeah, we couldn't be speaking on the radio if it wasn't for pi. We wouldn't be able to speak on a mobile phone or smartphone if it wasn't for pi. We wouldn't have computers. Celebrating Pi Day is a really good way to get kids aware of the role mathematics plays in today's world.

It's a scenario that has gotten a lot of attention lately because of a group called Mars One. (SOUNDBITE OF MARS ONE PROMOTIONAL VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: The colonization of Mars is the adventure of the century. MONTAGNE: The group claims to have a Mars mission in the works. Its dramatic promotional video features 100 finalists selected for its astronaut corps. But talking about a Mars voyage is a long way from actually getting the money, building the ship and blasting off - obviously - as NPR science correspondent Nell GreenfieldBoyce reports. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Mars is waiting, so if we wanted to go, we could just go, right? MARY LYNNE DITTMAR: No, we can't. (Laughter) We're nowhere near ready to go to Mars. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Mary Lynne Dittmar is an aerospace consultant in Washington, D. C. She says most people just don't get how hard this would be. DITTMAR: The distances that are involved and the complexities that are involved in going and staying there are really enormous. GREENFIELDBOYCE: A trip to Mars would take more than half a year one way. You'll need to bring along a ton of food plus oxygen. Then there's the question of whether you can even land on a planet with such a thin atmosphere. DITTMAR: We don't know yet how we're going to manage landing the sheer amount of mass on Mars that we're going to have to land on Mars in order to be able to have habitation. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And if they make it to the surface, the first Martians will have to cope with everything from cancer-causing radiation to dust. It's everywhere. DITTMAR: The small period of time that we spent on the moon, dust was a huge issue. Mars has a big dust problem, too. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Nonetheless, a Dutch venture called Mars One has captured the public's imagination with its plan to colonize Mars by 2025. The group is led by Bas Lansdorp. He says they've been featured on CNN, The New York Times. BAS LANSDORP: And actually on NPR. We've been on NPR I think, twice already. GREENFIELDBOYCE: His Mars dream started almost 20 years ago. Lansdorp was watching TV and was stunned by vivid images of the red Martian surface sent back by a NASA rover. LANSDORP: And for some reason that I really cannot explain, I wanted to go to Mars and build a new human settlement there. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Lansdorp is a mechanical engineer by training. He's worked in wind energy, and he now has a business plan for Mars. He says the voyage should pay for itself because it will be a media spectacle. Everyone in the world will want to watch the whole adventure. He envisions a reality TV show with sponsorships and advertising. LANSDORP: We expect it's worth up to 10 Olympic Games of media revenue, which is 45 billion U. S. dollars. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Of course, sponsors of the Olympics can be pretty confident that the games will happen. I asked Lansdorp how he responds to skeptics who say that Mars One is basically just a website and a marketing plan. LANSDORP: Well, I think that the people who say that really haven't paid attention to what we've achieved already. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says lots of people apply to their astronaut corps, paying a fee to do so. And the group has commissioned two studies from established aerospace companies. The Mars One plan calls for first sending out a small robotic lander about three years from now. Lansdorp says he can do this more cheaply than NASA. But won't it still cost hundreds of millions of dollars? LANSDORP: Certainly moving in that direction, yes. GREENFIELDBOYCE: I mean - doesn't sound like you've raised anything like that so far. LANSDORP: We don't need that kind of money yet because we are not yet building the actual lander. But these are the kinds of investments that we're currently in negotiation for. GREENFIELDBOYCE: How much has he raised? He won't say. John Logsdon is a space policy expert at George Washington University. He seriously doubts that Mars One has the right stuff. JOHN LOGSDON: I just don't find it a credible proposition. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That doesn't mean he thinks the idea of going to Mars in the next couple of decades is a total fantasy. LOGSDON: I would like to see, once again, people leave this planet and go someplace else. Whether I'll be around in the 2030s to see the first missions to Mars - I hope so. GREENFIELDBOYCE: You think they'll really be in the 2030s? LOGSDON: They could be. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says they could be because humans on Mars in the 2030s is NASA's stated goal. But unlike the days of Apollo, Logsdon says NASA can't expect any big infusion of cash. It will have to cobble together the pieces of a Mars program on its current budget. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: The support systems are go for static tests. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Low-speed data systems are go. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: High-speed data systems are go. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Last week in Utah, the agency test-fired part of a huge, new rocket. NASA says it needs this rocket to go out into deep space, back to the moon and beyond. (SOUNDBITE OF ROCKET)GREENFIELDBOYCE: Its first flight should come in 2018. Jason Crusan is director of Advanced Exploration Systems at NASA. JASON CRUSAN: We are developing many of the different systems to move from this low Earth-orbit phase that we're in today with the space station, into deep space and onwards towards Mars. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But that does not impress an aerospace engineer named Robert Zubrin. He's president of the Mars Society, which has long pushed for human missions. ROBERT ZUBRIN: The NASA humans-to-Mars program is all sizzle and no steak. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says sure, NASA is building a big rocket and a little capsule, but where's key stuff like the space habitation module you'll need for any real long-term mission? ZUBRIN: There is no program. There isn't even a plan. There's just chatter. GREENFIELDBOYCE: I asked him, if we're ever actually going to get to Mars, what's your best bet about what could make that happen? ZUBRIN: No one can know the future, but I would say that the strongest initiative going on right now, the one that is making visible dynamic progress, is the SpaceX initiative. GREENFIELDBOYCE: SpaceX, the first private company to have a capsule docked with the international space station. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Four, three, two, one, zero. We have liftoff, Falcon 9. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That's a SpaceX rocket blasting off to the station to deliver cargo for NASA. It may soon take up astronauts, too. The founder of SpaceX is Elon Musk. Zubrin says he is, quote, \"quite a person. \"ZUBRIN: I mean, he developed spacecraft for one-tenth the cost and one-third the time that NASA and the aerospace major companies have done.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ELON MUSK: I just think that a future where humanity is a spacefaring civilization, out there exploring the stars is an incredibly exciting future and inspiring, and so that's what we're trying to help make happen.

GREENFIELDBOYCE: And Musk has announced that later this year, he hopes to unveil plans for getting large numbers of people to the red planet, a project called the Mars Colonial Transporter. Nell GreenfieldBoyce, NPR News. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  Imagine stepping into a spaceship to blast off to Mars knowing you'll never return to Earth - OK, Steve, how about that? It's a scenario that has gotten a lot of attention lately because of a group called Mars One. (SOUNDBITE OF MARS ONE PROMOTIONAL VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: The colonization of Mars is the adventure of the century. MONTAGNE: The group claims to have a Mars mission in the works. Its dramatic promotional video features 100 finalists selected for its astronaut corps. But talking about a Mars voyage is a long way from actually getting the money, building the ship and blasting off - obviously - as NPR science correspondent Nell GreenfieldBoyce reports. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Mars is waiting, so if we wanted to go, we could just go, right? MARY LYNNE DITTMAR: No, we can't. (Laughter) We're nowhere near ready to go to Mars. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Mary Lynne Dittmar is an aerospace consultant in Washington, D. C. She says most people just don't get how hard this would be. DITTMAR: The distances that are involved and the complexities that are involved in going and staying there are really enormous. GREENFIELDBOYCE: A trip to Mars would take more than half a year one way. You'll need to bring along a ton of food plus oxygen. Then there's the question of whether you can even land on a planet with such a thin atmosphere. DITTMAR: We don't know yet how we're going to manage landing the sheer amount of mass on Mars that we're going to have to land on Mars in order to be able to have habitation. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And if they make it to the surface, the first Martians will have to cope with everything from cancer-causing radiation to dust. It's everywhere. DITTMAR: The small period of time that we spent on the moon, dust was a huge issue. Mars has a big dust problem, too. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Nonetheless, a Dutch venture called Mars One has captured the public's imagination with its plan to colonize Mars by 2025. The group is led by Bas Lansdorp. He says they've been featured on CNN, The New York Times. BAS LANSDORP: And actually on NPR. We've been on NPR I think, twice already. GREENFIELDBOYCE: His Mars dream started almost 20 years ago. Lansdorp was watching TV and was stunned by vivid images of the red Martian surface sent back by a NASA rover. LANSDORP: And for some reason that I really cannot explain, I wanted to go to Mars and build a new human settlement there. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Lansdorp is a mechanical engineer by training. He's worked in wind energy, and he now has a business plan for Mars. He says the voyage should pay for itself because it will be a media spectacle. Everyone in the world will want to watch the whole adventure. He envisions a reality TV show with sponsorships and advertising. LANSDORP: We expect it's worth up to 10 Olympic Games of media revenue, which is 45 billion U. S. dollars. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Of course, sponsors of the Olympics can be pretty confident that the games will happen. I asked Lansdorp how he responds to skeptics who say that Mars One is basically just a website and a marketing plan. LANSDORP: Well, I think that the people who say that really haven't paid attention to what we've achieved already. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says lots of people apply to their astronaut corps, paying a fee to do so. And the group has commissioned two studies from established aerospace companies. The Mars One plan calls for first sending out a small robotic lander about three years from now. Lansdorp says he can do this more cheaply than NASA. But won't it still cost hundreds of millions of dollars? LANSDORP: Certainly moving in that direction, yes. GREENFIELDBOYCE: I mean - doesn't sound like you've raised anything like that so far. LANSDORP: We don't need that kind of money yet because we are not yet building the actual lander. But these are the kinds of investments that we're currently in negotiation for. GREENFIELDBOYCE: How much has he raised? He won't say. John Logsdon is a space policy expert at George Washington University. He seriously doubts that Mars One has the right stuff. JOHN LOGSDON: I just don't find it a credible proposition. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That doesn't mean he thinks the idea of going to Mars in the next couple of decades is a total fantasy. LOGSDON: I would like to see, once again, people leave this planet and go someplace else. Whether I'll be around in the 2030s to see the first missions to Mars - I hope so. GREENFIELDBOYCE: You think they'll really be in the 2030s? LOGSDON: They could be. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says they could be because humans on Mars in the 2030s is NASA's stated goal. But unlike the days of Apollo, Logsdon says NASA can't expect any big infusion of cash. It will have to cobble together the pieces of a Mars program on its current budget. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: The support systems are go for static tests. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Low-speed data systems are go. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: High-speed data systems are go. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Last week in Utah, the agency test-fired part of a huge, new rocket. NASA says it needs this rocket to go out into deep space, back to the moon and beyond. (SOUNDBITE OF ROCKET) GREENFIELDBOYCE: Its first flight should come in 2018. Jason Crusan is director of Advanced Exploration Systems at NASA. JASON CRUSAN: We are developing many of the different systems to move from this low Earth-orbit phase that we're in today with the space station, into deep space and onwards towards Mars. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But that does not impress an aerospace engineer named Robert Zubrin. He's president of the Mars Society, which has long pushed for human missions. ROBERT ZUBRIN: The NASA humans-to-Mars program is all sizzle and no steak. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says sure, NASA is building a big rocket and a little capsule, but where's key stuff like the space habitation module you'll need for any real long-term mission? ZUBRIN: There is no program. There isn't even a plan. There's just chatter. GREENFIELDBOYCE: I asked him, if we're ever actually going to get to Mars, what's your best bet about what could make that happen? ZUBRIN: No one can know the future, but I would say that the strongest initiative going on right now, the one that is making visible dynamic progress, is the SpaceX initiative. GREENFIELDBOYCE: SpaceX, the first private company to have a capsule docked with the international space station. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Four, three, two, one, zero. We have liftoff, Falcon 9. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That's a SpaceX rocket blasting off to the station to deliver cargo for NASA. It may soon take up astronauts, too. The founder of SpaceX is Elon Musk. Zubrin says he is, quote, \"quite a person. \" ZUBRIN: I mean, he developed spacecraft for one-tenth the cost and one-third the time that NASA and the aerospace major companies have done. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And everyone knows he's gung-ho for Mars. You only have to go online, and in five seconds you can find videos of Musk talking about the need to put humans on another planet.

Joe got a pitch about the 100th anniversary of a tower on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley. It's home to 20 tons of fossils and a carillon. He was intrigued. You could say he went for the bones, but stayed for the bells. (SOUNDBITE OF BELL)JOE PALCA, BYLINE: This story starts just after noon near the very top of a 307-foot tall clock tower on the Berkeley campus. (SOUNDBITE OF GRAND CARILLON)PALCA: That's a carillon, or in this case, a grand carillon made up of 61 bells. University carillonist Jeff Davis is playing a tune called \"A Mince Pie Or A Pudding,\" a tune he wrote for the carillon. Carillons come in a variety of shapes and sizes, but Davis says there are certain minimums. JEFF DAVIS: Twenty-three bells arranged in chromatic sequence being able to be played expressively by a keyboard. PALCA: Unlike a piano or organ keyboard, this one is made up of large levers and foot pedals. These connect to cables that run up to bells in the space above us. Davis hammers on the levers expressively with his fist. (SOUNDBITE OF GRAND CARILLON)PALCA: Although there have been bells of one sort or another up here at the top of the tower for 100 years, the grand carillon has only been here since 1983. DAVIS: We have beautiful, beautiful treble bells here. PALCA: That's the good news about the Berkeley carillon. Davis says there's also bad news. DAVIS: It's placed too far above the ground, really, to have the kind of majestic effect that a carillon could have. PALCA: Although speaking of majestic, you do get a magnificent view of the San Francisco Bay from the top of the tower. Now, I get why they put a carillon in a tower, but what about the fossils? What are they doing here? Mark Goodwin says there's a simple answer. MARK GOODWIN: Space. PALCA: Goodwin is the assistant director of the University of California Museum of Paleontology. Paleontology was booming at Berkeley in 1913 when the bell tower was being built. And even then, Goodwin says space on campus was at a premium. We're standing in a high-ceilinged room near the base of the tower. There are shelves and cabinets everywhere, all stuffed with fossils. GOODWIN: So we have five floors like this. PALCA: It's quite a collection. A lot of these bones are from creatures that got stuck in the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles. GOODWIN: Giant sloths, tigers, lions, and then one of my favorites is the North American camel. PALCA: Camel - there were camels in LA. Would it look like what I think of as a camel? GOODWIN: Yeah, it looks like a modern camel. PALCA: Oh, OK. GOODWIN: We also have invertebrate collections - mollusks, clams and snails. We have micropaleo collections from the oil companies that were put in here. PALCA: And wait - there's more. GOODWIN: We have a big bird collection. There's a huge coyote skeleton - mammoths - elephants - American bison - mastodons - rhino casts. PALCA: OK, OK, there's a lot of stuff. But what's it all good for? Goodwin says plenty. GOODWIN: They're not just dusty old bones sitting on shelves, even though they are, but they're very useful for getting at information and trying to answer questions about paleoecology, paleoclimatology and things like that. PALCA: In other words, question such as what's changed in the 10,000 years since the LA Basin resembled an African savanna instead of what we see today. Goodwin sees this collection as an invaluable resource. and I suspect there's one thing that makes it truly unique. So as far as you know, is this the only paleontological collection that has its own carillon? GOODWIN: Yeah. Until that hypothesis is falsified, I can confidently say yes to that question.

The scientists were then able to breed the coral in a lab. As NPR's Christopher Joyce reports, it's part of an effort to stem the decline of coral around the world. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Coral reefs are actually colonies of tiny organisms encased in hard skeletons. Often the whole colony reproduces at once in a spectacular event called broadcast spawning. Males eject clouds of sperm into the water, then females do the same with eggs. They cross their fingers - or whatever the coral equivalent of that is - and hope for the best. Scientists have observed this before, but not with pillar coral, a rare type in the west Atlantic and Caribbean that forms columns or pillars. Kristen Marhaver says that's because their timing was off. KRISTEN MARHAVER: For years, scientists were underwater about 30 minutes after the pillar coral spawned. JOYCE: They were late because they were focusing on another type of coral - elkhorn. It turns out elkhorn coral spawns just after the pillar coral does. Divers were always getting suited up for the elkhorn spawning and missed what the pillar coral was doing underneath their boats. Three years ago, Marhaver and colleagues with a group called Caribbean Research and Management of Biodiversity figured that out. Eventually they nailed down the pillar coral's mating moment. MARHAVER: Three days after the August full moon, 100 minutes after sunset. JOYCE: So the next time they spawned, near the island of Curacao, Marhaver was in the water waiting and saw what looked like a cloud rising from the reef. MARHAVER: They're very flamboyant. It's quite obvious what they're up to. JOYCE: The divers frantically collected sperm and eggs - the gametes as they're called. MARHAVER: You're running around underwater with flashlights and tarps and doing hand signals and collecting tubes, and it's beautiful to see. We screamed through our scuba regulators and snapped millions of photos and breathe our air tanks down really fast. JOYCE: Back at the lab, the team fertilized the eggs with the sperm and bred the coral there, a first for pillar coral. Marhaver describes all this in a journal called BMC Ecology. She says the goal is to return these juvenile corals to the ocean and get them to thrive. Pillar coral isn't doing very well on its own and scientists and don't know exactly why. MARHAVER: Bringing them together in the lab is a little bit of a way of spiking the sauce, ensuring that the gametes meet. And then we can put them back underwater and say, OK, now do your thing. JOYCE: Corals have been doing their thing for ages, but Kim Ritchie, a marine biologist at the Mote Marine Laboratory in Florida, says they don't like surprises. KIM RITCHIE: They're incredibly sensitive to both temperature changes and storm damage. JOYCE: These surprises include warmer water from climate change as well as more acidic water. The acidity increases as the ocean absorbs the extra carbon dioxide that's in the air now from fossil fuels. Ritchie's part of a team of scientists that's written a plan to help coral in U. S. waters survive these changes. Many now are not. They're dying. She says besides breeding coral, scientists are trying to identify strains that are resilient and then put them back in the ocean. RITCHIE: Take eggs and sperm from any coral and then rear them under certain conditions in the laboratory that are already challenging conditions and see which ones make it. JOYCE: The ones that do make it would theoretically have a better chance of surviving back in the sea. Like those broadcast spawners she studies, Ritchie is hopeful. RITCHIE: Nature finds a way, and I don't believe these corals are going to be gone. I believe they're shifting and they will adapt. JOYCE: With a little help from their friends.

He travels the globe collecting ants, bees and wasps. Along the way, he's developed the Schmidt sting pain index - not surprised. It ranks pain on a scale of 1 to 4, 4 being the worst. SCHMIDT: The sting pain scale was basically a scientific tool because I had no numbers for pain. You know, people just said oh, ouch that really hurt. Gee, that really agonized me. Those you can't put into a computer and compare them. INSKEEP: Well, he can now because over three decades, he's added 78 different species to his index. He can rank them because he has been stung well over 1,000 times, including by the one he considers the most painful - the tropical bullet ant.

And you're just, you know, agonizing there. And it doesn't go away. MONTAGNE: Another level 4 bug is the tarantula hawk wasp.

NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Scientists have discovered about 70 glowing fungi. One of the most dramatic grows in the coconut forests of Brazil. Locals call it the coconut flower. It looks like a plain old mushroom until it gets dark, and then you see its eerie green glow. Hans Waldenmaier is part of a research team at the University of Sao Paulo. I caught up with him when he was doing field work on these mushrooms. He says at night their glow is easy to spot. HANS WALDENMAIER: You just have to turn off your flashlight and the mushrooms stand out if they're there. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says when there's no moon. WALDENMAIER: If you have your light off, these green mushrooms, you know, they're basically the only light source that you see inside the forest aside from fireflies. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The question is why would a mushroom glow? Jay Dunlap is a molecular biologist at Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine. He says some researchers have argued that the glow was just an accidental byproduct of metabolism. JAY DUNLAP: In other words, they don't intend to make light, it just sort of happens. GREENFIELDBOYCE: New work from Dunlap's lab casts doubt on that idea. His group collaborated with those researchers in Brazil to study that green glowing mushroom and found that its light production is controlled by a biological clock. DUNLAP: We found that the light was made mostly at night and not mostly during the day. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That suggests it's deliberate. And one possible reason to light up the night is to attract insects. Waldenmaier and his colleagues in Brazil decided to test this possibility by making their own glowing mushrooms. They used an acrylic resin to make mushroom-shaped replicas that were the right size and shape. Inside some of these artificial mushrooms, they put a green LED that made them light up. Dunlap says the researchers coated all of these fake mushrooms with odorless glue. DUNLAP: So then they just put the mushrooms out in the forest and asked who came and got stuck. GREENFIELDBOYCE: It turns out that lots more insects got stuck on the fake mushrooms that were making light. The results appear in the journal Current Biology.

YARROW: It sounds odd, but I do. MARTIN: So what is in - are there some things that are just always in a junk drawer? YARROW: The junk drawer starts out as kind of a way where people feel organized. They keep things that they use all the time in there like scissors and tape and box cutters. And then it sort of becomes a place where, well, this thing is so tiny if I don't put it someplace safe I'll lose it.

There's matchbooks in there that people tell me are from the first date, New Year's horns and ticket stubs and stuff like that.

They can't get rid of it, but they don't necessarily need it. MARTIN: But at the same time, we clearly don't feel compelled to put these things in a proper scrapbook. I mean, I'm the same way. I was digging through my junk drawer, and I found all kinds of stuff - I mean, like, pictures of my kids and their art, you know, like, old tickets to events. And I just can't seem to get myself to the idea of putting them any more proper location. And so they just - the junk drawer, for me, is the place - it's the orphan stuff, the stuff that has no other home. YARROW: Exactly. And if it makes you feel any better, everybody does that. So I think it maybe wouldn't be a bad thing to look at the junk drawer as just sort of like a living scrapbook. And just let it go. MARTIN: Oh, I love that idea.

I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross, who's off today. Last year, 4 million people visited SeaWorld's theme parks where the prized attractions are shows featuring massive killer whales or orcas. For years, activists have charged that keeping orcas in captivity is harmful to the animals and risky for the trainers who work for them - a case that gained urgency in 2010 when Dawn Brancheau, a veteran orca trainer, was dragged into the water and killed by a whale at the SeaWorld Park in Orlando. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE CALL)CHUCK TOMPKINS: Orange County Sheriff's Office. CHRIS DOLD: We need SO to respond for a dead person at SeaWorld. A whale has eaten one of the trainers. TOMPKINS: A whale ate one of the trainers? DOLD: That's correct. DAVIES: That 911 call was featured in the documentary \"Blackfish\" released in 2013. Brancheau was not eaten, as the caller said, but the whale did kill her. The documentary also covers an incident two months earlier at a theme park in Spain, when an orca killed a trainer named Alexis Martinez. The Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigated the tragedy in Orlando and concluded SeaWorld had exposed trainers to hazardous conditions, and it fined the corporation. And its order later upheld on appeal. OSHA also effectively banned SeaWorld from permitting its personnel to enter its tanks to train and perform with orcas, a practice known as waterwork. Our first guest today is John Hargrove, who spent 14 years as a killer whale trainer, mostly at SeaWorld. He eventually became disillusioned with the company's treatment of the orcas and is one of seven former trainers who criticize the company in the documentary \"Blackfish. \" Later in the show, we'll get a response from SeaWorld's curator of zoological operations, Chuck Tompkins, and its vice president of veterinary services, Dr. Chris Dold. Former SeaWorld trainer John Hargrove has a new memoir called \"Beneath The Surface. \"John Hargrove, welcome to FRESH AIR. I'd like to begin with the incident that you describe at the very beginning of the book. You're in France at this point, and you're in the water with a whale named Freya. What happened? JOHN HARGROVE: I had an aggressive incident with her. It was the most severe waterwork aggression I had in my career, and it was the only time in my career in a waterwork aggression where I remember being truly unnerved by it - feeling like that I may not be able to get out of the situation. I had been swimming with her son in another pool, and then I ultimately ended up swimming with Freya. And as soon as I dove into her pool, I had another trainer throw me some fish. And Freya came at me, and I offered the fish to her. She refused the fish, and she immediately started pushing me, with a closed mouth but into my chest, and pushing me into the middle of the pool. While I was trying to deflect off her best I could, but those animals are so incredibly agile. There's no way. So she just stayed on me and just kept on me where there was no way I could deflect off till she had me right in the middle of the pool. And they do that because you're furthest away from safety. You're furthest away from land. You're furthest away from the other trainers. And then she drug the entire length of the side of her body down my body, making contact, so with her underside, her ventral side of her body, with the side of my body. And then she stopped with her tail flukes, one submerged, one above the water. And I didn't know if she was going to hit me in the head with her tail flukes, which would've easily broken my neck. She did not do that, thankfully and obviously, but then she went under. She ultimately sank down below me. She turned sideways. She opened her mouth, and she put the entire width of my body in her mouth right as I called out to the trainer that was closest to me to, you know, get ready to call paramedics. As soon as I said that last word, she pulled me under. She didn't hold me under very long or pull me very deep. And she ultimately opened her mouth, and she and I both floated to the surface together. And I repeated it - call paramedics. And she rolled. She grabbed me again in her mouth. She pulled me under. It was the exact same topography as the first pull-under. DAVIES: And was this a pattern that you recognized? HARGROVE: Certainly, I had seen trainers being pulled under by whales before, and I had been pulled under by whales before. But I had never seen a whale grab a trainer by their torso before. So to feel her entire jaws - and she's 7,000 pounds - around my hip bones. I mean, you know, seeing her, looking her in the eye during the entire incident. So I knew - I could see Freya's eyes still focused on me also, and I knew she wasn't going to let me swim out. DAVIES: This is a harrowing tale, and it goes on. When I read that - and I'm sure as other readers read about that incident, their thought will be, how could you possibly ever get back in the water with a whale again? And when you read the book, I understand because I understand your great affection for these animals and the relationship you built with them. So I want to talk now a bit about these animals, these killer whales, the orcas. You know, it's interesting. You say you have trouble calling them animals. You call them beings. You write that when a killer whale looked you in the eye, you'd see an intelligence. Tell us about that. HARGROVE: There's something almost scary to it - the intelligence level of these animals - their level of problem-solving, how tightly united their social groups are, their family units, especially - not so much just these whales that have been moved around to different parks, but the animals that are true family members. It's really remarkable. DAVIES: You know, few of us follow careers that we've aspired to since childhood, but you have. When did you become enchanted with orcas? HARGROVE: Six-years-old, 1980. It was the first time I ever went to SeaWorld. I was with my mother and my stepfather, and it was the first Shamu Stadium show that I saw. And I just remember being so seduced and mesmerized by it, just seeing, you know, this large stadium and 5,000 people and these incredible animals and seeing people in the water with these animals. And at that point, I was already, of course, an animal lover, but I had never seen anything this size and the magnificence of a killer whale. And so seeing a person interact and having this, you know, relationship with an animal like that - it hit me at a cellular level and never left me. And I, you know, obsessively pursued it from that point forward. DAVIES: Yeah, you describe how you spent time at SeaWorld. You pestered the trainers, talked to them and eventually did all the things you have to do - become an excellent swimmer, go and study, eventually got to Sea World and got to work with killer whales. I'd like you to describe a little bit about what the performances are like there, what you would actually do in the water with the whales, what people would see. HARGROVE: Well, when we'd do shows? When we were still. . . DAVIES: Yeah. HARGROVE: . . . Swimming in the shows? You know, what we would try to highlight in the show is we would try to show the smaller waterwork behaviors that would really kind of show off our relationship with the animals. And then ultimately, we would work our way into the more dramatic behaviors - you know, the hydro hops, the rocket hops where you see the whales throwing us through the air and we're diving off the whale, surf rides. . . DAVIES: Surf rides is where you're holding onto the whale and it just cruises around the arena, yeah? HARGROVE: Well, you're standing on their back and you're riding them like - essentially you're surfing on them. You know, surfing on the back of them like you would a surfboard. You know, so those types of bigger, more dramatic behaviors. So we would like to, you know, showboat the smaller behaviors and show the relationship. And then get into the big, dramatic stuff that, you know, you can't do off of a dolphin, but you can do off of an 8,000-pound killer whale just because of the sheer size and strength of the animal. DAVIES: You mentioned their size. How big is an orca compared to dolphins? HARGROVE: You know, I never worked with dolphins, but my understanding, say, of a bottlenose dolphin, they're roughly around 500, 600 pounds. I'd say more 500, even less than that, certainly, if it's a female. And killer whales - the largest female in the world and actually the first killer whale I ever swam with, Corky - she's in California, she's still alive -  she's 8,200 pounds. Tilikum, who killed Dawn, he was - he is 12,000 pounds. Ulises in California, he's an adult male, he's 10,000 pounds now. So you can see the radical difference in size. DAVIES: Many times larger than a human. Like, it's like being. . . HARGROVE: Absolutely. DAVIES: . . . In the tank with something the size of a truck. HARGROVE: It's an amazing force. I mean, even the smallest behaviors that we do on the animals, people don't realize the force that that creates on our body and the compression on our joints. When you're having an 8,000-pound animal push you around the pool, it's not - you're not effortlessly gliding through the water like most people think. You know, it's like having two SUVs pushing you around and you're just on one foot. And then you're making all the turns and moves and the animal's shifting and - so it's an enormous amount of pressure on your body and joints. And that's why we have so many injuries and so many problems with our bodies later. DAVIES: One of the things you write a lot about in your book are the stresses that killer whales experience living in captivity in SeaWorld. And I want to talk about some of those. Now, in the wild, of course, these animals live their whole lives with a social group that they're very accustomed to who understand their vocalizations. What happens when they're in SeaWorld and are mixed with whales outside their social group? HARGROVE: We see a lot of aggression between the whales. We see - and we would describe it as hyper-aggression. There's a lot of it. There's a lot of raking. So that's when one whale is cutting another whale with their teeth. Sometimes those rakes are superficial, and other times they are very deep and just deep gashes where the whale is, you know, just looks like, you know, profuse bleeding and bleeding out. And, you know, they would have to be on heavy, heavy doses of antibiotics to try to prevent infection setting in, and sometimes infection would set in. And one time, Ulises bit Corky's tail flukes. You can actually still see it if you go to a show - which I don't encourage people to do - but if you just see on video there's a big notch taken out of Corky's fluke, and that was from Ulises biting her, and she nearly died from that from it getting infected. So you see a lot of that type of behavior with the whales in captivity. DAVIES: You know, I - the SeaWorld officials that we spoke to, I asked them this, I mean because clearly there is a lot of raking, which does damage to the whales' bodies. And I said, is this something that you see in the wild? They said yeah, you see it all the time. What do you think? HARGROVE: Well, I think what they're doing is - there's always a half-truth or a part truth to that. You can see raking in the wild, and it's mild, and it's - a lot of times it's playful and, again, it's superficial. And it's not to the level of what I'm describing in captivity. So they try to explain it away with well, you'll see that in the wild, but, no, it's completely different. What you see in the wild - that type of raking is not what you see in captivity in places like at SeaWorld. It's completely different. DAVIES: Our guest is John Hargrove. He spent many years as a trainer of killer whales at SeaWorld. His new book about the experience is called \"Beneath The Surface. \" We'll continue our conversation in a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, we're speaking with John Hargrove. He spent many years training orcas - killer whales - at SeaWorld and has written a book about his experiences. It's called \"Beneath The Surface. \"Now, you say mothers and their offspring will spend their entire lives together in the wild, staying in the same social group. SeaWorld says that it never separates mothers from calves, young children. What is your observation of that? HARGROVE: This is one of the most infuriating things to me because I can tell you, my own personal knowledge - so this is a conservative number - I know of 19 calves we have taken from their mother. DAVIES: Are we talking about a distinction of language here? I mean, is this semantics? I mean, they - I think when they say calves, they mean offspring who are still dependent on their moms, as opposed to, you know, those that are grown and self-sufficient. HARGROVE: This, again, is where SeaWorld tries to be clever and tries to get people with semantics. They've - what they've tried to do is redefine the word calf by saying a calf is no longer a calf once they're not nursing with their mother anymore. And that's just simply - that's just not true. A calf is always a calf. So for example, Kasatka and Takara, when they were separated when Takara was 12, Takara is still Kasatka's calf, and they would remain together for life in the wild. So but of course. . . DAVIES: Did you witness this yourself? HARGROVE: I worked and swam with both of those whales, but when the separation actually happened in 2004, I had just left France. I went on to France, and then I had left France. But then when I came back to the SeaWorld Park in 2008, I was privy to all the details of that incident because Takara then came to Texas. And so now I was working and swimming with Takara again, so I needed to know every single thing that had happened with her since I had last worked with her for my own safety. So one of those things that I had to have knowledge of was that separation that took place in 2004. So I knew every detail and every - of that incident and how the animals responded. And you know, and it was horrific. It was horrific what happened to Kasatka and Takara and still affects them years later. But you know, Takara was not nursing Kasatka at age 12, but she was still Takara's calf. And it was an extremely traumatic event to separate them, and like I said, still is years later. So that's where SeaWorld tries to get people with semantics. And besides, even if - just say, even if that were true, which it's not, SeaWorld has separated mothers from their calves before they had stopped nursing. They took Keet away from Kalina, and he was only 20 months old. And he was still nursing. So, I mean, it has happened. DAVIES: Going back to the separation of the mother Kasatka from her daughter Takara, what manifestations of stress or grieving, if you want to call it that, did Kasatka show when that happened? I mean, they literally took her daughter out of the water. HARGROVE: That's right. We trick the whales when this happens, when there's a separation like that. We'll wait to even bring up the cranes until after we get the animals that are going to be transported to another park. We'll first make sure that we get those whales into the med pool because the whales are so smart, they know that even if they hear the cranes coming up the pathway or certainly if they see them, they won't separate. They won't allow it to happen because they know the - what's the possibility. They're so smart, and they've seen it before that, you know, one of the members of their family or their social group could be taken away from them. So we'll wait until we get them into the med pool, and then once we have them in the med pool, then we drive the crane up. But you know, you'll see just extremely upset vocalizations from whales that are in the med pool and whales that are being taken away and then the whales that they're being taken away from. And in fact, with Kasatka and Takara, Kasatka, who had been in captivity for 30 years, she was emitting vocalizations that had never been heard before ever by anyone. And so they brought in one of their own SeaWorld researchers from the Hubbs Research Institute - SeaWorld Research Institute. She analyzed those vocals and determined that they were long-range vocals. And she was emitting those vocalizations that were determined to be long-range 'cause she was looking - you know, obviously Takara was gone, and she was trying something that - anything that she could to try to locate and communicate with Takara, which is absolutely heartbreaking. And those vocalizations continued on for a long time. DAVIES: You know, I asked the SeaWorld officials about that, and they said, well - they thought that, you know, people like you were misinterpreting some of the vocalizations that occurred in circumstances like that. And further, they said that when they move whales from one facility to another, it's done with careful attention to the social groups so that conflicts don't occur and they don't feel stress from missing family members. HARGROVE: Well, there was no misinterpretation of those vocalizations because I certainly understand what types of vocalizations whales make and what those vocalizations mean. And this information was communicated to me by a senior manager from Shamu Stadium at SeaWorld of California. So obviously that was their determination of their vocalizations, which was communicated to me rightfully so. So there's no real gray area there for any misinterpretation of what those vocalizations might have meant. Everyone clearly understood that it was an extremely traumatic event for both Kasatka and Takara. And I'm sorry, the second part of your question was. . . DAVIES: Well, they were saying that they manage this stuff carefully and pay a lot of attention to social groups, which whales get along, that kind of thing. HARGROVE: Well, OK, then a great rebuttal to that is, if they paid such careful attention to that, they wouldn't have taken Kohana from Takara. Kohana was only 3 years old when they took. . . DAVIES: Kohana was the daughter of Takara, right? HARGROVE: Exactly. DAVIES: OK. HARGROVE: And ironically, up on SeaWorld's - their own page, The Truth About Blackfish, they have a picture of Takara with her calf Kohana, and they say, we do not separate mothers from their calves. OK, right now, Takara is at SeaWorld of Texas, and Kohana is in Spain. So they are separated. And they actually took Kohana away from Takara when she was only 3 years old. And that put Kohana in a social situation where she had no mother at the age of 3 and no other adult females. So what happened was, she was inbred with her Uncle Keto. He inbred her twice. She had the calf. And because she was just a baby, really, no other whale to learn from, no mother to learn from, she rejected both of her calves, and the second calf died within its first year. So I don't think that that would classify as them taking into careful consideration what's best for social pairing when you're starting to inbreed animals. DAVIES: You write that the whales in SeaWorld chew the paint from the bottom of the pools. HARGROVE: They do. They chew it everywhere. They'll chew it off the bottom of the pool. They'll bite the stage. They'll peel it from the sidewalls. They'll peel it from the ledges of the pool just out of sheer boredom because their environment is so horrifically sterile. And in the process, they wear down their teeth. And once their teeth are so badly worn down, they'll develop a pinhole in it. And once that pinhole develops, then they'll get an abscess which can kill them very quickly. So then we're forced, for health reasons - which is a horrible thing for the whales, but it's kind of the lesser of two evils. We have to manually drill that tooth in what's known as a pulpotomy. And then after that, now they have this open pathway directly to the bloodstream, which can kill them. And we have had whales that we believe - that have died from those problems with their teeth. So we have to, every day, invasively irrigate those drilled holes in their teeth. We go in with a metal catheter with a hydrogen peroxide solution and have to invasively irrigate two to three times a day just to try to keep that hole open and not blocked because if you don't - if you don't irrigate very well and you miss something, it does become blocked. They can get that abscess, and they can die, which is what we believe happened with Kalina, the original baby of Shamu who died in 2010. DAVIES: And you would participate in these dental surgeries a lot, right? HARGROVE: Absolutely. Every day, I was a irrigating the whales' teeth that needed to be irrigated, which is, you know, roughly about 50 percent of the whales in our collection. Their teeth are so bad that we've had to drill - so every single day, I was irrigating killer whale teeth. DAVIES: John Hargrove's new memoir is called \"Beneath The Surface. \" After a break, he'll talk about the 2010 incident at SeaWorld's Orlando Park when a whale pulled an experienced trainer into the water and killed her. We'll also hear from two senior officials at SeaWorld. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross. We're speaking with John Hargrove, a former senior trainer of killer whales at SeaWorld's theme parks, who became disillusioned and left the company in 2012. He has a new memoir about his experiences with orcas called \"Beneath The Surface. \"Everything changed for SeaWorld in 2010 when a senior, experienced trainer, Dawn Brancheau, was dragged into the water and killed. Do you want to tell us what happened - your take on that event? HARGROVE: Sure. Dawn was very experienced. She was working with Tilikum during a \"Dine With Shamu,\" the show out front. DAVIES: Tilikum was the whale? Yeah, go ahead. HARGROVE: Yeah, exactly - a 12,000-pound male. And Dawn was on his close-contact team, so only certain approved trainers were on his close-contact team. And she was working with Tilikum the way she was allowed to work with Tilikum. She wasn't breaking any rules or protocols. She wasn't swimming with him. And, you know, he made the choice to grab her and pull her into the pool. We will never know why Tilikum made that choice. And we will never know for sure if Tilikum intended to kill her or if he was just in such a rage. But what we do know without question - even though SeaWorld denies it now publicly, but internally we never denied it and we always discussed it as so - is that it was an aggressive event. So, I mean, even in court, in the OSHA hearings, SeaWorld attempted to try to say it was not aggressive behavior. But I can tell you, all of our senior-level internal meetings, we always discussed it as what it was, which was a highly aggressive event. I mean, he didn't just drown Dawn, he dismembered her. So, I mean, it was definitely - and he never responded to any attempt to call him over. All the emergency recalls that the whales are trained on failed. He never came over, and he was emitting highly upset vocals throughout the entire incident. And again, like I said, in the end, tragically, she was not only dead, but she was dismembered. To say that - even try to claim that it was not aggressive is just vulgar. DAVIES: There are a number of really harrowing episodes that you describe in the book where trainers - there's another one where a trainer named Alexis Martinez was killed at a park in Spain, that while distinct from SeaWorld uses SeaWorld trainers. And then many examples in SeaWorld parks where trainers were in danger. When we spoke to the SeaWorld folks, they said these incidents are extremely rare. Would you agree? HARGROVE: I think they're extremely rare when they're killed and they're dismembered, like with Alexis and Dawn. But aggression towards trainers is not extremely rare, and in fact we just keep that from the public. And if it doesn't happen in the media, if the media doesn't get hold of it, then you guys never hear about it. And the perfect example of that is the one in \"Blackfish\" where Tamarie is pulled in by both Splash and Orkid. We had that videotape under lock and key at Shamu Stadium, and only us Shamu Stadium trainers ever saw that video. But. . . DAVIES: Now, this was Tamarie Tollison. . . HARGROVE: That's right. DAVIES: . . . Who was dragged into the water by a whale named Orkid and bitten, right? HARGROVE: Yeah, Orkid grabbed her by the foot. But then after Orkid pulled her under, Splash and Orkid both held her under, and then Splash crunched her arm, bit her arm, and compound fractured her arm. And she nearly died in that incident; she would've died if Robin Sheets wouldn't have made the decision to take the chain off Kasatka's gate. . . DAVIES: That's an. . . HARGROVE: . . . Because Kasatka was more dominant. So that video only surfaced to the public under the Freedom of Information Act because it was included as evidence in the OSHA hearings - OSHA versus SeaWorld, over Dawn being killed. And my point of that is, is that there are many of those and there are still many of those that the public are not aware of. You know, we would have a lot of major water-work aggressions, we just would not tell them to the public for obvious reasons. DAVIES: For many years, people have criticized keeping orcas in captivity, have criticized SeaWorld. You stuck with the company for a long time, defended it, believed in it. What finally made you leave? HARGROVE: You know, I was a 100 percent SeaWorld loyalist and respected people like Chuck Tompkins. I still have a very high level of respect for Chuck. I know that Chuck loves the whales, but I also understand the position that he's in to protect the company. But what changed for me was that I really - as I became higher ranked, I saw the devastating effects of captivity on these whales, and it just really became a moral and ethical issue. And, you know, when you first start to see it, you first try to say, OK, well, I love these animals; I'm going to take care of them. Then you think, well, I can change things. And then, you know, all these things of course never improve. And then you start getting directed; you start seeing mothers separated from the calves; you start seeing trainers being killed and then they blame them for their own death, and then you - ultimately in court, you know, SeaWorld testify they had no knowledge we had a dangerous job. And for me, that was the final straw. DAVIES: What did your years in the water with orcas do to your body? HARGROVE: Oh, gosh. Well, I have - I've had major sinus surgery here in New York where they had to cut out scar tissue in all four compartments of my sinuses and saw away bone because of the cold, so many years of being exposed to the cold water had caused my bones to thicken in my skull. I have major cartilage destruction in both of my knees and in my back. I've lacerated my face to the skull - 17 stitches to close up. I've broken my foot. I've broken toes. I've broken fingers. I've broken my ribs two times. I've been treated for thoracic strain for a couple of years. Actually, I'm glad it's a little easier now. But, you know, it helps when you're actually not swimming with the whales anymore. But, you know, so I have a laundry list of injuries, and, you know, they're only going to get worse. I'm 41 years old now, and I have these injuries. I mean, they were taking x-rays of me and saying that my back already was reflective of a back of someone in their 60s. DAVIES: And yet you stayed in the water, and I gather in a lot of ways, you really miss it still, don't you? HARGROVE: You know, I'm conflicted. You know, I'll always miss the whales. I love those whales, and they gave me the most unbelievable memories that I'll cherish for the rest of my life. And I was there because I loved them and because I wanted to have that life with them. But I hate the fact that I was a part of a system that took these animals from their natural environment, stripped them away from their family, often killing members of their family in the process. And now that they are treated as a breeding, you know, baby machines and just, you know, stripping the calves away from their mother and moving them around and now there's inbreeding going on. You know, one of the worst examples is the forced artificial insemination. You know, just in July of 2013 they forcibly artificially inseminated Kalia, and she was only 8 years old. In the wild, she wouldn't breed until 13 to 15. So she's not even - she's years away from being fully developed at 8 years old, and they forcibly inseminated her at 8. And I don't think - how can anyone look at these types of things that are going on and say that this is morally and ethically acceptable? It's just not. DAVIES: John Hargrove, thanks so much for speaking with us. HARGROVE: Thank you so much for having me. DAVIES: John Hargrove's new memoir is called \"Beneath The Surface. \" Coming up, we'll hear from SeaWorld's curator of zoological services and its supervisor of veterinary services. This is FRESH AIR. DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. We've heard a lot of criticisms of SeaWorld's treatment of killer whales at its parks and the risks its trainers face. A trainer was killed by a whale in Orlando in 2010. After a lengthy court battle, a judge upheld the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's conclusion that SeaWorld had exposed its trainers to danger and that it should not be allowed to let its personnel enter the water with whales. For a response, we spoke with SeaWorld's curator of zoological operations, Chuck Tompkins, and its vice president of veterinary services, Dr. Chris Dold. Dr. Chris Dold, Chuck Tompkins, welcome to FRESH AIR. Thank you for joining us. You know, a common theme in the film \"Blackfish\" and in John Hargrove's book about his experience is the assertion that the conditions of captivity to the killer whales at SeaWorld are cruel to the animals and create dangerous situations for their trainers. So I want to kind of go through some parts of that. In the film \"Blackfish\" - and John Hargrove makes the same point in his book, that there are cases where mothers were separated from offspring. And it was very traumatic for them. There are clear signs of mourning. And Hargrove believes that this creates behavioral - stresses and behavioral problems. I know SeaWorld says it doesn't separate calves from mothers - calves as - defined as, I guess, younger offspring. But are there - but are moms separated from daughters or sons they've been with their whole lives, and is that a potential - does that then create stress and potential behavioral problems? TOMPKINS: Well, this is Chuck. I've been involved in several moves where we have moved the animals because of social needs or a particular group of animals didn't get along or we wanted a breeding group to be more successful. We have moved adult animals or sub-adult animals, but we've never moved a calf from a mom. DAVIES: What's a calf? How do you define a calf? TOMPKINS: A calf is some - an animal young enough who's still dependent on the mom, still nursing with the mom and still requires the mom's leadership. We think they're probably dependent probably for four to five years. So after that, they start to gain their independence, and very quickly, they become their own animals in the social group. So a calf, to me, is a very young animal who's dependent on the mom. And we've never moved any of those young animals like that. For the animals that we have moved, we obviously are aware of what we're doing and what we're about to do, and we prepare those animals for that move. They spend more time in their own social groups. They've already shown that behavior anyway. And we've trained them to be relaxed during that move. To say that they're uncomfortable or stressed, that's just not the way we do our business at SeaWorld. We don't put any animal in any stressful situation. DAVIES: OK. Now, in the book, and this is also in the film, John Hargrove describes a heartbreaking scene in which a mom - it might've been Kasatka - I have trouble with the whale names - but clearly was distressed and making vocalizations that he'd never heard before, indicating that whatever preparation, she found this very difficult and behaved differently immediately afterward. TOMPKINS: His interpretation of the environment is completely different from mine or any other trainer that was there. These animals are very vocal. And anytime you're doing something different in the environment, these animals can become vocal. But never during these situations have we heard those type of vocals that would indicate stress or uncomfortability or anything of that nature, or we wouldn't continue with the process. DOLD: This is Dr. Dold. There's a theme, and maybe a bit of exaggeration, about each of these processes as described in the film, which I'm certainly familiar with, that really sort of sensationalizes what we're doing in those stories that are told from the standpoint of those who are criticizing us. The main point is that every decision we make around a social setting for the whales, around moving a whale from one park to another one, is founded in respect for the animals. We spend a long time not just, as Chuck mentioned, preparing a whale, if it's going to move, for that move, behaviorally, but also working as a team to decide, is this social situation that we may be creating or changing still going to work for the health and well-being of all of the animals? And there's one last part of this story that I'll share here because the way we manage our whales, as close as we are with the whales that we care for in our parks, it is very different than what a wild killer whale experiences. Remember, 80 percent of our whales, or more now, were born at a park at SeaWorld, and so one of the fundamental differences between a wild killer whale and the killer whales that live at our parks is that they have humans working with them every day. Human beings are a part of their lives. And so when we move a killer whale away from killer whales it's been living with for a long time, and that may be a mother killer whale or another sibling, some of that social group still goes with that whale. If it isn't a couple of the whales already that it grew up with moving with it, it's the trainers that that whale knows, as well as the other whales in its environment. DAVIES: John Hargrove says that the whales chew on the paint in their tanks and sees this as - that this is harmful to their teeth and that it's a sign of stress. DOLD: Killer whales do have worn teeth and a number of our whales have worn teeth. And it's important to note that wild killer whales wear their teeth as well. And just like our killer whales, it's a result of manipulating things in their environment. Remember, killer whales, bottlenose dolphins, these species of toothed whales and dolphins, they don't have hands, and so they use their mouths to manipulate their environment. And you'll see if you look on the Internet, you'll look at photos of stranded killer whales, and you actually see that a lot of them have the exact same tooth profile as our killer whales. If they are manipulating things in their environment or they're brushing against a more abrasive surface, like a wall, there may be some tooth wear as a result. The important difference is, of course, that we have a team of veterinarians there to intervene. If that were to develop into a problem and on the rare occasion that it does, we can step in and provide comprehensive care for it. DAVIES: You spoke earlier about raking. And raking is this activity where one whale will rake its teeth along the skin of another and create some kind of injury. And there are a lot of pictures in the film of raking, of whale skin being damaged and sometimes cuts that bleed. Hargrove writes about this as well. And what they say is that this is evidence of the stress and conflict that these whales experience in captivity. In the wild, when they can swim away from someone there in conflict, you just don't see much raking. Is that true? DOLD: That's not true at all. Raking as a behavior isn't just prevalent in killer whales. It is the norm in any whale or dolphin species with teeth. That's how - one of the fundamental ways that these animals will exert dominance and, as Chuck mentioned, during aggressive interactions. And so this is completely part of normal killer whale behavior and killer whale interaction. It's normal part of bottlenose dolphin behavior and bottlenose dolphin interaction. And, in fact, if you look at some of the very well-known and widely published photo ID catalogs that are out right now that are freely available - and it's great work done by field biologists looking at killer whales as a way of identifying individual whales and following them over time - you'll see that well over 80 percent of those photographs of just the dorsal fins alone and the little part of the back have rake marks from other killer whales as part of those whales. And that's just one small part of the whale. So it's well-known to be part of normal killer whale behavior, even wild killer whales that presumably have the ability to swim out of the way. DAVIES: Dr. Chris Dold is vice president of veterinary services at SeaWorld. Chuck Tompkins is the corporate curator of zoological operations at the parks. This is FRESH AIR, and we'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, we're talking with Dr. Chris Dold; he is a vice president of veterinary services at SeaWorld. Also with us is Chuck Tompkins, the corporate curator of zoological operations. And we're talking about some of the issues raised by the film \"Blackfish\" and a recent book by former trainer John Hargrove. Well, as you know, I mean, there was a terrible tragedy at the SeaWorld in Orlando in 2010 when a trainer, Dawn Brancheau, was killed after she was dragged into the water by a whale. And one of the things that a number of trainers were - felt very angry about was a sense that SeaWorld essentially blamed her for this accident, asserting that she'd had a ponytail and that that might have been the cause, and I think a lot of trainers felt betrayed by it - by the company's posture or what they see as the company's posture on that. Do either of you have opinion - an opinion to share about that? TOMPKINS: Yes, I do. This is Chuck. I was actually the company spokesman during that time. And to be clear, I worked with Dawn her entire career. She was not only somebody that worked with us, but she was also a very, very close friend. That was a terrible emotional time for a lot of people. And we knew the facts and we - as much as we could at the time, we knew that her hair was grabbed, but that was not blaming anybody. We never, never publicly came out and blamed Dawn for anything. I think we were very respectful towards Dawn. I think we were very respectful towards the family. And in the hundred-something interviews that I did shortly after that, we simply stated the basic facts - that we knew what had happened, but we would seek what would happen, what were the facts - and we eventually decided that it was an accident that happened and there was not going to be blame. So I adamantly disagree that we disrespected Dawn in any way, shape or form. DAVIES: Right. Well, and I never found a corporate statement to that effect. However, I mean, as you know, in the subsequent court case, the SeaWorld expert witness, Mr. Andrews, said in his report what led to the event was a mistake by Ms. Brancheau, and the judge quotes that in his opinion and strongly takes issue with it. Is that not in effect blaming her? TOMPKINS: Well, Jeff Andrews was not working for SeaWorld during the time. . . DAVIES: No. But he was represented by your attorneys as an expert witness offering an opinion on the case. TOMPKINS: Yeah, and it was his opinion, not necessarily the opinion of SeaWorld. And I stick by the fact that we've never publicly blamed Dawn and we never would. DAVIES: And there was an initial statement in the initial press accounts by a member of the sheriff's office that the trainer appeared to have slipped or fallen in the pool, which clearly was not the case. And it was said that the sheriff's official made that statement after meeting with SeaWorld officials. Is that right? TOMPKINS: I can't speak to all the specifics. I do know that there was a lot of statements made without sitting down and making sure that we got the right information. I can't speak to what the sheriff said and the validity of what he said, but I do know that after talking with everybody and the trainer who was a witness there as well as some of the other people that were by the side of the pool, that was not the case. DAVIES: As you know, I mean, the judge - the administrative judge in that case, in an opinion which was later upheld in an appeal, I mean, found that SeaWorld had placed its trainers in a hazardous circumstance and ordered changes. Do you think trainers should be in the water with whales? TOMPKINS: Well, obviously having spent 38 years working with killer whales and 25 of those years in the water developing the relationship with those killer whales, there is a very unique relationship and trust that you can acquire with a killer whale. We also need to remember that we need to leave Tilikum out of this mix. Tilikum was never a waterwork animal, never was going to be a waterwork animal. We never treated him like a waterwork animal. DAVIES: Just, just - wait, just - you're using terms - Tilikum is the whale that killed Dawn Brancheau. Waterwork means. . . TOMPKINS: Correct. DAVIES: . . . A trainer. . . TOMPKINS: Getting in the water with a killer whale. DAVIES: Very good, go ahead. TOMPKINS: That's right. But with all the other killer whales, we really develop these type of relationships that there's no way on land that you can develop that type of relationship. These animals are aquatic. They relate in the water. Now, does that mean that we don't have that type of relationship? We have definitely learned to adapt. We're now working these killer whales from the deck, but we're working very hard to keep that relationship. But in my opinion, I still think, based on our safety record and our past experiences, being in the water would be a good thing for a killer whale. DAVIES: After the death of Dawn Brancheau in 2010, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration brought a court action that was an extensive testimony taken in that. And the judge found in that there had been many incidents over the years in which trainers had been involved in dangerous situations, in some cases injured or killed. I mean, doesn't that suggest that your monitoring of these interactions of the animals is far from foolproof? TOMPKINS: No, not at all. I, obviously, was the person that testified during that OSHA case, and, you know, there's a lot of numbers tossed out there and stuff. The reality is we only had a handful of injuries where people left the park to go to the hospital. And that's based on - at that particular time, we had 1. 6 million water interactions with these animals. If you do the math on that, there's a very small percentage of people that had a situation where they were injured working a killer whale. We feel like we had one of the safest programs, and we still have one of the safest killer whale interaction programs in the world. DAVIES: As you know, Judge Welsch's opinion was very critical of the math that you just described. TOMPKINS: I understand that. And I would disagree because I've spent 38 years looking at the statistics and knowing each and every one of those situations. The problem was that a lot of those incidents who were written down were observations where trainers felt like they needed to put it on paper, but nobody was injured. No killer whale acted aggressive more than there was an unusual behavior. An incident does not necessarily mean there was an aggressive moment. An incident means it was a notable behavior that we wanted to keep track of. DAVIES: Well, again the judge says that the record of incidents that SeaWorld produced left out a lot of encounters that probably should've been included. TOMPKINS: No, that was not the case. There was two that was not documented in the document that I showed. But they were - showed up in another document that trainers still had access to. So there was not one situation that all the trainers did not have access to. And to be clear, each trainer is fully aware of the potential of what they're doing, how they're interacting with these animals and also the specifics of the animal that they're working with. DAVIES: Let me ask a broader question. As you know, there are a lot of people who just believe that these animals should not be held captive. And your case is that you do an awful lot for the animals, that they're healthy and well-adjusted. What affirmative good comes from having these animals in captivity and performing? DOLD: There's a lot of good that comes of it. Very, very basically, we as humans are interested in these animals, and so we're interested in everything about them. Those of us who have the privilege to care for them on a daily basis and work with them on a daily basis take as deep a caring and understanding for these animals as we possibly can. And we recognize that we have a social contract, if you will, to do as much as we can with these animals and for these animals. And fundamental to that is not just providing for their comprehensive care and well-being, but it's also to study them and understand them and make them available for others who wish to study and understand them so that we can continue to contribute to the global understanding, scientific understanding, society's understanding of these incredible animals. DAVIES: Dr. Chris Dold, Chuck Tompkins, thanks so much for speaking with us. DOLD: Thanks very much. TOMPKINS: Thank you. DAVIES: Dr. Chris Dold is SeaWorld's vice president of veterinary services. Chuck Tompkins is curator of zoological operations. Earlier, we spoke with John Hargrove, a former SeaWorld trainer. His memoir is called \"Beneath The Surface. \" Tomorrow on FRESH AIR, we talk with actor Benito Martinez who stars in the TV series \"American Crime\" and with John Ridley, creator and executive producer. DAVE DAVIES, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross, who's off today. Last year, 4 million people visited SeaWorld's theme parks where the prized attractions are shows featuring massive killer whales or orcas. For years, activists have charged that keeping orcas in captivity is harmful to the animals and risky for the trainers who work for them - a case that gained urgency in 2010 when Dawn Brancheau, a veteran orca trainer, was dragged into the water and killed by a whale at the SeaWorld Park in Orlando. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE CALL) CHUCK TOMPKINS: Orange County Sheriff's Office. CHRIS DOLD: We need SO to respond for a dead person at SeaWorld. A whale has eaten one of the trainers. TOMPKINS: A whale ate one of the trainers? DOLD: That's correct. DAVIES: That 911 call was featured in the documentary \"Blackfish\" released in 2013. Brancheau was not eaten, as the caller said, but the whale did kill her. The documentary also covers an incident two months earlier at a theme park in Spain, when an orca killed a trainer named Alexis Martinez. The Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigated the tragedy in Orlando and concluded SeaWorld had exposed trainers to hazardous conditions, and it fined the corporation. And its order later upheld on appeal. OSHA also effectively banned SeaWorld from permitting its personnel to enter its tanks to train and perform with orcas, a practice known as waterwork. Our first guest today is John Hargrove, who spent 14 years as a killer whale trainer, mostly at SeaWorld. He eventually became disillusioned with the company's treatment of the orcas and is one of seven former trainers who criticize the company in the documentary \"Blackfish. \" Later in the show, we'll get a response from SeaWorld's curator of zoological operations, Chuck Tompkins, and its vice president of veterinary services, Dr. Chris Dold. Former SeaWorld trainer John Hargrove has a new memoir called \"Beneath The Surface. \" John Hargrove, welcome to FRESH AIR. I'd like to begin with the incident that you describe at the very beginning of the book. You're in France at this point, and you're in the water with a whale named Freya. What happened? JOHN HARGROVE: I had an aggressive incident with her. It was the most severe waterwork aggression I had in my career, and it was the only time in my career in a waterwork aggression where I remember being truly unnerved by it - feeling like that I may not be able to get out of the situation. I had been swimming with her son in another pool, and then I ultimately ended up swimming with Freya. And as soon as I dove into her pool, I had another trainer throw me some fish. And Freya came at me, and I offered the fish to her. She refused the fish, and she immediately started pushing me, with a closed mouth but into my chest, and pushing me into the middle of the pool. While I was trying to deflect off her best I could, but those animals are so incredibly agile. There's no way. So she just stayed on me and just kept on me where there was no way I could deflect off till she had me right in the middle of the pool. And they do that because you're furthest away from safety. You're furthest away from land. You're furthest away from the other trainers. And then she drug the entire length of the side of her body down my body, making contact, so with her underside, her ventral side of her body, with the side of my body. And then she stopped with her tail flukes, one submerged, one above the water. And I didn't know if she was going to hit me in the head with her tail flukes, which would've easily broken my neck. She did not do that, thankfully and obviously, but then she went under. She ultimately sank down below me. She turned sideways. She opened her mouth, and she put the entire width of my body in her mouth right as I called out to the trainer that was closest to me to, you know, get ready to call paramedics. As soon as I said that last word, she pulled me under. She didn't hold me under very long or pull me very deep. And she ultimately opened her mouth, and she and I both floated to the surface together. And I repeated it - call paramedics. And she rolled. She grabbed me again in her mouth. She pulled me under. It was the exact same topography as the first pull-under. DAVIES: And was this a pattern that you recognized? HARGROVE: Certainly, I had seen trainers being pulled under by whales before, and I had been pulled under by whales before. But I had never seen a whale grab a trainer by their torso before. So to feel her entire jaws - and she's 7,000 pounds - around my hip bones. I mean, you know, seeing her, looking her in the eye during the entire incident. So I knew - I could see Freya's eyes still focused on me also, and I knew she wasn't going to let me swim out. DAVIES: This is a harrowing tale, and it goes on. When I read that - and I'm sure as other readers read about that incident, their thought will be, how could you possibly ever get back in the water with a whale again? And when you read the book, I understand because I understand your great affection for these animals and the relationship you built with them. So I want to talk now a bit about these animals, these killer whales, the orcas. You know, it's interesting. You say you have trouble calling them animals. You call them beings. You write that when a killer whale looked you in the eye, you'd see an intelligence. Tell us about that. HARGROVE: There's something almost scary to it - the intelligence level of these animals - their level of problem-solving, how tightly united their social groups are, their family units, especially - not so much just these whales that have been moved around to different parks, but the animals that are true family members. It's really remarkable. DAVIES: You know, few of us follow careers that we've aspired to since childhood, but you have. When did you become enchanted with orcas? HARGROVE: Six-years-old, 1980. It was the first time I ever went to SeaWorld. I was with my mother and my stepfather, and it was the first Shamu Stadium show that I saw. And I just remember being so seduced and mesmerized by it, just seeing, you know, this large stadium and 5,000 people and these incredible animals and seeing people in the water with these animals. And at that point, I was already, of course, an animal lover, but I had never seen anything this size and the magnificence of a killer whale. And so seeing a person interact and having this, you know, relationship with an animal like that - it hit me at a cellular level and never left me. And I, you know, obsessively pursued it from that point forward. DAVIES: Yeah, you describe how you spent time at SeaWorld. You pestered the trainers, talked to them and eventually did all the things you have to do - become an excellent swimmer, go and study, eventually got to Sea World and got to work with killer whales. I'd like you to describe a little bit about what the performances are like there, what you would actually do in the water with the whales, what people would see. HARGROVE: Well, when we'd do shows? When we were still. . . DAVIES: Yeah. HARGROVE: . . . Swimming in the shows? You know, what we would try to highlight in the show is we would try to show the smaller waterwork behaviors that would really kind of show off our relationship with the animals. And then ultimately, we would work our way into the more dramatic behaviors - you know, the hydro hops, the rocket hops where you see the whales throwing us through the air and we're diving off the whale, surf rides. . . DAVIES: Surf rides is where you're holding onto the whale and it just cruises around the arena, yeah? HARGROVE: Well, you're standing on their back and you're riding them like - essentially you're surfing on them. You know, surfing on the back of them like you would a surfboard. You know, so those types of bigger, more dramatic behaviors. So we would like to, you know, showboat the smaller behaviors and show the relationship. And then get into the big, dramatic stuff that, you know, you can't do off of a dolphin, but you can do off of an 8,000-pound killer whale just because of the sheer size and strength of the animal. DAVIES: You mentioned their size. How big is an orca compared to dolphins? HARGROVE: You know, I never worked with dolphins, but my understanding, say, of a bottlenose dolphin, they're roughly around 500, 600 pounds. I'd say more 500, even less than that, certainly, if it's a female. And killer whales - the largest female in the world and actually the first killer whale I ever swam with, Corky - she's in California, she's still alive -  she's 8,200 pounds. Tilikum, who killed Dawn, he was - he is 12,000 pounds. Ulises in California, he's an adult male, he's 10,000 pounds now. So you can see the radical difference in size. DAVIES: Many times larger than a human. Like, it's like being. . . HARGROVE: Absolutely. DAVIES: . . . In the tank with something the size of a truck. HARGROVE: It's an amazing force. I mean, even the smallest behaviors that we do on the animals, people don't realize the force that that creates on our body and the compression on our joints. When you're having an 8,000-pound animal push you around the pool, it's not - you're not effortlessly gliding through the water like most people think. You know, it's like having two SUVs pushing you around and you're just on one foot. And then you're making all the turns and moves and the animal's shifting and - so it's an enormous amount of pressure on your body and joints. And that's why we have so many injuries and so many problems with our bodies later. DAVIES: One of the things you write a lot about in your book are the stresses that killer whales experience living in captivity in SeaWorld. And I want to talk about some of those. Now, in the wild, of course, these animals live their whole lives with a social group that they're very accustomed to who understand their vocalizations. What happens when they're in SeaWorld and are mixed with whales outside their social group? HARGROVE: We see a lot of aggression between the whales. We see - and we would describe it as hyper-aggression. There's a lot of it. There's a lot of raking. So that's when one whale is cutting another whale with their teeth. Sometimes those rakes are superficial, and other times they are very deep and just deep gashes where the whale is, you know, just looks like, you know, profuse bleeding and bleeding out. And, you know, they would have to be on heavy, heavy doses of antibiotics to try to prevent infection setting in, and sometimes infection would set in. And one time, Ulises bit Corky's tail flukes. You can actually still see it if you go to a show - which I don't encourage people to do - but if you just see on video there's a big notch taken out of Corky's fluke, and that was from Ulises biting her, and she nearly died from that from it getting infected. So you see a lot of that type of behavior with the whales in captivity. DAVIES: You know, I - the SeaWorld officials that we spoke to, I asked them this, I mean because clearly there is a lot of raking, which does damage to the whales' bodies. And I said, is this something that you see in the wild? They said yeah, you see it all the time. What do you think? HARGROVE: Well, I think what they're doing is - there's always a half-truth or a part truth to that. You can see raking in the wild, and it's mild, and it's - a lot of times it's playful and, again, it's superficial. And it's not to the level of what I'm describing in captivity. So they try to explain it away with well, you'll see that in the wild, but, no, it's completely different. What you see in the wild - that type of raking is not what you see in captivity in places like at SeaWorld. It's completely different. DAVIES: Our guest is John Hargrove. He spent many years as a trainer of killer whales at SeaWorld. His new book about the experience is called \"Beneath The Surface. \" We'll continue our conversation in a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, we're speaking with John Hargrove. He spent many years training orcas - killer whales - at SeaWorld and has written a book about his experiences. It's called \"Beneath The Surface. \" Now, you say mothers and their offspring will spend their entire lives together in the wild, staying in the same social group. SeaWorld says that it never separates mothers from calves, young children. What is your observation of that? HARGROVE: This is one of the most infuriating things to me because I can tell you, my own personal knowledge - so this is a conservative number - I know of 19 calves we have taken from their mother. DAVIES: Are we talking about a distinction of language here? I mean, is this semantics? I mean, they - I think when they say calves, they mean offspring who are still dependent on their moms, as opposed to, you know, those that are grown and self-sufficient. HARGROVE: This, again, is where SeaWorld tries to be clever and tries to get people with semantics. They've - what they've tried to do is redefine the word calf by saying a calf is no longer a calf once they're not nursing with their mother anymore. And that's just simply - that's just not true. A calf is always a calf. So for example, Kasatka and Takara, when they were separated when Takara was 12, Takara is still Kasatka's calf, and they would remain together for life in the wild. So but of course. . . DAVIES: Did you witness this yourself? HARGROVE: I worked and swam with both of those whales, but when the separation actually happened in 2004, I had just left France. I went on to France, and then I had left France. But then when I came back to the SeaWorld Park in 2008, I was privy to all the details of that incident because Takara then came to Texas. And so now I was working and swimming with Takara again, so I needed to know every single thing that had happened with her since I had last worked with her for my own safety. So one of those things that I had to have knowledge of was that separation that took place in 2004. So I knew every detail and every - of that incident and how the animals responded. And you know, and it was horrific. It was horrific what happened to Kasatka and Takara and still affects them years later. But you know, Takara was not nursing Kasatka at age 12, but she was still Takara's calf. And it was an extremely traumatic event to separate them, and like I said, still is years later. So that's where SeaWorld tries to get people with semantics. And besides, even if - just say, even if that were true, which it's not, SeaWorld has separated mothers from their calves before they had stopped nursing. They took Keet away from Kalina, and he was only 20 months old. And he was still nursing. So, I mean, it has happened. DAVIES: Going back to the separation of the mother Kasatka from her daughter Takara, what manifestations of stress or grieving, if you want to call it that, did Kasatka show when that happened? I mean, they literally took her daughter out of the water. HARGROVE: That's right. We trick the whales when this happens, when there's a separation like that. We'll wait to even bring up the cranes until after we get the animals that are going to be transported to another park. We'll first make sure that we get those whales into the med pool because the whales are so smart, they know that even if they hear the cranes coming up the pathway or certainly if they see them, they won't separate. They won't allow it to happen because they know the - what's the possibility. They're so smart, and they've seen it before that, you know, one of the members of their family or their social group could be taken away from them. So we'll wait until we get them into the med pool, and then once we have them in the med pool, then we drive the crane up. But you know, you'll see just extremely upset vocalizations from whales that are in the med pool and whales that are being taken away and then the whales that they're being taken away from. And in fact, with Kasatka and Takara, Kasatka, who had been in captivity for 30 years, she was emitting vocalizations that had never been heard before ever by anyone. And so they brought in one of their own SeaWorld researchers from the Hubbs Research Institute - SeaWorld Research Institute. She analyzed those vocals and determined that they were long-range vocals. And she was emitting those vocalizations that were determined to be long-range 'cause she was looking - you know, obviously Takara was gone, and she was trying something that - anything that she could to try to locate and communicate with Takara, which is absolutely heartbreaking. And those vocalizations continued on for a long time. DAVIES: You know, I asked the SeaWorld officials about that, and they said, well - they thought that, you know, people like you were misinterpreting some of the vocalizations that occurred in circumstances like that. And further, they said that when they move whales from one facility to another, it's done with careful attention to the social groups so that conflicts don't occur and they don't feel stress from missing family members. HARGROVE: Well, there was no misinterpretation of those vocalizations because I certainly understand what types of vocalizations whales make and what those vocalizations mean. And this information was communicated to me by a senior manager from Shamu Stadium at SeaWorld of California. So obviously that was their determination of their vocalizations, which was communicated to me rightfully so. So there's no real gray area there for any misinterpretation of what those vocalizations might have meant. Everyone clearly understood that it was an extremely traumatic event for both Kasatka and Takara. And I'm sorry, the second part of your question was. . . DAVIES: Well, they were saying that they manage this stuff carefully and pay a lot of attention to social groups, which whales get along, that kind of thing. HARGROVE: Well, OK, then a great rebuttal to that is, if they paid such careful attention to that, they wouldn't have taken Kohana from Takara. Kohana was only 3 years old when they took. . . DAVIES: Kohana was the daughter of Takara, right? HARGROVE: Exactly. DAVIES: OK. HARGROVE: And ironically, up on SeaWorld's - their own page, The Truth About Blackfish, they have a picture of Takara with her calf Kohana, and they say, we do not separate mothers from their calves. OK, right now, Takara is at SeaWorld of Texas, and Kohana is in Spain. So they are separated. And they actually took Kohana away from Takara when she was only 3 years old. And that put Kohana in a social situation where she had no mother at the age of 3 and no other adult females. So what happened was, she was inbred with her Uncle Keto. He inbred her twice. She had the calf. And because she was just a baby, really, no other whale to learn from, no mother to learn from, she rejected both of her calves, and the second calf died within its first year. So I don't think that that would classify as them taking into careful consideration what's best for social pairing when you're starting to inbreed animals. DAVIES: You write that the whales in SeaWorld chew the paint from the bottom of the pools. HARGROVE: They do. They chew it everywhere. They'll chew it off the bottom of the pool. They'll bite the stage. They'll peel it from the sidewalls. They'll peel it from the ledges of the pool just out of sheer boredom because their environment is so horrifically sterile. And in the process, they wear down their teeth. And once their teeth are so badly worn down, they'll develop a pinhole in it. And once that pinhole develops, then they'll get an abscess which can kill them very quickly. So then we're forced, for health reasons - which is a horrible thing for the whales, but it's kind of the lesser of two evils. We have to manually drill that tooth in what's known as a pulpotomy. And then after that, now they have this open pathway directly to the bloodstream, which can kill them. And we have had whales that we believe - that have died from those problems with their teeth. So we have to, every day, invasively irrigate those drilled holes in their teeth. We go in with a metal catheter with a hydrogen peroxide solution and have to invasively irrigate two to three times a day just to try to keep that hole open and not blocked because if you don't - if you don't irrigate very well and you miss something, it does become blocked. They can get that abscess, and they can die, which is what we believe happened with Kalina, the original baby of Shamu who died in 2010. DAVIES: And you would participate in these dental surgeries a lot, right? HARGROVE: Absolutely. Every day, I was a irrigating the whales' teeth that needed to be irrigated, which is, you know, roughly about 50 percent of the whales in our collection. Their teeth are so bad that we've had to drill - so every single day, I was irrigating killer whale teeth. DAVIES: John Hargrove's new memoir is called \"Beneath The Surface. \" After a break, he'll talk about the 2010 incident at SeaWorld's Orlando Park when a whale pulled an experienced trainer into the water and killed her. We'll also hear from two senior officials at SeaWorld. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross. We're speaking with John Hargrove, a former senior trainer of killer whales at SeaWorld's theme parks, who became disillusioned and left the company in 2012. He has a new memoir about his experiences with orcas called \"Beneath The Surface. \" Everything changed for SeaWorld in 2010 when a senior, experienced trainer, Dawn Brancheau, was dragged into the water and killed. Do you want to tell us what happened - your take on that event? HARGROVE: Sure. Dawn was very experienced. She was working with Tilikum during a \"Dine With Shamu,\" the show out front. DAVIES: Tilikum was the whale? Yeah, go ahead. HARGROVE: Yeah, exactly - a 12,000-pound male. And Dawn was on his close-contact team, so only certain approved trainers were on his close-contact team. And she was working with Tilikum the way she was allowed to work with Tilikum. She wasn't breaking any rules or protocols. She wasn't swimming with him. And, you know, he made the choice to grab her and pull her into the pool. We will never know why Tilikum made that choice. And we will never know for sure if Tilikum intended to kill her or if he was just in such a rage. But what we do know without question - even though SeaWorld denies it now publicly, but internally we never denied it and we always discussed it as so - is that it was an aggressive event. So, I mean, even in court, in the OSHA hearings, SeaWorld attempted to try to say it was not aggressive behavior. But I can tell you, all of our senior-level internal meetings, we always discussed it as what it was, which was a highly aggressive event. I mean, he didn't just drown Dawn, he dismembered her. So, I mean, it was definitely - and he never responded to any attempt to call him over. All the emergency recalls that the whales are trained on failed. He never came over, and he was emitting highly upset vocals throughout the entire incident. And again, like I said, in the end, tragically, she was not only dead, but she was dismembered. To say that - even try to claim that it was not aggressive is just vulgar. DAVIES: There are a number of really harrowing episodes that you describe in the book where trainers - there's another one where a trainer named Alexis Martinez was killed at a park in Spain, that while distinct from SeaWorld uses SeaWorld trainers. And then many examples in SeaWorld parks where trainers were in danger. When we spoke to the SeaWorld folks, they said these incidents are extremely rare. Would you agree? HARGROVE: I think they're extremely rare when they're killed and they're dismembered, like with Alexis and Dawn. But aggression towards trainers is not extremely rare, and in fact we just keep that from the public. And if it doesn't happen in the media, if the media doesn't get hold of it, then you guys never hear about it. And the perfect example of that is the one in \"Blackfish\" where Tamarie is pulled in by both Splash and Orkid. We had that videotape under lock and key at Shamu Stadium, and only us Shamu Stadium trainers ever saw that video. But. . . DAVIES: Now, this was Tamarie Tollison. . . HARGROVE: That's right. DAVIES: . . . Who was dragged into the water by a whale named Orkid and bitten, right? HARGROVE: Yeah, Orkid grabbed her by the foot. But then after Orkid pulled her under, Splash and Orkid both held her under, and then Splash crunched her arm, bit her arm, and compound fractured her arm. And she nearly died in that incident; she would've died if Robin Sheets wouldn't have made the decision to take the chain off Kasatka's gate. . . DAVIES: That's an. . . HARGROVE: . . . Because Kasatka was more dominant. So that video only surfaced to the public under the Freedom of Information Act because it was included as evidence in the OSHA hearings - OSHA versus SeaWorld, over Dawn being killed. And my point of that is, is that there are many of those and there are still many of those that the public are not aware of. You know, we would have a lot of major water-work aggressions, we just would not tell them to the public for obvious reasons. DAVIES: For many years, people have criticized keeping orcas in captivity, have criticized SeaWorld. You stuck with the company for a long time, defended it, believed in it. What finally made you leave? HARGROVE: You know, I was a 100 percent SeaWorld loyalist and respected people like Chuck Tompkins. I still have a very high level of respect for Chuck. I know that Chuck loves the whales, but I also understand the position that he's in to protect the company. But what changed for me was that I really - as I became higher ranked, I saw the devastating effects of captivity on these whales, and it just really became a moral and ethical issue. And, you know, when you first start to see it, you first try to say, OK, well, I love these animals; I'm going to take care of them. Then you think, well, I can change things. And then, you know, all these things of course never improve. And then you start getting directed; you start seeing mothers separated from the calves; you start seeing trainers being killed and then they blame them for their own death, and then you - ultimately in court, you know, SeaWorld testify they had no knowledge we had a dangerous job. And for me, that was the final straw. DAVIES: What did your years in the water with orcas do to your body? HARGROVE: Oh, gosh. Well, I have - I've had major sinus surgery here in New York where they had to cut out scar tissue in all four compartments of my sinuses and saw away bone because of the cold, so many years of being exposed to the cold water had caused my bones to thicken in my skull. I have major cartilage destruction in both of my knees and in my back. I've lacerated my face to the skull - 17 stitches to close up. I've broken my foot. I've broken toes. I've broken fingers. I've broken my ribs two times. I've been treated for thoracic strain for a couple of years. Actually, I'm glad it's a little easier now. But, you know, it helps when you're actually not swimming with the whales anymore. But, you know, so I have a laundry list of injuries, and, you know, they're only going to get worse. I'm 41 years old now, and I have these injuries. I mean, they were taking x-rays of me and saying that my back already was reflective of a back of someone in their 60s. DAVIES: And yet you stayed in the water, and I gather in a lot of ways, you really miss it still, don't you? HARGROVE: You know, I'm conflicted. You know, I'll always miss the whales. I love those whales, and they gave me the most unbelievable memories that I'll cherish for the rest of my life. And I was there because I loved them and because I wanted to have that life with them. But I hate the fact that I was a part of a system that took these animals from their natural environment, stripped them away from their family, often killing members of their family in the process. And now that they are treated as a breeding, you know, baby machines and just, you know, stripping the calves away from their mother and moving them around and now there's inbreeding going on. You know, one of the worst examples is the forced artificial insemination. You know, just in July of 2013 they forcibly artificially inseminated Kalia, and she was only 8 years old. In the wild, she wouldn't breed until 13 to 15. So she's not even - she's years away from being fully developed at 8 years old, and they forcibly inseminated her at 8. And I don't think - how can anyone look at these types of things that are going on and say that this is morally and ethically acceptable? It's just not. DAVIES: John Hargrove, thanks so much for speaking with us. HARGROVE: Thank you so much for having me. DAVIES: John Hargrove's new memoir is called \"Beneath The Surface. \" Coming up, we'll hear from SeaWorld's curator of zoological services and its supervisor of veterinary services. This is FRESH AIR. DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. We've heard a lot of criticisms of SeaWorld's treatment of killer whales at its parks and the risks its trainers face. A trainer was killed by a whale in Orlando in 2010. After a lengthy court battle, a judge upheld the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's conclusion that SeaWorld had exposed its trainers to danger and that it should not be allowed to let its personnel enter the water with whales. For a response, we spoke with SeaWorld's curator of zoological operations, Chuck Tompkins, and its vice president of veterinary services, Dr. Chris Dold. Dr. Chris Dold, Chuck Tompkins, welcome to FRESH AIR. Thank you for joining us. You know, a common theme in the film \"Blackfish\" and in John Hargrove's book about his experience is the assertion that the conditions of captivity to the killer whales at SeaWorld are cruel to the animals and create dangerous situations for their trainers. So I want to kind of go through some parts of that. In the film \"Blackfish\" - and John Hargrove makes the same point in his book, that there are cases where mothers were separated from offspring. And it was very traumatic for them. There are clear signs of mourning. And Hargrove believes that this creates behavioral - stresses and behavioral problems. I know SeaWorld says it doesn't separate calves from mothers - calves as - defined as, I guess, younger offspring. But are there - but are moms separated from daughters or sons they've been with their whole lives, and is that a potential - does that then create stress and potential behavioral problems? TOMPKINS: Well, this is Chuck. I've been involved in several moves where we have moved the animals because of social needs or a particular group of animals didn't get along or we wanted a breeding group to be more successful. We have moved adult animals or sub-adult animals, but we've never moved a calf from a mom. DAVIES: What's a calf? How do you define a calf? TOMPKINS: A calf is some - an animal young enough who's still dependent on the mom, still nursing with the mom and still requires the mom's leadership. We think they're probably dependent probably for four to five years. So after that, they start to gain their independence, and very quickly, they become their own animals in the social group. So a calf, to me, is a very young animal who's dependent on the mom. And we've never moved any of those young animals like that. For the animals that we have moved, we obviously are aware of what we're doing and what we're about to do, and we prepare those animals for that move. They spend more time in their own social groups. They've already shown that behavior anyway. And we've trained them to be relaxed during that move. To say that they're uncomfortable or stressed, that's just not the way we do our business at SeaWorld. We don't put any animal in any stressful situation. DAVIES: OK. Now, in the book, and this is also in the film, John Hargrove describes a heartbreaking scene in which a mom - it might've been Kasatka - I have trouble with the whale names - but clearly was distressed and making vocalizations that he'd never heard before, indicating that whatever preparation, she found this very difficult and behaved differently immediately afterward. TOMPKINS: His interpretation of the environment is completely different from mine or any other trainer that was there. These animals are very vocal. And anytime you're doing something different in the environment, these animals can become vocal. But never during these situations have we heard those type of vocals that would indicate stress or uncomfortability or anything of that nature, or we wouldn't continue with the process. DOLD: This is Dr. Dold. There's a theme, and maybe a bit of exaggeration, about each of these processes as described in the film, which I'm certainly familiar with, that really sort of sensationalizes what we're doing in those stories that are told from the standpoint of those who are criticizing us. The main point is that every decision we make around a social setting for the whales, around moving a whale from one park to another one, is founded in respect for the animals. We spend a long time not just, as Chuck mentioned, preparing a whale, if it's going to move, for that move, behaviorally, but also working as a team to decide, is this social situation that we may be creating or changing still going to work for the health and well-being of all of the animals? And there's one last part of this story that I'll share here because the way we manage our whales, as close as we are with the whales that we care for in our parks, it is very different than what a wild killer whale experiences. Remember, 80 percent of our whales, or more now, were born at a park at SeaWorld, and so one of the fundamental differences between a wild killer whale and the killer whales that live at our parks is that they have humans working with them every day. Human beings are a part of their lives. And so when we move a killer whale away from killer whales it's been living with for a long time, and that may be a mother killer whale or another sibling, some of that social group still goes with that whale. If it isn't a couple of the whales already that it grew up with moving with it, it's the trainers that that whale knows, as well as the other whales in its environment. DAVIES: John Hargrove says that the whales chew on the paint in their tanks and sees this as - that this is harmful to their teeth and that it's a sign of stress. DOLD: Killer whales do have worn teeth and a number of our whales have worn teeth. And it's important to note that wild killer whales wear their teeth as well. And just like our killer whales, it's a result of manipulating things in their environment. Remember, killer whales, bottlenose dolphins, these species of toothed whales and dolphins, they don't have hands, and so they use their mouths to manipulate their environment. And you'll see if you look on the Internet, you'll look at photos of stranded killer whales, and you actually see that a lot of them have the exact same tooth profile as our killer whales. If they are manipulating things in their environment or they're brushing against a more abrasive surface, like a wall, there may be some tooth wear as a result. The important difference is, of course, that we have a team of veterinarians there to intervene. If that were to develop into a problem and on the rare occasion that it does, we can step in and provide comprehensive care for it. DAVIES: You spoke earlier about raking. And raking is this activity where one whale will rake its teeth along the skin of another and create some kind of injury. And there are a lot of pictures in the film of raking, of whale skin being damaged and sometimes cuts that bleed. Hargrove writes about this as well. And what they say is that this is evidence of the stress and conflict that these whales experience in captivity. In the wild, when they can swim away from someone there in conflict, you just don't see much raking. Is that true? DOLD: That's not true at all. Raking as a behavior isn't just prevalent in killer whales. It is the norm in any whale or dolphin species with teeth. That's how - one of the fundamental ways that these animals will exert dominance and, as Chuck mentioned, during aggressive interactions. And so this is completely part of normal killer whale behavior and killer whale interaction. It's normal part of bottlenose dolphin behavior and bottlenose dolphin interaction. And, in fact, if you look at some of the very well-known and widely published photo ID catalogs that are out right now that are freely available - and it's great work done by field biologists looking at killer whales as a way of identifying individual whales and following them over time - you'll see that well over 80 percent of those photographs of just the dorsal fins alone and the little part of the back have rake marks from other killer whales as part of those whales. And that's just one small part of the whale. So it's well-known to be part of normal killer whale behavior, even wild killer whales that presumably have the ability to swim out of the way. DAVIES: Dr. Chris Dold is vice president of veterinary services at SeaWorld. Chuck Tompkins is the corporate curator of zoological operations at the parks. This is FRESH AIR, and we'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, we're talking with Dr. Chris Dold; he is a vice president of veterinary services at SeaWorld. Also with us is Chuck Tompkins, the corporate curator of zoological operations. And we're talking about some of the issues raised by the film \"Blackfish\" and a recent book by former trainer John Hargrove. Well, as you know, I mean, there was a terrible tragedy at the SeaWorld in Orlando in 2010 when a trainer, Dawn Brancheau, was killed after she was dragged into the water by a whale. And one of the things that a number of trainers were - felt very angry about was a sense that SeaWorld essentially blamed her for this accident, asserting that she'd had a ponytail and that that might have been the cause, and I think a lot of trainers felt betrayed by it - by the company's posture or what they see as the company's posture on that. Do either of you have opinion - an opinion to share about that? TOMPKINS: Yes, I do. This is Chuck. I was actually the company spokesman during that time. And to be clear, I worked with Dawn her entire career. She was not only somebody that worked with us, but she was also a very, very close friend. That was a terrible emotional time for a lot of people. And we knew the facts and we - as much as we could at the time, we knew that her hair was grabbed, but that was not blaming anybody. We never, never publicly came out and blamed Dawn for anything. I think we were very respectful towards Dawn. I think we were very respectful towards the family. And in the hundred-something interviews that I did shortly after that, we simply stated the basic facts - that we knew what had happened, but we would seek what would happen, what were the facts - and we eventually decided that it was an accident that happened and there was not going to be blame. So I adamantly disagree that we disrespected Dawn in any way, shape or form. DAVIES: Right. Well, and I never found a corporate statement to that effect. However, I mean, as you know, in the subsequent court case, the SeaWorld expert witness, Mr. Andrews, said in his report what led to the event was a mistake by Ms. Brancheau, and the judge quotes that in his opinion and strongly takes issue with it. Is that not in effect blaming her? TOMPKINS: Well, Jeff Andrews was not working for SeaWorld during the time. . . DAVIES: No. But he was represented by your attorneys as an expert witness offering an opinion on the case. TOMPKINS: Yeah, and it was his opinion, not necessarily the opinion of SeaWorld. And I stick by the fact that we've never publicly blamed Dawn and we never would. DAVIES: And there was an initial statement in the initial press accounts by a member of the sheriff's office that the trainer appeared to have slipped or fallen in the pool, which clearly was not the case. And it was said that the sheriff's official made that statement after meeting with SeaWorld officials. Is that right? TOMPKINS: I can't speak to all the specifics. I do know that there was a lot of statements made without sitting down and making sure that we got the right information. I can't speak to what the sheriff said and the validity of what he said, but I do know that after talking with everybody and the trainer who was a witness there as well as some of the other people that were by the side of the pool, that was not the case. DAVIES: As you know, I mean, the judge - the administrative judge in that case, in an opinion which was later upheld in an appeal, I mean, found that SeaWorld had placed its trainers in a hazardous circumstance and ordered changes. Do you think trainers should be in the water with whales? TOMPKINS: Well, obviously having spent 38 years working with killer whales and 25 of those years in the water developing the relationship with those killer whales, there is a very unique relationship and trust that you can acquire with a killer whale. We also need to remember that we need to leave Tilikum out of this mix. Tilikum was never a waterwork animal, never was going to be a waterwork animal. We never treated him like a waterwork animal. DAVIES: Just, just - wait, just - you're using terms - Tilikum is the whale that killed Dawn Brancheau. Waterwork means. . . TOMPKINS: Correct. DAVIES: . . . A trainer. . . TOMPKINS: Getting in the water with a killer whale. DAVIES: Very good, go ahead. TOMPKINS: That's right. But with all the other killer whales, we really develop these type of relationships that there's no way on land that you can develop that type of relationship. These animals are aquatic. They relate in the water. Now, does that mean that we don't have that type of relationship? We have definitely learned to adapt. We're now working these killer whales from the deck, but we're working very hard to keep that relationship. But in my opinion, I still think, based on our safety record and our past experiences, being in the water would be a good thing for a killer whale. DAVIES: After the death of Dawn Brancheau in 2010, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration brought a court action that was an extensive testimony taken in that. And the judge found in that there had been many incidents over the years in which trainers had been involved in dangerous situations, in some cases injured or killed. I mean, doesn't that suggest that your monitoring of these interactions of the animals is far from foolproof? TOMPKINS: No, not at all. I, obviously, was the person that testified during that OSHA case, and, you know, there's a lot of numbers tossed out there and stuff. The reality is we only had a handful of injuries where people left the park to go to the hospital. And that's based on - at that particular time, we had 1. 6 million water interactions with these animals. If you do the math on that, there's a very small percentage of people that had a situation where they were injured working a killer whale. We feel like we had one of the safest programs, and we still have one of the safest killer whale interaction programs in the world. DAVIES: As you know, Judge Welsch's opinion was very critical of the math that you just described. TOMPKINS: I understand that. And I would disagree because I've spent 38 years looking at the statistics and knowing each and every one of those situations. The problem was that a lot of those incidents who were written down were observations where trainers felt like they needed to put it on paper, but nobody was injured. No killer whale acted aggressive more than there was an unusual behavior. An incident does not necessarily mean there was an aggressive moment. An incident means it was a notable behavior that we wanted to keep track of. DAVIES: Well, again the judge says that the record of incidents that SeaWorld produced left out a lot of encounters that probably should've been included. TOMPKINS: No, that was not the case. There was two that was not documented in the document that I showed. But they were - showed up in another document that trainers still had access to. So there was not one situation that all the trainers did not have access to. And to be clear, each trainer is fully aware of the potential of what they're doing, how they're interacting with these animals and also the specifics of the animal that they're working with. DAVIES: Let me ask a broader question. As you know, there are a lot of people who just believe that these animals should not be held captive. And your case is that you do an awful lot for the animals, that they're healthy and well-adjusted. What affirmative good comes from having these animals in captivity and performing? DOLD: There's a lot of good that comes of it. Very, very basically, we as humans are interested in these animals, and so we're interested in everything about them. Those of us who have the privilege to care for them on a daily basis and work with them on a daily basis take as deep a caring and understanding for these animals as we possibly can. And we recognize that we have a social contract, if you will, to do as much as we can with these animals and for these animals. And fundamental to that is not just providing for their comprehensive care and well-being, but it's also to study them and understand them and make them available for others who wish to study and understand them so that we can continue to contribute to the global understanding, scientific understanding, society's understanding of these incredible animals. DAVIES: Dr. Chris Dold, Chuck Tompkins, thanks so much for speaking with us. DOLD: Thanks very much. TOMPKINS: Thank you. DAVIES: Dr. Chris Dold is SeaWorld's vice president of veterinary services. Chuck Tompkins is curator of zoological operations. Earlier, we spoke with John Hargrove, a former SeaWorld trainer.

TOTTEN: Davis's group has been carrying out this sea turtle census for about three years. She estimates there are between 30 and 100 turtles in the area. But why these large tropical creatures chose this place to settle down is a mystery. It's a river sometimes mired in trash, next to a busy road and a military base. DAN LAWSON: When you look around, this is not a tropical paradise or the other things that usually come to your mind when you think about sea turtles.

TOTTEN: But, Lawson says, there's a catch. Over the next decade or so, the plants will phase out this method of using ocean water as a cooling mechanism. That means, eventually, no Jacuzzi. It's unclear how this will affect the federally protected turtles. The cooler water will likely slow their bodies down, but the warmth might not be the only reason they're here.

Its colonies grow twice as fast as the parent species. The United States department of agriculture puts the cost of controlling subterranean termites and repairing the damage they cause at an estimated $11 billion a year. And researchers say the new super termite is potentially even more destructive than other species. From Miami, NPR's Greg Allen reports. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Thomas Chouvenc is a researcher and entomologist with the University of Florida. He moved from France to South Florida for one reason - to study termites. THOMAS CHOUVENC: I come to work every day, and I get surprised every day. Termites will do things you just don't expect. ALLEN: South Florida is one of the few places in the world, along with Taiwan and Hawaii, where the world's two most destructive termite species coexist. Neither the Asian nor the Formosan subterranean termite is native to Florida. Two years ago, Chouvenc was collecting adult-winged Asian termites - alates, as they're called - when he made an important discovery. CHOUVENC: Out of chance, I was using my butterfly nets, you know, catching a few alates from Asian subterranean termite. And, boom, oh - I got both Formosan and Asian at the same time. ALLEN: Both Asian and Formosan termites spend most of their lives below ground. But when a termite colony is large enough, it produces winged adults that swarm and mate. The two termite species had never been known to swarm at the same time before. The researchers believe it's likely happening now because of climate change. But what Chouvenc and his colleagues at the University Florida lab found next was even more important. In an article published today in the journal PLOS ONE, they write that in Florida, the world's two most destructive termite species are mating and producing offspring. In their lab near Fort Lauderdale, Chouvenc pulls from a shelf a vial containing termites he collected in the field just a few days ago - Formosan and Asian, also known as Gestroi termites, now mating and ready to start their own colony. CHOUVENC: And you can see here - this is a Gestroi. And this is Formosan. They were together. This is Gestroi. Formosan is much, much brighter here. And these are two different species. See, they're perfectly happy together. It is not a problem at all. ALLEN: The Formosan females are larger than female Asian termites. For some reason, they're even more attracted to male Asian termites than their own species. The resulting offspring are hybrids. The coloration's somewhere in the middle between the orange Formosan and the darker Asian termites. Chouvenc opens a plastic container containing a colony that's 1-year-old. CHOUVENC: These are the hybrids. So when we compare the number of individuals from hybrids to the parental species, they tend to be between 20 percent and actually 200 percent higher. So it's almost a double number of termites compared to the parental species. ALLEN: A larger, faster growing colony means the hybrids are likely to be even more destructive than either parent species. But there are still many questions - the top one is will the hybrids to be sterile, or will they be able to reproduce and create new colonies on their own? Another question, almost as important, is what kind of climate will they tolerate? Asian termites need a tropical climate and so aren't seen in the continental U. S. outside of Florida. Ed Vargo, a professor of urban entomology at Texas A&M, wasn't involved in the research but was part of the team that reviewed the findings. He says if the hybrid termites take after their Formosan parents and tolerate a temperate climate, they could be very destructive. ED VARGO: 'Cause if that's the case, then these colonies, in addition to spreading on their own, could be moved around by people. And then you'd have this sort of highly destructive super termite - potentially cause very extensive damage in those areas where it can become established. ALLEN: Chouvenc and his colleagues hope to start getting answers to some of these questions as they investigate how far the new hybrid termites have spread in South Florida.

A warming climate is altering that mosaic in unpredictable ways. And as NPR's Christopher Joyce reports, new research shows the pace of change in parts of the Antarctic is accelerating. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Many of the ice sheets that blanket Antarctica run right down to the land's edge and then out into the ocean, where they form floating ice shelves. Some of those shelves have been shrinking lately. Now a team of scientists has discovered that shelves in the west Antarctic are shrinking a lot faster than they realized. HELEN FRICKER: We are starting to lose more ice at a faster rate. We're accelerating. JOYCE: Helen Fricker, a climate scientist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California, says the rate of shrinking has increased by 70 percent over the past decade. That's based on satellite measurements of the ice taken over an 18-year period. Briefer snapshots of the ice had missed the overall trend. Important? Yes because the enormous mass of ice sitting on the Antarctic bedrock - grounded ice, it's called - is held back from the ocean by those shrinking ice shelves. FRICKER: They're stopping that grounded ice flowing off the continent into the ocean just by being there. So it's kind of like a restraining force. JOYCE: What keeps climate scientists awake at night is what happens if the shelves thin down to the point of collapse? Huge ice sheets on land could flow into the ocean. That's new ice added to the sea, making its overall level rise. FRICKER: If you're sitting at the bar with a gin and tonic and you've got it full and the bar person decides they want to put an extra ice cube in, it's going to spill your drink. JOYCE: The grounded ice in the west Antarctic alone could raise sea levels around the world by over 9 feet if all of it melted. The research appears in the journal Science. Polar climate expert Richard Alley at Penn State University says scientists don't know how much melting these ice shelves can take before they collapse. RICHARD ALLEY: It's toppling the domino. You don't push quite hard enough, and nothing happens. And you push a little bit harder, and it falls over. JOYCE: And as to what's causing the shrinking. . . ALLEY: Some combination of slightly warmer water. But more so, it is winds changing in ways that bring warmer water to the ice sheet. JOYCE: No one thinks an Arctic Armageddon is imminent. But things can happen quickly. In 2002, and Antarctic shelf called Larsen B did collapse in just three weeks. It was the size of Rhode Island. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

FRICKER: They're stopping that grounded ice flowing off the continent into the ocean just by being there. So it's kind of like a restraining force. JOYCE: What keeps climate scientists awake at night is what happens if the shelves thin down to the point of collapse? Huge ice sheets on land could flow into the ocean. That's new ice added to the sea, making its overall level rise. FRICKER: If you're sitting at the bar with a gin and tonic and you've got it full and the bar person decides they want to put an extra ice cube in, it's going to spill your drink. JOYCE: The grounded ice in the west Antarctic alone could raise sea levels around the world by over 9 feet if all of it melted. The research appears in the journal Science. Polar climate expert Richard Alley at Penn State University says scientists don't know how much melting these ice shelves can take before they collapse. RICHARD ALLEY: It's toppling the domino. You don't push quite hard enough, and nothing happens. And you push a little bit harder, and it falls over. JOYCE: And as to what's causing the shrinking. . . ALLEY: Some combination of slightly warmer water. But more so, it is winds changing in ways that bring warmer water to the ice sheet. JOYCE: No one thinks an Arctic Armageddon is imminent. But things can happen quickly. In 2002, and Antarctic shelf called Larsen B did collapse in just three weeks. It was the size of Rhode Island.

Often, it's more like this. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO GAME, \"SUPER MARIO BROS. \")RAZ: \"Super Mario Bros. ,\" one of the most popular video games of all time. This one and other games like it take up a lot of our time. JANE MCGONIGAL: On the computers, the consoles, the iPads, the phones - there are a billion people now on the planet who spend, on average, an hour a day playing games on connected devices. RAZ: That is, as Jane McGonigal says, a billion hours a year. Jane researches video games. We heard from her earlier in the show. And she's trying to challenge the idea that those billion hours of video game play are a waste of time. Here's part of her TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MCGONIGAL: Now, this may surprise you, but it turns out, there's actually some scientific research on this question. It's true. Hospice workers, the people who take care of us at the end of our lives, recently issued a report on the most frequently expressed regrets that people say when they are literally on their death beds - I wish I hadn't worked so hard, I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends, I wish I had let myself be happier. Now, as far as I know, no one ever told one of the hospice workers, I wish I'd spent more time playing video games. But when I hear these regrets of the dying, I can't help but hear deep human cravings that games actually help us fulfill. For example, I wish I hadn't worked so hard. For many people, this means I wish I'd spent more time with my family, with my kids when they were growing up. Well, we know that playing games together has tremendous family benefits. A recent study from Brigham Young University School of Family Life reported that parents who spend more time playing video games with their kids have much stronger real-life relationships with them. I wish I'd stayed in touch with my friends - well, hundreds of millions of people use social games like \"FarmVille\" or \"Words With Friends\" to stay in daily contact with real-life friends and family. A recent study from Michigan University showed that these games are incredibly powerful relationship-management tools. They help us stay connected with people in our social network that we would otherwise grow distant from if we weren't playing games together. I wish I'd let myself be happier - well, here I can't help but think of the groundbreaking clinical trials recently conducted at East Carolina University that showed that online games can outperform pharmaceuticals for treating clinical anxiety and depression. Just 30 minutes of online game play a day was enough to create dramatic boosts in mood and long-term increases in happiness. RAZ: So, I get like, you're surrounded by this research and all this evidence, but I wonder like, when you play video games and you're indoors and you're alone and maybe you're not even moving that much, like, I'm wondering how that really improves us? MCGONIGAL: I fully concede that people who worry about that have some very compelling evidence on their side. For example, we know that the average \"Call Of Duty\" player spends the equivalent of one month of full-time work every single year playing \"Call Of Duty. \" So it does make you worry is this a good investment of time, doing something that we know in anywhere between three to eight percent of active game players identify as addicted and self-identify as having negative impacts on their real lives? That's actually where I've focused my research over the past three years, trying to figure out what makes a difference between somebody who is going to spend 20 hours a week playing video games who will have positive impacts on their lives as a result. Would you like to know what that difference is. . . RAZ: Yeah, please. MCGONIGAL: . . . By the way? (Laughter). So, the number-one thing is whether they are trying to avoid feelings or thinking about problems, if they view games as this escape. But there's another kind of player who play games with family members because they want to spend quality time together, or they know they're stressed out after a bad day at school or work and they want to be in a better mood before they tackle their homework or a project they brought home. And that's the only difference. There's - tons of studies have shown, if you are able to feel like game play is part of your everyday real life then you are far less likely to see a negative impact on your life goals. RAZ: So the redemptive power of playing games is an idea that Jane McGonigal has been studying for most of her academic career. And a few years ago, she got the chance to test that idea on herself in real life. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MCGONIGAL: It started two years ago when I hit my head and got a concussion. Now, the concussion didn't heal properly and after 30 days, I was left with symptoms like nonstop headaches, nausea, vertigo, memory loss, mental fog. My doctor told me that in order to heal my brain I had to rest it, so I had to avoid everything that triggered my symptoms. For me that meant no reading, no writing, no videogames, no work or email, no running, no alcohol, no caffeine. In other words - and I think you see where this is going - no reason to live. (LAUGHTER)MCGONIGAL: Of course it's meant to be funny, but in all seriousness, suicidal ideation is quite common with traumatic brain injuries. It happens to 1 in 3, and it happened to me. My brain started telling me, Jane, you want to die. It said, you're never going to get better. It said, the pain will never end. And these voices became so persistent and so persuasive that I started to legitimately fear for my life, which is the time that I said to myself after 34 days - and I will never forget this moment - I said, I am either going to kill myself or I'm going to turn this into a game. Now, why a game? Well, I knew from researching the psychology of games for more than a decade, that when we play a game - and this is in the scientific literature - we tackle tough challenges with more creativity, more determination, more optimism and we're more likely to reach out to others for help. And I wanted to bring these gamer traits to my real-life challenge. So I created a role-playing recovery game called \"Jane The Concussion Slayer. \" Now, this became my new secret identity. And the first thing I did as the slayer was call my twin sister - I have an identical twin sister named Kelly - and tell her, I'm playing a game to heal my brain and I want you to play with me. This was an easier way to ask for help. She became my first ally in the game. My husband Kiyash joined next. And together, we identified and battled the bad guys - now, this was anything that could trigger my symptoms and therefore slow down the healing process - things like bright lights and crowded spaces. We also collected and activated power-ups. This was anything I could do on even my worst day to feel just a little bit good, just a little bit productive, things like cuddling my dog for 10 minutes or getting out of bed and walking around the block just once. RAZ: The game was that simple - adopt a secret identity, recruit allies, battle bad guys. It wasn't a video game, it was just a new game-like way of approaching a problem. And amazingly, after just a few days of play, Jane's fog of depression and anxiety began to fade. MCGONIGAL: It just vanished. It felt like a miracle. Now, it wasn't a miracle cure for the headaches or the cognitive symptoms. That lasted for more than a year and it was the hardest year of my life by far. But even when I still had the symptoms, even while I was still in pain, I stopped suffering. Now, what happened next with the game surprised me. I put up some blog posts and videos online explaining how to play, but not everybody has a concussion, obviously not everyone wants to be the slayer. So I renamed the game \"SuperBetter,\" and soon I started hearing from people all over the world who were adopting their own secret identity, recruiting their own allies and they were getting super better facing challenges like cancer and chronic pain, depression and Crohn's disease. And I could tell from their messages that the game was helping them in the same ways that it helped me. (SOUNDBITE OF INTERNET VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Hi, I'm Mike, and I'm getting super better from depression. RAZ: Thousands of people have played \"SuperBetter\" through an interactive website that Jane built. And some of them have kept video diaries. (SOUNDBITE OF INTERNET VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: My \"SuperBetter\" challenge is sleeping better. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: To, each day, take a creative photograph. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Lowering my stress. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: To lose 45 to 50 pounds. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: . . . And controlling anxiety. RAZ: Watching the success of her game, Jane began to wonder what exactly she had tapped into. So she spent the next couple of years. . . MCGONIGAL: Doing more research to understand the brain chemistry of gaming so that I could understand better why this game helped me and why it's helped so many other people. One thing that I know now is that games do a very powerful job of increasing the amount of dopamine in your brain. RAZ: Dopamine is one of those brain chemicals that makes you feel good. You get it from exercise, you get it from food. And when you play a game you get it because. . . MCGONIGAL: Every time you make a prediction or you take an action that could potentially have a positive result, your brain increases dopamine because it helps you learn. RAZ: So in \"SuperBetter,\" for example, by taking a big goal and breaking it into lots of tiny ones, Jane was able to create a bunch of small opportunities for players to succeed. And those opportunities were called power-ups. (SOUNDBITE OF INTERNET VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Now that I'm so far into \"SuperBetter,\" I almost feel like there's a ding that goes off in my head and then I'm like, oh hey, I just did a power-up. RAZ: And with each power-up, more dopamine in the brain, until those little victories begin to add up. (SOUNDBITE OF INTERNET VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: I just got back from the gym and I'm recording this just because I'm so excited to tell you that I have actually reached my weight loss goal already, in week five. I'm thrilled. (Laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MCGONIGAL: When we're in game worlds, I believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves - the most likely to help at a moment's notice, the most likely to stick with a problem as long as it takes, to get up after failure and try again. And in real life when we face failure, when we confront obstacles, we often don't feel that way. We feel overcome, we feel overwhelmed, we feel anxious, maybe depressed, frustrated or cynical. We never have those feelings when we're playing games, they just don't exist in games. RAZ: Yeah. So like, it seems to me that it's not even necessarily about video games, but it's that video games are what most people are playing. So, I don't know, we might as well figure out a way to make them work for us. MCGONIGAL: Absolutely. I have come to realize that video games are just one way to develop this incredibly powerful tool kit of psychological resources. So I call this gameful psychology, right? It's a way of looking at challenges, it's a way of generating social support, it's a way of activating positive emotions when you're facing something difficult. That's why video games, to me, are so exciting when we think about how might we treat depression or anxiety differently, how might we help people achieve their health goals? It's not that they need to play more video games or that video games are going to be the path to achieving these goals, it's that so many people have already cultivated these psychological strengths. And I want to help them bring those strengths to their real lives. RAZ: Jane McGonigal, video game designer. She's got three Ted Talks, all up at ted. com.

I'm Guy Raz. Here's a question to start the show with. Why is it sometimes so hard to feel empathy for strangers? JEFF MOGIL: Because you're stressed by them. RAZ: You're stressed by them? MOGIL: Yeah, and I think this is something that, you know, people don't think about a lot, but it's true. RAZ: This is Jeff Mogil. He's a neuroscientist at McGill University in Canada. MOGIL: I mean, for most of the history of our species, we were living in groups of, you know, a hundred people or so, we knew all of them and we didn't have empathy for strangers. But that was fine because we barely ever saw any strangers. RAZ: Which is why today, if you take any two strangers and you put them in a room together, as Jeff did in a recent study. . . MOGIL: You know, they weren't doing anything. They weren't competing in any way. But the very fact that you took two people and stuck them in a room and closed the door increased stress levels in both of them. RAZ: It increased their heart rates and made their palms sweaty because. . . JANE MCGONIGAL: You're trying to figure out if you can trust them. You're trying to see if you have anything in common. It's harder to relate them, to talk to them when you don't have any familiarity. RAZ: This is Jane McGonigal. She's a videogame designer, and Jane told us about Jeff's study. MCGONIGAL: A great new study that just came out a couple of weeks ago. RAZ: And Jeff wanted to test out the hypothesis that being around strangers creates stress which decreases empathy. MCGONIGAL: They tested this by using your perception of pain if you both plunge your hands into a freezing cold bucket of ice water. MOGIL: For 30 seconds, and then they immediately take their hands out and they give a rating. MCGONIGAL: And they would ask you to rate how painful it was and how much pain you thought the other person was feeling. RAZ: And so Jeff gave each subject the pain test three times, once with a stranger in the room, both of them plunge their hands into the water; once alone, nobody else in the room; and then one more time, but this time with a friend and again, both of them plunge their hands into the water. MOGIL: And what we found was if they were tested across from their friend, their pain was worse than when they were tested by themselves. But if people were tested across from a stranger, their pain was the same as when they were tested by themselves. RAZ: How does that make sense? Like, you would think that if you're across from your friend, it would be OK because your friend is there and you would - it wouldn't be as painful 'cause you're both going through this thing, right? MOGIL: You would, wouldn't you? RAZ: Yeah, right. MOGIL: That's the amazing thing about it. And the only explanation is that the pain from your friend is adding to your own pain just a little bit, making your experience of your own pain worse. RAZ: This is a form of empathy called emotional contagion. And what Jeff found is that it happens between friends, but not between strangers. MOGIL: The stranger's pain doesn't affect you at all. RAZ: Wow. So we're really, like, wired not to care about strangers. MOGIL: Yeah, I mean, yes (laughter). RAZ: That sort of sucks. MOGIL: (Laughter) I guess so. RAZ: So the final question for Jeff Mogil and his researchers at McGill University was, could there be a way to reduce stress and create empathy between two strangers who had just met? MCGONIGAL: These researchers found that you can essentially reduce the level of stress that you have interacting with a stranger to nothing by playing \"Rock Band\" for 15 minutes. (SOUNDBITE OF ACDC SONG, \"BACK IN BLACK\")RAZ: \"Rock Band\" - the videogame, of course, where you play plastic instruments. MCGONIGAL: You play the drums. I play the guitar. MOGIL: They were working together for the same score. MCGONIGAL: It's a pretty cooperative game. And for 15 minutes, you play this game together. You will then test at the same level of stress as you would with one of your closest friends. RAZ: So in just 15 minutes, if you played \"Rock Band\" with just a stranger, you would start to feel empathy towards them? MOGIL: That's what we showed. So what was blocking the empathy effect in strangers was stress. And playing \"Rock Band\" together blocked the stress. Block the stress, the empathy can emerge. MCGONIGAL: You would literally feel their pain more. . . RAZ: Wow. MCGONIGAL: . . . If you had played a videogame with them. RAZ: Jane McGonigal has actually done a lot of this kind of research herself. MCGONIGAL: I'm a researcher of games and how they change how we think and act in our real lives. RAZ: And Jane, like the other TED speakers on the show today, has wondered how play can make us better at other things in life, whether it can make us healthier, more creative, more social. And as we'll hear, play can mean a lot of things, like building a tree house or pulling off an elaborate prank or in Jane's case, playing video games. MCGONIGAL: I don't know about you, I'm so sick of talking about the same things when it comes to games. All the things that we worry about - our kids aren't getting enough exercise or, oh, there's so much violence in popular media. I mean, these things are all true, but at the end of the day, how does it help us take advantage of the beneficial aspects of games? It doesn't. RAZ: We'll hear more from Jane later in the show. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. Here's a question to start the show with. Why is it sometimes so hard to feel empathy for strangers? JEFF MOGIL: Because you're stressed by them. RAZ: You're stressed by them? MOGIL: Yeah, and I think this is something that, you know, people don't think about a lot, but it's true. RAZ: This is Jeff Mogil. He's a neuroscientist at McGill University in Canada. MOGIL: I mean, for most of the history of our species, we were living in groups of, you know, a hundred people or so, we knew all of them and we didn't have empathy for strangers. But that was fine because we barely ever saw any strangers. RAZ: Which is why today, if you take any two strangers and you put them in a room together, as Jeff did in a recent study. . . MOGIL: You know, they weren't doing anything. They weren't competing in any way. But the very fact that you took two people and stuck them in a room and closed the door increased stress levels in both of them. RAZ: It increased their heart rates and made their palms sweaty because. . . JANE MCGONIGAL: You're trying to figure out if you can trust them. You're trying to see if you have anything in common. It's harder to relate them, to talk to them when you don't have any familiarity. RAZ: This is Jane McGonigal. She's a videogame designer, and Jane told us about Jeff's study. MCGONIGAL: A great new study that just came out a couple of weeks ago. RAZ: And Jeff wanted to test out the hypothesis that being around strangers creates stress which decreases empathy. MCGONIGAL: They tested this by using your perception of pain if you both plunge your hands into a freezing cold bucket of ice water. MOGIL: For 30 seconds, and then they immediately take their hands out and they give a rating. MCGONIGAL: And they would ask you to rate how painful it was and how much pain you thought the other person was feeling. RAZ: And so Jeff gave each subject the pain test three times, once with a stranger in the room, both of them plunge their hands into the water; once alone, nobody else in the room; and then one more time, but this time with a friend and again, both of them plunge their hands into the water. MOGIL: And what we found was if they were tested across from their friend, their pain was worse than when they were tested by themselves. But if people were tested across from a stranger, their pain was the same as when they were tested by themselves. RAZ: How does that make sense? Like, you would think that if you're across from your friend, it would be OK because your friend is there and you would - it wouldn't be as painful 'cause you're both going through this thing, right? MOGIL: You would, wouldn't you? RAZ: Yeah, right. MOGIL: That's the amazing thing about it. And the only explanation is that the pain from your friend is adding to your own pain just a little bit, making your experience of your own pain worse. RAZ: This is a form of empathy called emotional contagion. And what Jeff found is that it happens between friends, but not between strangers. MOGIL: The stranger's pain doesn't affect you at all. RAZ: Wow. So we're really, like, wired not to care about strangers. MOGIL: Yeah, I mean, yes (laughter). RAZ: That sort of sucks. MOGIL: (Laughter) I guess so. RAZ: So the final question for Jeff Mogil and his researchers at McGill University was, could there be a way to reduce stress and create empathy between two strangers who had just met? MCGONIGAL: These researchers found that you can essentially reduce the level of stress that you have interacting with a stranger to nothing by playing \"Rock Band\" for 15 minutes. (SOUNDBITE OF ACDC SONG, \"BACK IN BLACK\") RAZ: \"Rock Band\" - the videogame, of course, where you play plastic instruments. MCGONIGAL: You play the drums. I play the guitar. MOGIL: They were working together for the same score. MCGONIGAL: It's a pretty cooperative game. And for 15 minutes, you play this game together. You will then test at the same level of stress as you would with one of your closest friends. RAZ: So in just 15 minutes, if you played \"Rock Band\" with just a stranger, you would start to feel empathy towards them? MOGIL: That's what we showed. So what was blocking the empathy effect in strangers was stress. And playing \"Rock Band\" together blocked the stress. Block the stress, the empathy can emerge. MCGONIGAL: You would literally feel their pain more. . . RAZ: Wow. MCGONIGAL: . . . If you had played a videogame with them.

ISABEL BEHNCKE: My name is Isabel Behncke. RAZ: Isabel's a primatologist. BEHNCKE: That means that I study the social behavior of primates. RAZ: And early in her career, during a research study. . . BEHNCKE: In a zoo in England, when I was comparing the behavior of chimpanzees and bonobos. . . RAZ: Isabel started to notice something with the bonobos in particular. BEHNCKE: Part from this incredible tolerant nature that bonobos have, they seem to play a lot. RAZ: Lots of chasing, laughing and so on for hours. And it wasn't just the kid bonobos that played; it was the adults as well. BEHNCKE: And that is really unusual. RAZ: It's unusual because while almost every kid mammal plays, when they grow up. . . BEHNCKE: They stop playing. RAZ: At least most species, including humans. But in just a handful. . . BEHNCKE: You get this apparently weird phenomena that the adults play. RAZ: I mean, so are bonobos, like, outliers? BEHNCKE: Yes, bonobos are outliers. So many other adult primates play - chimpanzees for instance - but they are outliers in the extent of the play, how much they play. You know, if I show you the network of play, it's amazing because basically everyone plays with almost everyone. And that's very, very unusual. RAZ: So Isabel thought perhaps play, at least for bonobos, wasn't frivolous. BEHNCKE: That's why I realized, gosh, maybe there's something about the complexity of play, particularly adult play that is related to intelligence, to basically creativity, to trust. RAZ: In other words, maybe play is essential for their survival. But to find out, Isabel needed to get out of the zoo. And so she thought. . . BEHNCKE: Let's try and find adult play in the wild. RAZ: So off she went to the jungles of Congo to study one particular family of bonobos. BEHNCKE: This is a group called the kamikake (ph) group. There's around 30 bonobos. RAZ: How do you study them? Like, do you, like, film them? Or do you just sort of hang out behind bushes and just kind of watch them quietly? BEHNCKE: I would love that it's just the hanging out behind bushes, but it's rather following them through the jungle wherever they go because it's studying a wild community. So that means that I have walked around 3,000 kilometers in learning their behavior. RAZ: Can you describe what you were seeing? What were they doing? How were they playing? BEHNCKE: So first of all, they chase; they bite; they tickle; many times they laugh. (SOUNDBITE OF BONOBO LAUGH)RAZ: A bonobo laugh, it turns out, sounds like this. (SOUNDBITE OF BONOBO LAUGH)BEHNCKE: There's other types of play where it's also this relationship between risk-taking, trust and ambiguity. For instance, imagine an adult sitting on a high branch, OK? Then a smaller individual comes, say a juvenile, and the adult grabs the arm of the juvenile and then balances him from the branch, right? So he could let him go and he doesn't. But obviously he trusts him. RAZ: And by the time Isabel left Congo, she realized that for bonobos, play is a kind of social glue. BEHNCKE: The group is actually connected through play, through this sense of joy of positive emotion that spreads and creates more positive emotion and trust in turn. RAZ: When you observed this, did you start to think, I wonder how this relates to us, to humans, and in our relationship with play? BEHNCKE: Yes. We share a common root for play. Our reward system in our brains, it's over-developed so obviously we have a capacity for positive emotion and joy that has been an important drive in our evolution. You see live expressions of these roots in normal human behavior, anything from expression in fashion to competitive sports to literature. Of course, that's where you suspend your belief and you go into these fictional worlds quite happily because that's what play does. It suspends reality. Things that don't usually happen can happen. So we train our brain to explore all these different worlds safely. RAZ: Here's Isabel's TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BEHNCKE: Bonobos, like humans, love to play throughout their entire lives. Play is not just child's games. For us and them, play's foundational for building relationships and fostering tolerance. It's where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game. Play increases creativity and resilience, and it's all about the generation of diversity - diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections. And when you watch bonobo play, you're seeing the very evolutionary roots of human laughter, dance and ritual. But they also hold a secret for our future, a future where we need to adapt to an increasingly challenging world through greater creativity and greater cooperation. The secret is that play is the key to these capacities. In other words, play is our adaptive wildcard. In order to adapt successfully to a changing world, we need to play. But will we make the most of our playfulness? Play is not frivolous. For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just read in tooth and claw. In times when it seems least appropriate to play, it might be the times when it's most urgent. RAZ: So if play is so important, then how much play do we need - do humans need? We'll hear more from Isabel Behncke and her ideas about play in just a moment. I'm Guy Raz, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about play, and also about how some of our closest relatives play. (SOUNDBITE OF BONOBOS)BEHNCKE: In particular, bonobos. They are great apes. RAZ: We've been talking with primatologist Isabel Behnckee who spent a lot of time in the Congolese jungle studying bonobos where she got the idea that play for humans, like bonobos, isn't just for fun. BEHNCKE: Think of human festivals, OK? Humans have had festivals since ancient times. We know hunter-gatherers had festivals. These things that humans have always done, not necessarily frequent, are crucial to bonding groups, to extending networks, to creating trust, to developing creativity and also, just the sheer joy. I think it's a very important element of our existential life. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)BEHNCKE: And in fact, one of my current projects, it's exactly that. I'm observing adult play of humans in what I call adult play in the wild. For instance, one of the field sites is Burning Man. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: OK, you've probably heard of Burning Man. It takes place in the deserts of northern Nevada every year - think art festival crossed with a dance-and-costume party in a giant utopian village. It's like a free-for-all of self-expression. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Oh, hey there. It's you. I'm so glad you made it. RAZ: This, by the way, is from a documentary on Burning Man. BEHNCKE: It's a weeklong of different expressions of play. . . (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Let's go. Come on. Let's go do some Burning Man right now. BEHNCKE: . . . Which obviously in humans, takes different forms. You know, bonobos don't necessarily go around in costume. But their oldest common traits. . . (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: I want to do it again. BEHNCKE: . . . Joy. . . (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: (Screaming). BEHNCKE: . . . Laughter. . . (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Oh, my God. BEHNCKE: . . . And you will see that people immediately connect to each other, laugh, are willing to make fun of themselves, engage with people that they didn't know before. It is amazing. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Tell me about your experience. How was it sliding down the slide? UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: It's a lot scarier than it looks, but it's so much fun. BEHNCKE: People taking risks - play loves risk, and play loves ambiguity and uncertainty in a way that - you know, in other situations, we hate uncertainty. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: So wait, you go to Burning Man with, like, a notepad and a lab coat, and you just, like, walk around? BEHNCKE: So I ditched the lab coat a long time ago. But yes, this is the idea exactly, to look at play in the wild, both in humans and nonhumans, and that's how you get to kind of common principles. RAZ: OK, so a lot of people think of Burning Man as, like, a bunch of flaky people, like, dancing around, you know, crazy in, like, the deserts of Nevada, but I have met people, like, several people, who have told me, oh, yeah, I mean, Burning Man has changed my life. And hearing you talk about it as this example of human adults in a habitat - natural habitat playing or being uninhibited enough to play, it seems to all make sense. BEHNCKE: Yes. Generally speaking, I think obviously adult play is a route for personal transformation, and festivals like Burning Man allow for that to happen. And I see enduring friendships being formed. I see people exploring and pushing their limits that they perhaps wouldn't have dared to do before, that then they take that back to their lives and go, yes, I can feel different. I can explore and express myself in these different ways. Just the sheer effect of experiencing joy, I think, also liberates and changes people at the core. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)BEHNCKE: To explore the world is fun, and there's something very important in our consciousness that lights up the world, that makes us feel alive about play.

That's what scientists from the University of California want you to do. They're developing an app to turn your phone into a cosmic ray detector. If enough people install the app, the scientists think they'll be able to figure out once and for all what's producing the very energetic particles that occasionally hit the Earth. NPR science correspondent Joe Palca has the story. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Daniel Whiteson and his buddy Michael Mulhearn are physicists trying to unravel the fundamental laws of the universe, and they almost never work on projects that are small. DANIEL WHITESON: The two of us both work in these enormous collaborations of about 3,000 scientists. And while that's very interesting and you meet a lot of sharp people, it's also nice sometimes to do a smaller project where you can be in control of what's happening. PALCA: You see, these guys work on the giant particle accelerator called the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland. One day back in November 2013, Whiteson says he and Mulhearn were visiting a local Geneva watering hole. WHITESON: We were having beers and thinking what could we do that's smaller scale that we can handle ourselves? And while we were chatting, we were, of course, fiddling with our smartphones, and that's when we realized - hold on a second, these smartphones can actually be used as particle detectors. PALCA: That's because smartphones use something called a CMOS chip inside their cameras, the same kind of chips used to detect particles generated by the Large Hadron Collider. The particles they figured they might be able to detect are what's known as high-energy cosmic rays. These particles are far more energetic than anything that even the Large Hadron Collider can produce, but nobody knows what's producing them. WHITESON: That means that there's something out there in space - some unknown new object in space - that's capable of generating particles at a very, very high energy. PALCA: Physicists would dearly love to figure out what's producing these energetic particles. WHITESON: The problem with figuring out where these things are coming from is that they're very rare. PALCA: That's where the smartphones come in. Whiteson and his pals are building an app that turns the CMOS chip in the phone's camera into a particle detector. They're hoping millions of people all over the globe will download the app. When a high-energy cosmic ray hits the top of Earth's atmosphere, it creates a shower of new energetic particles. WHITESON: So if we have a bunch of users nearby each other, all running the app, then they will see hits in their phone. They'll see particles being detected by our app in their phone at the same moment. PALCA: And by analyzing the distribution of the particle shower detected by the phones, Whiteson says they'll learn more about the high-energy cosmic rays that produced the shower - that's the idea, anyway. Whiteson says the reaction from other astrophysicists to his smartphone-as-particle-detector scheme ranges from bemused to skeptical. But he thinks that's reasonable. WHITESON: We don't yet know if it's the best idea we ever had or just the silliest idea we ever had. One thing we're certain of, though, is that it's been one of the funnest projects to work on.

PALCA: You see, these guys work on the giant particle accelerator called the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland. One day back in November 2013, Whiteson says he and Mulhearn were visiting a local Geneva watering hole. WHITESON: We were having beers and thinking what could we do that's smaller scale that we can handle ourselves? And while we were chatting, we were, of course, fiddling with our smartphones, and that's when we realized - hold on a second, these smartphones can actually be used as particle detectors. PALCA: That's because smartphones use something called a CMOS chip inside their cameras, the same kind of chips used to detect particles generated by the Large Hadron Collider. The particles they figured they might be able to detect are what's known as high-energy cosmic rays. These particles are far more energetic than anything that even the Large Hadron Collider can produce, but nobody knows what's producing them. WHITESON: That means that there's something out there in space - some unknown new object in space - that's capable of generating particles at a very, very high energy. PALCA: Physicists would dearly love to figure out what's producing these energetic particles. WHITESON: The problem with figuring out where these things are coming from is that they're very rare. PALCA: That's where the smartphones come in. Whiteson and his pals are building an app that turns the CMOS chip in the phone's camera into a particle detector. They're hoping millions of people all over the globe will download the app. When a high-energy cosmic ray hits the top of Earth's atmosphere, it creates a shower of new energetic particles. WHITESON: So if we have a bunch of users nearby each other, all running the app, then they will see hits in their phone. They'll see particles being detected by our app in their phone at the same moment. PALCA: And by analyzing the distribution of the particle shower detected by the phones, Whiteson says they'll learn more about the high-energy cosmic rays that produced the shower - that's the idea, anyway. Whiteson says the reaction from other astrophysicists to his smartphone-as-particle-detector scheme ranges from bemused to skeptical. But he thinks that's reasonable. WHITESON: We don't yet know if it's the best idea we ever had or just the silliest idea we ever had. One thing we're certain of, though, is that it's been one of the funnest projects to work on.

The NSA's techniques for gathering emails and phone records have been controversial for some time. And that may be making it harder for the agency to recruit new codebreakers. NPR's Geoff Brumfiel visited the NSA to see firsthand if the agency can still draw top math and computing talent. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Neal Ziring is a computer scientist at the NSA. And contrary to what you might believe about the NSA, it's not all supercomputers cracking codes. NEAL ZIRING: There's no such thing as a computer that can break any code. And there isn't. It's all hard work. BRUMFIEL: Work done by a lot of people - nationwide, the NSA employs roughly 35,000. And each year, it must find new recruits to keep it at the cutting edge of code making and code breaking. It gets those recruits from places like Johns Hopkins University, which is just up the road from the NSA's Maryland headquarters. Matthew Green is a professor of computer science there. He says each year, he has students going to work for the NSA. MATTHEW GREEN: Well, it ranges. Sometimes, it's a half-a-dozen. Sometimes, it's just one or two. BRUMFIEL: Johns Hopkins may be nearby, but it's not unique. The NSA recruits at hundreds of universities across the country. It's been that way for years until 2013, when Edward Snowden leaked a huge trove of top-secret NSA documents. They showed the agency had a sweeping program that's scooped up data from emails, phones and elsewhere. GREEN: Before the Snowden leaks, we all looked at the NSA as basically being, you know, a spy agency. And they did what they were supposed to do, which is they found people who are threats to national security, and they listened into their traffic. But we've learned that they're collecting this incredible amount of information. And they're not shy about doing whatever they have to do to get access to that information. BRUMFIEL: Now Green doesn't feel as friendly towards the NSA as he once did. He thinks it's important people learn about the Snowden documents. He teaches about them in his classes to students like Daniel Swann. DANIEL SWANN: I'm a fourth-year concurrent bachelors-masters student in computer science here at Hopkins. BRUMFIEL: Swann grew up not too far from the NSA in Annapolis, Md. And he's exactly the type of person they would love to have working for them. SWANN: When I was a senior in high school, I thought I would end up working for a defense contractor or the NSA itself. That was actually a big priority for me. I wrote about that in my college essay - about how serving the country was important to me - things like that. But the past couple years, (laughter) I can say that has definitely taken a different turn. BRUMFIEL: After Snowden and taking Matthew Green's class, Swann says he's changed his mind about the NSA. SWANN: I can't see myself working there in the near future, partly because of these moral reasons. BRUMFIEL: Someone like Daniel Swann is a fairly rare commodity. Hopkins is a big university. But this year, the school's Information Security Institute, which specializes in cybersecurity, will produce just 31 masters. And of those, just five are U. S. citizens, a requirement to work at the NSA. The agency must recruit hundreds of computer science and math students each year. How many like Daniel Swann are turning away because of the Snowden leaks? ZIRING: That's kind of a tricky question. BRUMFIEL: That's Neal Ziring. Ziring also helps lead academic outreach for the agency. ZIRING: When I've been out on campuses and talking to students - right? - there are some of them that - that puts them off, or it makes them have doubts. BRUMFIEL: But honestly, Ziring says there's a much bigger problem. ZIRING: I was at Dartmouth career fair a few months ago. And our table's sort of right across from Facebook. And we are looking for some of the same things that they are. BRUMFIEL: Ever since the Snowden leaks, cybersecurity has been hot in Silicon Valley. That's in part because the industry no longer trusts the government as much as it once did. Companies want to develop their own security, and they're willing to pay top dollar to get the same people the NSA is trying to recruit - students like Daniel Swann. Last summer, Microsoft paid him $7,000 a month to be an intern. They even threw in a rental car. SWANN: It was actually really nice. It was a Subaru Legacy (laughter). BRUMFIEL: The NSA's Ziring says the agency can't compete on money. So he tries to sell it in other ways. ZIRING: You know, we have good health benefits. And we're government - right? - so we have huge scope of insurance to choose from. BRUMFIEL: Can things like work-life balance and continuing education really attract young talent when the money is so good elsewhere? I put that question to one of the NSA's newest recruits. ALISA: My name is Alisa. I've been working at NSA for just under two years. BRUMFIEL: The NSA won't tell me Alisa's last name because her work is classified. But she's a mathematician in her mid-twenties. She joined right as the Snowden documents were being made public. She wrestled with whether it was the right thing to do. Her mom wanted her to go for the big bucks. ALISA: She actually kind of held a grudge for a long time that I was not getting a higher-paying job. BRUMFIEL: But Alisa came anyway. And she's glad she did. ALISA: I absolutely love what I'm doing now. BRUMFIEL: Which is classified, so she won't say anything more about it, except it's the kind of stuff she can't work on anywhere else. The NSA says that, so far, it's been able to find enough students like Alisa. But it will keep having to make the hard sell. This year alone, the agency will need to hire a total of 1,600 new recruits. Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News, Washington.

This week, archaeologists announced that they've uncovered one of the largest medieval hospital cemeteries in Britain. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: The discovery was made a few years ago on the campus of Cambridge University. An archaeological team was digging underneath the Old Divinity School at St. John's College ahead of renovations when they started finding skeletons. CRAIG CESSFORD: When you find the first one or two, it's slightly a shock when you see the face and the skull of someone staring back up at you. CORNISH: That's Craig Cessford, the leader of the team. He says they kept digging and found the remains of about 1,300 people. CESSFORD: Some of them are complete, and you can see the body laid out. Other ones were just jumbles of bones. CORNISH: Cessford announced the discovery in The Archaeological Journal. The remains are from the 13th to 15th centuries, buried without coffins from the hospital of St. John the Evangelist. BLOCK: That's actually how St. John's College in Cambridge got its name. Now, before you start imagining 13th-century surgeries gone wrong, Cessford says it wasn't the kind of hospital we think of today. CESSFORD: It's sort of a combination of a nursing home, a hotel, a church and all those things wrapped into one really. CORNISH: Cessford says it's hard to tell from just the bones how the people in the hospital cemetery died. CESSFORD: It's quite possible that some of them died of bubonic plague. And, of course, a lot of relatively simple diseases that, today, you can get vaccinated against would potentially have been fatal at that time. CORNISH: Now, to Americans it might be surprising that a massive medieval cemetery went so long without being discovered. But Cessford says it's just another day when you're digging in a historic place like Cambridge.

Water conservation in the state is now mandatory. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JERRY BROWN: We're in an historic drought and that demands unprecedented action. It's for that reason that I'm issuing an executive order mandating substantial water reduction across our state. As Californians, we have to pull together and save water in every way we can. RATH: But water conservation alone, at least what's required by the governor's plan, won't fix the problem. Across California, communities are now looking at all options to avoid running out of water, including making more. It's prompting some to look to the past. This may be the most severe drought in recorded history in California, but it's not the longest. The last big drought here started in the late '80s and lasted seven years. Sheila Lodge was the mayor of Santa Barbara back then. SHEILA LODGE: See if I remember anything - sure. RATH: You mind if I call you Sheila? LODGE: No, not at all. RATH: So take us back to the last big drought here. LODGE: Well, it started in the later part of the '80s. And you don't know with a drought if you're in one until a few years have gone by. And oh, you know, this is really serious. RATH: The city council in Santa Barbara took action - banned watering lawns, hired water police to enforce restrictions. LODGE: But in the meanwhile, we had to do something to find other water supplies. RATH: They considered a bunch of options. Trucking water down from Canada was way too expensive. One proposal actually envisioned dragging an iceberg all the way down the coast from Alaska. LODGE: Somehow, nobody was ever able to tell us how they would get the melting water from the iceberg into the water system. RATH: In the end, they decided to build a desalination facility to turn seawater into drinking water. But Mother Nature can have a cruel sense of irony. Just as the $35 million desalination plant was nearing completion, there was the miracle March of 1991. LODGE: We had over 30 inches of rain in one month, and 30 inches is twice as much as we get in a whole year normally. We were on our way to being safe. RATH: By the time the desal plant was ready to come online in 1992, the drought was over. They ran the facility for six weeks just to make sure that it worked. Then they shut it down. The city mostly forgot about it until now. Santa Barbara is reopening the desalination plant. JOSHUA HAGGMARK: We are currently at the Charles E. Meyer desalination facility. RATH: This is the man in charge of getting it back online - water resources manager Joshua Haggmark. HAGGMARK: So right behind you here is about as sophisticated as it gets for this old facility. RATH: Walking around this facility feels like stepping back in time - big computers with tiny memories, floppy disk drives. HAGGMARK: So what we got here - we'll start with the aerial right here - kind of just walk you through it. RATH: Joshua takes us through bird's-eye view photos and a giant flowchart on the wall. There are lights embedded in it, but they stay dark. HAGGMARK: Here's Stearns Wharf. And the intake is just off of Stearns Wharf. It's about a half mile off the beach. RATH: Once it gets to the plant, the water flows through gravel and sand filters and finally, when all the debris is gone, into the heart of the plant - the salt removers. HAGGMARK: And these are the reverse osmosis membranes. These are only here to take out the salt. That's really what they do. So by the time the water gets here, it should have nothing but salt in it. RATH: And that's it. Two gallons of ocean water goes in, one gallon of drinking water comes out. The leftover gallon is super salty brine. This doubly-salty water gets mixed with the city's wastewater, piped back out to sea and spread around about 30 miles offshore. That briny waste is one of many concerns raised by environmentalists and other critics of desalination plants like this one and others that are being planned and built all along the California coast. Marco Gonzalez is the executive director of the Coastal Environmental Rights Foundation. MARCO GONZALEZ: The biggest concern about desalination is that it is expensive, it's energy intensive and it has a lot of side effects - a lot of unintended consequences for marine life, both from the intake and the discharge. RATH: Right now, the sources of electricity available are not environmentally friendly. GONZALEZ: And really, it's going to require us to find alternative energy sources to power these plants. So as we put more renewables online, it will become more environmentally friendly and more cost-effective. RATH: Cost-effectiveness is important because desalination is expensive. To get the Santa Barbara plant back online, the average resident is going to have to pay $20 more each month for water starting this July, even though the plant won't come online until 2016. Gonzalez says before pouring money into desalination plants that potentially hurt the environment, we need to buckle down on water conservation. GONZALEZ: The first thing I say to someone who says that we need to do desal now is turn off your sprinklers. We don't even know how much we need because we waste so much. We live in a total artificial world of water use and water supply. RATH: Others insist conserving simply will not be enough. The drought is too severe, and we've been using too much water for too long. Jay Famiglietti is the senior water scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. JAY FAMIGLIETTI: I don't think we can really conserve our way out of this problem, this problem being a combination of drought and of incredibly high water demand by a growing population and climate change. RATH: But Famiglietti cautions desalination won't be enough on its own. Almost everyone agrees for a drought this severe you need an all-of-the-above approach. FAMIGLIETTI: Desal is part of it, and sewage recycling is part of it. More efficient irrigation, better water pricing, better crop choices - there's all sorts of things that we need to include in our portfolio to bridge that gap between supply and demand. RATH: Even after factoring in the water the desalination plant is expected to produce and recycled water and what's called extraordinary conservation, the city of Santa Barbara is projecting a significant water shortfall in 2017. Joshua Haggmark says they hope to be able to buy water to make up the shortfall, but with a lot of other thirsty buyers in the region, finding an affordable source could be a problem.

So as we put more renewables online, it will become more environmentally friendly and more cost-effective. RATH: Cost-effectiveness is important because desalination is expensive. To get the Santa Barbara plant back online, the average resident is going to have to pay $20 more each month for water starting this July, even though the plant won't come online until 2016. Gonzalez says before pouring money into desalination plants that potentially hurt the environment, we need to buckle down on water conservation. GONZALEZ: The first thing I say to someone who says that we need to do desal now is turn off your sprinklers. We don't even know how much we need because we waste so much. We live in a total artificial world of water use and water supply. RATH: Others insist conserving simply will not be enough. The drought is too severe, and we've been using too much water for too long. Jay Famiglietti is the senior water scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. JAY FAMIGLIETTI: I don't think we can really conserve our way out of this problem, this problem being a combination of drought and of incredibly high water demand by a growing population and climate change. RATH: But Famiglietti cautions desalination won't be enough on its own. Almost everyone agrees for a drought this severe you need an all-of-the-above approach. FAMIGLIETTI: Desal is part of it, and sewage recycling is part of it. More efficient irrigation, better water pricing, better crop choices - there's all sorts of things that we need to include in our portfolio to bridge that gap between supply and demand. RATH: Even after factoring in the water the desalination plant is expected to produce and recycled water and what's called extraordinary conservation, the city of Santa Barbara is projecting a significant water shortfall in 2017. Joshua Haggmark says they hope to be able to buy water to make up the shortfall, but with a lot of other thirsty buyers in the region, finding an affordable source could be a problem.", "section": "Environment", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2015 NPR.

Still, some geologists say Homo sapiens have had such a huge impact on the Earth that the human era should be marked in the official timeline of the planet, the same way scientists use terms like Jurassic or Cretaceous period to talk about the age of dinosaurs. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports this idea has kicked off a vigorous debate. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: The Earth is about 4 and a half billion years old. Scientists have divided up that vast stretch of time into categories and subcategories. There's eons and eras and periods and epochs. JAN ZALASIEWICZ: And currently, formally, we live in something called the Holocene Epoch. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Jan Zalasiewicz is a geologist at the University of Leicester in the U. K. He says the push to give an official name to the time of human domination began about 15 years ago. A prominent atmospheric chemist was at a meeting where people kept referring to environmental change in the Holocene. ZALASIEWICZ: And he said stop it, you know, things have changed so much. We're no longer in the Holocene. We're in the - and he was looking for words - the Anthropocene. And then that started people talking. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The term Anthropocene has caught on; people do use it, but it's not official. Zalasiewicz is part of a working group that's considering whether it should be. The group hopes to soon make recommendations to the international scientific organization that decides such things, but defining the Anthropocene is tricky. Consider this - when did it start? One early idea was that it began with the Industrial Revolution. ZALASIEWICZ: But the majority of us are beginning to favor a more recent time in the mid-20th century. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says that's when human activities first left clear marks on the geologic record. Atom bomb tests produced fallout that can be detected in ice cores, soils and sediments all over the planet. Similarly, that's when there's signs of a huge increase in burning fossil fuels. ZALASIEWICZ: Since the mid-20th century, the whole world has been sprinkled with fly ash - tiny carbon particles. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Geologists like to see those kinds of signals in the rock to mark the beginning of an official time period. But some researchers say, wait a second, humans actually began to transform the planet thousands of years earlier with agriculture. Bill Ruddiman is a climate scientist at the University of Virginia. BILL RUDDIMAN: If the Anthropocene began in 1945, then the entire story of changing the surface of the Earth by cutting forest and plowing prairies is - occurred before the Anthropocene. Does that make sense? GREENFIELDBOYCE: In the current issue of the journal Science, he and some colleagues argue that the Anthropocene is a useful concept, but that trying to formally define it isn't helpful. Now the geologic time periods in use today were originally developed as scientists try to figure out Earth's history by looking at rocks and fossils because rocks and fossils were all they had. Stan Finney is a geologist at California State University in Long Beach. He points out that we can trace humanity's impact in a totally different way. We have things like written records. STAN FINNEY: Why do we have to go find something in the rock record? GREENFIELDBOYCE: And he says other organisms besides humans have had an even bigger impact. When the first plants evolved to grow on land, there were dramatic changes to the Earth's surface and atmosphere.

GRACE HOOD, BYLINE: Nik Brockman is Boulder County's web specialist. He's running through the cast of characters from last season. There were two females. A second female arrived and kicked out the original female. They think she was bonded to the male who was also living there. NIK BROCKMAN: And then those two were the ones that took over the nest. HOOD: Oh, really? So there was, like, a nest takeover? BROCKMAN: So it was, yeah, it was what some people called it - the home-wrecker, the home-wrecker osprey. HOOD: A romantic slight is a storyline that's the bread-and-butter of reality TV programming. It plays well to nest cam watchers too. Since the osprey cam started four years ago, Brockman says it's become the most popular page on the County's website. So when the county's camera got zapped by lightning last year, Boulder spent thousands to reinstall it. BROCKMAN: It's a good combination of using technology to see what's going on that you might not be able to see at the ground level but also raising issues around open space and wildlife preservation. HOOD: Preservation is what drew Bob Anderson and the Raptor Resource Project into nest cams more than a decade ago. Today, the bald eagle camera he set up in Decorah, Iowa is one of the most-watched in the country. He says there's a sense of ownership for regular viewers. BOB ANDERSON: Somewhere between 50 hours and 500 hours of watching, whatever bird cam, you know, blows your dress up, it becomes your bird. HOOD: Anderson says everyone from the disabled who can't get outdoors to students in classrooms have been tuning in lately since the eaglets have appeared. He thinks what makes to the Decorah cameras so popular are the social components, an army of volunteers who post pictures and field questions. Charles Eldermire is the bird cam's project leader at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in New York. His lab hosts 6 to 20 cameras depending on the time of the year. CHARLES ELDERMIRE: It's a relatively small investment for what might be a large amount of web traffic. HOOD: And it's not just about cameras. The feed appears on a webpage with its own timeline, frequently asked questions on the species and Facebook links. ELDERMIRE: And that gives you a great audience to then talk to about - at least for us as a nonprofit - what our mission is. HOOD: Its led to teachable moments for the lab's viewing audience around the perils of plastics for the Laysan Albatross. But Eldermire says a 24/7 live feed of wild creatures can also create awkward situations, like when one nestling is trying to kill another. ELDERMIRE: So we don't sugarcoat anything. But what we try and do is provide enough information and in an engaging enough way that people aren't surprised by what's going to happen. And they know that we are thinking of them as viewers when we're crafting the environment that they can watch it in. HOOD: Eldermire says volunteers are on-call at all hours. So if there's an event like death, viewers are notified before they load the nest cam. Back in Boulder County, the osprey nest cam has gotten another dose of drama this year. Web specialist Nik Brockman says once again, there's a home-wrecker scenario with the same two females from last season scuffling over the male and the nest.

I'm Guy Raz. You'd never know it from just walking around, but in a simple, mid-century building on the campus of Brandeis University near Boston, there's an office where some of the most revolutionary ideas in psychology were first developed. An office - it's just a room. MARGIE LACHMAN: Yep. RAZ: No plaque outside. . . LACHMAN: Yeah, we really should have a plaque outside that office, shouldn't we? RAZ: Margie Lachman. . . LACHMAN: Professor of psychology at Brandeis University. RAZ: Gave a tour of the office. LACHMAN: These are the same halls that he would've walked down. RAZ: That once belonged to to. . . LACHMAN: when he was here. RAZ: Abraham Maslow. LACHMAN: Hi. Were you here when Abraham Maslow was here? UNIDENTIFIED MAN: I knew Abe Maslow quite well. LACHMAN: OK, so he knew Abe Maslow. So there are a few people around. . . RAZ: Maslow worked here until a year before his death in 1970. LACHMAN: So I do know that the desk was located here. RAZ: But it was about 20 years before that. . . LACHMAN: And he looked out this window. RAZ: In the 1950s, when his ideas really began to change the field of psychology. LACHMAN: Before that, psychology focused on what's wrong with the person. They've looked that people who were neurotic, people who had psychological disorders. Psychology was really the study of problems and mental illness. RAZ: In other words, before Maslow, psychologists were more interested in why people were the way they were rather than how they could change, even improve. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ABRAHAM MASLOW: I don't think there's anything pollyanna about saying, yes, improvement is possible. You have to work hard at it. Here's the way to do it. RAZ: And so instead of looking at what was wrong with his patients. . . LACHMAN: Maslow was really one of the first to think about what's right with the person. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MASLOW: There is a possibility of improvement. Now, it has to be probabilistic. RAZ: This audio of Maslow was recorded during a retreat in the mid-1960s, where he lectured on self-improvement. Now, decades earlier, people looking for this kind of help might have been called patients who were sick. But to Maslow. . . LACHMAN: They were called clients. There was much more of a face-to-face relationship between the therapist and the client that was a natural human relationship of trying to work together to understand problems or issues that might occur. That was really revolutionary at the time, believe it or not. RAZ: And Maslow didn't just come up with this idea that perfectly functioning people could nonetheless strive to be better. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MASLOW: Persons can be improved. RAZ: As you might remember from psych 101. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MASLOW: It's not guaranteed. RAZ: He actually designed a framework to help understand how. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MASLOW: There's some people who are more difficult than others. RAZ: That framework is known as Maslow's hierarchy of needs. It's an idea that, to this day, shapes modern psychology. And on the show today, we'll explore Maslow's five human needs in order of importance - the things he said humans need to survive and then to thrive. LACHMAN: And so this notion of a hierarchy - you start at the bottom and you build up. RAZ: Like a pyramid. And at the base, the most fundamental human needs. . . LACHMAN: The basic survival needs. RAZ: Shelter, food and as we'll hear later, sleep. RUSSELL FOSTER: We have not taken sleep seriously since the 20th century. RAZ: Second on the pyramid - security. BRUCE SCHNEIER: Without security, you're not going to build a society. RAZ: From there, Maslow believed you could move up to. . . LACHMAN: Higher-order, growth-oriented needs that other people really hadn't talked about before. RAZ: Love and belonging. SEBASTIAN JUNGER: The reality for primates is that you can't even survive without belonging to a group. RAZ: Then comes esteem. CAROLINE CASEY: To be in a healthy relationship, to like yourself - it just takes work. RAZ: And finally, something Maslow called self-actualization. LACHMAN: Really focusing on growth and finding meaning in life and purpose in life. MIHALY CSIKSZENTMIHALYI: That the world is so full of things you can do that you can try to do better. And if you can do that, it doesn't matter what you're doing. RAZ: Maslow believed there was something fundamentally human about these needs and about our desire to be better and more fulfilled. LACHMAN: Yeah, I mean, I think most of the work at the time had actually been done with animals. Animal work had been done looking at things like hunger and thirst and these basic needs. And he tried to apply this to humans and found that that wasn't all there was. He - it wasn't just people were trying to survive. They were trying to do something beyond survival. And they had this basic - seemed like a basic motivation to improve and to reach their greatest potential. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz.

And as she mentioned, the first and most fundamental needs in Maslow's hierarchy were physiological needs - food, water, shelter and a need that most of us just don't treat like one. . . RUSSELL FOSTER: . . . Sleep. Sleep has to be absolutely at the top of that hierarchy, in a sense. RAZ: This is Russell Foster. He's a circadian neuroscientist at Oxford University, where he studies sleep. And in his research he's discovered that most people don't take it as seriously as they should. FOSTER: I think it's the apparent, you know, dilemma that we don't seem to be doing anything. We seem to be just essentially wasting our time while we're asleep. So when you celebrate your 60th wedding anniversary, it's worth reflecting that of those 60 years, 21-and-a-half were probably asleep. RAZ: Wow. FOSTER: Therefore, it's perhaps only reasonable to celebrate 38-and-a-half years. But the key thing is that the quality of that 21-and-a-half years spent asleep will to some extent dictate the quality of those years awake with your partner. RAZ: Of course, why exactly sleep is so important and what's going on when we do it is still largely a mystery to scientists like Russell. But there are a lot of theories out there, and Russell Foster described three of them in his TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FOSTER: The first is sort of the restoration idea. And it's somewhat intuitive. Essentially, all the stuff we've burnt up during the day, we restore, we replace, we rebuild during the night. And indeed, as an explanation it goes back to Aristotle, so that's - what? - 2,300 years ago. It's fashionable at the moment because what's been shown is that within the brain a whole raft of genes have been shown to be turned on only during sleep. And those genes are associated with restoration and metabolic pathways. So there's good evidence for the whole restoration hypothesis. What about energy conservation? You essentially sleep to save calories. When you do the sums, though, it doesn't really pan out. The energy-saving of sleeping is about 110 calories a night. Now, that's the equivalent of a hotdog bun, so I'm less convinced by the energy conservation idea. But the third idea I'm quite attracted to, which is brain processing and memory consolidation. What we know is that if after you've tried to learn a task and you sleep-deprive individuals, the ability to learn that task is smashed. It's really, hugely attenuated. So sleep and memory consolidation is also very important. However, it's not just the laying down a memory and recalling it. What's turned out to be really exciting is that our ability to come up with novel solutions to complex problems is hugely enhanced by a night of sleep. In fact, it's been estimated to give us a threefold advantage. Sleeping at night enhances our creativity. And what seems to be going on is that in the brain those neural connections that are important, those synaptic connections that are important, are linked and strengthened, while those that are less important tend to sort of fade away and be less important. RAZ: And so, when we sleep, parts of us are shutting down. But actually, big parts of our system never sleep, never shut down. They're constantly working, right? FOSTER: No, no. And in fact that's very important because one of the ways that we sort of thought about it is that we've got all these jigsaw pieces flowing in during the day, that the brain is essentially having to deal with billions of bits of information. And we haven't had time to sort of put it into the rest of the jigsaw puzzle. But at night you've got that time to try and associate those bits of the jigsaw puzzles, those new pieces of the puzzle, in with what you've experienced previously and what you might anticipate happening in the future. RAZ: So all life on Earth has an innate sense of time. In mammals, the queue of course is light. It's what determines our circadian rhythms. And researchers, like Russell, are starting to better understand the neurological and physiological impact of what happens when we ignore those rhythms and don't get enough sleep, which accounts for most of us. FOSTER: And that's across the age spectrum, from teenagers, stressed adults, indeed the retired population. RAZ: And not getting enough makes you less alert, more irritable, prone to illness. And if you're sleep deprived. . . FOSTER: You're releasing one of the hunger hormones called ghrelin, and that enormously increases your appetite for carbohydrates, and particularly sugars. RAZ: Lack of sleep hurts your memory. It affects your judgment. But perhaps most importantly, lack of sleep hurts your body's ability to defend itself. FOSTER: So, for example, even one night of no sleep can reduce elements of your immune system by about 24, 25 percent. RAZ: And Russell says in lab experiments, when mice are sleep deprived, they don't die of exhaustion. They actually die from infections. FOSTER: And one of the problems of not having enough sleep is that we are very poorly able to judge how tired we are. And even if we are sleep deprived by one or two hours we sort of get by. But we've all experienced after that really fantastic holiday, where we feel like a different person. . . RAZ: Yeah. FOSTER: . . . And we forget so quickly - once you get back to work and you are sleep deprived again, you forget that glorious feeling of what a good night of sleep can do to you. So most of us of course ask the question, what do you do? Make your bedroom a haven for sleep. The first critical thing is make it as dark as you possibly can, and also make it slightly cool. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)RAZ: OK, so you've probably heard this advice before - sleep in a cool, dark bedroom, no caffeine late in the day, no screens before bedtime, get on a regular schedule. But so many of us, even though we'll spend 36 percent of our lives asleep, we just don't do these things. We don't treat sleep as a need - on par with food or water or shelter. FOSTER: Yes, yes, it is that important. And I suppose if you think about it, you know, it's 36 percent of our biology. And if we don't do it, then, you know, that amount of time is telling us that sleep of course is incredibly important. We wouldn't do it unless it was essential. Evolution doesn't work like that. It essentially the fact that we sleep so long indicates that this is a massively important part of our overall biology, and we must not ignore it. And if we do, it's at our own peril. RAZ: Yeah, but, I mean, but what explains it? I mean, why do we ignore it? FOSTER: I think it's in the 20th century, in particular, where we've relegated sleep as this sort of illness that requires a cure, so people during the 80s, 90s, and, you know, even very recently have sort of boasted about, oh, I did an all-nighter, you know. I haven't slept or only slept one or two hours. But in the preindustrial era, poets and society in general embraced sleep. Shakespeare is absolutely littered with quotes about sleep - the honey-heavy dew of slumber. You know, sleep, sleep, nature's soft nurse. Why hast thou forsaken me? And all of this sort of intuitive love of sleep has been lost. And science, ironically, because it's uncovering the importance of sleep, is restoring sleep in our priorities. It's something that we can't marginalize but something we must embrace once again. RAZ: Russell Foster's entire talk can be found at ted. npr. org.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ABRAHAM MASLOW: Now, the idea is this - what are the motivations of people who are beyond the needs of the ordinary style because they're already satisfied? Now, what moves them? RAZ: In 1966, at the time of this recording, Abraham Maslow described what was then a new idea to psychology - the final stage of his hierarchy of needs. He called it self-actualization. MARGIE LACHMAN: Well, self-actualizing is highest level of the hierarchy in the sense that people who are really focusing on growth and finding meaning in life and purpose in life. RAZ: This is Margie Lachman. We met her earlier. She's a professor at Brandeis, as was Abraham Maslow. LACHMAN: People like Eleanor Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln were some of the examples that he gave for people who were self-actualizing. One of the stories I like to tell my students is that when he was here at Brandeis, he interviewed about 3,000 students searching for self-actualizing students, and he was very disappointed. He didn't find one that would qualify as being self-actualizing. RAZ: Wow. LACHMAN: So when I tell my students that, I quickly say to them, but don't worry, as you age and have more experiences and get to learn more about yourself, then you can really enter this realm of growth. RAZ: Abraham Maslow died suddenly of a heart attack in 1970. He was just 62. But if he had lived long enough to continue researching self-actualization, it might have looked a lot like the work of another famous psychologist. How should I - what should I call you? MIHALY CSIKSZENTMIHALYI: Well. . . RAZ: With kind of a difficult name. CSIKSZENTMIHALYI: . . . Mihaly is fine. Mike is acceptable, too, sure. RAZ: Oh, oh, great, OK. CSIKSZENTMIHALYI: Because that's what it means. RAZ: Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, or Mike, was born in a part of Italy that's now Croatia. He's 82. And when Mihaly was a young psychologist studying in America in the 1950s, Abraham Maslow's ideas were just beginning to take hold. CSIKSZENTMIHALYI: Every once in a while he would write a couple of pages in a obscure journal, and it would be like a breath of fresh air. And I felt, wow, yeah, that's why I want to be a psychologist in the first place. And the kind of pyramid of needs and. . . RAZ: Like Maslow before him, Mihaly was drawn to the question of self-actualization and what we need to be truly happy. So after years of research, he came up with an answer, and one that made him famous in the world of psychology and human behavior. Here is Mihaly's TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CSIKSZENTMIHALYI: About 30 percent of the people surveyed in the United States since 1956 say that their life is very happy. And that hasn't changed at all, whereas the personal income has more than doubled, almost tripled, in that period. But you find, after a certain basic point, increases in material well-being don't seem to affect how happy people are. So my research has been focused more on where in everyday life do we feel really happy. And to start those studies about 40 years ago, I began to look at creative people - first artists, then scientists, and so forth - trying to understand what made them feel that it was worth doing things, for which many of them didn't expect either fame or fortune, but which made their life meaningful and worth doing. RAZ: Mihaly, in other words, was researching people who didn't make a lot of money but who had nonetheless built meaningful, happy lives. And he concluded that people like this fit into a kind of pattern when it came to what they did. So if it was the piano, for instance. . . RAZ: At first you'll enjoy the simplest things that you are doing, and you are proud of being able to do the scales in music, let's say, or to play a very simple tune. RAZ: But once you master the basics. . . CSIKSZENTMIHALYI: You say, OK, how can I take the next step? RAZ: The next step - maybe you've heard this - is you practice a lot. CSIKSZENTMIHALYI: Eventually, after, you know, about 10,000 hours of practice, you can play whatever you want. RAZ: And once you practice enough, eventually, you can achieve a level of mastery in what you do that allows you to enter a special state of mind when you do it. Mihaly studied all kinds of composers, including Oscar Peterson, who wrote this piece of music that you've been hearing. And all those composers describe the experience of losing themselves in their music, in their work, in a way that made them truly happy. One of the composers who Mihaly described in his TED Talk called it a state of ecstasy. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CSIKSZENTMIHALYI: Now, he says also that this is so intense an experience that it feels almost as if he didn't exist. And that sounds like kind of a romantic exaggeration. But actually our nervous system is incapable of processing more than about 110 bits of information per second. And in order to hear me and understand what I'm saying, you need to process about 60 bits per second. That's why you can't understand more than two people talking to you. Well, when you are really involved in this completely engaging process of creating something new, as this man does, he doesn't have enough attention left over to monitor how his body feels or his problems at home. He can't feel even that he's hungry or tired. His body disappears. His identity disappears from his consciousness because he doesn't have enough attention - like none of us do - to really do well something that requires a lot of concentration and at the same time to feel that he exists, so existence temporarily suspended. Now, when that happens, the music just flows out. And so many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow that I call this type of experience the flow experience. RAZ: Mihaly found that flow, this experience of fully losing yourself in an activity, wasn't specific to musicians or artists. He saw it in chief executives and assembly-line workers in Detroit, Himalayan mountain climbers, Navajo shepherds, Olympic athletes. Whatever they did, if they found a way to experience flow in their lives, they seemed to be truly happy. CSIKSZENTMIHALYI: The world is so full of things you can do that you can try to do better. And if you can do that, it doesn't matter what you are doing. RAZ: Mihaly described one man he interviewed during his research who worked in New York City. CSIKSZENTMIHALYI: Whose whole adult life consisted in slicing salmon for lox and bagel in delicatessen in New York and how. . . (SOUNDBITE OF PEOPLE TALKING)CSIKSZENTMIHALYI: . . . And he describes how you take a fish, a 30, 40-pound salmon, and you drop it on the counter, one after the other, until you develop a three-dimensional X-ray of how the fish is made inside by seeing how it ripples and how it sounds when it falls on the counter. And then takes these knives that he always sharpens, and then starts cutting these fish so that he avoids the bone structure that would be in the way, and makes the thinner slices as fast as possible with the least effort possible. He developed this into an art form and is very proud every night. When he goes home, he knows that he has filleted better than anybody else could do in the world. RAZ: What would Abraham Maslow think of this? This idea that happiness can be found in ordinary moments where we lose ourselves in extraordinary ways? He didn't call it flow, but he had a different name for it. He called it peak experience. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MASLOW: But this involves a renunciation of the notion of the perfectibility of man. Man can be perfect, but for five minutes. . . (LAUGHTER)MASLOW: . . . In a peak experience, in some great moment, it's possible. But we just can't say perfect. You must give up the notion of the permanent heaven. We can get into heaven, but for five minutes, then you have to come back to the world again. RAZ: Abraham Maslow speaking in 1966.

In the front office, Eric Newsome and Portia Robertson-Migas. Our partners at TED are Chris Anderson, June Cohen, Deron Triff and Janet Lee. I'm Guy Raz, and you've been listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. GUY RAZ, HOST:  So once you make it beyond the basic needs - physiological needs, security needs - beyond the needs of self-esteem and love and belonging, what could possibly be left? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ABRAHAM MASLOW: Now, the idea is this - what are the motivations of people who are beyond the needs of the ordinary style because they're already satisfied? Now, what moves them? RAZ: In 1966, at the time of this recording, Abraham Maslow described what was then a new idea to psychology - the final stage of his hierarchy of needs. He called it self-actualization. MARGIE LACHMAN: Well, self-actualizing is highest level of the hierarchy in the sense that people who are really focusing on growth and finding meaning in life and purpose in life. RAZ: This is Margie Lachman. We met her earlier. She's a professor at Brandeis, as was Abraham Maslow. LACHMAN: People like Eleanor Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln were some of the examples that he gave for people who were self-actualizing. One of the stories I like to tell my students is that when he was here at Brandeis, he interviewed about 3,000 students searching for self-actualizing students, and he was very disappointed. He didn't find one that would qualify as being self-actualizing. RAZ: Wow. LACHMAN: So when I tell my students that, I quickly say to them, but don't worry, as you age and have more experiences and get to learn more about yourself, then you can really enter this realm of growth. RAZ: Abraham Maslow died suddenly of a heart attack in 1970. He was just 62. But if he had lived long enough to continue researching self-actualization, it might have looked a lot like the work of another famous psychologist. How should I - what should I call you? MIHALY CSIKSZENTMIHALYI: Well. . . RAZ: With kind of a difficult name. CSIKSZENTMIHALYI: . . . Mihaly is fine. Mike is acceptable, too, sure. RAZ: Oh, oh, great, OK. CSIKSZENTMIHALYI: Because that's what it means. RAZ: Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, or Mike, was born in a part of Italy that's now Croatia. He's 82. And when Mihaly was a young psychologist studying in America in the 1950s, Abraham Maslow's ideas were just beginning to take hold. CSIKSZENTMIHALYI: Every once in a while he would write a couple of pages in a obscure journal, and it would be like a breath of fresh air. And I felt, wow, yeah, that's why I want to be a psychologist in the first place. And the kind of pyramid of needs and. . . RAZ: Like Maslow before him, Mihaly was drawn to the question of self-actualization and what we need to be truly happy. So after years of research, he came up with an answer, and one that made him famous in the world of psychology and human behavior. Here is Mihaly's TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) CSIKSZENTMIHALYI: About 30 percent of the people surveyed in the United States since 1956 say that their life is very happy. And that hasn't changed at all, whereas the personal income has more than doubled, almost tripled, in that period. But you find, after a certain basic point, increases in material well-being don't seem to affect how happy people are. So my research has been focused more on where in everyday life do we feel really happy. And to start those studies about 40 years ago, I began to look at creative people - first artists, then scientists, and so forth - trying to understand what made them feel that it was worth doing things, for which many of them didn't expect either fame or fortune, but which made their life meaningful and worth doing. RAZ: Mihaly, in other words, was researching people who didn't make a lot of money but who had nonetheless built meaningful, happy lives. And he concluded that people like this fit into a kind of pattern when it came to what they did. So if it was the piano, for instance. . .

High - high, as a kite - the marijuana has done its job well. She can be led now, ready to go along. Casually, he introduces the idea of something stronger, real kicks. ARUN RATH, HOST: The idea that marijuana is dangerous because it's a stepping stone to harder drugs, like cocaine or heroin, is pretty old. And it's always been controversial. Dr. Denise Kandel is a professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University, and she's been studying drug use and addiction for decades. In the early 1970s, the National Institute on Drug Abuse gave Dr. Kandel money to study marijuana as a possible gateway drug. DENISE KANDEL: And in those days, you know, you were funded to do marijuana and you were not even supposed to ask about anything else. RATH: But Dr. Kandel thought it made sense to look at other factors aside from marijuana. Even though she wasn't supposed to, Dr. Kandel went ahead and asked about tobacco and alcohol use. Her instinct paid off. KANDEL: When I did the analysis, I found that there was a certain sequence that young people seem to be following when they got involved in drugs. They did not start with marijuana, but they started with drugs that are legal for adults in the society, such as beer and wine and cigarettes, other forms of alcohol. RATH: And tobacco - nicotine - appeared to be the most effective gateway of all. To reinforce her behavioral findings, Dr. Kandel wanted to conduct a biological study. And since you can't really confine kids to a lab and dose them with alcohol or tobacco - or heroin for that matter - science turns to rodents. KANDEL: When you have an animal model, you can change the order of presentation. You can present an animal with, you know, drug A, see how he reacts to drug B and do the reverse - B versus A. RATH: Now, Dr. Kandel is not a neurologist. But conveniently, she happens to be married to one and not just any - Nobel Prize-winner Dr. Eric Kandel. Nearly 40 years after Dr. Denise Kandel's paper on the gateway hypothesis was published, she and her husband published a molecular basis for nicotine as a gateway drug in the New England Journal of Medicine. KANDEL: What we found is that when an animal was primed by nicotine and then was exposed to cocaine, the effect of cocaine was amplified many times. RATH: Dr. Kandel wants people to pay attention to their results. She says that given how well nicotine primes the brain for addiction, she's concerned about reports showing e-cigarette use among young people on the rise. KANDEL: Because as we said, you know, nicotine is nicotine, whether it comes from an e-cigarette or from a combustible cigarette, you end up with nicotine in the brain. RATH: Dr. Denise Kandel. Her original findings on nicotine as a gateway drug came out 40 years ago this year. Her follow-up with her husband was published last fall.

Does she really love me, or is she just looking at me that way to get a treat? New research out this week in the journal Science may provide some clues. NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has this report on puppy love. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Just up the street from NPR's headquarters, I found Myrna Charles walking her Great Danes. MYRNA CHARLES: This is Peace and Quiet. This one's quiet. What, you're going to say hi? BRUMFIEL: Peace and Quiet are a lot of dog to handle. CHARLES: He's 185 pounds and she's 140 pounds. BRUMFIEL: But they're also nice doggies. CHARLES: They're pretty good. The only time they're running is really if there's a squirrel. BRUMFIEL: And what do you do when there's a squirrel? CHARLES: I let the leash go because if not, I'm in a tree or I'm being dragged with them. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Part of the reason Peace and Quiet are so well behaved is because of domestication. For thousands of years, humans have bred dogs for obedience. But what about affection? EVAN MACLEAN: Well, it's a harder one to get at, partly because emotions are so subjective. BRUMFIEL: Evan MacLean is at Duke University's Canine Cognition Center. He says sometimes human project emotions. MACLEAN: I think a common one is that people always talk about dogs looking guilty. You know, you come home from work and there's a mess in the house. And you look at your dog and you knew they were feeling guilty about what they did. And, you know, there have been good studies to show that actually, what's happening in those situations our dogs are actually just responding to people. BRUMFIEL: The dog looks guiltily at you because you look angrily at the dog. A team at Azabu University in Japan has now found a more quantitative measure of emotion. They let owners and dogs interact, and rather than just watching them, the team took urine samples. MACLEAN: And what they did is they measured oxytocin, which is a hormone that has been very associated with trust and social bonds. BRUMFIEL: Oxytocin is the same bonding hormone that gives parents warm fuzzies when looking at their infants. Researchers found that when dogs stared into their owner's eyes, oxytocin levels rose in both the people and the dogs. The same was not true for wolves, who were observed with their handlers. MACLEAN: That suggests that what they observed in dogs might actually be something special about dogs and not just a general feature of interaction between humans and any other animal. BRUMFIEL: Now, not everyone is buying this hormonal connection. Clive Wynne is a psychologist at Arizona State University who studies how dogs and people interact. CLIVE WYNNE: There is a fashion in science at the moment to identify changes in hormone levels with changes in emotional and feeling state. BRUMFIEL: In fact, oxytocin is not always associated with love. The hormone can also be linked to feelings of emotional isolation, even aggression in some animals. And Wynne says the wolves didn't make a lot of eye contact. If they had, their oxytocin might have gone up too. But honestly, Wynne believes dog owners shouldn't worry. WYNNE: I think the best evidence that any dog lover has that their dog loves them, it's what the dog does when it's around them. CHARLES: No. No. . .

But the puma known as P-22 was already pretty famous. I mean, he's got his own Facebook page. Jeff Sikich joins me now. He's a biologist with the National Park Service. Welcome to the program, Jeff. JEFF SIKICH: Hi, thank you for having me. MARTIN: So when did you first encounter P-22, as he's called? SIKICH: When I captured him back in March of 2012 is the first time I saw him. MARTIN: And what were the circumstances? SIKICH: Yeah, so Griffith Park is located at the eastern edge of our Santa Monica Mountains, and it's a very small park in terms for a mountain lion. It's roughly eight square miles completely surrounded by development. And there was a study going on in Griffith Park at the time to identify what animals were in there. And they got a photo of a mountain lion and let us know. So we were extremely interested that a mountain lion was in this small little park. So we set out to attempt to capture it and place a GPS radio collar on it to learn about what this animal is doing. MARTIN: Is he rare? I mean, are there a lot of mountain lions in that area? SIKICH: He is the only one since our study started in 2002 that we know of that has occupied Griffith Park. MARTIN: So you're saying he's all alone in this park? There are no other mountain lions? SIKICH: There are no other lions that we know of in Griffith Park. When we captured him, we also took samples - blood samples, tissue. And the genetics show that he was born in the Santa Monica Mountains, which is pretty amazing because that meant to get to Griffith Park, he had to cross two major freeways - the 405 freeway, navigate through the Hollywood hills and then cross the 101 freeway to get into Griffith Park. MARTIN: So what's going to happen to him? I mean, he's by himself. Is he going to partner up with - he doesn't have the option to partner up with anyone. SIKICH: Exactly. So as a young male, it was great, right. So mountain lions are solitary animals, especially young males when they're disbursing. They're looking for an area outside that of an adult male. And we've seen that in our core study area, the Santa Monica Mountains. Every young male, before P-22, ended up dying when they dispersed from ma. They either got hit on the freeway or killed by the adult male. So P-22 did find a way out to an area where there is no adult males, there seems to be plenty of prey, plenty of deer for him. But he is an adult now. He has the smallest home range of any adult male, to our knowledge, ever recorded. So in a matter of time, you know, he might choose to leave or attempt to leave in order to find some mates. MARTIN: Has anyone thought about giving him a better name than P-22? SIKICH: (Laughter). Yeah so that's a question I get often. MARTIN: I'm sure. SIKICH: Why do we call him P-22? So that's - P is for puma. He's the 22nd puma caught in our study. And, you know, just because we had this numbering system does not mean we're not attached to these animals. And I tell people, feel free to call him any name you like. And I'll add to that, you know, who's to say what a good or a bad name is, right? MARTIN: (Laughter). SIKICH: I think P-22 sounds perfect. It's short, it's commanding, it rolls off the tongue. MARTIN: Fair enough (laughter). SIKICH: So I think it fits him perfectly. MARTIN: Jeff Sikich is a biologist with the National Park Service in the Santa Monica Mountains. Jeff, thanks so much for talking with us. SIKICH: Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  A mountain lion holed up under a house in Los Angeles for a little while this past week and made headlines across the country. But the puma known as P-22 was already pretty famous. I mean, he's got his own Facebook page. Jeff Sikich joins me now. He's a biologist with the National Park Service. Welcome to the program, Jeff. JEFF SIKICH: Hi, thank you for having me. MARTIN: So when did you first encounter P-22, as he's called? SIKICH: When I captured him back in March of 2012 is the first time I saw him. MARTIN: And what were the circumstances? SIKICH: Yeah, so Griffith Park is located at the eastern edge of our Santa Monica Mountains, and it's a very small park in terms for a mountain lion. It's roughly eight square miles completely surrounded by development. And there was a study going on in Griffith Park at the time to identify what animals were in there. And they got a photo of a mountain lion and let us know. So we were extremely interested that a mountain lion was in this small little park. So we set out to attempt to capture it and place a GPS radio collar on it to learn about what this animal is doing. MARTIN: Is he rare? I mean, are there a lot of mountain lions in that area? SIKICH: He is the only one since our study started in 2002 that we know of that has occupied Griffith Park. MARTIN: So you're saying he's all alone in this park? There are no other mountain lions? SIKICH: There are no other lions that we know of in Griffith Park. When we captured him, we also took samples - blood samples, tissue. And the genetics show that he was born in the Santa Monica Mountains, which is pretty amazing because that meant to get to Griffith Park, he had to cross two major freeways - the 405 freeway, navigate through the Hollywood hills and then cross the 101 freeway to get into Griffith Park. MARTIN: So what's going to happen to him? I mean, he's by himself. Is he going to partner up with - he doesn't have the option to partner up with anyone. SIKICH: Exactly. So as a young male, it was great, right. So mountain lions are solitary animals, especially young males when they're disbursing. They're looking for an area outside that of an adult male. And we've seen that in our core study area, the Santa Monica Mountains. Every young male, before P-22, ended up dying when they dispersed from ma. They either got hit on the freeway or killed by the adult male. So P-22 did find a way out to an area where there is no adult males, there seems to be plenty of prey, plenty of deer for him. But he is an adult now. He has the smallest home range of any adult male, to our knowledge, ever recorded. So in a matter of time, you know, he might choose to leave or attempt to leave in order to find some mates. MARTIN: Has anyone thought about giving him a better name than P-22? SIKICH: (Laughter). Yeah so that's a question I get often. MARTIN: I'm sure. SIKICH: Why do we call him P-22? So that's - P is for puma. He's the 22nd puma caught in our study.

It was an unprecedented blow to Gulf wildlife at the time, killing shorebirds, marine mammals and fish. But the lasting damage is not as dire as originally feared. Still, researchers say it's too soon to know what the long-term impacts might be. NPR's Debbie Elliott reports. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Wetzel Wood casts his fishing line into the rough surf of the Gulf of Mexico. He pulls his bait, a cigar minnow, through the water just beyond where the waves break for shore near his hometown of Orange Beach, Ala. WETZEL WOOD: On a good day, you'd catch king mackerel, Spanish mackerel. ELLIOTT: Wood is at the Gulf State Park Pier. It's where he first learned to fish with his grandfather in 1969. WOOD: I've seen a lot of different things out here. It's been wonderful. ELLIOTT: But one of the worst was five years ago when oil was spewing from BP's out-of-control well for nearly three months. From this pier, Wood watched as mats of oil hit the Alabama coast. WOOD: I was kind of thinking, you know, I don't know if we'll ever be able to come out here and fish again. It was kind of a lonesome feeling, you know? I had no idea when it would come back if it came back. ELLIOTT: Wood says today you don't see oil, and fishing appears to be on the rebound, but it's not as good as it once was. He still worries about the future. Scientists are trying to find some answers. The results so far are mixed. Kenneth Heck with Alabama's Dauphin Island Sea Lab says fish population studies in the Gulf show one picture, but a different one emerges when researchers look at individual fish in controlled lab studies. KENNETH HECK: Almost without exception, those studies find negative impacts - OK - at the level of the individual organism. However, all the studies that I know of that have been done to-date at the population level out in nature have not found those impacts. So there's a mismatch between what we have seen in the laboratory and what we've seen in the field. ELLIOTT: BP points to those population studies as evidence of a strong recovery for a resilient Gulf - far better than the ecosystem collapse some people predicted during the spill. BP Senior Vice President Geoff Morrell. GEOFF MORRELL: There is not what many people had feared, a lost generation of Gulf species. STEVE MURAWSKI: I think the homework is incomplete. ELLIOTT: Steve Murawski is a marine scientist at the University of South Florida. MURAWSKI: This is a large, complex ecosystem that's difficult to sample. You're talking about cryptic things that we're trying to, you know, get a handle on. We know that there's impacts in certain areas. And some species - sure, they're capable of rebounding, and they did. But to basically make a blanket statement is way too premature. ELLIOTT: Murawski says migrating fish with a shorter lifespan, such as Spanish mackerel, appear to be doing OK. But ones that live longer and don't move around as much - red snapper and tilefish, for instance - show more problems like tumors and oil in their organs. Other studies indicate that dolphin in certain areas have suffered and endangered sea turtle nests have declined. Murawski says more than 3 million barrels of oil is going to have an impact. MURAWSKI: People need to acknowledge this was a massive oil spill. This stuff, by-and-large, doesn't just disappear. It has consequences. And so we would expect a certain level of consequence to happen in a spill of this magnitude. ELLIOTT: Murawski says because the BP spill was unprecedented, there's little historical data to provide clues about the long-term prognosis for the Gulf, and those answers will only come with time.

Astronomers say it's the best place in the world to build a massive 18-story telescope. From Hawaii Public Radio, Molly Solomon reports. (SOUNDBITE OF CHANTING)MOLLY SOLOMON, BYLINE: On an overcast morning, barefoot men and women dance hula 9,200 feet above sea level to a song honoring Mauna Kea, the mountain under their feet. Their hips sway to the beat of a drum as they call out in chant to Poli'ahu, one of the many Hawaiian gods that reside in the mountain. Hundreds of protesters who have camped out on Mauna Kea for weeks watch the hula in silence. A gust of wind ruffles an upside-down Hawaiian flag, a sign used to show the state is in distress. Leading the dancers is Vicky Holt Takamine, their kumu hula, or teacher. She felt it was important to come to the mountain in support of the activists - consider the construction of the giant telescope to be a desecration of their sacred land. VICKY HOLT TAKAMINE: We've been advocating for no more development on Mauna Kea for years. And our words have fallen on deaf ears. SOLOMON: The $1. 4 billion-dollar project would be the 14th and largest observatory on Mauna Kea. Scientists say the telescope would allow astronomers to see 13 billion light years away, going all the way back to the origins of the universe. It could lead to greater knowledge of star formation, dark energy and other fundamental questions of existence. DOUG SIMONS: I think there's a perception that there's a sort of a disconnect from the observatories to the community. SOLOMON: Doug Simons is the executive director at Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. He says astronomy in the islands dates back to 1968 when the first telescopes were built along the slope of the mountain summit. The seven-year process of approving the telescope included public hearings and legal challenges, with two appeals still pending in lower courts. Simons says in all his time working on the Big Island, he's never seen this level of opposition. SIMONS: Completely unprecedented in the history of Hawaii astronomy - no comparison. And you have to ask yourself, what's the difference? And a lot of people are asking that. What changed since the last time, you know, a big telescope was put up there that has allowed this wedge to be driven in the community? SOLOMON: The protests, which have attracted international attention, arose from the indigenous rights movement. For many activists on the mountain, Mauna Kea has come to symbolize a fight for native knowledge, land-use and Hawaiian sovereignty. Earlier this month, 31 people were arrested for blocking the road to prevent construction crews from reaching the summit. One of them was 26-year-old Kaho\u2019okahi Kanuha, a preschool teacher at a Hawaiian charter school. He says the battle over five acres atop Mauna Kea is about more than just land. It's about a clash of beliefs. KAHO'OKAHI KANUHA: Curiosity should not supersede of values and the traditions of the host people and the host culture. SOLOMON: Kanuha says he's not against the science. He points to his Polynesian ancestors, celestial navigators who charted their course to Hawaii by following the stars. KANUHA: It's the basis of us - the foundation of people and being able to find new land and create new life. However, we did not desecrate and destroy things to do that.

I'm Guy Raz. So do you want to hear something really cool? DEBORAH GORDON: Yes. RAZ: OK. Take a listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ANT NEST)RAZ: Do you know what that is? GORDON: I think that could be the sound of ant feet stampeding through their nest. RAZ: Now, I know what you're thinking. That was a really good guess. GORDON: I'm Deborah Gordon. I'm a professor of biology at Stanford, and I study ants. (SOUNDBITE OF ANT NEST)RAZ: Deborah, of course, had actually heard this recording before. It's from an Australian sound engineer, Stephen Frost, who captured the sound of some ants crawling over little, tiny microphones. They're loud. GORDON: They are loud. RAZ: Yeah. I guess if you put similar microphones on the sidewalks of, like, New York City, it would sound kind of similar. GORDON: Yeah. I think it would be a lot more chaotic. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: So what were you interested in that got you into ants? GORDON: Well, I've always liked finding the pattern underneath a process that seems disordered or turbulent. Actually, my first interest was in music theory. So it was a revelation to find out about the rules of counterpoint to understand that not only is a piece by Bach very beautiful, but it also is following rules. And so you can't move in parallel fourths. You can't move in parallel fifths. Each note can only follow certain other notes, can only take certain steps. The music has to follow those rules. But of course, when you're listening, you don't know anything about the rules. You just hear this beautiful music. And for me, it was amazing to realize that underneath this wonderful sound was a pattern and a system. RAZ: And that is exactly why Deborah Gordon loves ants. (SOUNDBITE OF ANT NEST)RAZ: Because underneath all that chaos is a system too, a system that you probably encounter every day. GORDON: So harvester ants in the desert have evolved to deal with the problem of conserving water. They have to spend water to get water. So when an ant is out in the desert sun foraging, it loses water to the air. RAZ: Yeah. GORDON: But they get their water out of the seeds that they eat. So the colony has to regulate foraging, and they do this with a very simple system of feedback. An ant doesn't leave the nest unless it's met enough ants returning with food. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: And a meeting for an ant is just a quick little touch. GORDON: That's right, where they're smelling each other with their antennae. RAZ: Yeah. I mean, ants clearly don't have meetings all day. GORDON: That - now, that's one of the good things about being an ant - no meetings. RAZ: Yeah, no meetings at all. So in an ant colony in the desert, when there's more food outside. . . GORDON: The ants find it faster. And they come back faster, and more ants inside go out to get it. And when there isn't very much food out there, they come back very slowly, and ants don't go out. RAZ: Now, that system of organization is surprisingly similar to something we humans came up with. GORDON: So when they first set up the Internet, operating costs were very high, so they set up a protocol that doesn't let a data packet go out until it gets an acknowledgment from the router that the previous data packet had the bandwidth to go on. So we invented, for the Internet, a very similar algorithm. . . RAZ: Wow. GORDON: . . . To one that has evolved in desert ants many, many millions of years, and we just invented the internet yesterday. RAZ: That's incredible. I mean, it would seem to suggest there is a reason why we came to that algorithm and there's a reason why it works - because it's been tested for millions of years. GORDON: That's right. And I think for situations where we don't have the right algorithm yet, we could look to see, well, how has nature solved that problem? And maybe we could use that solution. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: It's possible for even the most chaotic systems to be organized and sometimes in ways that would never occur to us. On the show today, how and why we organize stories and ideas about new ways of handling complexity in the workplace. . . RICARDO SEMLER: If you find you need to come here, come here. If you're good to work at home, work at home. We just want to make sure that you are self-directed. RAZ: . . . New ways of organizing your family. . . BRUCE FEILER: Nothing has been more top-down through history than the family. The problem is, the life that we are sending our kids into is not top-down anymore. RAZ: . . . Organizing disaster relief. . . MORGAN O'NEILL: But it just was crazy to us that we showed up and spontaneously decided to give orders and that was fine. RAZ: . . . And why organized systems sometimes still fail. . . ZEYNEP TUFEKCI: We know how to, you know, go and occupy a park together, but we don't yet know how to think together. RAZ: Most of the systems we'll hear about this episode, of course, are human systems, but Deborah Gordon says, if you start with how ants are organized. . . GORDON: You're going in the same order that evolution went. RAZ: Perfect. GORDON: (Laughter). All right. RAZ: Yeah, that's perfect. That's. . . And she says you can actually learn a lot from ants. . . GORDON: About how effective a noisy, messy system can be. RAZ: Here's Deborah's TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GORDON: We can learn from this about other systems, like brains and data networks that we engineer. What all these systems have in common is that there's no central control. An ant colony consists of sterile female workers - those are the ants you see walking around - and then one or more reproductive females who just lay the eggs. They don't give any instructions even though they're called queens. They don't tell anybody what to do. So in an ant colony, there's no one in charge. And all systems like this without central control are regulated using very simple interactions. Ants interact using smell. They smell with their antennae, and they interact with their antennae. So when one ant touches another with its antennae, it can tell, for example, if the other ant is a nest mate and what task that other ant has been doing. So when one ant meets another, it doesn't matter which ant it meets. And they're actually not transmitting any kind of complicated signal or message. All that matters to the ant is the rate at which it meets other ants. And all of these interactions taken together produce a network. So just as a neuron adds up its stimulation from other neurons to decide whether to fire, an ant adds up its stimulation from other ants to decide whether to forage. RAZ: Which brings us back to the main idea Deborah Gordon thinks we can take from ants. The brain, like an ant colony and so many other systems in nature, has no central control. And yet, we humans have set up so many of our systems in exactly the opposite way, from feudal systems of kings and noblemen to modern government, corporations, the military. Someone at the top is always in control. GORDON: But in a blade of grass, there's no central control. And in a human body, there's no central control. Nobody's telling one of your blood cells, OK, you go over here; and then when you get there, you're going to meet this immune cell, and this is what you should do when that happens. So systems without central control are everywhere in nature. RAZ: Yeah. GORDON: But if you think about the feudal system, it's not only that the king has this power, but it's also - the king constantly has to persuade everybody that he has this power. RAZ: Right. GORDON: And everybody has to keep reinforcing the idea that he has this power. So it doesn't just sit there. It has to constantly be maintained and reinforced and controlled and fought over. So it takes a lot of work to maintain a hierarchy. RAZ: Which doesn't really apply to the ant world. GORDON: That's right. The ants don't do that work, and our bodies don't do that work. And maybe, in a way, it's more effective and efficient to have a system without any central control, where the whole thing can keep working without having to do all that extra effort of maintaining a hierarchy. There are more than 12,000 species of ants in every conceivable environment that operate without central control. Using only simple interactions, ant colonies have been performing amazing feats for more than 130 million years. We have a lot to learn from them. Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)RAZ: Deborah Gordon - you can see both of her TED Talks about how ants are organized at ted. com. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. So do you want to hear something really cool? DEBORAH GORDON: Yes. RAZ: OK. Take a listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ANT NEST) RAZ: Do you know what that is? GORDON: I think that could be the sound of ant feet stampeding through their nest. RAZ: Now, I know what you're thinking. That was a really good guess. GORDON: I'm Deborah Gordon. I'm a professor of biology at Stanford, and I study ants. (SOUNDBITE OF ANT NEST) RAZ: Deborah, of course, had actually heard this recording before. It's from an Australian sound engineer, Stephen Frost, who captured the sound of some ants crawling over little, tiny microphones. They're loud. GORDON: They are loud. RAZ: Yeah. I guess if you put similar microphones on the sidewalks of, like, New York City, it would sound kind of similar. GORDON: Yeah. I think it would be a lot more chaotic. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: So what were you interested in that got you into ants? GORDON: Well, I've always liked finding the pattern underneath a process that seems disordered or turbulent. Actually, my first interest was in music theory. So it was a revelation to find out about the rules of counterpoint to understand that not only is a piece by Bach very beautiful, but it also is following rules. And so you can't move in parallel fourths. You can't move in parallel fifths. Each note can only follow certain other notes, can only take certain steps. The music has to follow those rules. But of course, when you're listening, you don't know anything about the rules. You just hear this beautiful music. And for me, it was amazing to realize that underneath this wonderful sound was a pattern and a system. RAZ: And that is exactly why Deborah Gordon loves ants. (SOUNDBITE OF ANT NEST) RAZ: Because underneath all that chaos is a system too, a system that you probably encounter every day. GORDON: So harvester ants in the desert have evolved to deal with the problem of conserving water. They have to spend water to get water. So when an ant is out in the desert sun foraging, it loses water to the air. RAZ: Yeah. GORDON: But they get their water out of the seeds that they eat. So the colony has to regulate foraging, and they do this with a very simple system of feedback. An ant doesn't leave the nest unless it's met enough ants returning with food. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: And a meeting for an ant is just a quick little touch. GORDON: That's right, where they're smelling each other with their antennae. RAZ: Yeah. I mean, ants clearly don't have meetings all day. GORDON: That - now, that's one of the good things about being an ant - no meetings. RAZ: Yeah, no meetings at all. So in an ant colony in the desert, when there's more food outside. . . GORDON: The ants find it faster. And they come back faster, and more ants inside go out to get it. And when there isn't very much food out there, they come back very slowly, and ants don't go out. RAZ: Now, that system of organization is surprisingly similar to something we humans came up with. GORDON: So when they first set up the Internet, operating costs were very high, so they set up a protocol that doesn't let a data packet go out until it gets an acknowledgment from the router that the previous data packet had the bandwidth to go on. So we invented, for the Internet, a very similar algorithm. . . RAZ: Wow. GORDON: . . . To one that has evolved in desert ants many, many millions of years, and we just invented the internet yesterday. RAZ: That's incredible. I mean, it would seem to suggest there is a reason why we came to that algorithm and there's a reason why it works - because it's been tested for millions of years. GORDON: That's right. And I think for situations where we don't have the right algorithm yet, we could look to see, well, how has nature solved that problem? And maybe we could use that solution. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: It's possible for even the most chaotic systems to be organized and sometimes in ways that would never occur to us. On the show today, how and why we organize stories and ideas about new ways of handling complexity in the workplace. . . RICARDO SEMLER: If you find you need to come here, come here. If you're good to work at home, work at home. We just want to make sure that you are self-directed. RAZ: . . . New ways of organizing your family. . . BRUCE FEILER: Nothing has been more top-down through history than the family. The problem is, the life that we are sending our kids into is not top-down anymore. RAZ: . . .

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Three, two, one and liftoff of the space shuttle Discovery with the Hubble Space Telescope, our window on the universe. GREENE: Since that launch, the Hubble Space Telescope has made more than a million observations. It has spied distant galaxies and exploding stars and changed the way we think about our place in the universe. Here's NPR's Geoff Brumfiel. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Behind a locked door at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, a team of engineers keeps watch over Hubble. It looks like any office - desks and computers - but there's a tiny animated map on the wall with a little cartoon telescope tracking Hubble's path. Dave Haskins is mission operations manager. DAVE HASKINS: Hubble is traveling over Africa - southern Africa right now. BRUMFIEL: Hubble has several billion miles on the odometer, and, like any high mileage vehicle, things go wrong. If there's a problem, Haskins gets a text message. He's even got a ring tone to alert him. (SOUNDBITE OF ALARM)HASKINS: Pretty annoying, right? So - yeah, there we go. BRUMFIEL: A computer on Hubble froze in October, briefly shutting it down. But today, it's running smoothly and that's good news. Jennifer Wiseman is Hubble's senior scientist. JENNIFER WISEMAN: We're doing everything from looking at objects in the solar system - trying to understand, for example, Jupiter - to looking at things far beyond our solar system. We are studying how galaxies evolve and change over cosmic history. We're even seeing some of the most distant galaxies we've ever detected. BRUMFIEL: Hubble's received upgrades over the years, but the real reason it's still so powerful is its location. JASON KALIRAI: So you'll only hear an astronomer say this, but the air that we breathe - it sucks (laughter). It makes our images blurry, right? BRUMFIEL: Jason Kalirai is at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which helps manage Hubble's many projects. Staring at space from Earth is kind of like trying to look out from the bottom of a swimming pool. KALIRAI: This is actually why we put telescopes on top of mountains. It's not to get closer to the stars. It's to get above the Earth's atmosphere. But nothing competes with actually being above the entire atmosphere and observing from space where you can get crystal clear images. BRUMFIEL: Hubble's crystal clear images are free and available online, and that's another reason it's so well-known. Think of any breathtaking image of space, like a spiral-armed galaxy, chances are Hubble took it. For Kalirai, one image really stands out. KALIRAI: There have been a few times in our history that we have completely transformed our understanding of the basic, fundamental question, what is our place in the universe? BRUMFIEL: In December of 1995, the telescope stared for 10 days at a tiny patch of apparently empty sky. The image it produced, called the Deep Field, showed more than a thousand undiscovered galaxies. It made researchers realize Earth's even smaller than we thought. KALIRAI: We're sitting on a rock now orbiting a star, and that star is one star out of a hundred billion in our galaxy. But the Deep Field tells us that that galaxy is one galaxy out of a hundred billion in the universe. And so I think Hubble's contribution is that we're not very special. (Laughter). BRUMFIEL: (Laughter). That's kind of a bummer. KALIRAI: (Laughter). No, I think it's exciting. It gives us a lot more to learn about. It gives us - you know, if we're not that special, you can continue to ask that question - right? - what's next? BRUMFIEL: Kalirai is lead scientist on an even bigger space telescope that will launch in 2018. As for what's next for the Hubble - that's uncertain. At some point, it will stop working. But researchers hope that's still many years away. Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  Twenty-five years ago this morning, NASA launched a telescope into space.

It begins with the murder of a troubled young woman named Mellory Manning. DAVID WOLMAN: Mellory Manning grew up in Christchurch, New Zealand. Mellory had a drug problem. She was working as a prostitute. And after her sister killed herself, Mellory realized that her life was headed down a similar path. So she was starting to turn things around, but unfortunately, the Christmas holiday was coming up, and she felt like she needed more money. And so she decided to work the street one last night. It was that night, in December of 2008, when she was murdered. RATH: Mellory Manning's murder confounded the police. Despite a massive forensic investigation and hundreds of interviews, they went months without a solid lead. Then a 70-something scientist named Dallas Mildenhall came to work on the case. WOLMAN: He's a kiwi, and he has this thinning shock of white hair and bulging blue eyes. And Dallas Mildenhall is a forensic palynologist. And that is not a term I had ever heard of before learning about him. He is basically a pollen and spores expert who brings to bear his expertise on criminal investigations. RATH: What you need to know about Dallas Mildenhall is that he's one of only a handful of forensic pollen all just into existence. He's aided investigations all over the world, using pollen to connect the dots in murder, arson, even art forgery cases. He once traced counterfeit malaria drugs to the border of China and Vietnam from the pollen grains in the capsules. So when the Mellory Manning investigation hit a wall - in his home country no less - the pollen detective gets a call. WOLMAN: One of the major reasons why it was stuck is the police could not say for sure where she had been killed. They were very suspicious early on of a gang called the Mongrel Mob because they were involved in prostitution. They had this sort of warehouse hangout not far from where the body was found. And yet they didn't have the evidence making that connection. All they had was supposition. So the challenge for someone like Mildenhall, then, is to come in and look at pollen samples taken from Mellory's nasal passages and her clothing and try and link it to locations that the police are wondering about as far as potential scenes for the crime. RATH: A single pollen grain from a sample tells you nothing. But all the pollen grains in a sample - their composition, their concentration, all that stuff - can tell you a lot. Still, we're talking about pollen grains in detail invisible to the naked eye - painstaking work. For many months, Mildenhall examined pollen from lots of potential crime scenes around Christchurch and came up with nothing. Then, after months of peering through the microscope at tiny slides, something almost unbelievable. WOLMAN: So what happened to Mildenhall one day is that he noticed a pollen grain that looked like it had two pores. It really doesn't sound that exciting. Two pores - when I heard it at first, not being a scientist, I was like and? What does that actually mean? And at first, he thought it was just a trick of the microscope or a sample maybe had been smushed or deformed because to get a sense of how rare it was, how to dramatic this finding was, he said it would be like seeing a dog with five legs. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RATH: He looked at the pollen taken from Mellory Manning and saw multiple examples of these mutated pollen grains. How could that be? He has a theory - an herbicide has mutated the pollen, giving it two pours. He tells the cops. WOLMAN: Sure enough, the area right next to the Mongrel Mob hangout and warehouse had been sprayed precisely at the time of year that Mildenhall suspected. RATH: The police told him to re-examine the samples collected from the gang's warehouse. WOLMAN: And so he spent three days poring over these samples again. And then, lo and behold, he started to find significant concentrations of this two-pored pollen grain. RATH: They had it. The pollen that was embedded in Mellory Manning's sweater during her murder was solidly linked to the Mongrel Mob's hangout. WOLMAN: Then what happened is while interrogating a suspect, they presented this forensic evidence to him, saying look, we can connect you to this place at that time of year. And that rattled him enough that then he started to sing. RATH: That man is convicted of the murder of Mellory Manning and sentenced to life in prison. So if pollen can play a crucial part in solving a case like this, why isn't everyone using it? Well, two things. David Wolman says that like lots of forensic evidence, this is really hard for judges and juries to understand. But it's also difficult, time-consuming work and there are only a handful of people in this field worldwide. And there may be no one who sees the world like Dallas Mildenhall. WOLMAN: Dallas Mildenhall is a guy who - he doesn't look through the air at the landscapes in front of him. He sees this blizzard of activity in the world around us, constantly, of pollen grains swirling and storming and rising and falling and raining down on the ground. The trick is being able to read that rain. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RATH: You can read David Wolman's fascinating piece \"Who Killed Mellory Manning? \" in the online magazine Matter.

But if you wondered who this guy Hubble was, why the telescope was named after him, NPR science correspondent Joe Palca provides the answer as part of his series Joe's Big Idea. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: The reason Edwin Hubble got a telescope named after him is he made two of the most important astronomical discoveries of all time. Back in the 1920s, he was working on the largest telescope in the world - the 100-inch Hooker telescope on Mount Wilson, just outside Los Angeles. On a chilly evening this past February, I climbed up to the dome of that telescope with operator Nik Arkimovich. I asked him to show me where Hubble would sit when he was using the telescope. Arkimovich points to a platform near the top of the telescope frame. NIK ARKIMOVICH: So Hubble gets to sit on a chair at the Newtonian focus right there. PALCA: What does he do up there? ARKIMOVICH: He's making adjustments to the guiding. PALCA: Motors and gears guide the telescope so it can stay pointed at a star as it moves across the sky. But astronomers need to make small tweaks throughout the night. ARKIMOVICH: He's got an eyepiece with crosshairs on it, and he's got a paddle that allows him to make minor adjustments. And his job is to keep the star in the crosshairs for maybe eight hours. JOHN MULCHAEY: It's certainly much, much easier today. PALCA: That's John Mulchaey, acting director of the Carnegie Observatories where Hubble worked during the day. MULCHAEY: Now we sit in control rooms. The telescopes operate brilliantly on their own, so we don't have to actually worry about tracking and things like this. PALCA: Today, telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope use digital cameras to catch the light from stars and other celestial objects. Mulchaey says in Hubble's day, they used glass plates. MULCHAEY: At the focus of the telescope, you would put a glass plate that has an emulsion layer on it that actually is sensitive to light. PALCA: At the end of an observing run, the plates would be developed, much like the film in a camera. MULCHAEY: A good portion of astronomy history is stored in this room and rooms here. PALCA: Here is the basement of the Carnegie Observatories building in Pasadena. A century's worth of glass plates are stored here. MULCHAEY: So why don't we go take a look at Hubble's famous Andromeda plates? PALCA: The plates are famous for a reason. They completely changed our view of the universe. MULCHAEY: All right, so this is a rare treat for you because this plate doesn't see the light of day for very often. PALCA: To the untrained eye, there's nothing terribly remarkable about the plate, but Mulchaey says what it represents is the most important discovery in astronomy since Galileo. The plate shows the spiral shape of the Andromeda galaxy - Hubble was looking for exploding stars in Andromeda called novas. Hubble marked these on the plate with the letter N. MULCHAEY: The really interesting thing here is there's one where it's an N crossed and it's crossed out in red. And he's changed the N to VAR with an exclamation point. PALCA: Hubble realized this wasn't a nova. The VAR stands for a variable star known as a Cepheid variable. It's a kind of star that allows you to make an accurate determination of how far away something is. This Cepheid variable showed the Andromeda galaxy wasn't a part of our galaxy at all. It was its own galaxy, way, way out there. At the time, most people thought the Milky Way was it - the only galaxy there was. MULCHAEY: And what this really showed was that wait, there's other galaxies out there. The universe is much, much bigger than anybody realizes. PALCA: Another blow to our human conceit that we are the center of the universe. Hubble went on to show the universe was expanding; a discovery so astonishing that Hubble had a hard time believing it himself. If Hubble made such important discoveries with century-old equipment, makes you wonder what he might've uncovered with the Hubble Space Telescope. Joe Palca, NPR News.

MARTIN: So how did it morph? I mean, there've been several iterations of this since, over these many, many hundreds of years. I understand that one of the earlier versions of the rhyme included a racial slur. Walk us through the journey of this rhyme. RAPHEL: An earlier version of the rhyme that children recited on playgrounds did include a racial slur sometimes.

But it's really hard to - and the history of it is much more complicated than that because the sounds in this rhyme are really sticky. You know, they're like these nonsense syllables that then sound like words that you recognize. So then you stick words that you recognize into the nonsense syllables. And then the words that recognized take on a life of their own. And in some cases that becomes extremely problematic. MARTIN: Is it fair to call it a song? I mean do people kind of sing it? RAPHEL: I'd say it's somewhere between a poem and a song and a chant because it's hard not to do it. You know? You start saying eeny meeny, and then you go miny mo. Catch a tiger by the - it has rhythm built into it. MARTIN: Can you find it in other languages or is this exclusively something that lives in English? RAPHEL: Oh, it's all over the world. So I'm going to completely butcher the pronunciation, but there's versions of it that folklorists heard in Denmark, for example, like, (reciting poem with Danish dialect). And there's versions in France(reciting poem with French dialect). They heard versions in Zimbabwe. Folklorists, too, went on the playgrounds to study what these kids were singing. It's all over. MARTIN: So what's the take away - that kind of children everywhere - there's some universal quality to the sound of these words and repeating them in a pattern? RAPHEL: I think the take away is these words sound really good together. (Laughter). You know? And it's really fun to repeat them in a pattern. It's also, you know, it's so much fun because they sound great together. You know them by heart, but you can do these little, like, switches and flips and variations in them.

Doctor Dyson is 91 and was one of the British scientists who helped win World War II. He spent most years since as a professor of physics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N. J. He has won the Max Planck Medal and the Templeton Prize, among scores more, and written important oft-quoted books, including \"Disturbing The Universe\" and \"The Scientist As Rebel. \" He writes frequently for The New York Review of Books, where his articles stir admiration and debate. His latest collection is \"Dreams Of Earth And Sky. \" And Dr. Dyson joins us now from Princeton, N. J. Thanks so much for being with us. FREEMAN DYSON: Great, I'm happy to be here. SIMON: The opening essay in this book startled me, \"Our Biotech Future. \" It made me think - and I must tell you, made me worry a little bit for my children. You foresee a time where scientists begin to re-engineer humans the way that breeders now develop new kinds of flowers. DYSON: Right. SIMON: Ideally, how would that kind of bioengineering help us? DYSON: Well, it's a question of multiple purposes, multiple motives. You have people who are breeding flowers just for fun because it's beautiful. You make new kinds of tulips or new kinds of roses and you can make new kinds of animals in the same way. Also, you can think of preventing hereditary diseases, which are some of the worst. So there are all sorts of different reasons why you might like to do some genetic engineering, either on humans or animals or plants. Each case has to be looked at carefully on its merits and certainly one set of rules is not going to be applicable to everyone. SIMON: You were good enough to reprint a very eloquent letter that Wendell Berry, the writer and poet, sent to The New York Review - criticized what you had to say. Let me read a line from him. He says (reading) after a long experience of problems caused by industrial solutions, might not a little skepticism be in order? DYSON: Well, I'm a skeptic if anybody is. You can be a skeptic and still not be paralyzed. We have always the choice of doing nothing, but usually that doesn't work out so well either. SIMON: In recent years, you've stirred up a controversy with some of what you said about global warming. And I'm not going to make any attempt to characterize your views. I noticed that your own book jacket calls them politically incorrect. So let me just get you to tell us why you think some of the most dire predictions we've heard don't hold up. DYSON: Well, what I would like to emphasize is that human actions have very large effects on the ecology which have nothing to do with climate. Carbon dioxide is what we're producing in big quantities and putting into the atmosphere. It happens to be a very good fertilizer for all kinds of vegetation, good for wildlife, good for agricultural production. So it has many benefits. And this is something you have together with the climate effects, which are much less certain. So it's a question of drawing a balance. I'm just saying I don't understand it and neither does anybody else. I'm skeptical because I don't think the science is at all clear and unfortunately, a lot of the experts really believe they understand it and maybe have the wrong answer. SIMON: Yeah. But I have to ask you, I think a lot of people - particularly the weather we've had over the past couple of years, seems much more volatile and we see video of polar bears having to swim for their lives and ice flows melting - I could go on. That must concern you. DYSON: Of course it concerns me, but of course we don't know much about the causes of those things. I mean, the worst disasters were the Ice Ages and nobody really understands for sure the causes of Ice Ages. So I'm not saying that the climate disasters aren't real. I'm merely saying we don't know how to prevent them. SIMON: Well, what would your recommendation be as a scientist? You just talked when it comes to bioengineering that it's dangerous to do nothing. DYSON: Yes, and certainly I would say one of the first things we should try to do is to get rid of poverty - human poverty. When people are poor, they can't take care of nature around them. They just have to survive as best they can so that some of the poorest people are actually the most destructive. So I would say if we can deal with poverty, that's something very positive which we should be doing. Also, preservation of habitat of wildlife. All sorts of problems we have to deal with, which climate is one. And I would say climate is not the most urgent. SIMON: Do you feel you've been villainized ever? DYSON: No - on the contrary. People are very friendly. SIMON: (Laughter). Well, we'll get some emails when this interview airs, you know? DYSON: Yes, I get some hate mail from people who bought Dyson vacuum cleaners and they hold me responsible. SIMON: (Laughter). So you're not that guy? Oh. DYSON: No, I'm not that guy. Well, actually I rather like him. He's a good guy. SIMON: I note this week that Stephen Hawking's quoted as saying that, \"we human beings have just a thousand years left on this earth and that if we're going to survive, we're going to have to relocate. \" How do you feel about that? DYSON: I hope we will. I think that - not to relocate so much, but just to spread out. Not just humans, but life as a whole. There's all this wonderful universe which seems to be dead as far as we can tell, and it will be much more beautiful when it comes to life. But I don't say it has to happen. People who are around at that time have to make the choice. SIMON: Would we still be human? DYSON: There again, it's a question of choice. The normal course of events in biology, either a species goes extinct or else it splits into many. Successful species end up as being 10 species or a hundred. That's what evolution is all about. So I think it's very likely that will happen to humans as well. And if I were going to live on Mars, I would like to have fur so I can wander around in a very cold climate. Undoubtedly when people live on Mars, they will want to be different just to be adapted to the environment, rather than trying to adapt the environment to them. SIMON: Freeman Dyson, his new collection of essays drawn from The New York Review of Books is \"Dreams Of Earth And Sky. \"Dr. Dyson, thanks so much for being with us. DYSON: Thank you. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  Freeman Dyson is one of the most famous names in science, and sometimes one of the most controversial. Doctor Dyson is 91 and was one of the British scientists who helped win World War II. He spent most years since as a professor of physics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N. J. He has won the Max Planck Medal and the Templeton Prize, among scores more, and written important oft-quoted books, including \"Disturbing The Universe\" and \"The Scientist As Rebel. \" He writes frequently for The New York Review of Books, where his articles stir admiration and debate. His latest collection is \"Dreams Of Earth And Sky. \" And Dr. Dyson joins us now from Princeton, N. J. Thanks so much for being with us. FREEMAN DYSON: Great, I'm happy to be here. SIMON: The opening essay in this book startled me, \"Our Biotech Future. \" It made me think - and I must tell you, made me worry a little bit for my children. You foresee a time where scientists begin to re-engineer humans the way that breeders now develop new kinds of flowers. DYSON: Right. SIMON: Ideally, how would that kind of bioengineering help us? DYSON: Well, it's a question of multiple purposes, multiple motives. You have people who are breeding flowers just for fun because it's beautiful. You make new kinds of tulips or new kinds of roses and you can make new kinds of animals in the same way. Also, you can think of preventing hereditary diseases, which are some of the worst. So there are all sorts of different reasons why you might like to do some genetic engineering, either on humans or animals or plants. Each case has to be looked at carefully on its merits and certainly one set of rules is not going to be applicable to everyone. SIMON: You were good enough to reprint a very eloquent letter that Wendell Berry, the writer and poet, sent to The New York Review - criticized what you had to say. Let me read a line from him. He says (reading) after a long experience of problems caused by industrial solutions, might not a little skepticism be in order? DYSON: Well, I'm a skeptic if anybody is. You can be a skeptic and still not be paralyzed. We have always the choice of doing nothing, but usually that doesn't work out so well either. SIMON: In recent years, you've stirred up a controversy with some of what you said about global warming. And I'm not going to make any attempt to characterize your views. I noticed that your own book jacket calls them politically incorrect. So let me just get you to tell us why you think some of the most dire predictions we've heard don't hold up. DYSON: Well, what I would like to emphasize is that human actions have very large effects on the ecology which have nothing to do with climate. Carbon dioxide is what we're producing in big quantities and putting into the atmosphere. It happens to be a very good fertilizer for all kinds of vegetation, good for wildlife, good for agricultural production. So it has many benefits. And this is something you have together with the climate effects, which are much less certain. So it's a question of drawing a balance. I'm just saying I don't understand it and neither does anybody else. I'm skeptical because I don't think the science is at all clear and unfortunately, a lot of the experts really believe they understand it and maybe have the wrong answer. SIMON: Yeah. But I have to ask you, I think a lot of people - particularly the weather we've had over the past couple of years, seems much more volatile and we see video of polar bears having to swim for their lives and ice flows melting - I could go on. That must concern you. DYSON: Of course it concerns me, but of course we don't know much about the causes of those things. I mean, the worst disasters were the Ice Ages and nobody really understands for sure the causes of Ice Ages. So I'm not saying that the climate disasters aren't real. I'm merely saying we don't know how to prevent them. SIMON: Well, what would your recommendation be as a scientist? You just talked when it comes to bioengineering that it's dangerous to do nothing. DYSON: Yes, and certainly I would say one of the first things we should try to do is to get rid of poverty - human poverty. When people are poor, they can't take care of nature around them. They just have to survive as best they can so that some of the poorest people are actually the most destructive. So I would say if we can deal with poverty, that's something very positive which we should be doing. Also, preservation of habitat of wildlife. All sorts of problems we have to deal with, which climate is one. And I would say climate is not the most urgent. SIMON: Do you feel you've been villainized ever? DYSON: No - on the contrary. People are very friendly. SIMON: (Laughter). Well, we'll get some emails when this interview airs, you know? DYSON: Yes, I get some hate mail from people who bought Dyson vacuum cleaners and they hold me responsible. SIMON: (Laughter). So you're not that guy? Oh. DYSON: No, I'm not that guy. Well, actually I rather like him. He's a good guy. SIMON: I note this week that Stephen Hawking's quoted as saying that, \"we human beings have just a thousand years left on this earth and that if we're going to survive, we're going to have to relocate. \" How do you feel about that? DYSON: I hope we will. I think that - not to relocate so much, but just to spread out. Not just humans, but life as a whole. There's all this wonderful universe which seems to be dead as far as we can tell, and it will be much more beautiful when it comes to life. But I don't say it has to happen. People who are around at that time have to make the choice. SIMON: Would we still be human? DYSON: There again, it's a question of choice. The normal course of events in biology, either a species goes extinct or else it splits into many. Successful species end up as being 10 species or a hundred. That's what evolution is all about. So I think it's very likely that will happen to humans as well. And if I were going to live on Mars, I would like to have fur so I can wander around in a very cold climate.

The descriptions of a police shooting that wasn't were so persuasive as to make you wonder about perception, certainty and error. Fox News producer Mike Tobin told viewers he had seen it. (SOUNDBITE OF FOX NEWS BROADCAST)MIKE TOBIN: Well, about 2:45 we saw a guy running from the cops here right at the intersection of North and Pennsylvania where the - you know, which has been the epicenter of the unrest here. And as he was running away, that officer drew his weapon and fired and struck the individual who was running away. SIEGEL: This is what it sounded like at that intersection as the supposed shooting victim was on the ground. This is from a Ustream broadcast. (SOUNDBITE OF USTREAM BROADCAST)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: He just shot him, bro. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: He shot him? UNIDENTIFIED MAN: He shot him in the back, man. SIEGEL: Reporter Hannah Allam of McClatchy News was also there. She tweeted, police appear to have shot young man. We asked her about the scene. HANNAH ALLAM: Sirens blaring, police chopper overhead, frenzied people saying he'd been shot - we saw him get shot in the back. I had people with their names interviewed. I said, did you see it? Yes, I saw it happen. SIEGEL: By the time the dust settled, Baltimore police issued this explanation. They'd seen a man with a handgun on a closed-circuit video camera. Officers chased him. They heard what sounded like a gunshot. They say the man may have purposely fired a shot or a shot may have accidentally gone off when the gun fell to the ground. The man fell. He was later put in an ambulance, taken to a hospital. They say he wasn't seriously injured. Fox News quickly retracted the story and apologized, but it raised questions of how people can be so certain they've seen something that didn't happen. Elizabeth Loftus is a professor of psychology and law at University of California, Irvine. She studies memory. Elizabeth Loftus, there were people who swore they'd seen a man shot by police. They described it passionately. It didn't happen. What's going on there? ELIZABETH LOFTUS: Well, one of the things that might've happened in this case is that people got little bits and pieces of information - maybe they saw a man or maybe they saw a gun or maybe they heard a noise. And they draw inferences about what might've happened, what could've happened, what they think possibly happened. And those inferences can act like suggestion and can distort your memory. So in some sense, these individuals, assuming they're not deliberately lying, could actually have created these false memories. SIEGEL: I'm going to play you a bit of an interview that was on Fox News yesterday. This was their reporter speaking to a woman who said she was an eyewitness. She had seen the shooting. (SOUNDBITE OF FOX NEWS BROADCAST)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: The officer got in the middle of the street and shot that boy in his back in my face. That's when you know. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: How close were you when the gunshot happened. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I was right there at the check cashing. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: So 20 - 30 feet. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Right. Right there - the officer was in the middle of the street. As the boy was running up, he straight - boom. SIEGEL: She doesn't sound like she's lying in that. She sounds absolutely convinced of what she saw. LOFTUS: Well, she sounds very convinced, and she has all these characteristics that make you want to believe exactly what she's saying. She's - you know, it's detailed. It's emotional. It's passionate. It's confident. And yet, these are some of the same qualities that we see in false memories. So I would certainly give her the benefit of the doubt and say she really believes this. SIEGEL: If you were to ask her to describe it over and over again several times, would you expect to hear the same memory repeated? LOFTUS: Well, pretty much. I mean, if a lot of time passed, she might forget parts of what she said earlier, and she may insert even more new details into the recollection. I mean, she might add clothing and all kinds of other details. SIEGEL: But we're not hearing somebody with some kind of psychological defect. We're hearing the human memory at work. LOFTUS: Yeah, absolutely. It illustrates the malleable nature of our memories. SIEGEL: So what happened in Baltimore yesterday - you would not find this surprising, given your experience of such things? LOFTUS: Well, no. Given my experience - I mean, we've seen people remember all kinds of things that didn't happen, even very upsetting things. So this doesn't surprise me. But out there in the real world when it's happening at a time of such tensions, maybe it's a time for us to be especially careful. SIEGEL: That's Elizabeth Loftus from the University of California, Irvine. Professor Loftus, thanks for talking with us today. LOFTUS: My pleasure.

Actually, I'm next to a stuffed lemur. And I'm here with the renowned British broadcaster and naturalist, Sir David Attenborough. Welcome to the program, Sir David. SIR DAVID ATTENBOROUGH: Thank you very much. SIEGEL: And happy birthday, by the way. How old are you today? ATTENBOROUGH: I've forgotten. SIEGEL: (Laughter). ATTENBOROUGH: Eighty-nine - 89. SIEGEL: Well, well done. ATTENBOROUGH: It's going on my 90th year if I'm swanking. SIEGEL: Absolutely. We are here with Sir David Attenborough because he has a remarkable two-part special that's airing next week on the Smithsonian Channel. It's called \"Rise of Animals: Triumph Of The Vertebrates. \"(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"RISE OF ANIMALS: TRIUMPH OF THE VERTEBRATES\")ATTENBOROUGH: Of all the animals that live on our planet, one extraordinary group dominates. It has produced the largest - the blue whale - the fastest, the most intelligent creatures that have ever lived. SIEGEL: Sir David, your show uses new fossil evidence to trace the key evolutionary developments in vertebrates, and a lot of it comes from China. I'm just curious why. ATTENBOROUGH: Well, the foundation of paleontological science, of course, is in the Western world. And the exploration of the fossils of China didn't take place until rather later. But the Western world constructed the general outline of the history of evolution, and inevitably there are gaps. So when China began to be explored in terms of its fossils, it naturally went to those sort of areas. And they produced answers to the stories - the links that were missing from the original story. SIEGEL: You said that the fossils in China provide answers to questions - in particular? ATTENBOROUGH: Well, one of the very, very big debates that became very heated and personal in paleontological science in the West was the origin of the birds. Where did the birds come from? How did they evolve? And there were really very vigorous debates and lots of books written on the subject taking different views. But in China, they discovered the answer in an incontrovertible way. They discovered dinosaurs - a particular kind of dinosaur - that were covered in feathers. And remarkably enough, not only feathers on the arms, which you can imagine how they became wings, but actually feathers on the legs, which makes you think. And so there's a very big story to be told there. And those fossils have had no equivalent, really, in the Western world. There was one big one, which was in Darwin's time called archaeopteryx, which was the link between reptiles in general and the birds, but which particular reptile was a big argument. And - but Chinese fossils answered that argument. SIEGEL: There are some purists who would say that dinosaurs aren't extinct, they're flying around us all the time. ATTENBOROUGH: That's correct. SIEGEL: They're the birds. ATTENBOROUGH: Yeah. SIEGEL: What was the most surprising finding for you? ATTENBOROUGH: The most surprising was the earliest mammal that we've ever so far discovered. And it's surprising because it's hardly bigger than the nail of my little finger, and that's its skull. And what's most surprising is how anybody looked at a thing which is, what, half-an-inch long and saw that it was a fossil skull. They must have magnificent eyesight because you could - actually, when you look at it with a lens, you can see it's got all these little teeth, and it's got a little socket for its eyes and so on. And this is a thing called Hadrocodium, and it is the earliest mammal that we know so far. SIEGEL: What's the secret to our success, we vertebrates? What do we have over the other life forms? ATTENBOROUGH: Well, having a body requires - of any size - requires a support of one kind, and there are two ways of doing it. One way is that you can produce a structure which you enclose the body in, and it gives it a strength. And that's the way of the external skeleton, which the insects adopted. But the problem with it is it's difficult to grow. For an animal to grow, you've got to increase - keep on building bigger external skeletons. And it also limits the amounts of things that you can do bodily-wise. And the other way of doing it is that you have a skeleton inside, which acts like a kind of scaffold. And that's what the vertebrates do. They have a backbone and various things, the limbs and so on are attached to that. And that can grow and grow and grow, and so it produced huge things like whales and like dinosaurs. SIEGEL: I'm curious. You've been making films about nature since you were working in black and white. ATTENBOROUGH: Yes. SIEGEL: And this series - this two-part series has some of the most spectacular graphics and animation. A little Hadrocodium fossil miraculously expands into a skeleton and crawls off your arm in the middle of this. Is this more fun to have all of these tools at your disposal, or is the greater demand on your narration more challenging? ATTENBOROUGH: Well, as a matter of fact, it produces a problem which may not be immediately obvious to a viewer, and that is that if you can bring a fossil to life as perfectly as we now can using computers, how do they know that it is not a real animal? And grappling with this problem when I was writing the first script, I suddenly thought, well, one way of doing it is that if you've got a fossil lying on a slab of stone, we could get the bones - using computers, we could get the bones to, as it were, rise up and group together and form once again an articulated skeleton. And we can then get it to move and run around. And I said to the computer boys - I said, look, don't clothe it with fur. Let's leave it like a skeleton. And they said you can't do that. It wouldn't look real. I said, on the contrary, it would look absolutely fabulous, and then people - viewers will know you're not trying to con them. You're not trying to - this is a computer device which enables you to bring the world to life - the extinct world to life in a remarkable way. And oddly enough, many of the most enchanting things that we with computers are those actually of naked, articulated skeletons running over my hands. SIEGEL: (Laughter) Agreed. I'm just curious. You recapitulate often during these programs. You go back to the timeline and the family tree to remind us where we came from. It looks like a very good pedagogical technique. Do you consider yourself an educator in these things? ATTENBOROUGH: I would like to think that there's actually no difference between education and entertainment. I think entertainment, which doesn't inform you about the characters in it, is actually shallow. The greatest entertainment is involved. It puts real depth into human - and teaches you about human nature. And similar, the converse - if you are actually dealing with the intellectual basis of human nature and so one, you can actually illuminate that with the sort of comedy and entertainment that you would get elsewhere. The two things should come together. The best are the ones that contain both. SIEGEL: Well, Sir David Attenborough, thank you very much. And once again, happy 89th birthday. ATTENBOROUGH: Thank you very much indeed. SIEGEL: You can see Sir David Attenborough's latest TV series, \"Rise Of Animals: Triumph Of The Vertebrates,\" next week on the Smithsonian Channel. It first airs Wednesday evening at 8 p. m. Eastern.

And oddly enough, many of the most enchanting things that we with computers are those actually of naked, articulated skeletons running over my hands. SIEGEL: (Laughter) Agreed. I'm just curious. You recapitulate often during these programs. You go back to the timeline and the family tree to remind us where we came from. It looks like a very good pedagogical technique. Do you consider yourself an educator in these things? ATTENBOROUGH: I would like to think that there's actually no difference between education and entertainment. I think entertainment, which doesn't inform you about the characters in it, is actually shallow. The greatest entertainment is involved. It puts real depth into human - and teaches you about human nature. And similar, the converse - if you are actually dealing with the intellectual basis of human nature and so one, you can actually illuminate that with the sort of comedy and entertainment that you would get elsewhere. The two things should come together. The best are the ones that contain both. SIEGEL: Well, Sir David Attenborough, thank you very much. And once again, happy 89th birthday. ATTENBOROUGH: Thank you very much indeed. SIEGEL: You can see Sir David Attenborough's latest TV series, \"Rise Of Animals: Triumph Of The Vertebrates,\" next week on the Smithsonian Channel.

So where are those baby velociraptor already? Come on, science. Well, in Russia, there's a park all ready to go for woolly mammoths, and scientists there say it's just a matter of time before they can bring back actual mammoths to enjoy it. Evolutionary biologist Beth Shapiro takes us through the world of de-extinction in her new book, \"How To Clone A Mammoth. \" But first, why to clone a mammoth? Shapiro says for her, it's all about restoring ecosystems. BETH SHAPIRO: Mammoths probably played a pretty important role in their ecosystem as the largest herbivore that was around. We know from work that's being done in Siberia right now that restoring herbivores to an ecosystem really does a lot to generate and regenerate the kind of grassland community that they need to survive. RATH: You go into some detail about how this is easier said than done - cloning an extinct animal. You actually cracked open some amber with ancient insects inside, looking for DNA just like they did in \"Jurassic Park. \" What did you find? SHAPIRO: Nothing. RATH: (Laughter). SHAPIRO: The same thing that anybody who's tried this has found. RATH: So with our animal you're using as an example - for a mammoth, what have been the ways they've been able to successfully find mammoth DNA? SHAPIRO: DNA from Mammoths is preserved in bone and skin, teeth, hair. And the mummies that have been melting out of the Siberian permafrost, DNA is not particularly well-preserved in these things. If I were to extract DNA from something that was alive, I could get really long fragments. But when I - we extract DNA from bones, that DNA is actually chopped up into tiny, little fragments, and they're also really broken and damaged. And this is the reason that we cannot clone mammoths. Cloning is actually a very specific scientific process. That process requires a living cell. RATH: So there are efforts that you write about that are underway already to bring the mammoth back there in Russia and in South Korea. Are they just pursuing a lost cause? SHAPIRO: I think so. RATH: Aw. SHAPIRO: Anyone who is determined to go out there and find a living mammoth cell is going to be sorely disappointed. There are other ways that we can do this, though, not by cloning a mammoth, but by genetically modifying the genome sequence of an elephant cell in a dish in a lab using new genome-editing technology and swapping out bits of elephant sequence for the mammoth version of sequences that we think are important in making a mammoth look and act more like a mammoth than like an elephant. And this technology is possible today. RATH: So what you're advocating here - and you do advocate for this, right? This is something you would like to see - the elephant with mammoth DNA worked into it. SHAPIRO: This is a hard question. RATH: (Laughter). SHAPIRO: Until we've figured out how to meet both the physical and psychological needs of elephants in captivity, they shouldn't be in captivity at all, much less being used to make mammoths. But if we were to put all of that aside, I don't want to see mammoths brought back. It's never going to be possible to create a species that is a hundred percent identical. But what if we could use this technology not to bring back mammoths but to save elephants? What if we could use this technology to make elephants slightly better adapted to living in cooler climates, the type of place that mammoths used to live? We could then create more space for them. RATH: But then this gets kind of philosophical, 'cause are you really preserving elephants, or are you replacing them with mutant elephants? SHAPIRO: Mammoths and elephants have approximately 99 percent identical genomes. And if we're talking about changing a few genes here and there to make them better adapted to living in the cold, I think we're talking about preserving elephants. RATH: You know, I have to say - maybe this is based more on science fiction than on science, but I'm a little bit uneasy at the idea of releasing genetically-engineered mammoth elephants even more than the idea of releasing good old-fashioned mammoths. SHAPIRO: Really? RATH: (Laughter). SHAPIRO: That's kind of surprising. We don't know what's going to happen when we start messing around with - reprogram the genetic code by creating Chihuahuas or Great Danes, and we don't seem to fear that. There's something more natural than about going in and very specifically targeting a gene that we have some idea of what it does. RATH: But would you say, though - I mean, with humans struggling right now to keep existing elephants from going extinct, is it worth it to put all this effort into mammoths as opposed to protecting the elephants that we have? SHAPIRO: I think that the key use of this technology, the same technology that we're talking about, is to protect species and populations that are alive today. Take, for example, black-footed ferrets that are living across the plains of North America. Black-footed ferrets nearly went extinct a couple decades ago because of extermination programs, and today, black-footed ferrets are threatened by a disease. What if we could use the same technology that we're talking about to go back in time and sequence DNA from black-footed ferrets that are in museum collections somewhere that are decades or centuries or even thousands of years old and find genetic diversity in those that we could then inject into the populations today that have no genetic diversity? Maybe we could use this technology to give those populations a little bit of a genetic booster shot and maybe a fighting chance against the diseases that are killing them. We're facing a crisis - a conservation-by-diversity crisis. This technology might be a very powerful new weapon in our arsenal against what's going on today. I don't think we should dismiss it out of fear.

I'm Terry Gross. Science and Buddhist meditation are two radically different investigative traditions as the Dalai Lama has pointed out. But he thinks an understanding of science is essential to the understanding of reality, which is why he wants to bring scientific teachings into Tibetan monasteries. As part of the Dalai Lama's program, my guest, astronomer Chris Impey, has made several trips to India to teach science to Tibetan monks in exile. We're going to talk about that a little later. But first, we're going to talk about our future in outer space, which is the subject of Impey's new book, \"Beyond. \" The book examines the past, present and future of space travel and imagines what it would be like to establish a colony in space. Impey has also received a grant from NASA to write a history of U. S. space science and astronomy missions. His own research has been supported by $18 million in grants from NASA and the National Science Foundation. To conduct his research, he was given time on the Hubble Space Telescope. Impey is a distinguished professor of astronomy at the University of Arizona. Chris Impey, welcome to FRESH AIR. So if we had not cut back on funding for the space program, what might we have accomplished by now? CHRIS IMPEY: Well, I think we might actually be living on the moon and Mars - maybe not many of us, but we might have our first bases there. We'd have robust commercial space activity or people routinely in orbit. America wouldn't have had a hiatus of four years and counting when we couldn't get astronauts into space. It would be probably quite different. GROSS: What kind of commercial activity do you envision? IMPEY: Well, it's multifaceted. There's going to be a non-salubrious part. You know, I don't want to start with that, but there's going to be sex and drugs in space, as there have been driving most technologies, tourism, eventually commerce, mining asteroids. There's going to be a robust commercial activity 'cause there's a lot of valuable resources out in space. GROSS: The sex and drugs part, what is that? IMPEY: Well, it's just people will sort of take their normal activities to the frontier. For example, to have the first baby conceived and born in zero gravity or off Earth is kind of a foundational step for humans, so that's an amazing adventure. GROSS: You mean so people will be willing to pay a lot to say, wow, I had sex in space. IMPEY: Yeah, sex in space. The - you know, the astronauts at NASA and the Russians, you know, continually deny the heavy rumor mill that says it's already happened. The astronauts are well-trained. They're not supposed to do that. But yes, when the public is up there, they're going to do what they normally do on the Earth. GROSS: Not to make too much of this, but you do mention in your book that it might not be that easy to have sex in space, for one, because of blood-flow issues. What's the issue there? IMPEY: Yeah. Well, so your body is not functioning normally when gravity - all your capillaries and your muscles are designed to deal with the tug of gravity, and you won't have that. There'll also be ways in which, you know, Newton's third law of action and reaction sort of interfere with the normal, you know, methods of sex that you might use on Earth. It'll be - I just assume it's going to be an adventure. And people will be creative, and they'll find new ways to enjoy themselves. GROSS: So what's left of our space program? IMPEY: It's actually still pretty good. So I think the perception of NASA in the doldrums and that we're in a bad space in our activities is a little exaggerated. NASA's budget isn't growing, but it's also not declining. So they're investing in new technologies. We're going to get a new heavy launch capability in a couple of years. The space station is active and doing scientific experiments. We're not launching satellites. There's a heavy entourage of spacecraft going through the solar system and exploring there. It's not quite as bad as some people make out. GROSS: How bad is it? IMPEY: Well, it's bad because this flat-line budget doesn't allow you to do adventurous, creative things. It really limits you. NASA can only do one big, clever thing every decade or so, and that's kind of tough because there's five or six or seven big, clever ideas on the table, things we'd like to do. GROSS: There's a new chapter in the space race, and that is that China has entered. And China is buying up a lot of resources on Earth like water and mineral rights in Africa. So what is it looking to do on the moon? IMPEY: Well, they have a multipronged space program. And the contrast, of course, is that they've grown their space activity at the rate of their economy, which has been 10 percent a year for a decade and may be slimming down a bit, but you know, that's compared to our flat-line budget for NASA. So they've got a doubling of their activity in less than a decade. They're looking to build their own space station, and it might be up there at a time when the International Space Station deorbited and burned up in the atmosphere. They're looking to go to the moon. They're looking to have a Mars rover. And they're actually, you know, unlike one of the stereotypes that they're just sort of copying our technology, they're actually innovating, and they have very young engineers in their space program - very keen, very well-trained, very ambitious. GROSS: You write that there's a lot of suspicion in America about China's motives in space. Who is suspicious? Is it the government, the Defense Department, NASA? IMPEY: Most government officials are suspicious because the Chinese are fairly secretive, and we still have this ITAR government regulation that really prohibits any technology transfer to the Chinese with regard to space. Also, you know, they did more than raise eyebrows when they blew up one of their own satellites in 2007 and caused a horrible storm of debris that sort of compromises everyone's activities at that distance. So it's a muscular space program. It's a little connected in ways that we don't fully understand to the military, and that makes people nervous. GROSS: Are people also nervous that they're going to claim as their own, say, parts of the moon? IMPEY: Well, the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 supposedly prohibits any country or government from claiming ownership of the moon or an asteroid or Mars. It leaves a loophole for individuals or corporations 'cause it just didn't anticipate that, so in principle, they can't really do that. Even where the Apollo and the astronauts landed is not really a U. S. preserve, which has led to some interesting issues as commercial entities try and go back to the moon and perhaps send their rovers trampling across the astronauts' footsteps and the lunar rover tracks. So the Chinese can't really claim ownership of it, but the resources - they can harvest the resources of the moon or Mars. And really, there's no rule against that. GROSS: If we, like, really stepped up the space program now and reinvigorated it with a supply of money, are there new innovations that have already been made that we could apply to space travel? IMPEY: I think the innovations that we haven't seen yet are going to come in the small scale. Humans in space, you know - it attracts our attention. It engages us. But you know, people are tricky in space. They're very fragile. They need to be fed and clothed. And they get bored, and they get lonely. And protecting them costs a lot of money and takes a lot of resources. The miniaturization of space travel, we really haven't seen a lot of, but it's happening very fast, particularly - there are things called CubeSats that are Rubik's Cube-type miniaturized satellites where the cost of building a little package and putting it in a 10 centimeter cube is maybe 50 or $100,000. So universities or even student groups get together, and they bundle these and then launch them together. And also, we're putting what amounts to cell phone technology in space. The sort of cameras and sensors that are routine in our cell phones, you can put those in Earth orbit and do Earth-looking stuff or eventually, outward looking stuff. So these small packages that are much, much cheaper to launch than a person are really going to revolutionize some of the things that happen in space. GROSS: So these small packages, as you put it, are launched within rockets? IMPEY: They launch within rockets, but their individual - the individual payloads are tiny. And you can just bundle a lot of them together into a conventional rocket, or maybe use a small rocket. And so for instance, last year, I think 140 CubeSats were launched, and that was more than in all the previous years. And the number's sort of doubling every year. So this is a real growth industry. And one part of it is getting away from the NASA model. This is maybe one area where NASA has, you know, taken a particular tack in, which is NASA's really good at these big, complex, billion-dollar missions - the Hubble Space Telescope, Cassini, the Mars rovers. But they're big. They're expensive. They take a decade. They're huge commitments. And NASA's not really gone in this sort of quick, cheap, fast and small route. And I think the private sector is doing that more vigorously than NASA is. GROSS: So what are some of the - what's some of the information or whatever that we're getting from these small packages that are being launched in space? IMPEY: Well, one interesting example using the sort of cell phone technologies and cameras that are really not much better than on your cell phone is, if you throw hundreds and hundreds of these little cell phone satellites into orbit, you just tolerate the fact that some of them will break or be destroyed or fall to the ground. And you have enough of them in orbit that they're planning to have a network that will be able to take a picture of every place on the Earth's surface literally every day or so. Maybe not with the resolution of the best GPS - so, like, a meter resolution - but that ability to monitor the Earth every day or so everywhere at that - there's never been that capability. So it's a brand-new capability enabled by these sort of cheap, small technologies. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Chris Impey. He's an astronomer and cosmologist and has written several books. His latest is called \"Beyond: Our Future in Space. \" Let's take a short break, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is astronomer and cosmologist Chris Impey. His new book is called \"Beyond: Our Future In Space. \"You write about the possibility - perhaps, a far-fetched possibility - of there eventually being a space elevator to get around the amount of fuel that you need to launch a rocket where you're basically sitting on an explosion all the time. So what's the vision for the space elevator? IMPEY: A space elevator is, of course, a cool idea out of science fiction. And Arthur C. Clarke most famously asked when we would have our space elevators. And he said, 50 years after people stop laughing, and I think people are about to stop laughing. The idea is basically you string a cable up into space to the point where it's suspended, like in an Indian rope trick, by the spinning force of the Earth up to a geostationary point, the place where a satellite would be stationary above your head, orbiting the Earth. That's a huge cable. That's 100,000-kilometer cable into space. And so can you find a material strong enough to make a cable that long suspended against gravity? And on the Earth, you can't. So an Earth-based space elevator is not possible with our current materials. But a moon elevator, where the gravity's one-sixth, actually could be done with current technology. GROSS: How do you even create a cable that long? IMPEY: You build it sort of in stages. I mean, just as you would span a chasm sort of by sending a thread across and then turning it into a rope and then a cable and then braiding it into a big thing. You sort of do the same thing. You'll suspend a very gossamer-thin cable up as far as you can and then gradually build it into a more robust cable, where it's handling its weight as it gets constructed. It's an incredible construction project, but I've met engineers - some at NASA, some elsewhere - they love this stuff. I mean, once they know it's possible, doesn't break laws of physics, doesn't break the laws of materials, they just want to do it. I mean, sign them on. So eventually it could happen on the moon. And the reason to do it on the moon, which doesn't seem like a great place to go, is that it's the great staging place for a space activity. If you can go to the moon with a base, you can mine the soil there for oxygen, which you could breathe or turn into rocket fuel. There's water in the lunar soil, so you can survive on the moon. And then if you build a space elevator, you can get essentially anywhere in the solar system for the cost of almost no rocket fuel. GROSS: So I'm still trying to envision what the idea behind this is. So you have this, like, incredibly long cable hanging down from the moon. And what, like - how does the rocket, or the whatever, get lifted onto the moon? IMPEY: So you - it's not a rocket. So just imagine you're holding a cable or a rope - a finite length piece of rope - and you're just spinning. You're just spinning it around. And it'll go straight out away from you by the centrifugal force. Well, the moon and the Earth are spinning, too. So if you have a cable going into the air sufficiently high, then it will be suspended by the force caused by the spinning object that you're standing on. And it will just appear to go straight up into the air, right out into space and hover there. It's perfectly balanced. And so then you don't need a rocket. You just make this cable robust enough that you can attach elevator cars to it, going up and down, just carrying things up and down. GROSS: Wow. It's really so hard to imagine (laughter) but. . . IMPEY: And the endpoint - so the endpoint of the elevator - where does it end? It goes straight up into space. It ends at place - basically the place that's called the geostationary orbit. So on Earth, we have satellites that just appear to hover in one point fixed in space because they're at this place where their orbital period equals a rotation period of the Earth. So you're essentially taking the cable up to that point. And if you carried some goods or some spacecraft up in an elevator to that point and let it go, it would be in orbit. GROSS: So do you think this is one of the things more likely to actually happen in the future? IMPEY: Well, it's a 20 to 30-year time frame. The fact that it can be done with present technology doesn't mean that it's easy. I've seen estimates of 10 to $20 billion for the cost of a space elevator. That's a lot of money. But if a set of corporations or governments got together to combine on it, it could possibly liberate an economic activity that dwarfed that number. GROSS: What is one of the more exciting developments in space travel or space life that you expect to see in your lifetime? IMPEY: I think the interesting and exciting thing will be when we get a community that's living off Earth for the first time, to see how they evolve. If they can get beyond the - just the sheer hardship of it, the - just the difficulty of being so far from the Earth, of being in close quarters, then at some point, after maybe only a couple of generations, these people will become an offshoot of the human tree. They will probably evolve into something else. They'll evolve physiologically quite quickly 'cause if the gravity is less, as it would be on Mars or the moon, they will change. Their physical bodies will change, even while they're alive. And if they have children and then grandchildren, they will change even more. And then psychologically, they will start to feel like a new - a new colony, a new people, as we moved around the planet and did so for reasons of just sheer exploration or freedom or wanting open spaces. You know, people diversified. They became quite different. And so the first off-Earth humans that live there and die there and then have children and grandchildren, they're going to quite quickly turn into maybe even a new species. GROSS: Among the things you've done - I mean, you're a professor at the University of Arizona in Tucson. But you've also taught in a special program that teaches astronomy, cosmology to Tibetan monks in exile in the Himalayas in India. And it's a special program called Science for Monks Leadership Program. And it was actually organized by the Dalai Lama, who wrote the introduction to one of your earlier books, which is called \"Humble Before The Void. \" And this book was all about you teaching science to these Tibetan monks. And in the introduction, the Dalai Lama writes, (reading) my own interest in science began when I was a young boy growing up in Tibet and came to understand the importance of science as another approach to understanding reality. What did the Dalai Lama tell you about why he thought it was important to teach science to Tibetan monks? IMPEY: And I've only met him once, but the message he has for his own cohort of monastics is that he doesn't want his culture to become a museum piece. You know, without a homeland, their culture is sort of eroding or being destroyed. And the monastic tradition is venerable, but it really hasn't changed for centuries. And he wants his monks and nuns to be trained for the 21st century. And so he wanted to inject math and science into the curriculum. And he's famously said that when he was 4 and picked to be the 14th reincarnation of the Bodhisattva of Compassion - if that hadn't happened, he'd have been an engineer. So he thinks very analytically. He thinks very logically. He's very engaged with talking to scientists. And he wanted that to become part of what monks learned, to be in the 21st century, to not be isolated culturally. And it's a wonderful program. I enjoy going there pretty much every year. GROSS: But, on the other hand, the whole point of being monastic, in some ways, is that you are isolated. IMPEY: Yes, it gives them an amazing separation to - with which to approach these sort of ineffable questions of our existence and origin and dark matter and dark energy. So when they engage the topics of cosmology, even though their math and physics training is slight, they ask the most fundamental questions. They're brilliant students because they're completely committed to learning. They're totally engaged. They're indefatigable. And they ask these incredible questions. GROSS: Give us an example of an incredible question. IMPEY: Well, sometimes, as an instructor, you even get frustrated by incredible questions 'cause they bring you to a halt. So we were talking one time about how astronomers measure the age of the universe to be 13. 8 billion years and also about the Big Bang and so on. And one of them just put his hand up, almost sheepishly, and asked, well, you measure time with radioactive decay and so on - well, how do you - how does time have any meaning before there were atoms? Or how do you measure time itself? Or what is the meaning of time? You know, so they just unravel to the most profound question that will floor most physicists. GROSS: And how do you come back (laughter) to a question like that? What do you say? IMPEY: Well, it, of course, derails my entire lesson plan 'cause we end off in a big discussion about the nature of time, which, you know, philosophers and physicists still wrestle with. Is time an emergent property, you know, that doesn't have any underlying reality? Is time a function of the way the universe is, such that if the universe were slightly different, time as we understand it wouldn't exist? We essentially spin off into these metaphysical and philosophical discussions. GROSS: My guest is astronomer and cosmologist Chris Impey. His new book about the past, present and future of space travel is called \"Beyond. \" After we take a short break, we'll talk more about teaching science to Tibetan monks, and we'll talk about what he's learned from them. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with astronomer and cosmologist Chris Impey. His new book, \"Beyond,\" is about the past, present and future of space travel. He's received a grant from NASA to write a history of U. S. space science and astronomy missions, and he spent time on the Hubble telescope to conduct his own research. He's a distinguished professor of astronomy at the University of Arizona. He's also part of a program created by the Dalai Lama to teach science to Tibetan monks. He's made several trips to monasteries in India where Tibetan monks are living in exile. When we left off, we were talking about teaching science to those monks. What was the monks' understanding of stars and the planets when you began teaching? IMPEY: So they do have a quite archaic view of cosmology. Their historical cosmology in the Buddhist tradition, which is inherited from Hinduism, involves Mount Meru at the center of the universe. It's sort of a, you know, a pre - very much a pre-Copernican Earth-centered almost flat-Earth view, and the stars and the distances to the stars don't have any real meaning to them. However, Buddhism and Hinduism are rich traditions, and the Dalai Lama's noted that there are 15 or 16 different cosmologies in their tradition, and he just laughs and says, well, 12 of them are just silly and wrong. So, you know, the monks are allowed and encouraged to be selective in which part of their tradition they accept, and some parts of their tradition are strikingly concordant with modern cosmology. They have parts of their tradition that talk about deep time - cycles of time of billions or even trillions of years. They have parts of their tradition that accommodate the idea of infinite worlds with life on them. You know, so they are fully capable of taking the vastness of time and space that we understand in modern cosmology, and it's assimilating it because it's part of their tradition, too. GROSS: You write that one of the concepts that was very difficult to communicate was the empty space that fills the solar system. You say there's nothing in Buddhist training that prepared these monks for the scale that you were dealing with. IMPEY: Yes, it's a difficult thing, although, on the other hand, the emptiness concept in Buddhism is very strong and also the idea that emptiness has its own reality and truth - that there doesn't have to be something for you to talk about for it to be real. So what we did was we used visualization. And it was a little - I was a little nervous about doing it when we started, but I would literally - their meditative powers are of course incredible, so I'd just get them to settle themselves, and then we'd just go out on these mental journeys out from the earth from where we were sitting in the monastery above the earth looking down on the solar system then moving out through the galaxy even out through space and time towards the Big Bang, and, you know, that was exhilarating to do that, and I think they had a fun ride, too. GROSS: What was the monk's reaction to the Big Bang theory, the idea that this enormous explosion is the start of, you know, of our planet and the start of life, and how does that compare with the belief that they had before you started teaching them about science? IMPEY: So the Big Bang itself is probably one area of cosmology that doesn't sit naturally in the Buddhist tradition because they believe in endless time, in cycles of time and, you know, space that might come into being and then go out of existence and life that does the same. However, cosmology is sort of moving in their direction because astronomers, having now diagnosed the Big Bang back to the first tiny fractions of a second, have started asking their own profound questions such as is the Big Bang the only space-time we can talk about, or what caused the Big Bang, or what was the precursor state? And out of those speculations, they've come up with ideas that if the universe, say, was a quantum fluctuation, there might've been other quantum fluctuations, and so perhaps there's a multi-verse concept. And time is endless where the origination of our space and time and the Big Bang is just one event, and that's starting to sound similar to the Buddhist tradition. GROSS: The title of your book about teaching science to Tibetan monks is \"Humble Before The Void. \" It's a beautiful expression. Where is that from? IMPEY: I don't think I found it anywhere else. It was - I was trying to encapsulate the magnificent combination they have of sort of playful curiosity and true humility in the face of the human condition and the face of understanding the universe. And at a personal level, that was the most - you know, that's the most rewarding thing about going to India. I find myself peeling away layers of my everyday life. You know, being a scientist and being an academic, it's a kind of, you know, sharp-elbowed, competitive world. People care about their reputations. There's a lot of big egos in play, and, you know, I have one, too. And there it just sort of doesn't matter as much, and you start to question your assumptions and the - you know, the nature of ambition and the nature of progress. Science is built on progress. It's always striving to learn more, to say more, to gain more knowledge and so on. And they are happy to be part of the progress of learning, but they don't see it as a goal in and of itself, and so they let you question some of your assumptions. GROSS: Did you practice meditation when you were in the Himalayas with the monks, and did they teach you about meditation? IMPEY: I wasn't a meditator before I went out there. I think I learned just by their example of how to think more calmly about things. The Buddhists talk about the monkey brain, and I can't pretend that my monkey brain, you know, settled down that much, but, you know, after three weeks off the grid living in a monastery, eating their very simple and slightly monotonous diet, enjoying the physical beauty and the smells of northern India - and the environment is incredible at the edge of the Himalayas - it has its effect. I mean, it percolates through to every part of you, and I think the net effect of that was meditative even though I wasn't actively meditating. GROSS: You write that it's interesting to compare the Tibetan monks' attitude toward learning science to conservative Christian groups. I'd like you to make the comparison. IMPEY: Well, it starts with his Holiness the Dalai Lama. He said famously, and in a couple of fora, that if science, modern science is found to disagree with the basic tenet of Buddhism, then Buddhism will change, and it's really hard to imagine those words coming out of the mouths of some religious leaders. That's an extraordinary openness to the inquiry that's at the heart of science, and so Buddhism, as I've experienced it and understood it, is a highly empirical thing. The Buddha, the historical figure, told his followers, don't accept my words as I tell you them. Like a metal smith would test the metal to see if it was pure, test my words to see if they are pure, to see if they agree with reality. So it's a very empirical tradition, and that's what aligns it with science. So the openness of his holiness to dialoguing with scientists, to having science in the monastic tradition, is an extremely strong statement by him that he doesn't see science as a threat to his religion. GROSS: He said if science is in conflict with Buddhism, then Buddhism will change. Has that been necessary yet? IMPEY: It's been necessary or it's happened in the example I gave of cosmology where the Buddhist tradition has many cosmologies and some of them are pre-Copernican and archaic, but they're still taught in the monasteries, and so he's trying to change that. He's trying to make the teaching in the monasteries be consistent with physics, to be consistent with modern astronomy and to be consistent with biology. The Buddhist tradition has some rather intriguing notions of sentience and the boundary between living and nonliving things, and those don't really accord with modern biology, so that's changing, too. GROSS: As a professor of cosmology and astronomy, do you ever see students who went to schools where evolution was not taught for religious reasons? IMPEY: Definitely, and I've had students, you know, actually smart students come up to me at the beginning of the semester and say, look, Professor Impey, I know you're going to talk about the Big Bang and Old Earth and so on, and I just want you to know I don't believe that. You know, I'll answer the - what you want in the multiple choice tests or on exams, but, you know, you need to know that that's not my belief system. That's unusually forthright. Most students don't say that, but I know that 10 or 15 percent of them in the demographics of my classroom are likely to have been in a situation where they did not get the scientific theory of evolution. GROSS: How do you deal with that as a teacher? IMPEY: I think all you can do is present the information. I mean, you can't really proselytize, to appropriate that word. You can't - certainly can't attack anyone's belief systems. And that's - you know, that's an important part of teaching. You have to be respectful. But you can just say, look, this is what we think we know about the natural world, and this is how we know it. And it's based on evidence. And the evidence is shared. It's open, and that's how science works. It's a very open activity. And you can judge for yourself. And if you look at all the evidence and you look at the community of people who have accepted this evidence and drawn a conclusion from it, you know, it's your call whether you want to adopt that as part of your worldview or not. GROSS: What's your reaction to schools that change the curriculum and eliminate certain chapters of scientific history because of religious principles and religious beliefs? IMPEY: I think that's the very insidious thing that's happening. And, of course, the co-conspirators in some of that are the major textbook companies. If they want the Texas adoption or the California adoption, they will customize their textbooks to those large markets to satisfy what the school boards there have said, and that's really dangerous. And then all the way up to the Supreme Court, there's been validation for the idea that in the science classroom, you teach science. You don't teach a controversy that doesn't exist on a subject where there is no controversy scientifically. And in other classrooms which might teach religious studies or might teach anthropology or cultural studies, you can teach different views of human activity. But in the science classroom, you should teach science, and the Supreme Court has validated that view. GROSS: What's the scientific question you'd most like to get an answer to or hear an answer to in your lifetime? IMPEY: Well, astronomers are in this intriguing situation where they have this really quite robust model of the universe - how it started and how it evolved - and yet, we don't know the two major ingredients of the universe. And in my research, I work on supermassive black holes and indirectly on dark matter. And dark matter and dark energy amount to 96 percent of the material contents of the universe, where all the atoms and all the stars and all the galaxies are the other 4 percent. At the moment, we don't know what dark matter and dark energy are. So I would love to see those two issues resolved because they're huge. They're saying that we are ignorant of the bulk of the universe, as we speak. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Chris Impey, and he's a cosmologist and astronomer and the author of the new book \"Beyond: Our Future In Space. \" Let's take a short break, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Chris Impey. He's a distinguished professor at the University of Arizona where he teaches astronomy and cosmology. He's written several books. His latest is called \"Beyond: Our Future In Space. \" And in addition to all that, he has also done a lot of research with these new telescopes that we're about to talk about, and he's made several trips to India to teach Tibetan monks in exile about science. Let's talk about the telescopes that you work with. And you've worked with the Hubble and with other telescopes in that family. Would you explain what makes those super telescopes different from the kind of telescope that most of us have looked through? IMPEY: Right. We'll start with the Hubble, which, well into its third decade, is still the preeminent astrophysics facility available to any astronomer. Some people forget that it's actually a pretty modest-sized telescope. It had to fit in the shuttle bay, which means it's just over 2 meters in diameter. And if you put it in a list of the world's largest telescopes on the ground or in space, it doesn't crack the top hundred. So it's a pretty modest telescope. What makes it extraordinary is the instruments that sit behind it gathering light and dispersing it into spectra and measuring infrared wavelengths as well as visible wavelengths. So it's got extraordinary instruments, and it sits above the atmosphere. And the atmosphere is sort of the enemy in astronomy 'cause it blurs the light. It stops you from seeing sharply. It stops you from seeing deep. There's glow associated with the atmosphere. Even when the moon's not out, the sky is not completely dark because of the terrestrial environment. So when you're above all that in space, you can just do a lot better. And that's really why Hubble is still doing great stuff. GROSS: What are you studying with these super telescopes? IMPEY: So I tend to - I use our telescopes in Chile. So Arizona is a good place for ground-based astronomy. We have some dark parts of the state still. But even now, American sites are just not dark enough. So we've been putting large telescopes - 6-and-a-half meter telescopes in Chile. And we're building a huge 22-meter telescope which would be the world's largest. And Chile's the best place in the world, essentially, to do astronomy now. It's dark. It's high. It's away from city lights and any kind of perturbations. And I'm using those telescopes to study supermassive black holes in distant galaxies because it turns out that every galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center, including our own. GROSS: Now, when you're studying that with a telescope, what exactly are you doing? You're not literally seeing a black hole. What are you - what information are you getting? IMPEY: That's right. You can see the black hole. The black hole itself is black. But what it does is it perturbs the center of the galaxy. It sends the stars screaming around on very fast orbits because of the gravity of this huge beast at the center. And by huge, we're talking hundreds of millions of times the mass of the sun. I think the biggest black hole in the universe is about 10 billion times the mass of the sun. So that intense gravity drives the stars nearby and the gas nearby into extremely high velocities. And so that's what you look at with an optical telescope. You look near - as near the center as you can get, and you look for these very faster speeds and very high energies of that material near the black hole. And that sort of lets you diagnose the black hole. GROSS: You've written that you've been able to snare light from near the beginning of time. What does that mean? IMPEY: It means that these large telescopes are like time machines. As you look out in space, you look back in time because the speed of light, while very fast, is finite. And so we see the moon as it was a second ago, nearby stars as they were 10 years ago, the edge of the galaxy as it was 100,000 years ago and nearby galaxies as they were millions of years ago. So the galaxies I study, we see light that has traveled for 5, 10, maybe 12 billion years, which is a big fraction of the age of the universe. So you are therefore looking back towards the universe when it was very young, and so a big telescope is turning into a time machine, lets you look back in time as close to the Big Bang as possible. GROSS: Since you've seen what you've described as a hidden universe, do you often wonder what else is out there that is invisible to us? IMPEY: Oh, absolutely. I mean, mostly what I wonder about 'cause one of my side interests is astrobiology is just what the possibilities of biology have been that really we can't detect right now. The Kepler satellite has essentially put a number on how many habitable Earth-like worlds there are just in our own galaxy, and it's an incredible number. It's 20 billion. So each of those is a potential biological experiment, and most of them are so far away, we just can't make images of them. We don't know what's happening on those Earth-like worlds even though we know they exist. That's what I would love to learn about. GROSS: So when you think about the possibility of life forms that might exist in distant galaxies, what kind of life forms do you think about? IMPEY: I don't think we are almost imaginative or creative enough to understand what they might be like. We're inevitably conditioned by the culture - I've read science fiction. I love movies - \"Star Wars,\" \"Star Trek\" - but they sort of acculture us to think anthropocentrically. We sort of tend to think of life that's a little bit like us or a lot like us. And the truth is, life could be so strange, we might not recognize it - certainly strange enough that we might not have real communication with it. So when you ask, how strange life might be in the universe, I don't think we know how to answer that question. And that's actually quite exciting. GROSS: Why do you find that exciting? IMPEY: Because I like the idea that we're not it. I like the idea that the universe - the boundless possibility of 20 billion habitable worlds has led to things that we can barely imagine. I think it's fun because it means your science is not self-contained and finite. It means that you have to really go out, way out, of the box even to imagine what astrobiology or life elsewhere might be like. GROSS: What do you say to people who are kind of dismissive of problems we now have on Earth - environmental problems, climate change, wars - and say, well, soon we'll be out in space, and we'll start all over again? IMPEY: Well, it's an important context for talking about space to not pretend that it's a solution to our problems. I mean, space is a brutally difficult and challenging environment. And only - what? - 500-or-so people have been in Earth orbit - a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of humanity. So when you read about terraforming Mars - oh, we could transform Mars and make it habitable and then move there - no, we're not going to do that. We couldn't afford to. It would take an incredibly long time, and there's no way we could get more than a tiny number of people there. So - and that applies to the Earth-like planets that we were talking about earlier. There's huge numbers of Earth-like planets, but the nearest one is probably going to be 20 light years away. At a tenth light speed, that's four generations to get there, and it's incredibly hard and expensive. So astronomy is just teaching us that although there are intriguing possibilities for living off Earth, our best solution by far is to take care of the home planet. GROSS: Chris Impey, it's been great to talk with you. Thank you so much, and safe travels back to India in October. IMPEY: Thanks, Terry. I've enjoyed it. GROSS: Chris Impey is the author of the new book \"Beyond: Our Future In Space. \" You can read an excerpt on our website freshair. npr. org. And if you want to catch up with FRESH AIR interviews you missed like last week's interview with the creator of \"Mad Men,\" Matthew Weiner, check out our podcast. Coming up, John Powers reviews the new restoration of the three films known as \"The Apu Trilogy\" by Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray. This is FRESH AIR. TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Science and Buddhist meditation are two radically different investigative traditions as the Dalai Lama has pointed out. But he thinks an understanding of science is essential to the understanding of reality, which is why he wants to bring scientific teachings into Tibetan monasteries. As part of the Dalai Lama's program, my guest, astronomer Chris Impey, has made several trips to India to teach science to Tibetan monks in exile. We're going to talk about that a little later. But first, we're going to talk about our future in outer space, which is the subject of Impey's new book, \"Beyond. \" The book examines the past, present and future of space travel and imagines what it would be like to establish a colony in space. Impey has also received a grant from NASA to write a history of U. S. space science and astronomy missions. His own research has been supported by $18 million in grants from NASA and the National Science Foundation. To conduct his research, he was given time on the Hubble Space Telescope. Impey is a distinguished professor of astronomy at the University of Arizona. Chris Impey, welcome to FRESH AIR. So if we had not cut back on funding for the space program, what might we have accomplished by now? CHRIS IMPEY: Well, I think we might actually be living on the moon and Mars - maybe not many of us, but we might have our first bases there. We'd have robust commercial space activity or people routinely in orbit. America wouldn't have had a hiatus of four years and counting when we couldn't get astronauts into space. It would be probably quite different. GROSS: What kind of commercial activity do you envision? IMPEY: Well, it's multifaceted. There's going to be a non-salubrious part. You know, I don't want to start with that, but there's going to be sex and drugs in space, as there have been driving most technologies, tourism, eventually commerce, mining asteroids. There's going to be a robust commercial activity 'cause there's a lot of valuable resources out in space. GROSS: The sex and drugs part, what is that? IMPEY: Well, it's just people will sort of take their normal activities to the frontier. For example, to have the first baby conceived and born in zero gravity or off Earth is kind of a foundational step for humans, so that's an amazing adventure. GROSS: You mean so people will be willing to pay a lot to say, wow, I had sex in space. IMPEY: Yeah, sex in space. The - you know, the astronauts at NASA and the Russians, you know, continually deny the heavy rumor mill that says it's already happened. The astronauts are well-trained. They're not supposed to do that. But yes, when the public is up there, they're going to do what they normally do on the Earth. GROSS: Not to make too much of this, but you do mention in your book that it might not be that easy to have sex in space, for one, because of blood-flow issues. What's the issue there? IMPEY: Yeah. Well, so your body is not functioning normally when gravity - all your capillaries and your muscles are designed to deal with the tug of gravity, and you won't have that. There'll also be ways in which, you know, Newton's third law of action and reaction sort of interfere with the normal, you know, methods of sex that you might use on Earth. It'll be - I just assume it's going to be an adventure. And people will be creative, and they'll find new ways to enjoy themselves. GROSS: So what's left of our space program? IMPEY: It's actually still pretty good. So I think the perception of NASA in the doldrums and that we're in a bad space in our activities is a little exaggerated. NASA's budget isn't growing, but it's also not declining. So they're investing in new technologies. We're going to get a new heavy launch capability in a couple of years. The space station is active and doing scientific experiments. We're not launching satellites. There's a heavy entourage of spacecraft going through the solar system and exploring there. It's not quite as bad as some people make out. GROSS: How bad is it? IMPEY: Well, it's bad because this flat-line budget doesn't allow you to do adventurous, creative things. It really limits you. NASA can only do one big, clever thing every decade or so, and that's kind of tough because there's five or six or seven big, clever ideas on the table, things we'd like to do. GROSS: There's a new chapter in the space race, and that is that China has entered. And China is buying up a lot of resources on Earth like water and mineral rights in Africa. So what is it looking to do on the moon? IMPEY: Well, they have a multipronged space program. And the contrast, of course, is that they've grown their space activity at the rate of their economy, which has been 10 percent a year for a decade and may be slimming down a bit, but you know, that's compared to our flat-line budget for NASA. So they've got a doubling of their activity in less than a decade. They're looking to build their own space station, and it might be up there at a time when the International Space Station deorbited and burned up in the atmosphere. They're looking to go to the moon. They're looking to have a Mars rover. And they're actually, you know, unlike one of the stereotypes that they're just sort of copying our technology, they're actually innovating, and they have very young engineers in their space program - very keen, very well-trained, very ambitious. GROSS: You write that there's a lot of suspicion in America about China's motives in space. Who is suspicious? Is it the government, the Defense Department, NASA? IMPEY: Most government officials are suspicious because the Chinese are fairly secretive, and we still have this ITAR government regulation that really prohibits any technology transfer to the Chinese with regard to space. Also, you know, they did more than raise eyebrows when they blew up one of their own satellites in 2007 and caused a horrible storm of debris that sort of compromises everyone's activities at that distance. So it's a muscular space program. It's a little connected in ways that we don't fully understand to the military, and that makes people nervous. GROSS: Are people also nervous that they're going to claim as their own, say, parts of the moon? IMPEY: Well, the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 supposedly prohibits any country or government from claiming ownership of the moon or an asteroid or Mars. It leaves a loophole for individuals or corporations 'cause it just didn't anticipate that, so in principle, they can't really do that. Even where the Apollo and the astronauts landed is not really a U. S. preserve, which has led to some interesting issues as commercial entities try and go back to the moon and perhaps send their rovers trampling across the astronauts' footsteps and the lunar rover tracks. So the Chinese can't really claim ownership of it, but the resources - they can harvest the resources of the moon or Mars. And really, there's no rule against that. GROSS: If we, like, really stepped up the space program now and reinvigorated it with a supply of money, are there new innovations that have already been made that we could apply to space travel? IMPEY: I think the innovations that we haven't seen yet are going to come in the small scale. Humans in space, you know - it attracts our attention. It engages us. But you know, people are tricky in space. They're very fragile. They need to be fed and clothed. And they get bored, and they get lonely. And protecting them costs a lot of money and takes a lot of resources. The miniaturization of space travel, we really haven't seen a lot of, but it's happening very fast, particularly - there are things called CubeSats that are Rubik's Cube-type miniaturized satellites where the cost of building a little package and putting it in a 10 centimeter cube is maybe 50 or $100,000. So universities or even student groups get together, and they bundle these and then launch them together. And also, we're putting what amounts to cell phone technology in space. The sort of cameras and sensors that are routine in our cell phones, you can put those in Earth orbit and do Earth-looking stuff or eventually, outward looking stuff. So these small packages that are much, much cheaper to launch than a person are really going to revolutionize some of the things that happen in space. GROSS: So these small packages, as you put it, are launched within rockets? IMPEY: They launch within rockets, but their individual - the individual payloads are tiny. And you can just bundle a lot of them together into a conventional rocket, or maybe use a small rocket. And so for instance, last year, I think 140 CubeSats were launched, and that was more than in all the previous years. And the number's sort of doubling every year. So this is a real growth industry. And one part of it is getting away from the NASA model. This is maybe one area where NASA has, you know, taken a particular tack in, which is NASA's really good at these big, complex, billion-dollar missions - the Hubble Space Telescope, Cassini, the Mars rovers. But they're big. They're expensive. They take a decade. They're huge commitments. And NASA's not really gone in this sort of quick, cheap, fast and small route. And I think the private sector is doing that more vigorously than NASA is. GROSS: So what are some of the - what's some of the information or whatever that we're getting from these small packages that are being launched in space? IMPEY: Well, one interesting example using the sort of cell phone technologies and cameras that are really not much better than on your cell phone is, if you throw hundreds and hundreds of these little cell phone satellites into orbit, you just tolerate the fact that some of them will break or be destroyed or fall to the ground. And you have enough of them in orbit that they're planning to have a network that will be able to take a picture of every place on the Earth's surface literally every day or so. Maybe not with the resolution of the best GPS - so, like, a meter resolution - but that ability to monitor the Earth every day or so everywhere at that - there's never been that capability. So it's a brand-new capability enabled by these sort of cheap, small technologies. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Chris Impey. He's an astronomer and cosmologist and has written several books. His latest is called \"Beyond: Our Future in Space. \" Let's take a short break, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is astronomer and cosmologist Chris Impey. His new book is called \"Beyond: Our Future In Space. \" You write about the possibility - perhaps, a far-fetched possibility - of there eventually being a space elevator to get around the amount of fuel that you need to launch a rocket where you're basically sitting on an explosion all the time. So what's the vision for the space elevator? IMPEY: A space elevator is, of course, a cool idea out of science fiction. And Arthur C. Clarke most famously asked when we would have our space elevators. And he said, 50 years after people stop laughing, and I think people are about to stop laughing. The idea is basically you string a cable up into space to the point where it's suspended, like in an Indian rope trick, by the spinning force of the Earth up to a geostationary point, the place where a satellite would be stationary above your head, orbiting the Earth. That's a huge cable. That's 100,000-kilometer cable into space. And so can you find a material strong enough to make a cable that long suspended against gravity? And on the Earth, you can't. So an Earth-based space elevator is not possible with our current materials. But a moon elevator, where the gravity's one-sixth, actually could be done with current technology. GROSS: How do you even create a cable that long? IMPEY: You build it sort of in stages. I mean, just as you would span a chasm sort of by sending a thread across and then turning it into a rope and then a cable and then braiding it into a big thing. You sort of do the same thing. You'll suspend a very gossamer-thin cable up as far as you can and then gradually build it into a more robust cable, where it's handling its weight as it gets constructed. It's an incredible construction project, but I've met engineers - some at NASA, some elsewhere - they love this stuff. I mean, once they know it's possible, doesn't break laws of physics, doesn't break the laws of materials, they just want to do it. I mean, sign them on. So eventually it could happen on the moon. And the reason to do it on the moon, which doesn't seem like a great place to go, is that it's the great staging place for a space activity. If you can go to the moon with a base, you can mine the soil there for oxygen, which you could breathe or turn into rocket fuel. There's water in the lunar soil, so you can survive on the moon. And then if you build a space elevator, you can get essentially anywhere in the solar system for the cost of almost no rocket fuel. GROSS: So I'm still trying to envision what the idea behind this is. So you have this, like, incredibly long cable hanging down from the moon. And what, like - how does the rocket, or the whatever, get lifted onto the moon? IMPEY: So you - it's not a rocket. So just imagine you're holding a cable or a rope - a finite length piece of rope - and you're just spinning. You're just spinning it around. And it'll go straight out away from you by the centrifugal force. Well, the moon and the Earth are spinning, too. So if you have a cable going into the air sufficiently high, then it will be suspended by the force caused by the spinning object that you're standing on. And it will just appear to go straight up into the air, right out into space and hover there. It's perfectly balanced. And so then you don't need a rocket. You just make this cable robust enough that you can attach elevator cars to it, going up and down, just carrying things up and down. GROSS: Wow. It's really so hard to imagine (laughter) but. . . IMPEY: And the endpoint - so the endpoint of the elevator - where does it end? It goes straight up into space. It ends at place - basically the place that's called the geostationary orbit. So on Earth, we have satellites that just appear to hover in one point fixed in space because they're at this place where their orbital period equals a rotation period of the Earth. So you're essentially taking the cable up to that point. And if you carried some goods or some spacecraft up in an elevator to that point and let it go, it would be in orbit. GROSS: So do you think this is one of the things more likely to actually happen in the future? IMPEY: Well, it's a 20 to 30-year time frame. The fact that it can be done with present technology doesn't mean that it's easy. I've seen estimates of 10 to $20 billion for the cost of a space elevator. That's a lot of money. But if a set of corporations or governments got together to combine on it, it could possibly liberate an economic activity that dwarfed that number. GROSS: What is one of the more exciting developments in space travel or space life that you expect to see in your lifetime? IMPEY: I think the interesting and exciting thing will be when we get a community that's living off Earth for the first time, to see how they evolve. If they can get beyond the - just the sheer hardship of it, the - just the difficulty of being so far from the Earth, of being in close quarters, then at some point, after maybe only a couple of generations, these people will become an offshoot of the human tree. They will probably evolve into something else. They'll evolve physiologically quite quickly 'cause if the gravity is less, as it would be on Mars or the moon, they will change. Their physical bodies will change, even while they're alive. And if they have children and then grandchildren, they will change even more. And then psychologically, they will start to feel like a new - a new colony, a new people, as we moved around the planet and did so for reasons of just sheer exploration or freedom or wanting open spaces. You know, people diversified. They became quite different. And so the first off-Earth humans that live there and die there and then have children and grandchildren, they're going to quite quickly turn into maybe even a new species. GROSS: Among the things you've done - I mean, you're a professor at the University of Arizona in Tucson. But you've also taught in a special program that teaches astronomy, cosmology to Tibetan monks in exile in the Himalayas in India. And it's a special program called Science for Monks Leadership Program. And it was actually organized by the Dalai Lama, who wrote the introduction to one of your earlier books, which is called \"Humble Before The Void. \" And this book was all about you teaching science to these Tibetan monks. And in the introduction, the Dalai Lama writes, (reading) my own interest in science began when I was a young boy growing up in Tibet and came to understand the importance of science as another approach to understanding reality. What did the Dalai Lama tell you about why he thought it was important to teach science to Tibetan monks? IMPEY: And I've only met him once, but the message he has for his own cohort of monastics is that he doesn't want his culture to become a museum piece. You know, without a homeland, their culture is sort of eroding or being destroyed. And the monastic tradition is venerable, but it really hasn't changed for centuries. And he wants his monks and nuns to be trained for the 21st century. And so he wanted to inject math and science into the curriculum. And he's famously said that when he was 4 and picked to be the 14th reincarnation of the Bodhisattva of Compassion - if that hadn't happened, he'd have been an engineer. So he thinks very analytically. He thinks very logically. He's very engaged with talking to scientists. And he wanted that to become part of what monks learned, to be in the 21st century, to not be isolated culturally. And it's a wonderful program. I enjoy going there pretty much every year. GROSS: But, on the other hand, the whole point of being monastic, in some ways, is that you are isolated. IMPEY: Yes, it gives them an amazing separation to - with which to approach these sort of ineffable questions of our existence and origin and dark matter and dark energy. So when they engage the topics of cosmology, even though their math and physics training is slight, they ask the most fundamental questions. They're brilliant students because they're completely committed to learning. They're totally engaged. They're indefatigable. And they ask these incredible questions. GROSS: Give us an example of an incredible question. IMPEY: Well, sometimes, as an instructor, you even get frustrated by incredible questions 'cause they bring you to a halt. So we were talking one time about how astronomers measure the age of the universe to be 13. 8 billion years and also about the Big Bang and so on. And one of them just put his hand up, almost sheepishly, and asked, well, you measure time with radioactive decay and so on - well, how do you - how does time have any meaning before there were atoms? Or how do you measure time itself? Or what is the meaning of time? You know, so they just unravel to the most profound question that will floor most physicists. GROSS: And how do you come back (laughter) to a question like that? What do you say? IMPEY: Well, it, of course, derails my entire lesson plan 'cause we end off in a big discussion about the nature of time, which, you know, philosophers and physicists still wrestle with. Is time an emergent property, you know, that doesn't have any underlying reality? Is time a function of the way the universe is, such that if the universe were slightly different, time as we understand it wouldn't exist? We essentially spin off into these metaphysical and philosophical discussions. GROSS: My guest is astronomer and cosmologist Chris Impey. His new book about the past, present and future of space travel is called \"Beyond. \" After we take a short break, we'll talk more about teaching science to Tibetan monks, and we'll talk about what he's learned from them. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with astronomer and cosmologist Chris Impey. His new book, \"Beyond,\" is about the past, present and future of space travel. He's received a grant from NASA to write a history of U. S. space science and astronomy missions, and he spent time on the Hubble telescope to conduct his own research. He's a distinguished professor of astronomy at the University of Arizona. He's also part of a program created by the Dalai Lama to teach science to Tibetan monks. He's made several trips to monasteries in India where Tibetan monks are living in exile. When we left off, we were talking about teaching science to those monks. What was the monks' understanding of stars and the planets when you began teaching? IMPEY: So they do have a quite archaic view of cosmology. Their historical cosmology in the Buddhist tradition, which is inherited from Hinduism, involves Mount Meru at the center of the universe. It's sort of a, you know, a pre - very much a pre-Copernican Earth-centered almost flat-Earth view, and the stars and the distances to the stars don't have any real meaning to them. However, Buddhism and Hinduism are rich traditions, and the Dalai Lama's noted that there are 15 or 16 different cosmologies in their tradition, and he just laughs and says, well, 12 of them are just silly and wrong. So, you know, the monks are allowed and encouraged to be selective in which part of their tradition they accept, and some parts of their tradition are strikingly concordant with modern cosmology. They have parts of their tradition that talk about deep time - cycles of time of billions or even trillions of years. They have parts of their tradition that accommodate the idea of infinite worlds with life on them. You know, so they are fully capable of taking the vastness of time and space that we understand in modern cosmology, and it's assimilating it because it's part of their tradition, too. GROSS: You write that one of the concepts that was very difficult to communicate was the empty space that fills the solar system. You say there's nothing in Buddhist training that prepared these monks for the scale that you were dealing with. IMPEY: Yes, it's a difficult thing, although, on the other hand, the emptiness concept in Buddhism is very strong and also the idea that emptiness has its own reality and truth - that there doesn't have to be something for you to talk about for it to be real. So what we did was we used visualization. And it was a little - I was a little nervous about doing it when we started, but I would literally - their meditative powers are of course incredible, so I'd just get them to settle themselves, and then we'd just go out on these mental journeys out from the earth from where we were sitting in the monastery above the earth looking down on the solar system then moving out through the galaxy even out through space and time towards the Big Bang, and, you know, that was exhilarating to do that, and I think they had a fun ride, too. GROSS: What was the monk's reaction to the Big Bang theory, the idea that this enormous explosion is the start of, you know, of our planet and the start of life, and how does that compare with the belief that they had before you started teaching them about science? IMPEY: So the Big Bang itself is probably one area of cosmology that doesn't sit naturally in the Buddhist tradition because they believe in endless time, in cycles of time and, you know, space that might come into being and then go out of existence and life that does the same. However, cosmology is sort of moving in their direction because astronomers, having now diagnosed the Big Bang back to the first tiny fractions of a second, have started asking their own profound questions such as is the Big Bang the only space-time we can talk about, or what caused the Big Bang, or what was the precursor state? And out of those speculations, they've come up with ideas that if the universe, say, was a quantum fluctuation, there might've been other quantum fluctuations, and so perhaps there's a multi-verse concept. And time is endless where the origination of our space and time and the Big Bang is just one event, and that's starting to sound similar to the Buddhist tradition. GROSS: The title of your book about teaching science to Tibetan monks is \"Humble Before The Void. \" It's a beautiful expression. Where is that from? IMPEY: I don't think I found it anywhere else. It was - I was trying to encapsulate the magnificent combination they have of sort of playful curiosity and true humility in the face of the human condition and the face of understanding the universe. And at a personal level, that was the most - you know, that's the most rewarding thing about going to India. I find myself peeling away layers of my everyday life. You know, being a scientist and being an academic, it's a kind of, you know, sharp-elbowed, competitive world. People care about their reputations. There's a lot of big egos in play, and, you know, I have one, too. And there it just sort of doesn't matter as much, and you start to question your assumptions and the - you know, the nature of ambition and the nature of progress. Science is built on progress. It's always striving to learn more, to say more, to gain more knowledge and so on. And they are happy to be part of the progress of learning, but they don't see it as a goal in and of itself, and so they let you question some of your assumptions. GROSS: Did you practice meditation when you were in the Himalayas with the monks, and did they teach you about meditation? IMPEY: I wasn't a meditator before I went out there. I think I learned just by their example of how to think more calmly about things. The Buddhists talk about the monkey brain, and I can't pretend that my monkey brain, you know, settled down that much, but, you know, after three weeks off the grid living in a monastery, eating their very simple and slightly monotonous diet, enjoying the physical beauty and the smells of northern India - and the environment is incredible at the edge of the Himalayas - it has its effect. I mean, it percolates through to every part of you, and I think the net effect of that was meditative even though I wasn't actively meditating. GROSS: You write that it's interesting to compare the Tibetan monks' attitude toward learning science to conservative Christian groups. I'd like you to make the comparison. IMPEY: Well, it starts with his Holiness the Dalai Lama. He said famously, and in a couple of fora, that if science, modern science is found to disagree with the basic tenet of Buddhism, then Buddhism will change, and it's really hard to imagine those words coming out of the mouths of some religious leaders. That's an extraordinary openness to the inquiry that's at the heart of science, and so Buddhism, as I've experienced it and understood it, is a highly empirical thing. The Buddha, the historical figure, told his followers, don't accept my words as I tell you them. Like a metal smith would test the metal to see if it was pure, test my words to see if they are pure, to see if they agree with reality. So it's a very empirical tradition, and that's what aligns it with science. So the openness of his holiness to dialoguing with scientists, to having science in the monastic tradition, is an extremely strong statement by him that he doesn't see science as a threat to his religion. GROSS: He said if science is in conflict with Buddhism, then Buddhism will change. Has that been necessary yet? IMPEY: It's been necessary or it's happened in the example I gave of cosmology where the Buddhist tradition has many cosmologies and some of them are pre-Copernican and archaic, but they're still taught in the monasteries, and so he's trying to change that. He's trying to make the teaching in the monasteries be consistent with physics, to be consistent with modern astronomy and to be consistent with biology. The Buddhist tradition has some rather intriguing notions of sentience and the boundary between living and nonliving things, and those don't really accord with modern biology, so that's changing, too. GROSS: As a professor of cosmology and astronomy, do you ever see students who went to schools where evolution was not taught for religious reasons? IMPEY: Definitely, and I've had students, you know, actually smart students come up to me at the beginning of the semester and say, look, Professor Impey, I know you're going to talk about the Big Bang and Old Earth and so on, and I just want you to know I don't believe that. You know, I'll answer the - what you want in the multiple choice tests or on exams, but, you know, you need to know that that's not my belief system. That's unusually forthright. Most students don't say that, but I know that 10 or 15 percent of them in the demographics of my classroom are likely to have been in a situation where they did not get the scientific theory of evolution. GROSS: How do you deal with that as a teacher? IMPEY: I think all you can do is present the information. I mean, you can't really proselytize, to appropriate that word. You can't - certainly can't attack anyone's belief systems. And that's - you know, that's an important part of teaching. You have to be respectful. But you can just say, look, this is what we think we know about the natural world, and this is how we know it. And it's based on evidence. And the evidence is shared. It's open, and that's how science works. It's a very open activity. And you can judge for yourself. And if you look at all the evidence and you look at the community of people who have accepted this evidence and drawn a conclusion from it, you know, it's your call whether you want to adopt that as part of your worldview or not. GROSS: What's your reaction to schools that change the curriculum and eliminate certain chapters of scientific history because of religious principles and religious beliefs? IMPEY: I think that's the very insidious thing that's happening. And, of course, the co-conspirators in some of that are the major textbook companies. If they want the Texas adoption or the California adoption, they will customize their textbooks to those large markets to satisfy what the school boards there have said, and that's really dangerous. And then all the way up to the Supreme Court, there's been validation for the idea that in the science classroom, you teach science. You don't teach a controversy that doesn't exist on a subject where there is no controversy scientifically. And in other classrooms which might teach religious studies or might teach anthropology or cultural studies, you can teach different views of human activity. But in the science classroom, you should teach science, and the Supreme Court has validated that view. GROSS: What's the scientific question you'd most like to get an answer to or hear an answer to in your lifetime? IMPEY: Well, astronomers are in this intriguing situation where they have this really quite robust model of the universe - how it started and how it evolved - and yet, we don't know the two major ingredients of the universe. And in my research, I work on supermassive black holes and indirectly on dark matter. And dark matter and dark energy amount to 96 percent of the material contents of the universe, where all the atoms and all the stars and all the galaxies are the other 4 percent. At the moment, we don't know what dark matter and dark energy are. So I would love to see those two issues resolved because they're huge. They're saying that we are ignorant of the bulk of the universe, as we speak. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Chris Impey, and he's a cosmologist and astronomer and the author of the new book \"Beyond: Our Future In Space. \" Let's take a short break, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Chris Impey. He's a distinguished professor at the University of Arizona where he teaches astronomy and cosmology. He's written several books. His latest is called \"Beyond: Our Future In Space. \" And in addition to all that, he has also done a lot of research with these new telescopes that we're about to talk about, and he's made several trips to India to teach Tibetan monks in exile about science. Let's talk about the telescopes that you work with. And you've worked with the Hubble and with other telescopes in that family. Would you explain what makes those super telescopes different from the kind of telescope that most of us have looked through? IMPEY: Right. We'll start with the Hubble, which, well into its third decade, is still the preeminent astrophysics facility available to any astronomer. Some people forget that it's actually a pretty modest-sized telescope. It had to fit in the shuttle bay, which means it's just over 2 meters in diameter. And if you put it in a list of the world's largest telescopes on the ground or in space, it doesn't crack the top hundred. So it's a pretty modest telescope. What makes it extraordinary is the instruments that sit behind it gathering light and dispersing it into spectra and measuring infrared wavelengths as well as visible wavelengths. So it's got extraordinary instruments, and it sits above the atmosphere. And the atmosphere is sort of the enemy in astronomy 'cause it blurs the light. It stops you from seeing sharply. It stops you from seeing deep. There's glow associated with the atmosphere. Even when the moon's not out, the sky is not completely dark because of the terrestrial environment. So when you're above all that in space, you can just do a lot better. And that's really why Hubble is still doing great stuff. GROSS: What are you studying with these super telescopes? IMPEY: So I tend to - I use our telescopes in Chile. So Arizona is a good place for ground-based astronomy. We have some dark parts of the state still. But even now, American sites are just not dark enough. So we've been putting large telescopes - 6-and-a-half meter telescopes in Chile. And we're building a huge 22-meter telescope which would be the world's largest. And Chile's the best place in the world, essentially, to do astronomy now. It's dark. It's high. It's away from city lights and any kind of perturbations. And I'm using those telescopes to study supermassive black holes in distant galaxies because it turns out that every galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center, including our own. GROSS: Now, when you're studying that with a telescope, what exactly are you doing? You're not literally seeing a black hole. What are you - what information are you getting? IMPEY: That's right. You can see the black hole. The black hole itself is black. But what it does is it perturbs the center of the galaxy. It sends the stars screaming around on very fast orbits because of the gravity of this huge beast at the center. And by huge, we're talking hundreds of millions of times the mass of the sun. I think the biggest black hole in the universe is about 10 billion times the mass of the sun. So that intense gravity drives the stars nearby and the gas nearby into extremely high velocities. And so that's what you look at with an optical telescope. You look near - as near the center as you can get, and you look for these very faster speeds and very high energies of that material near the black hole. And that sort of lets you diagnose the black hole. GROSS: You've written that you've been able to snare light from near the beginning of time. What does that mean? IMPEY: It means that these large telescopes are like time machines. As you look out in space, you look back in time because the speed of light, while very fast, is finite. And so we see the moon as it was a second ago, nearby stars as they were 10 years ago, the edge of the galaxy as it was 100,000 years ago and nearby galaxies as they were millions of years ago. So the galaxies I study, we see light that has traveled for 5, 10, maybe 12 billion years, which is a big fraction of the age of the universe. So you are therefore looking back towards the universe when it was very young, and so a big telescope is turning into a time machine, lets you look back in time as close to the Big Bang as possible. GROSS: Since you've seen what you've described as a hidden universe, do you often wonder what else is out there that is invisible to us? IMPEY: Oh, absolutely. I mean, mostly what I wonder about 'cause one of my side interests is astrobiology is just what the possibilities of biology have been that really we can't detect right now. The Kepler satellite has essentially put a number on how many habitable Earth-like worlds there are just in our own galaxy, and it's an incredible number. It's 20 billion. So each of those is a potential biological experiment, and most of them are so far away, we just can't make images of them. We don't know what's happening on those Earth-like worlds even though we know they exist. That's what I would love to learn about. GROSS: So when you think about the possibility of life forms that might exist in distant galaxies, what kind of life forms do you think about? IMPEY: I don't think we are almost imaginative or creative enough to understand what they might be like. We're inevitably conditioned by the culture - I've read science fiction. I love movies - \"Star Wars,\" \"Star Trek\" - but they sort of acculture us to think anthropocentrically. We sort of tend to think of life that's a little bit like us or a lot like us. And the truth is, life could be so strange, we might not recognize it - certainly strange enough that we might not have real communication with it. So when you ask, how strange life might be in the universe, I don't think we know how to answer that question. And that's actually quite exciting. GROSS: Why do you find that exciting? IMPEY: Because I like the idea that we're not it. I like the idea that the universe - the boundless possibility of 20 billion habitable worlds has led to things that we can barely imagine. I think it's fun because it means your science is not self-contained and finite. It means that you have to really go out, way out, of the box even to imagine what astrobiology or life elsewhere might be like. GROSS: What do you say to people who are kind of dismissive of problems we now have on Earth - environmental problems, climate change, wars - and say, well, soon we'll be out in space, and we'll start all over again? IMPEY: Well, it's an important context for talking about space to not pretend that it's a solution to our problems. I mean, space is a brutally difficult and challenging environment. And only - what? - 500-or-so people have been in Earth orbit - a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of humanity. So when you read about terraforming Mars - oh, we could transform Mars and make it habitable and then move there - no, we're not going to do that. We couldn't afford to. It would take an incredibly long time, and there's no way we could get more than a tiny number of people there. So - and that applies to the Earth-like planets that we were talking about earlier. There's huge numbers of Earth-like planets, but the nearest one is probably going to be 20 light years away. At a tenth light speed, that's four generations to get there, and it's incredibly hard and expensive. So astronomy is just teaching us that although there are intriguing possibilities for living off Earth, our best solution by far is to take care of the home planet. GROSS: Chris Impey, it's been great to talk with you. Thank you so much, and safe travels back to India in October. IMPEY: Thanks, Terry. I've enjoyed it.

RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: That might be a slightly overblown description of their task, but only slightly. They are two diplomats leading international negotiations over climate change. Their leading talk's due to wrap up in Paris later this year. INSKEEP: Their task is to get 200 countries to agree on what to do. Those 200 nations, of course, include the United States, where both houses of Congress include leaders who dismissed the scientific consensus on climate change. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce wanted to meet the men who would sign up for such a task. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: The vast State Department building in Washington, D. C. is a labyrinth. My official escort gets lost. We have to consult maps and ask strangers. Finally, we reach a small, stuffy, windowless conference room where Dan Reifsnyder is waiting. DAN REIFSNYDER: My normal job is deputy assistant secretary for environment here at the State Department. GREENFIELDBOYCE: For the rest of this year, though, he's doing something a little different - chairing climate talks for the United Nations. REIFSNYDER: It's kind of like taking 196 cats and trying to get them all to move in the same direction. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But at least he's not herding these cats alone. His co-chair is sitting across the table. He's an ambassador from Algeria named Ahmed Djoghlaf. And he says he's only part of this, quote, \"thanks to Dan. \" I ask him what he means and Djoghlaf says, he wouldn't have agreed to lead the negotiations with anyone else. AHMED DJOGHLAF: If it was not Dan as a co-chair, I would have think twice. The chemistry and working relationship between two to guide a process is very important. It's like you have a co-pilot, not a pilot. So if you don't get along, the plane can collapse and you can have a crash. GREENFIELDBOYCE: What these two men are actually piloting is something called the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action. This is diplomat speak for the effort to finally get a meaningful, global agreement to rein in greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet. REIFSNYDER: They say that we're married this year, Ahmed and I. It probably feels like that to our spouses, you know, 'cause we're probably with each other more often than with them. GREENFIELDBOYCE: This is kind of an arranged marriage. There are two co-chairs because the industrialized world and the developing world don't trust each other. Historically, rich nations have wanted to curb emissions. Poor nations have said, hey, you made this mess, not us. Don't set rules that might limit our growth. So there's one chair from the U. S. and one from Algeria. Didn't you guys used to be, basically, part of groups that would be opposed to each other? REIFSNYDER: Yes, but an interesting thing happens when you get elected to one of these positions. You know, you kind of are expected and you do, I think, kind of rise above your group. You cease to become an advocate. You become a broker. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And despite growing up an ocean apart, these brokers seem to have a lot in common. They both wear suits and ties. Reifsnyder's tie is striped; Djoghlaf's has little elephants. They both have Ph. D. s and law degrees. They're both in their 60s with gray hair. Both say, in another life, they might've been college professors. Instead, they were both drawn to this career. When I asked them what it's really like to do international climate negotiations, Reifsnyder tells me the story of one would-be negotiator. She has to follow him around to learn the ropes, but she didn't last long. REIFSNYDER: She said, I need sleep, I need food, I need exercise, I need fresh air; I can't do this. I can't sit in rooms for 18 hours on end and not eat and not sleep and listen to these arguments and go at it. And I thought, well, it's a good thing you figured that out in three days. You know, I haven't figured it out yet. (LAUGHTER)GREENFIELDBOYCE: Neither has Djoghlaf, who's cracking up at this description of their life's work. So you like this life? DJOGHLAF: To be frank with you, no, no. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Djoghlaf actually had been planning to retire, which pleased his wife, but instead, he took on this huge responsibility. DJOGHLAF: So when she heard about it, she was mad. And she told me that you cannot live without these processes and you are addicted. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He and Reifsnyder both say what drives them is a sense of mission. REIFSNYDER: We only have one planet, you know? We have to protect it. GREENFIELDBOYCE: These guys can't remember when they first met. They say it must have been during some of the very first climate negotiations about 25 years ago. I asked them how they would describe each other. Djoghlaf says his partner is a walking encyclopedia of climate change. DJOGHLAF: I am relying entirely on him on the substance, of course, on the knowledge of the issues. , and the issues are extremely complicated. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And in return, here's what Reifsnyder says about him. REIFSNYDER: I would say he is the quintessential diplomat. He is extremely gifted and smooth with people. DJOGHLAF: And that is what Dan thinks, but this is not true (laughter). GREENFIELDBOYCE: He's such a good diplomat, he insists that, really, his colleague is more skilled. But let's be clear. All the diplomacy in the world won't stop the planet from getting warmer. Most experts predict that when talks conclude in Paris, nations won't have promised enough to meet a goal set years ago, limiting global warming to two degrees Celsius. Still, it would be a big deal to get consensus on a reasonably ambitious and robust plan for moving forward. That would repair some damage done in 2009 when the last major climate talks fell apart in Copenhagen. DJOGHLAF: As you know, in 2009, it was a failure. You can call it whatever you want, but it was a failure. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Djoghlaf says no one can afford a repeat of that. That's why he and Reifsnyder will spend months listening to representatives from countries big and small. They'll wrangle with long, unwieldy documents and will agonize over every detail of negotiation sessions right down to the seating arrangements. REIFSNYDER: People talk about how you spend years negotiating the shape of the table. Well, the shape of the table can be very important. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Later this year in Paris, they'll find out if they got the shape of the table right. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  We're about to meet two men whose assignment is to save the world. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  That might be a slightly overblown description of their task, but only slightly. They are two diplomats leading international negotiations over climate change. Their leading talk's due to wrap up in Paris later this year. INSKEEP: Their task is to get 200 countries to agree on what to do. Those 200 nations, of course, include the United States, where both houses of Congress include leaders who dismissed the scientific consensus on climate change. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce wanted to meet the men who would sign up for such a task. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: The vast State Department building in Washington, D. C. is a labyrinth. My official escort gets lost. We have to consult maps and ask strangers. Finally, we reach a small, stuffy, windowless conference room where Dan Reifsnyder is waiting. DAN REIFSNYDER: My normal job is deputy assistant secretary for environment here at the State Department. GREENFIELDBOYCE: For the rest of this year, though, he's doing something a little different - chairing climate talks for the United Nations. REIFSNYDER: It's kind of like taking 196 cats and trying to get them all to move in the same direction. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But at least he's not herding these cats alone. His co-chair is sitting across the table. He's an ambassador from Algeria named Ahmed Djoghlaf. And he says he's only part of this, quote, \"thanks to Dan. \" I ask him what he means and Djoghlaf says, he wouldn't have agreed to lead the negotiations with anyone else. AHMED DJOGHLAF: If it was not Dan as a co-chair, I would have think twice. The chemistry and working relationship between two to guide a process is very important. It's like you have a co-pilot, not a pilot. So if you don't get along, the plane can collapse and you can have a crash. GREENFIELDBOYCE: What these two men are actually piloting is something called the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action. This is diplomat speak for the effort to finally get a meaningful, global agreement to rein in greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet. REIFSNYDER: They say that we're married this year, Ahmed and I. It probably feels like that to our spouses, you know, 'cause we're probably with each other more often than with them. GREENFIELDBOYCE: This is kind of an arranged marriage. There are two co-chairs because the industrialized world and the developing world don't trust each other. Historically, rich nations have wanted to curb emissions. Poor nations have said, hey, you made this mess, not us. Don't set rules that might limit our growth. So there's one chair from the U. S. and one from Algeria. Didn't you guys used to be, basically, part of groups that would be opposed to each other? REIFSNYDER: Yes, but an interesting thing happens when you get elected to one of these positions. You know, you kind of are expected and you do, I think, kind of rise above your group. You cease to become an advocate. You become a broker. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And despite growing up an ocean apart, these brokers seem to have a lot in common. They both wear suits and ties. Reifsnyder's tie is striped; Djoghlaf's has little elephants. They both have Ph. D. s and law degrees. They're both in their 60s with gray hair. Both say, in another life, they might've been college professors. Instead, they were both drawn to this career. When I asked them what it's really like to do international climate negotiations, Reifsnyder tells me the story of one would-be negotiator. She has to follow him around to learn the ropes, but she didn't last long. REIFSNYDER: She said, I need sleep, I need food, I need exercise, I need fresh air; I can't do this.

We first learned about the term colony collapse disorder, or CCD, about a decade ago when there was an increase in the mass die-off of honeybees. The rate of colony collapse did slow down, giving beekeepers some hope. But results from a new survey, sponsored in part by the Department of Agriculture, is causing a fresh round of alarm. The survey says during last summer - summer - when bees should be happiest and healthiest, die-offs spiked again. To talk more is Gene Brandi. He's a beekeeper and vice president of the American Beekeeping Federation. Welcome to the program. GENE BRANDI: Thanks, Audie. Glad to be here. CORNISH: So to give people a sense of the numbers here, 5,000 of your fellow beekeepers reported losing 42 percent of their colonies between April 2014 to this April. In the previous period, they lost 34 percent. So I mean, do these numbers fit with what you've actually seen on the ground there in Central California? BRANDI: Actually, the numbers may be a bit conservative. I certainly know a lot of beekeepers who lost more than that. CORNISH: And beekeepers don't just collect honey, right? Help us understand how you make your livelihood keeping bees. BRANDI: Well, the greatest benefit that bees have to our American agricultural system and to the food supply is in the pollination of crops, and there is probably over 80 crops in the nation that require honeybees for pollination. All of the berry crops - the blueberries and cranberries, raspberries, blackberries - require bees - cherries, apples, plums, avocados. We need between 80 and 90 percent of the nation's available commercial bees to pollinate almonds in California. There's just dozens and dozens of crops that would not be here at all without the pollinating activities of bees. CORNISH: So beekeepers don't just collect honey. They also, I guess, rent the bees to farmers? BRANDI: Yes, we do. Getting paid up to set bees on agricultural crops for pollination is a major portion of most beekeepers' income. CORNISH: So given what we've talked about here and the fact that colony collapse disorder has been an issue for some time, can you talk about how you and your customers have been coping? I mean, what are the workarounds or alternatives that people have had to adopt in these recent times? BRANDI: Well, in the case of almonds, it takes pretty close to 1. 7 million colonies that are needed just to pollinate the almonds in California, and we certainly need to import the majority of the bees needed for pollination from other states. And actually, with my own business, my son and I lease bees from beekeepers in the Midwest and even from New England just because of the lack of available bees from other places. CORNISH: Given what you've described these last few years, what do you have to do differently to survive and to improve your hives? BRANDI: Well, it certainly takes a lot more intensive hive management to keep the hives alive and healthy. And often times, we need to replace queens and we purchase queens from queen breeders. And actually, right now, queen bees are costing $21 to $23 apiece. So queen bees have never been more expensive, but they've never been more in-demand. CORNISH: Some of the factors that have been reported as contributing to the die-offs include use of certain pesticides, also a kind of parasite. Do any of these factors also affect those queen bees and the breeders there? BRANDI: I would say that any of the factors that affect the colony's ability to thrive and survive also affect the queen's. There's no doubt that the varroa mites, the exposure to certain pesticides, the nutritional issues that we're dealing with all impact the queen. CORNISH: How has this fundamentally changed the business? Have you had friends in the business who were no longer in it because of this crisis? You know, what do they say? BRANDI: Well, yes, I do know quite a few people that threw in the towel - that had losses that were too big to recover from. And it's sad, but that's the reality. So those of us that are still in the business are the survivors, if you will. CORNISH: That's Gene Brandi. He's a beekeeper in Central California. Thank you so much for speaking with us.

They don't save endangered species. They don't generate wealth. But they get to look at stars. And occasionally, they uncover the secrets of the universe. For some, that makes astronomy pretty irresistible. NPR science correspondent Joe Palca has been exploring what makes scientists tic as part of his project Joe's Big Idea. Today, Joe takes us inside the world of a leading astronomer who's hooked on the stars, but has his feet on the ground. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: The night before I met with Caltech astronomy professor Shrinivas Kulkarni, a friend of mine asked me what is a universe anyway, and is there anything beyond the universe? I didn't really have a great answer, so the next morning when I went over to Kulkarni's house for breakfast. . . SHRINIVAS KULKARNI: Let's go eat. PALCA: I asked him. Last night, at dinner, we were trying discuss what a universe was. KULKARNI: Well, these are very profound philosophical matters, Joe. And usually, I consider myself - however oxymoron-ish it may sound - as a practical astronomer, whereas people who think about those things are academic astronomers. (Laughter). PALCA: Practical astronomers do things like measure distances and analyze spectra. KULKARNI: But you don't try to figure out what is beyond the universe 'cause that's getting pretty deep. PALCA: Kulkarni says yeah, I know we astronomers are supposed to say, oh, I wandered out one day, and I looked up at the stars, and I couldn't stop thinking about it. But really. . . KULKARNI: Many scientists, I think, secretly are what I call us, boys with toys. PALCA: Boys with toys. KULKARNI: And I think there's nothing wrong with that, except. . . PALCA: Boys with toys. KULKARNI: . . . You're not supposed to say that. PALCA: At the same time, playing with those toys has allowed astronomers to make measurements that reveal the age of the universe, the fact that it's expanding and that there are lots of other solar systems out there besides ours. Many of those fundamental discoveries were made using telescopes at the Palomar Observatory in California. Kulkarni is now director of the observatory. He proposed a field trip so I could get a sense of the wonder astronomers feel when working there. Good plan. KULKARNI: (Laughter). PALCA: The drive from Pasadena to Palomar in the mountains north of San Diego is about two and a half hours. KULKARNI: It looks like good for observing. It's very clear. PALCA: Kulkarni was born in India in 1956. He's been an astronomer his entire professional life. But look at the whole person, and you'll see Shri Kulkarni is a man of contrasts. He loves Brazilian music. He raises bunny rabbits. And he says one of his deepest passions is the exact opposite of astronomy. It's the history of great economic collapses. KULKARNI: Something like astronomy is terribly important because it is about the universe, OK. I mean, we are learning something totally fundamental - how the way we live comes about. But it's not something immediate. It really doesn't matter if the Big Bang happened 13. 7 billing years ago or 13. 75 billion years ago. On the other hand, economics - it's actually unimportant in the long run. Terribly important in the short run, but it surely matters today. PALCA: We spent a lot of the car ride talking about Enron and the dot-com bubble. Wow, we're going up this really windy road up the side of a mountain. A little further ahead, a large dome appears, stark white against the late afternoon blue sky. KULKARNI: And now, you can see the 200-inch, or sometimes called the Big Eye. PALCA: For nearly 50 years, the 200-inch telescope at Palomar was the largest telescope in the world. It's a masterpiece of engineering. And even though it's aging, Kulkarni says it can still be used for good science. Besides, he loves it up here. When the dome slides open, the view of the twilight sky is breathtaking. To stand here with Shri Kulkarni is to bring together the past and the future. For as much as Kulkarni delights in this place, as inspiring as it is to be here, he says actually visiting a telescope is soon to be a thing of the past. KULKARNI: The best way to do astronomy is to get the astronomers out of the dome. We just get better data. And the human in the loop becomes monotonous, really, I mean, night after night. If a machine can do it, honestly, I think everyone is happy. PALCA: The other reason Kulkarni says machines are good for studying the sky is that they have no preconceived notions about what they'll find. He says astronomers just don't have the imagination to know what to look for. KULKARNI: The sky is so much richer and so much more imaginative than the imagination that you should always approach it with a certain sense of openness. PALCA: Kulkarni says you look at the information the machines collect and try to figure out what it's telling you. That's the way you make discoveries. Kulkarni is now 58 years old, and I asked him if he thought he'd ever get tired of playing with his toys. He said not really. But he knows someday, he'll have to try something different. KULKARNI: My wife's been hounding me about what I'll do after I retire. She said you're always running around and doing things. And I want to be a bartender. PALCA: A bartender? KULKARNI: It's a fascinating job. PALCA: Well, a man can dream. (LAUGHTER)PALCA: Joe Palca, NPR News. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  Astronomers don't cure diseases. They don't save endangered species.

Her memoir, titled \"Head Case,\" is a darkly funny exploration of what that discovery meant to her. Cole Cohen joins us now. Thanks so much for being with us. COLE COHEN: Thank you for having me, Rachel. MARTIN: Let's talk about what life was like before this revelation. I mentioned your propensity to get lost. We're not talking about being in a new place and getting confuses as a lot of us might do. You got lost in, like, big box stores that you had been to before. Can you describe that sensation, that feeling of not knowing where you are in a situation like that? COHEN: Yeah. I know that sensation every time I go grocery shopping. You know, you want to get a jar of peanut butter. You have a memory of where that jar of peanut butter is, and I just don't have that in my brain. I don't store that information. So it's like a discovery every time. MARTIN: I'd love for you to read an example of one of the symptoms. You have a hard time with numbers, even references to numbers. And you write about this in the book when you're taking driver's ed. Do you mind reading that bit? COHEN: Sure. That would be great. (Reading) When I learned how to drive, the instructor tells me to think of the steering wheel as the face of a clock. Put my left hand at nine, my right hand at three. I stare at her with horror and decide to make a random guess. She repeats her instructions again and again, until she forcibly takes my hands and places them on the wheel. No, like this. I keep taking my hands off the wheel as I turn the car, and then I place them back in an incorrect position. I don't notice until the teacher corrects me. I make continuing attempts at three-point turns around the empty high school parking lot until eventually our hour-long session is over. Next week, we do the same thing again. After about three sessions of this, she gives up. MARTIN: So with this diagnosis, I mean, was it empowering to some degree? Was it embarrassing? I mean, do you tell people? I mean, clearly, you wrote a memoir about it, but did you start calling your friends and being like, this is why - this is why I do this stuff? COHEN: Yeah, actually I did start calling friends. And it's a huge relief. To be able to know why has made all the difference in the world for me. And I could have just as easily gone my entire life without knowing. So I really don't think of it as negative information at all because it's allowed me to have a huge essential understanding of who I am that I could have completely missed out on if I had never gotten an MRI. MARTIN: You talk in the book about how music was a sanctuary of sorts for you, that it helped you get through a lot of downtimes. How did that help you? COHEN: I think there are a couple different ways it helped me. One is that I find repetition very soothing. And so I found, like, I was not just listening to songs that repeated, but I was listening to punk music, which repeats a lot. And I found that I was really craving these repeating musical structures. I also think that it helped as an emotional outlet. And I'm still a big music person. And it's interesting because I think that a lot of people who are neuro-diverse, with different brains, you know, react to music more strongly. There's that whole book, \"Musicophilia\" with Oliver Sacks. Like I really relate to those stories. MARTIN: Is there a particular piece, like, that's a go-to piece for you? COHEN: Yeah. There's a song by a band called The Fall. The Fall actually has a song called \"Repetition Repetition. \"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"REPETITION\")THE FALL: (Singing) We dig repetition. COHEN: I really love The Fall in part because they have so much repetition and yet no song is ever the same. MARTIN: Cole Cohen. Her new memoir is called \"Head Case: My Brain And Other Wonders. \" Thanks so much for talking with us, Cole. COHEN: Thank you, Rachel. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"REPETITION\")THE FALL: (Singing) We dig repetition. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  For most of her life, Cole Cohen had a hard time with all kinds of things. She'd get lost all of the time. She couldn't do math to save her life. The whole concept of time was hard for her to grasp. Her parents took her to doctor after doctor, and there were all kinds of tests and experiments with medication, but no real diagnosis until she was 26 years old.

Some scientists are changing their views about the evolution of these creatures that make many people cringe. They used to think snakes evolved in water, streamlined for swimming. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports on the findings of a new study. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: When scientists want to know what life was like millions of years ago, they look at fossils. But that hasn't helped them much with snakes. Allison Hsiang is a researcher at Yale University. ALLISON HSIANG: For a long time, there weren't very good snake fossils and things that sort of told us what snakes looked like early-on or transitional fossils between snakes and their closest ancestors. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That's because snakes are mostly small with fragile skeletons that aren't easily preserved, although there are some notable exceptions. HSIANG: There are some fossil snakes that get enormous. There's a fossil snake called Titanoboa that lived about 60 million years ago and it could get upwards of 40 feet in length. GREENFIELDBOYCE: In the last decade, scientists have discovered a bunch of new snake fossils. Hsiang and some colleagues decided to do a rigorous comprehensive analysis to see what the most recent common ancestor of all snakes might have looked like. The team studied fossils plus the genes and anatomy of living snakes. HSIANG: We had a total of 73 species, and I believe 15 of those were fossil species. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Their conclusions appear this week in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology. Hsiang says the evidence suggests that all snakes are the descendants of a kind of ancestral proto-snake that lived about 120 million years ago on land, not water. And this snake likely had tiny hind legs, left over from an even earlier ancestor. HSIANG: They probably weren't using them in locomotion in any way, but they did probably still have vestigial hind limbs stuck in the back of their bodies. GREENFIELDBOYCE: These ancient snakes probably slithered at night across the forest floor. They also had needle-like hooked teeth that they used to grab small rodent-like critters, which they swallowed whole. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

They found stone tools that were made before the first humans arrived on the scene. NPR's Christopher Joyce has more. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: The first humans had a handy talent. They whacked rocks together in just the right way to fashion sharp tools. In fact, scientists named the earliest humans Homo habilis, meaning handyman. Until now, the evidence suggested this talent emerged about two-and-a-half-million years ago, but now anthropologists have found stone tools way older than that. The tools are now in a museum in Nairobi where team leader Sonia Harmand of Stony Brook University explained that at first they didn't quite know what they had. SONIA HARMAND: We were very, very excited. JOYCE: But unaware that these tools were 3. 3 million years old, which is hundreds of thousands of years before humans evolved from their ape-like ancestors. Another member of the Stony Brook team, Jason Lewis, says once they did confirm that this assemblage of stones was indeed that old, they knew they had to prove they were actually tools crafted by hand and not just banged-up rocks. JASON LEWIS: We very quickly had to put our nose to the grind stone to put everything together to convince the rest of the world. JOYCE: As they report in the journal Nature, what convinced the team was the fact that there was a whole stone-tool-making kit right there in one place. It was just like the ones the first humans used - big core stones and flat anvil stones and sharp flakes. To make a tool, you hold the core stone on the anvil stone and strike it with another rock. What breaks off are sharp flakes. And it was clear from marks on these stones that that's what was done. And the team found lots of those sharp flakes. These could've been used to cut meat off of bone or cut up vegetable matter. In all, they found over 140 tool-making artifacts in one site. So who made these tools? Certainly chimpanzees can use stones as tools to break up nuts, for example, but they don't manufacture them. The Stony Brook team suspects it was an ape-like creature called Australopithecus. The famed creature Lucy was one such. About four feet tall, they lived both in trees and on land. But even if humans can no longer lay claim to inventing stone tools, it's worth looking at whether tool-making would have been a regular part of the Australopithecus skill set. ERIN MARIE WILLIAMS-HATALA: The question, I think, is not could they have, but would they have done so repeatedly? JOYCE: Erin Marie Williams-Hatala is a paleoanthropologist at Chatham University in Pittsburgh. She says the hands and wrists of an Australopithecus were adapted to grasping tree branches - long fingers and a slender thumb - not great for making tools. Williams-Hatala says sure, maybe they could do it, but it would've been a chore. WILLIAMS-HATALA: And maybe that's because it took them so long to do it that it just didn't make sense for their subsistence strategy - for the way that they lived their lives. JOYCE: So being able to make tools doesn't mean they became a regular part of the Australopithecus lifestyle. That probably didn't happen until the first human hands evolved with a big, strong thumb and more motor control. WILLIAMS-HATALA: When our hands and wrists changed to a sufficient degree, it began to make sense for our ancestors to engage in these behaviors in a new way and probably more frequently. . .

I'm Guy Raz. Our show today is about one of the things that humans have been searching for since the beginning of recorded history - the fountain of youth. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HARVEY FINEBERG: Suppose I said that with just a few changes in your genes, you could get a better memory - more precise, more accurate and quicker. Or maybe you'd like to be more fit, stronger, with more stamina. How about living longer with good health? RAZ: This is Harvey Fineberg speaking on the TED stage. He's a physician and a medical ethicist and the former dean of Harvard's Medical School. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FINEBERG: Which would you like if you could have just one? How many would opt for memory? How about fitness? What about longevity? Oh, the majority - that makes me feel very good as a doctor. If you could have any one of these, it would be a very different world. RAZ: All the hands went up when you asked that question. FINEBERG: Yeah. RAZ: Everybody wants to live longer. FINEBERG: Most people do want to live longer. RAZ: Yeah. FINEBERG: But we want to live longer healthier. You know, we have a chronological age, and we have a psychological age. And we have a physical age, which is how many years compared to the average person are you in your state of health at a given age. We can't do anything about the chronological age. That's the passage of time. RAZ: Yeah. FINEBERG: We can do something about the psychological age and the physical age. How we live, what we eat, whether we exercise regularly - those are the choices that are within our power today. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: That's today, and many of us do make those choices. But Harvey Fineberg has researched an entirely new world of choices we might someday have, choices that might change how long we live and even how future humans evolve. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FINEBERG: Evolution does not necessarily favor the longest-lived or the strongest or the fastest and not even the smartest. Evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment. So as we think about the place again of humans in evolution, I would say that there are a number of possibilities. The first is that we will not evolve. The second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind - natural, imposed by the forces of nature. But there's a third possibility, an enticing, intriguing and frightening possibility. I call it neo-evolution, the new evolution that is not simply natural but guided and chosen by us. What if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke? Wouldn't you want to make those changes in your genes? If we look ahead, these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Harvey Fineberg's idea is that the kinds of changes Cynthia Kenyon made in those tiny little C. elegans will one day be common in humans, that eventually, we'll be able to edit human genes - splice parts in, take things out - but not just in a gene that might help us live longer, but in all kinds of specific genes that make some of us more susceptible to certain diseases. FINEBERG: Just a year ago, mice that were specially bred to have a gene defect that was analogous to muscular dystrophy were treated in embryo form, and the mice that grew up were much less likely to have the expression of muscular dystrophy. That suggests that this technology may become a way to treat human disease or to prevent human genetic disease. RAZ: I mean, so could that also prevent the diseases of aging, like - where things like cancer or Alzheimer's might one day seem like diseases of the 19th century like scarlet fever or smallpox. FINEBERG: We think of many diseases as natural phenomenon. RAZ: Right. FINEBERG: Infection is natural. But it's avoidable, whether it's a vaccine today or a gene edit in a hundred years from today. RAZ: Wow. FINEBERG: And imagine a world where you're walking on the street, and you just can't tell if someone is 80 or 180 years of age. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: I mean, that's - that's crazy. FINEBERG: I don't think it's crazy. It's unlikely in the near-term. RAZ: Right. FINEBERG: But it's not inconceivable. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FINEBERG: Imagine, then, just two other little changes. You can change the cells in your body, but what if you could change the cells in your offspring? Eliminate the diabetes. Eliminate the hemophilia. Reduce the risk of cancer. Who doesn't want healthier children? And then that same analytic technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease will also enable us to adopt super attributes. That better memory - why not have the quick wit? Why not have the quick-twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer? Why not live longer? And when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes we want, we will have converted old-style evolution into neo-evolution. We'll take a process that normally might require 100,000 years, and we can compress it down to 1,000 years and maybe even in the next 100 years. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: I mean, of course, this raises a ton of ethical questions, right? FINEBERG: Absolutely. RAZ: I mean, like, you're talking about a future where we create people who have certain genetic advantages. FINEBERG: We can try to anticipate the ethical questions with technologies, but we're better, usually, at trying to deal with them when they are tangible and real. Any of these tools is going to be powerful enough that it would also be subject to misuse and inappropriate use, so it's very important, in my mind, that it be used under very strict control and legal and ethical conditions. But we won't be able to undo new knowledge. When we have that knowledge and we have problems that we're trying to fix, we will have tremendous desire to fix those problems. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FINEBERG: These are choices that your grandchildren or their grandchildren are going to have before them. Will we use these choices to make a society that is better, or will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us? Will we make a society that is more boring and more uniform or more robust and more versatile? These are the kinds of questions that we will have to face. And most profoundly of all, will we ever be able to develop the wisdom and to inherit the wisdom that we'll need to make these choices wisely. For better or worse and sooner than you may think, these choices will be up to us. Thank you. (APPLAUSE, SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Harvey Fineberg is a physician and a medical ethicist.

RAZ: Wow. FINEBERG: And imagine a world where you're walking on the street, and you just can't tell if someone is 80 or 180 years of age. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: I mean, that's - that's crazy. FINEBERG: I don't think it's crazy. It's unlikely in the near-term. RAZ: Right. FINEBERG: But it's not inconceivable. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) FINEBERG: Imagine, then, just two other little changes. You can change the cells in your body, but what if you could change the cells in your offspring? Eliminate the diabetes. Eliminate the hemophilia. Reduce the risk of cancer. Who doesn't want healthier children? And then that same analytic technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease will also enable us to adopt super attributes. That better memory - why not have the quick wit? Why not have the quick-twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer? Why not live longer? And when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes we want, we will have converted old-style evolution into neo-evolution. We'll take a process that normally might require 100,000 years, and we can compress it down to 1,000 years and maybe even in the next 100 years. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: I mean, of course, this raises a ton of ethical questions, right? FINEBERG: Absolutely. RAZ: I mean, like, you're talking about a future where we create people who have certain genetic advantages. FINEBERG: We can try to anticipate the ethical questions with technologies, but we're better, usually, at trying to deal with them when they are tangible and real. Any of these tools is going to be powerful enough that it would also be subject to misuse and inappropriate use, so it's very important, in my mind, that it be used under very strict control and legal and ethical conditions. But we won't be able to undo new knowledge. When we have that knowledge and we have problems that we're trying to fix, we will have tremendous desire to fix those problems. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) FINEBERG: These are choices that your grandchildren or their grandchildren are going to have before them. Will we use these choices to make a society that is better, or will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us? Will we make a society that is more boring and more uniform or more robust and more versatile? These are the kinds of questions that we will have to face. And most profoundly of all, will we ever be able to develop the wisdom and to inherit the wisdom that we'll need to make these choices wisely. For better or worse and sooner than you may think, these choices will be up to us. Thank you. (APPLAUSE, SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: Harvey Fineberg is a physician and a medical ethicist.

CYNTHIA KENYON: It was absolutely thrilling. I mean, unbelievable. I mean, it still makes my hair stand up just thinking about it. RAZ: Cynthia's a molecular geneticist. She studies the biology of aging. KENYON: It's something that you did not think would ever be possible. You would just get this feeling like you're looking into something that who knew was there? And I still feel that way. It's an amazing feeling. RAZ: She's talking about a breakthrough in her lab, something she found in an unlikely specimen, a breakthrough that could change how long we humans live. Here's how Cynthia Kenyon explained it in her TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KENYON: Have you ever wanted to stay young a little longer and put off aging? This is a dream of the ages, but scientists have for a long time thought this was just never going to be possible. They thought, you know, you just wear out - there's nothing you can do about it, kind of like an old shoe. But if you look at nature, you see that different kinds of animals can have really different life spans. Now, these animals are different from one another because they have different genes. So that suggests that somewhere in these genes, somewhere in the DNA, are genes for aging, genes that allow them to have different life spans. So if there are genes like that then you can imagine that if you could change one of the genes in an experiment, an aging gene, maybe you could slow down aging and extend life span. And if you could do that then you could find the genes for aging, and if they exist, and you can find them then maybe one could eventually do something about it. RAZ: So Cynthia decided to try. And of all the species to answer these questions, she started with worms - a very strange sounding worm. KENYON: Caenorhabditis elegans, or C. elegans. And they're beautiful, they're shaped like little horses' tails, but they're tiny. They're about the size of a comma. RAZ: A comma. KENYON: A comma, in a sentence, yeah. Very, very small. But they're really neat. They're cheap. You can grow lots of them. They have a very short life span. They only live a few weeks, but they get old, so that makes them very, very practical for scientific studies of aging. RAZ: And what Cynthia and other researchers did with these worms is nothing short of amazing because by changing a single gene that's called the DAF-2, the C. elegans ended up living twice as long, and that was just the beginning. KENYON: First, we doubled their life span. Then we extended it by six-fold, and then another lab was able to extend the life span for 10 times as long. The normal average life span of a worm is 18 days and these worms were 144 days old. RAZ: Wow. KENYON: OK so they were more - just almost 10 times as long as the average life span of a normal worm. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KENYON: In just two weeks, the normal worms are old. You can see the little head moving down at the bottom there. But everything else is just lying there. The animal's clearly in the nursing home. And if you look at the tissues of the animal, they're starting to deteriorate. You know, even if you've never see one of these little C. elegans - which, probably most of you haven't seen one - you can tell they're old. Isn't that interesting? So there's something about aging that's kind of universal. And now here is the DAF-2 mutants. One gene is changed out of 20,000. It's the same age, but it's not in the nursing home. It's going skiing. (LAUGHTER)KENYON: So it's aging, actually - this is what's really cool - it's aging more slowly. It takes this worm two days to age as much as the normal worm ages in one day. And when I tell people about this, they tend to think of maybe a 90 or 80 or 90-year-old person who looks really good for being 90 or 80, but it's really more like this - suppose you're - let's say you're a 30-year-old guy or 30 - in your 30s. And you're a bachelor and you're dating people, and you meet someone that you really like. You get to know her and you're in a restaurant and you say, well, how old are you? She says, I'm 60. That's what it's like. You would never know. You never know till she told you. You would think to extend the life span of an animal for such a long time, you know, you'd have to kind of go around in a way and fix things or shore them up. You'd have to do something for the skin and something for the intestine, something for the nervous system. You'd have to - it would be really hard because old tissues all look old, but they all have their own separate problems. But what's the big surprise is that there are these systemic or system-wide control circuits that you can tap into. And what happens is that there are circulating factors, factors in the blood that can move through the animal and tell all the tissues to slow down their aging. Not to slow down their movement, but to slow down their aging. The great secret of all this is that, you know, all animals are much more similar to one another than they are different. Worms have muscles, they have nerve cells, they have serotonin, they have acetylcholine, they have all the neurotransmitters we have, the very same ones. So what that means is, you can easily interrogate the genome by making mutations to find genes that control things, things that you didn't even know were controlled, like aging. And there are actually hints that gene changes in humans that mimic the effects of these changes in animals may contribute to exceptional longevity to becoming a centenarian, in a human. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KENYON: So after we found - made our discoveries with little C. elegans, people who worked on other kinds of animals started asking, if we make the same DAF-2 mutation in other animals, will they live longer? And that is the case in flies. If you change those hormone pathway in flies, they live longer. And also in mice, and mice are mammals like us. So it's an ancient pathway because it must've arisen a long time ago in evolution so that it still works in all these animals and they also - the common precursor - also gave rise to people. So maybe it's working in people the same way. So for example, there is one study that was done in a population of Ashkenazi Jews in New York City. And just like any population, most of the people, you know, will live to about 70 or 80, but some live to be 90 or 100. And what they found was that there were - people who live to 90 or 100 were more likely to have DAF-2 mutations. RAZ: It's so interesting because, you know, the whole idea of a fountain of youth is so steeped in human mythology, like, you know, these mythical fountains that people would go and drink from. But it actually seems like, I don't know, like, we might actually be getting closer to that. KENYON: I think so, and I think to great benefit, I think so particularly because of this link between natural aging, which is a way bigger risk factor for, for example, cancer, than smoking is. I mean, it's huge. Aging is such a risk factor. If we could, you know, slow it down, then we should be able to counteract all these diseases. And those - I mean, those worms did have a terrifically wonderful health span, as well as life span. So we see it, so we know it can happen in these animals. Whether it can happen in people, we just don't know. But what I do think is that we can harness our bodies' own abilities that are kind of kept under wraps to allow the aging process to be slowed down. And that's the hope, is that we can do it in a way that counteracts lots of diseases and keeps us healthy right until the end. RAZ: Cynthia Kenyon studies the biology of aging. You can see her entire talk at ted. npr. org. In a moment - could we evolve into a disease-free species? I'm Guy Raz, and this is the TED Radio Hour from NPR.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Fine. Holding up. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Holding up? SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Mid-morning at the Wellness and Arts Center at Iona Senior Services in Washington, D. C. , there's coffee and smiles in the dining room, bright paintings on the wall and lots of catching up between people who see each other all the time. Iona provides what's called adult day services. It's for people who can live on their own but could still use help and aren't ready to move into any kind of senior home. We sat down with Susan Morgan (ph) and Cynthia Allen (ph), who told us what they looked forward to that day. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: Oh, opera's this afternoon. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: Opera's this afternoon. I'm not going to do opera. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: I am. See, I like music. She likes art. It's different. That's OK because they have everything. SIMON: So you make friends here? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: Yeah. Yeah, it's hard not to. You have assigned seats at lunch, but they notice who you like to eat with and they put you with people you like. And if you don't like the people - I have had little chats with the management. SIMON: (Laughter). UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: And they're very supportive. SIMON: Cecilia Weeks (ph) sat with her friend sipping coffee. How do you fill your day here? What you do here? CECILIA WEEKS: Oh, enjoyable. All of us, we love each other and we get along very, very well with each other. That's why I like coming. SIMON: Ms. Weeks lives in Washington, D. C. now, but moved to town in her 20s. C. WEEKS: It was from Panama, the republic of Panama, 40 years ago. SIMON: And did you work? C. WEEKS: I worked for D. C. government. SIMON: What'd you do for the D. C. government? C. WEEKS: It was in charge of - how do they call it? SIMON: Cecilia Weeks's memory can be a little foggy these days. We reached her niece, Vivian (ph) Weeks, to fill in some details for the aunt she loves. VIVIAN WEEKS: She raised a son as a single mother in Washington, D. C. while she worked as an administrative assistant for Catholic University. SIMON: And later she did work for the D. C. government, but on the D. C. Commission on the Arts and Humanities. Vivian Weeks says of her aunt. . . V. WEEKS: Cecilia Weeks is a wonderful (laughter), feisty, 70-year-old aunt. SIMON: But she has diabetes and dementia. Vivian Weeks told us that she worried a couple of years ago when she couldn't reach her aunt on the phone and found out from her church that Cecilia was in the hospital. Vivian Weeks brought her aunt home to her family, but it was clear her aunt needed more than companionship. V. WEEKS: The first morning that Cecilia came to live with us, she went into hypoglycemic shock. It looks very much like somebody who's in a seizure - eyes in the back of their heads, shaking tremendously. So that was just the beginning. SIMON: Vivian Weeks had three children at home too, and caring for her aunt put a strain on her family. She started to look for support and found Iona, but. . . V. WEEKS: The news was not good at that time. What they said to us was this program is a very good one, but it costs approximately - I believe it was $110, $120 a day - so she couldn't afford it and that was that. But a year later, we got a call from Iona. Miraculously, they said look, we've got a grant from the D. C. Office on Aging, so your aunt will likely qualify for it and we'd like to meet her. SIMON: It turns out that only about a third of the people who come to the Iona Wellness and Art Center currently pay the full fee. The rest receive some kind of financial support from grants, Medicaid or the Veterans Administration. Vivian Weeks says her aunt is able to enjoy the independence of living alone with support from Iona's program. A day service center can give a family peace of mind. V. WEEKS: It is not babysitting, but I tell you, when she's there I don't worry about if she's OK. SIMON: Sharon O'Connor is the director of the Wellness and Art Center at Iona. She says that participants often begin the program with qualms and gripes about what age has meant they can no longer do. O'CONNOR: I used to be able to drive, and, I used to be able to go anywhere I wanted to go. And what we try to do is figure out what are the things that they can still do and what are the things that bring them joy in their lives? And so those are the things that we include in our program. SIMON: And in many ways, the senior citizens who come to Iona are still growing. O'CONNOR: The stories that I get from the families are pretty amazing because they say, I had no idea that my mother could still paint, or, I had no idea that my mother still had the enthusiasm to get up and dance. SIMON: Vivian Weeks says her aunt has new delight in life. V. WEEKS: Because she is getting physical therapy in addition to art therapy there several times a week, it changes her whole disposition. She never knew that she could really be an artist. SIMON: Most of all, Iona seems to keep the people who come to this adult day service center connected to life, to activities and friendship. Sharon O'Connor says. . . O'CONNOR: Isolation is actually very dangerous to a person's health. It really causes their health to decline. It causes depression. It causes increased hospitalization. Isolation is not a good thing. SIMON: There are about 4,800 centers that provide adult day services in the country which serve more than a quarter of a million people on any given day, but the number of senior citizens grows each day. Many are vigorous and independent but also require close attention to their health and help with the tasks of daily life, not to mention, people to have lunch with and laugh with. Adult day services provide all that and may become more common in American life as more of the population grows into old age. There are 63 people registered in the Iona Wellness and Arts Center now. They're expanding and hope they can accommodate as many as 85 people like Cecilia Weeks, who may have slowed a bit, but who still like to dance. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: Go Cecilia. Go Cecilia. I like those hips. (Laughter). UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: How are you this morning? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Fine. Holding up. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Holding up?

O'CONNOR: The stories that I get from the families are pretty amazing because they say, I had no idea that my mother could still paint, or, I had no idea that my mother still had the enthusiasm to get up and dance. SIMON: Vivian Weeks says her aunt has new delight in life. V. WEEKS: Because she is getting physical therapy in addition to art therapy there several times a week, it changes her whole disposition. She never knew that she could really be an artist. SIMON: Most of all, Iona seems to keep the people who come to this adult day service center connected to life, to activities and friendship. Sharon O'Connor says. . . O'CONNOR: Isolation is actually very dangerous to a person's health. It really causes their health to decline. It causes depression. It causes increased hospitalization. Isolation is not a good thing. SIMON: There are about 4,800 centers that provide adult day services in the country which serve more than a quarter of a million people on any given day, but the number of senior citizens grows each day. Many are vigorous and independent but also require close attention to their health and help with the tasks of daily life, not to mention, people to have lunch with and laugh with. Adult day services provide all that and may become more common in American life as more of the population grows into old age. There are 63 people registered in the Iona Wellness and Arts Center now. They're expanding and hope they can accommodate as many as 85 people like Cecilia Weeks, who may have slowed a bit, but who still like to dance. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: Go Cecilia. Go Cecilia. I like those hips. (Laughter).", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2015 NPR.  All rights reserved.

For most of us, between power plants, industry and fires, dirty air is all around us. One family in Pittsburgh is taking advantage of a device available through the local library system to reduce bad air quality inside their homes. WESA's Larkin Page-Jacobs has their story. UNIDENTIFIED LIBRARY WORKER: That's for three weeks. JOHN HORCHNER: Three weeks - great. UNIDENTIFIED LIBRARY WORKER: Yes. Bye-bye. LARKIN PAGE-JACOBS, BYLINE: John Horchner has been eagerly waiting to check out the Speck monitor from the Carnegie Library for a few weeks. The device detects tiny particles the fraction of a width of a hair and counts them - the lower the number, the better. Horchner and his family live in a leafy neighborhood. But the greenery can belie high levels of particulate matter drifting through the air. And while he and his family are healthy, he tries to exert some control at home. They typically have three air purifiers pumping away. HORCHNER: I think anything above good is probably bad. There is no such thing as moderate particles. Tell that to the person that was out jogging and died of a heart attack. Oh, it was moderate today. PAGE-JACOBS: His family is amused by his vigilance. But now his daughter Christine and wife Nadine are gathered around the kitchen table to see what the Speck monitor will reveal. Horchner guesses an optimistic 10 or lower. Nadine predicts the room will give a reading of 30. HORCHNER: OK. Here is. It's at zero. Look. Calm down. OK - back. It went up to eight then back to seven. So twelve - oh, here we are. OK, kids. In a second, I'm going to turn the air purifier on. PAGE-JACOBS: It climbs to 22 and stays there. Next test site - the upstairs study. It scores a 20 - pretty good readings. Finally, they head to their daughter's room, where Horchner has run a little experiment. He sealed off the door with duct tape earlier in the day in an attempt to create a controlled environment. CHRISTINE: I can't open. HORCHNER: OK. OK, let's keep the stale air in. PAGE-JACOBS: The verdict - 30. Not great but not bad. ILLAH NOURBAKHSH: So it's the outside air. That's infiltration. PAGE-JACOBS: Illah Nourbakhsh attributes the particulate pollution to Pittsburgh's dirty air seeping in around the windows and up through the floorboards. He's a professor at Carnegie Mellon University's CREATE Lab which develops technology for social innovation. Beyond infiltration from the outdoors, the air in a room is affected by a variety of activities. Nourbakhsh says the monitor can help people identify polluters in their house and change their habits, whether it's making sure air is vented while cooking, putting a filter over a window AC unit or vacuuming long before the kids get home so the particles have time to settle. And it's not just for those with existing health conditions. Perfectly healthy people can be harmed in the long term by dirty air. NOURBAKHSH: We're talking the kind of heart conditions like arrhythmia, like cardiovascular disease. Those are things that are going to not necessarily kill you, but they're going to make the quality of your life go down.

When the deadly tremors move down a fault line to Los Angeles, a Caltech seismologist played by Paul Giamatti goes on national television to warn the country about what will happen next. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"SAN ANDREAS\")PAUL GIAMATTI: (As Lawrence) What we're experiencing is what we call a swarm event. Basically, California's entire tectonic plate has shifted. People need to know that the shaking is not over. BATES: Next, a record-breaking trembler hits San Francisco. I talked with Lucy Jones, one of the world's leading seismologists, about whether a swarm like this could really happen. LUCILE JONES: Actually, we don't use the term swarm. Swarm is for when they're all in the same location. But this idea of a triggered earthquake, that an earthquake in Nevada could set off an earthquake in Los Angeles, we've seen that. In 1992, a 7. 3 in Southern California set off a 5. 7 in Nevada. The 1906 earthquake in San Francisco set off a magnitude six near the Mexican border, so that distant trigger is actually a core part of the earthquake process. BATES: You know, when the movie opens, we have a Caltech seismologist who's working with a team of people on a project that monitors quakes along a series of fault lines in California. And, in essence, they're trying to predict quakes. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"SAN ANDREAS\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) The magnetic pulse rate has increased before each one of them. GIAMATTI: (As Lawrence) That was a 2. 2. Our model's predictive. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Right, man, finally. GIAMATTI: (As Lawrence) Yep, we sure did. BATES: So, are you guys actually working on something like this? Are you - is this the holy grail for seismologists? JONES: If you had played this to me when I started my career 30 years ago, I would've went, yeah, that's what we're trying for. But everything we looked at, none of it worked. So now we can recognize that an earthquake's begun so quickly that we get the information to you before the shaking gets to you. That doesn't give you a lot of warning. Unfortunately, what they're doing in the movie has really been shown to not work. BATES: That's really too bad (laughter). With the first big quake in the movie, a TV journalist played by Archie Panjabi darts into a doorway, darts underneath a doorway - the lintel. And she's quickly corrected by the Caltech guy. Here's what he tells her. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"SAN ANDREAS\")GIAMATTI: (As Lawrence) No, no, no, no, no, no - under the table. Drop, cover and hold on. BATES: That in-the-doorway mythology has been floating around for a really long time. Why is the doorway a bad idea, and did he give her the right advice? JONES: He gave her the right advice. The doorways began actually from a Red Cross volunteer in the 1952 earthquake that saw a collapsed adobe house with the lintel still standing and said, wow, that - the door must be a good place to be, and they started teaching that. And it's true if you're in a 200-year-old adobe house. In any modern construction, the doorway is no stronger than anywhere else, and it usually has a door. So what you're trying to do in an earthquake is you're trying to protect yourself from flying objects. That's why going under a table is a good idea. We used to just say duck and cover. Now we say drop, cover, hold on, because in strong shaking, the table may be trying to go somewhere else. BATES: The casualties and the fatalities in this movie are just staggering. When - and I'm saying when and not if because I've listened to you guys - the big one hits California, is this movie exaggerating the loss of life? How likely are we to die in an earthquake? JONES: You're far more likely to die on the freeway than in an earthquake if you live in California. We think of earthquakes as a threat to our lives. The reality is they're a very serious threat to our pocketbooks. What they showed in Los Angeles was most buildings standing, but badly damaged, and that may indeed be the reality. This is actually why I've been working with the mayor's office in the city of Los Angeles, to look at how we can strengthen our older buildings, because we can't take that financial hit of having our buildings unusable. BATES: A lot of us may well be in our cars when the big one happens, and I'm wondering, what's in your trunk to get you through an earthquake? JONES: (Laughter) That's a very important thing, because as most Californians, you don't know where you're going to be when the earthquake hits, but you know you're going to have your car with you. So, as a woman, number one is running shoes because sometimes the shoes I'm in are not one I want to have to walk home in. I've tried to keep some water supplies, basic first aid. I've got a little Mylar blanket stuck in there, a crank flashlight because, you know, batteries go bad, so having one of these ones were you can use a little crank to get the electricity going is a very positive thing. BATES: One of the heroines in the film, a young Blake, has a plan for reuniting with her family. Should we be doing the same thing in the event of an earthquake or any other kind of big catastrophe? JONES: Oh, absolutely. I really thought that was one of the best messages out of the movie. The family not only had a family plan, they moved to plan B. A core message of the movie is the fear you feel when you don't know if your family's OK. And it's the emotions that, as usual, Hollywood got better than the facts. BATES: I think a lot people in the audience - I saw it here in Los Angeles - were looking kind of going, ooh, man. And I'm wondering if a lot of people in other places like New York or Dallas or D. C. might be looking at it as purely entertainment. Should they be thinking about earthquake preparedness too? JONES: Earthquakes happen around the country, and everywhere has some disaster. And that basic preparation of some supplies and, most of all, a communication plan, will make all of us better. It's not as bad as the movie shows, but it's bad enough that you better have some plans. BATES: So, we've corrected some of the science here, but I'm wondering what you thought of this just as a viewer, or was it more of a Busman's Holiday for you? JONES: I actually first saw it with a group of seismologists, and we were all sort of ready to go, oh, really? I mean, because we could tell from the trailers some of it wasn't an accurate. We all enjoyed it. You know, don't consider this a seismology course. Consider this a summer blockbuster movie. BATES: Dr. Lucy Jones is a fourth-generation Californian, which means she's been through some shaking, and one of the world's leading seismologists. She's headquartered at the U. S. Geological Survey at Caltech in Pasadena and spoke to us from member station KPCC. Thanks, Dr. Jones. JONES: Thanks for having me.

If that news doesn't grab you, there's this. What they are doing could affect the future of the planet. They're working on a draft of a major United Nations agreement to control greenhouse gas emissions that are changing the Earth's climate. NPR correspondent Nell Greenfieldboyce has spent almost her entire life writing and being edited. She wondered what it's like when there are editors from nearly 200 countries. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: When I found out that climate change negotiations all boiled down to writing and editing a document, I was astonished. I mean, anyone who's ever written something and then been edited knows that this can be a nightmare, even in the best of circumstances. I asked my editor, Alison Richards, what it was like to edit me. She tried to be diplomatic. ALISON RICHARDS: Editing is an intense process. When you're editing, you have to trust each other. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But what if you don't trust each other? RICHARDS: Then, it's a fight. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Luckily, we trust each other. And when we edit a story like the one you're hearing now, it's just the two of us going at it. But the U. N. is a whole different ballgame. The current U. N. meeting in Germany involves professional negotiators from basically every country in the world, rich and poor, big and small. And in their past negotiations on climate change, there hasn't been a lot of trust. Still, together, they've got to edit a document called a negotiating text. Anyone can get a copy. I am printing the English version, but the U. N. website has it in Chinese, Russian, Arabic, Spanish, French. It was produced earlier this year in Geneva. At that meeting, to build trust and goodwill, negotiators could throw in any proposed text they wanted. The result is 90 pages long, a jumbled patchwork of ideas for how countries should rein in their emissions and deal with climate change. New Zealand's climate change ambassador, Jo Tyndall, told me it's a mess of a text. JO TYNDALL: In fact, it's got so many options and variations, it's unreadable. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Is that the general consensus? TYNDALL: I suspect so. Because it's been a compilation of views, I doubt that anyone would say that we can readily write an agreement purely on the basis of this text. We have to make considerable changes to it. GREENFIELDBOYCE: During the next 11 days, negotiators will start making those changes. JENNIFER MORGAN: They are wrangling over language, even to the point of it being commas, sometimes. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Jennifer Morgan is global director of the Climate Change Program at a nonprofit called the World Resources Institute. She's been watching these kinds of climate meetings for two decades. She says this time, in Bonn, facilitators from Switzerland, Colombia, Norway, Zambia will lead groups that will focus on sections of the text that deal with topics like mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology. MORGAN: Sometimes, they literally will put the text that they're working on onto a screen so everybody can see what text that they are talking about, and they will even sometimes edit it right on the screen. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says small word changes can have huge consequences. For example, should the text say countries shall do something or countries may do something? MORGAN: That means a lot. Whether it's all countries should do this or just the developed countries should do this, means a lot. And they spend hours and hours going through, trying to come to an agreement. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And sometimes, acceptance of one change is contingent on getting another change. MORGAN: A country might only be willing to agree on the edit in this paragraph on finance if some paragraph in another part of the text gets tweaked in another way. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Then, there are the brackets. MORGAN: Brackets are famous in the climate negotiations. If you have brackets around a paragraph, it means it's not agreed. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Right now, on every page, there are brackets around paragraphs and also around sentences, phrases, individual words. Brackets are everywhere. The goal for this meeting in Bonn is not to come to agreement on everything and remove the brackets. Negotiators really just want to streamline the text and eliminate any repetition so that the key areas of disagreement become clear. Gus Silva-Chavez is a climate change policy expert at an environmental group called Forest Trends. He says, don't forget. All of this careful wordcraft is being done by people who speak dozens of different languages. GUS SILVA-CHAVEZ: The negotiations are done technically in six languages, but I would say 99 percent of them are in English. So a lot of times, with the African group, with the Latin Americans, there's a lot of questions about what some of these concepts and words mean. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He thinks this would be a successful meeting if they could whittle this text down from 90 pages to less than 50. SILVA-CHAVEZ: But even then, it's really just cleaning up the text. It's not an actual negotiation where options are eliminated. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That will happen in the coming months when the negotiation will really get intense. SILVA-CHAVEZ: The average person doesn't understand that this affects everything and this is probably the most complex negotiation that the world has ever had. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says the words in this document will influence how countries produce their energy, grow their food, how much they'll adapt to climate change, and how much they'll do to fight against it. SILVA-CHAVEZ: While sometimes these texts get really long and really complex, that is because this is a really complex issue, and there's no easy path out of this. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The last meeting to work on this agreement is scheduled for the end of this year in Paris. There, negotiators hope to hammer out a final text that virtually every nation can accept, a thing of beauty, maybe 10 to 20 pages, with no brackets. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

NPR correspondent Nell Greenfieldboyce has spent almost her entire life writing and being edited. She wondered what it's like when there are editors from nearly 200 countries. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: When I found out that climate change negotiations all boiled down to writing and editing a document, I was astonished. I mean, anyone who's ever written something and then been edited knows that this can be a nightmare, even in the best of circumstances. I asked my editor, Alison Richards, what it was like to edit me. She tried to be diplomatic. ALISON RICHARDS: Editing is an intense process. When you're editing, you have to trust each other. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But what if you don't trust each other? RICHARDS: Then, it's a fight. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Luckily, we trust each other. And when we edit a story like the one you're hearing now, it's just the two of us going at it. But the U. N. is a whole different ballgame. The current U. N. meeting in Germany involves professional negotiators from basically every country in the world, rich and poor, big and small. And in their past negotiations on climate change, there hasn't been a lot of trust. Still, together, they've got to edit a document called a negotiating text. Anyone can get a copy. I am printing the English version, but the U. N. website has it in Chinese, Russian, Arabic, Spanish, French. It was produced earlier this year in Geneva. At that meeting, to build trust and goodwill, negotiators could throw in any proposed text they wanted. The result is 90 pages long, a jumbled patchwork of ideas for how countries should rein in their emissions and deal with climate change. New Zealand's climate change ambassador, Jo Tyndall, told me it's a mess of a text. JO TYNDALL: In fact, it's got so many options and variations, it's unreadable. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Is that the general consensus? TYNDALL: I suspect so. Because it's been a compilation of views, I doubt that anyone would say that we can readily write an agreement purely on the basis of this text. We have to make considerable changes to it. GREENFIELDBOYCE: During the next 11 days, negotiators will start making those changes. JENNIFER MORGAN: They are wrangling over language, even to the point of it being commas, sometimes. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Jennifer Morgan is global director of the Climate Change Program at a nonprofit called the World Resources Institute. She's been watching these kinds of climate meetings for two decades. She says this time, in Bonn, facilitators from Switzerland, Colombia, Norway, Zambia will lead groups that will focus on sections of the text that deal with topics like mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology. MORGAN: Sometimes, they literally will put the text that they're working on onto a screen so everybody can see what text that they are talking about, and they will even sometimes edit it right on the screen. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says small word changes can have huge consequences. For example, should the text say countries shall do something or countries may do something? MORGAN: That means a lot. Whether it's all countries should do this or just the developed countries should do this, means a lot. And they spend hours and hours going through, trying to come to an agreement. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And sometimes, acceptance of one change is contingent on getting another change. MORGAN: A country might only be willing to agree on the edit in this paragraph on finance if some paragraph in another part of the text gets tweaked in another way. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Then, there are the brackets. MORGAN: Brackets are famous in the climate negotiations. If you have brackets around a paragraph, it means it's not agreed. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Right now, on every page, there are brackets around paragraphs and also around sentences, phrases, individual words. Brackets are everywhere. The goal for this meeting in Bonn is not to come to agreement on everything and remove the brackets. Negotiators really just want to streamline the text and eliminate any repetition so that the key areas of disagreement become clear. Gus Silva-Chavez is a climate change policy expert at an environmental group called Forest Trends. He says, don't forget. All of this careful wordcraft is being done by people who speak dozens of different languages. GUS SILVA-CHAVEZ: The negotiations are done technically in six languages, but I would say 99 percent of them are in English. So a lot of times, with the African group, with the Latin Americans, there's a lot of questions about what some of these concepts and words mean. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He thinks this would be a successful meeting if they could whittle this text down from 90 pages to less than 50. SILVA-CHAVEZ: But even then, it's really just cleaning up the text. It's not an actual negotiation where options are eliminated. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That will happen in the coming months when the negotiation will really get intense. SILVA-CHAVEZ: The average person doesn't understand that this affects everything and this is probably the most complex negotiation that the world has ever had. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says the words in this document will influence how countries produce their energy, grow their food, how much they'll adapt to climate change, and how much they'll do to fight against it. SILVA-CHAVEZ: While sometimes these texts get really long and really complex, that is because this is a really complex issue, and there's no easy path out of this. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The last meeting to work on this agreement is scheduled for the end of this year in Paris. There, negotiators hope to hammer out a final text that virtually every nation can accept, a thing of beauty, maybe 10 to 20 pages, with no brackets.

That came today from a team of government scientists as NPR's Geoff Brumfiel reports. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: If the entire problem of global warming could be summed up in one single number, that number would be the global mean surface temperature. It's the temperature of the entire surface of the Earth at a moment in time. During the 20th century, that number shot up. But then, something happened. Kevin Trenberth is at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. KEVIN TRENBERTH: Since about 1998 through to 2013, the rate of increase was a lot less. BRUMFIEL: So much less that it appeared global warming may have stopped altogether. Scientists called it the global warming hiatus. Climate change skeptics used the hiatus in the political fight. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TUCKER CARLSON: We haven't seen a rise in global temperatures in almost 20 years. Why is that? We're not sure. And so until we figure out why - what's happening with the global climb, you probably shouldn't hike energy taxes for average Americans in response to a threat you don't understand. BRUMFIEL: That's commentator Tucker Carlson on Fox News last year. Trenberth says slower warming is in part caused by unusual changes to Pacific Ocean currents. But today in the journal Science, a team directly responsible for taking the Earth's temperature says there may also be a more fundamental problem. It turns out global surface temperature is really hard to measure. TOM KARL: The concept itself is quite simple. Actually trying to do it is quite complex. BRUMFIEL: Tom Karl is at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. The single number comes from tens of thousands of independent temperature measurements. On land, they're made by weather stations. On the sea, it's ships. KARL: All kinds of ships. They include military ships. They include commercial ships. BRUMFIEL: The ship's measurements have been used for decades, but starting in the 1980s, governments began dropping buoys into the ocean to do independent measurements. Karl and his colleagues decided to look where ships passed near buoys and compared the two temperatures, and they made a surprising discovery. KARL: The buoys actually read colder than the ships. BRUMFIEL: Even though the two thermometers were in the same place. It was happening all over the world, and as more buoys delivered more cooler temperature readings, they made global temperature look cooler. Karl and his colleagues corrected decades of data so that ships and buoys in the same place agree on the temperature. The result. . . KARL: We think the data no longer supports the notion of having a hiatus. BRUMFIEL: In other words, the Earth's temperature kept right on warming for the past 20 years. Kevin Trenberth, who wasn't involved in this analysis, says critics may be skeptical of these revisions, but they shouldn't be. TRENBERTH: You see this kind of thing also with the stock market or with various other economic indicators that, oh, they have revised the estimates of what the unemployment rate was in the last quarter or something like that, and that's exactly what's going on here. BRUMFIEL: And the warming may be speeding up even more. 2014 was the warmest year on record, and Trenberth says the past 12 months have been even warmer than that. Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News.

HONOR HARGER: Yep. RAZ: So what is this? HARGER: This is the sound of cosmic microwave background radiation left over from the Big Bang 13. 78 billion years ago. RAZ: Wow. We're hearing the Big Bang right now? HARGER: You're hearing what's left of the Big Bang. That's the closest that we can come to experiencing the beginning of the universe. RAZ: This is Honor Harger. She's a sound artist. And a few years ago, Honor started to listen to space because while most of us could tell you what space looks like, not a lot of people could tell you what it sounds like. Here's how Honor explained it from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HARGER: Now, this story doesn't start with vast telescopes or futuristic spacecraft, but a rather more humble technology - the telephone. It's 1876. It's in Boston. And this is Alexander Graham Bell, who was working with Thomas Watson on the invention of the telephone. A key part of their technical setup was a half-mile-long length of wire which was thrown across the rooftops of several houses in Boston. The line carried the telephone signals that would later make Bell a household name. But like any long length of charged wire, it also inadvertently became an antenna. Thomas Watson spent hours listening to the strange crackles and hisses and chirps and whistles that his accidental antenna detected. So what were these strange noises? As he correctly guessed, some of these sounds were caused by activity on the surface of the sun. So whilst inventing the technology that would usher in the telecommunications revolution, Watson had discovered that the star at the center of our solar system emitted powerful radio waves. He had accidently been the first person to tune into them. RAZ: You know, it's crazy because we think about space as a silent place. Like, we don't think of space as having anything to hear. HARGER: Well, in a sense, that's accurate because the medium of space itself is a vacuum. And, you know, obviously sound can't travel in a vacuum. But it's the fact that radio waves can travel through the vacuum of space and then be detected using the same types of radio receivers and antennas that our listeners are using to detect our voices. That's where the magic is really happening here. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)HARGER: Because, you know, scaling up those antennas and changing the frequency of those receivers makes it possible for us to detect not just radio waves made by us here on Earth but celestial radio waves made by the sun or Jupiter or a pulsar or any other astrophysical phenomena. RAZ: So - but what if you're just, like, out there in space, right? Like, what does that empty sound - like, that empty space - sound like? HARGER: Well, the sound of space itself sounds a bit like an undifferentiated hissing noise. RAZ: Just like a (hissing). HARGER: Pretty much. RAZ: Yeah. HARGER: Yeah. And it's not until you're actually, you know, listening to a particular object. So different objects sound like different things. Jupiter sounds like ocean waves breaking up on a beach if it's long waves of radiation. (SOUNDBITE OF OCEAN WAVES)HARGER: Pebbles being thrown onto a tin roof if it's short waves of radiation. (SOUNDBITE OF PEBBLES CLATTERING)HARGER: The sun sounds a little bit like the sea, kind of roaring. A pulsar, for instance, which a pulsating radio star, sounds like a drum beat. (SOUNDBITE OF DRUM BEAT)HARGER: The faster the pulsar is spinning, the faster the beat. (SOUNDBITE OF DRUM BEAT)HARGER: You become quite attuned to being able to detect what it is that you're listening to just by the sounds. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HARGER: It's through listening that we've come to uncover some of the universe's most important secrets - its scale, what it's made of and even how old it is. This is what the sun sounds like. (SOUNDBITE OF SUN RADIO WAVES)HARGER: This is the planet Jupiter. (SOUNDBITE OF PLANETARY RADIO WAVES)HARGER: This is a highly condensed clump of neutral matter spinning in the distant universe. (SOUNDBITE OF SPINNING NEUTRAL MATTER)RAZ: When you hear those sounds, what are they telling us about space? HARGER: So one of the practices of turning a non-audible phenomena into sound is trying to work out if there's something that we can hear in the data that we can't see. And sometimes ears can be incredibly effective detectors of patterns in a way that perhaps our eyes - because we use them so much more - are not as effective at. So I suppose that's the scientific answer. And then the human or artistic answer is that there's something quite emotionally fulfilling about being able to connect with something as distant and therefore quite abstract as a star through the emotional mechanism of listening. These vastly, you know, kind of large astrophysical structures become a little bit more tangible to us, I think, if we can approach them through listening as opposed to just looking.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MANN: EPA officials haven't endorsed that idea. They say they're satisfied that enough PCBs have been removed that the Hudson can begin healing, and GE spokesman Mark Behan says the company has done enough. BEHAN: For years, there have been voices who've said they wanted a different project, a larger project, a smaller project. But EPA is the decision-maker. EPA ordered the dredging project, and GE executed that project and, I think, did so exceptionally well. MANN: But a separate coalition of state and federal agencies, not including the EPA, has been studying the impact of PCBs on Hudson River wildlife. They've signaled that they may push GE to dredge contaminated sites not included on the EPA's list.

They look like they belong in the dinosaur age, and they're horseshoe crabs. Scientists worry their numbers are declining, and as NPR's Jeff Brady reports, that's why volunteers fan out along the coast to count horseshoe crabs each year. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: On a beach and near Dover, Del. , horseshoe crabs are lined up for miles. They've come ashore for their annual spawning season. The females are larger, as big as a dinner plate. The shell has a horseshoe shape. From a few steps back, they look like green army helmets. FAITH HEWES: And you could tell when they're old. BRADY: How can you tell when they're old? FAITH: Because they have a lot of stuff on their backs and a lot of barnacles. BRADY: Faith Hewes learned about horseshoe crabs from her dad. Jim Hewes is a seventh grade science teacher. He volunteers to lead counting teams. Just before 9 p. m. , it's nearly dark. High tide is receding, and he gives instructions to a half-dozen volunteers. They hold big white squares made of plastic pipe. JIM HEWES: When you put in your square, go right to the water's edge, OK? Drop it in. And again, remember, you're counting the crabs that are only within the square itself. BRADY: Two teams do this 50 times each along a mile of this Delaware beach. Hewes says if a crab walks out of the square, count that one too. HEWES: Alright, guys, let's have fun, and let's count some crabs. BRADY: With rubber boots and headlamps, the volunteers dig through the many males to find the few females laying eggs in the sand. TOM HUBER: You count the males. I'll check for females. MELANIE HUBER: OK. BRADY: Tom Huber and daughter Melanie bend down and dig in. Son Benson stands with a clipboard. BENSON HUBER: They count them. I just write it down and anything - like if they have tags, I have to record those as well. BRADY: Some crabs are tagged so researchers can track where they go. HUBER: OK, so 13 males, 2 females. BENSON: OK. BRADY: There are plenty of crabs tonight, but overall, there's still concern. The fishing industry uses horseshoe crabs for bait. Migratory birds eat their eggs, and biomedical companies use its blue blood to make a special clotting agent. Kirby Rootes-Murdy with the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission says here in the Delaware Bay region, numbers are stable, and south of here, the population is increasing. KIRBY ROOTES-MURDY: What we are seeing in terms of concerning evidence is a decrease in abundance for the New York and kind of New England regions. BRADY: And Rootes-Murdy points out another important thing about horseshoe crabs. Turns out, they aren't really crabs. ROOTES-MURDY: It's pretty nuts that they have the name horseshoe crab, but they're much more closely related to spiders and scorpions than they are to actual blue crabs that people are familiar with. BRADY: Back at the shore, Maggie Pletta with the Delaware National Estuarine and Research Reserve says don't let that spider scorpion thing worry you. MAGGIE PLETTA: They can't sting you. They're not venomous. They're not using their tale as a spear. You know, so if you see them on the beach and they're stuck upside down, flip them over. Return them the favor. Just flip them, and let them get back to doing their business. BRADY: Volunteers will be out here on the beach at night through June 18 this year counting horseshoe crabs.

HAROLD OTT: I think this is a very exciting right now, because basically what we can do is we can push cells to become hard cells or muscle cells. But we're not quite there yet to then guide them to grow into a full-blown heart or lung. It's just highly complex. And it's hard to do in a dish. RATH: The scientists use a process called decellularization. They remove the existing living tissue from an existing rat arm and repopulate the scaffolding left behind with new, living cells. And the arm they've created looks disturbingly real. You can check out the photos on our website - flesh, muscles, everything. That's not all. They ran an electrical current through the muscles tissue and the little arm began to twitch. OTT: Those muscles - those little muscles were not strong enough yet to move the entire arm.

It sort of really showed us that this is a platform that eventually has the potential to regenerate functional composite tissue for patients. RATH: Now that they've created the arm, Dr. Ott says it's time to work on making the limb re-attachable and fully functional. OTT: The next step will be now to apply the cellular part to the cell technology of this paper to human or patient-derived cells and to answer quite a bit more questions. As you can imagine, this scaffold not only has to be alive, but eventually, we hope that it will connect back to the patients through recipients' nerve system in order to become fully functional.

There's talk of reviving a long-stalled federal drought relief bill in Congress to help farmers. The idea is to free up more stored water supplies and send tens of millions of dollars in aid to hard-hit communities from California to Alaska. But a fight over one landmark environmental law continues to be a hang-up. NPR's Kirk Siegler has the story. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: Travel up and down California farm country, the Central Valley, and you hardly hear people lamenting the lack of rain or how dry this past winter was. What you hear from the ag industry and many local and national politicians is this. . . DEVIN NUNES: Well, what I always like to say is that this is a man-made drought created by government. SIEGLER: Representative Devin Nunes is a Republican congressman from the Valley. When he says man-made drought, he's talking about court-ordered restrictions that have kept hundreds of millions of gallons of water in West Coast rivers and estuaries to protect endangered fish. He says that water didn't go to farmers in his district, nor has it helped the fish populations rebound. NUNES: Why would you keep doing the same thing and starve your citizens of water? I mean, this is - California is supposedly the most tech savvy state, the most progressive state in the union, yet you can't even provide water to its own people. It's rather pathetic. SIEGLER: And here's where the issue of drought relief is getting tied up in a much larger political battle between business-friendly Republicans and green-leaning Democrats. See, a lot of the laws and regulations that keep water in rivers during severe droughts like this fall under the Endangered Species Act. Signed by President Nixon in 1973, the act has long been unpopular with Republicans who say it's being used as a political tool to stymie all sorts of development in the West. NUNES: Clearly, if the Endangered Species Act is not working and it's not protecting the species and you're wasting water, the Congress can actually change the law. SIEGLER: And that's just what some would like to do, much to the chagrin of green-leaning Democrats and environmentalists. MATT NIEMERSKI: Going at the Endangered Species Act as the cause for the drought and the cause for people not getting water is a bit of a red herring, a false notion. SIEGLER: Matt Niemerski is director of Western water policy for American Rivers. He says there are tools already available to help farmers through a drought without touching the act. He points to conservation and efficiency programs under the farm bill for starters. NIEMERSKI: The federal agencies have authorities and flexibility to do things with water. What they don't have right now is the financial resources to do that. SIEGLER: So environmentalists want more money for conservation programs they've long lobbied for and Republicans want to amend or repeal environmental laws. One side says environmentalists are trying to shut down farming altogether in places like the Central Valley. And the other says big business is seizing on the drought crisis to try to gut to the Endangered Species Act. But listen to Representative Devin Nunes's response to that last accusation in case you didn't think things were heated. NUNES: This is a drought that's been created by government, by their big supporters in the radical environmental groups. So I can't believe you'd ask such a stupid question after I just explained it to you. SIEGLER: Meanwhile, here in California at least, you don't get the sense that people are waiting around for Congress to act. Ellen Hanak is a researcher on water issues at the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California. ELLEN HANAK: So I see at the local level and at the regional level a lot of really constructive conversations happening with people trying to figure out how to stretch available supplies and get the most bang for the buck. SIEGLER: The institute has proposed a drought relief plan that barely touches the controversial Endangered Species Act. Instead, it proposes small changes to ages-old Western water laws that would allow more water trading and storage. Whether any of these make their way into a bill will become clearer in the next few weeks. Kirk Siegler, NPR News.

If you get a cut, your skin will form a scar. Starfish and salamanders can regrow lost limbs. And it turns out that some jellyfish have a really unusual way of repairing an injury. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce tells us scientists were recently shocked to discover this. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Moon jellyfish are strange, little creatures. A couple of years ago, Michael Abrams, at the California Institute of Technology, began growing them in the lab. MICHAEL ABRAMS: We started doing kind of old-school experiments where you just sort of cut off pieces and see what happens. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says each young jellyfish is tiny and looks like a snowflake, with eight arms and a mouth in the center. Abrams tried chopping them in half with a razor blade. ABRAMS: If you imagine cutting them in half, that means you've now got four arms on one side and no arms on the other side. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He thought the lost limbs might regenerate, but no. Instead, over a couple of days, the remaining limbs moved around the body until the little jellyfish was once again symmetrical. ABRAMS: Rather than four arms on one side, you had sort of an X shape - like a cross. GREENFIELDBOYCE: In fact, no matter how many arms he cut off, these little jellies would rearrange what was left to re-create a symmetrical pattern. ABRAMS: We were not expecting to see that. GREENFIELDBOYCE: His adviser, Lea Goentoro, was intrigued. LEA GOENTORO: It could be a really different strategy of surviving from injuries, so I just thought, well, we need to look at this a bit more. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The team did a bunch of studies. They're described in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. What they learned is that the jellyfish get healed by swimming. As a wounded jellyfish struggles to move through the water with its remaining limbs, its muscles contract and relax. This creates forces that push on the body's elastic, jelly-like material, reshaping it until the limbs are once again evenly spaced. GOENTORO: It's that propulsion machinery itself that drives its own repair. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The researchers say this idea could prove useful for designing future materials or technologies that would fix themselves, not by replacing a part, but by simply rearranging what's left.

And then you go to a nature preserve in the Florida Panhandle and realize you had no idea. (SOUNDBITE OF FROGS CHIRPING)BLOCK: The symphony of frogs fills the muggy night air at Nokuse Plantation. (SOUNDBITE OF FROGS CHIRPING)BLOCK: We've come here to meet a man who's done something extraordinary. He's bought up tens of thousands of acres of land in the Florida sandhills and turned them into a unique, private preserve. It's the largest block of privately owned conservation land in the southeastern U. S. He's restoring ecosystems that were destroyed by agriculture and timbering. M. C. DAVIS: Well, my name's M. C. Davis, and I'm a self-proclaimed, devout conservationist. I've been dedicated now for about 20 years. BLOCK: And what were you before that? DAVIS: I was somewhere to the right of Attila the Hun. BLOCK: M. C. Davis is thinking 300 years into the future with his wildlife restoration project, even though he knows he doesn't have much time left. He recently learned that he's terminally ill. But let's go back to the beginning and how Davis made his fortune. First, there was gambling. DAVIS: I was hustling around, gambling, from about the time I was 16 until I was 30. It was my primary income. BLOCK: Eventually, he got into business, buying up land and mineral rights - made hundreds of millions along the way. Now, at age 70, M. C. Davis proudly calls himself a tree hugger in love with this land. But growing up poor in the Florida Panhandle, he just wanted to get away. DAVIS: I grew up with five other people in 300 square feet in a wore out trailer on a dirt road. And so, man, I was trying to get to town, make some money. And I spent half my life doing that, and I spent the other half getting back in the woods, you know? BLOCK: I ask M. C. Davis to take me to one of his favorite spots on his land, so we ride out through the woods in a golf cart to a bog of carnivorous pitcher plants, their trumpets glowing a vivid yellow. He loves them. DAVIS: You can see a fellow trapped right down in there. BLOCK: A little bug in there. DAVIS: Yeah. BLOCK: Davis has bought up 54,000 acres of land, mostly from timber companies. And he is restoring it to a longleaf pine forest, a rich center of biodiversity. Longleaf pines once covered the South - 40 million acres. But that original longleaf forest was all cut by the 1930s, lost to timbering and lost to memory. DAVIS: I never even heard the word longleaf. BLOCK: So how did this committed capitalist become a sudden conservationist? He says it all started 20 years ago in a traffic jam. DAVIS: It's drizzling rain, and I just sort of frantic with exasperation, stuck in traffic. And I look up, and I saw on the marquee of the high school Black Bear Presentation. BLOCK: So M. C. Davis pulled out of traffic and went inside. DAVIS: I hate to confess to this. I didn't know Florida even had black bears at the time. BLOCK: He heard the passionate pitch, and it changed his life. He started reading books by environmentalists and had an epiphany. What if he could dedicate his fortune to nature? Well, that's what he's done. Davis has spent some $90 million snapping up land for conservation. DAVIS: And this was the first tract I bought. BLOCK: Right here. DAVIS: Right here. BLOCK: He's had 8 million longleaf pine seedlings planted to restore the forest to the way it used to be centuries ago. And with it, he's creating an ecological hotspot, filled with wildlife. DAVIS: I've seen eagles and bobcats and foxes and coons and armadillos. BLOCK: The most recent arrivals come not by paw or wing, but in Rubbermaid tubs stacked in the back of a white Chevy Suburban. (SOUNDBITE OF SCRATCHING)BLOCK: Someone is making some noise in here. MATT ARESCO: Yeah, we just got some tortoises in from St. Johns County over near Saint Augustine. BLOCK: We've met up with the director of Nokuse Plantation, biologist Matt Aresco in his field office. He's showing us 11 newcomers - gopher tortoises. They're great diggers, burrowing deep underground. Their top shells are patterned with gorgeous amber hexagons. Now, this one - oh - he's (laughter). He saw my hand, and he's trying to get away(LAUGHTER)BLOCK: Gopher tortoises are listed as a threatened species in Florida. Many were killed for their meat. Others have suffered from habitat loss. This batch was rescued from a subdivision that's going up hundreds of miles away. These tortoises would've been buried and died. ARESCO: Yeah, so this is an adult female. This one weighs probably six pounds. You're probably only the third person she's ever seen in her entire life. BLOCK: (Laughter). ARESCO: And she's probably been around for about 40 years, at least. (SOUNDBITE OF CAR DOOR CLOSING)BLOCK: We head out to the center of the preserve with the new tortoises in tow. ARESCO: And this - all the trees you see are longleaf pines that were planted in 2005. BLOCK: Those longleaf pines started as 10-inch seedlings. Now they're about 20 feet tall, with long, bright green needles clustered in pom-poms. They look like Dr. Seuss trees. One by one, Matt Aresco sets the tortoises at the entrance to a borough. ARESCO: Look at that. Look at him digging. He's already throwing sand back. BLOCK: These newcomers make 4,043 gopher tortoises released into the forest at Nokuse Plantation. ARESCO: Oh, he likes that borough. (SOUNDBITE OF RAIN)BLOCK: Over at the pitcher plant bog, M. C. Davis looks at out at his land as a heavy rain starts drumming down. He tells me all of this work - tortoise by tortoise, seedling by seedling - it's all just the beginning of a 300-year project. DAVIS: 'Cause I can't make the tree be 300 years old for another 270 years. BLOCK: And M. C. Davis is all too aware that his own time is limited. Can we talk about your health? DAVIS: Well, we can. I'm not a lot different from most folks. I'm dying, as we all are, and it's well-advanced. I mean, it's not anything - there's 300-and-something thousand people right now in the United States that have fourth stage lung cancer. So, hey, it's just nature's way. BLOCK: Davis was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer this past November. He says he's confident he has a solid team in place to carry on this work when he's gone. I would think it would be a very satisfying thing to look around at this land - all these trees - think about those thousands of tortoises that have been relocated here and think about all of this outliving you. DAVIS: Well, that is the purpose. And, you know, if there's such a thing as being perpetual, this will be here, no matter how stupid our species gets and no matter how much it degrades this. It will start over. But I'm hoping that we're capable of leaving some huge biological warehouses that, if and when our country fails - and all of them do sooner or later - that hopefully the impacts wouldn't be total, that nature just wouldn't have to start from scratch. BLOCK: M. C. Davis, unexpected conservationist, gambler-turned-tree hugger, tells me he's leaving nearly all of his millions to this conservation trust. His money will also go to the environmental education center he created here that thousands of Florida schoolchildren come through every year. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: See, right there? UNIDENTIFIED BOY: Yeah. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: It'll turn into a dragonfly. UNIDENTIFIED BOY: Really? It turns into a dragonfly? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Yeah. UNIDENTIFIED BOY: Cool.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today - shifting time, ideas about how we perceive and think about time. And do you remember when you were a kid how a day at school felt like forever? And then at a certain point in your life, as you get older, the days and the months just seem to move faster. DAN GILBERT: Yes, they do. RAZ: This is Dan Gilbert, Harvard psychologist. GILBERT: And that's because older and younger people don't actually experience time all that differently, they just remember it very differently. When old people say time goes by so fast, they're talking about the time that's already gone by. There's also just a whole hell of a lot more recording in the brain of an 86-year-old person. When they're thinking about life, they're thinking across much greater expanses of time. And so to traverse that many years in five seconds versus traversing five or six years in five seconds, you get the sense that you're going a lot faster. RAZ: Which makes sense when you think about it, but it still doesn't explain why we tend to think of ourselves as fixed in time depending on where we are in life. GILBERT: When I turned 21, I thought, I'm finally grown up. And then when I turned 30, I thought, no, now I'm grown-up. Boy, was I crazy about that when I was 21. RAZ: Yeah. GILBERT: I repeated that when I was 40 and then when I was 50. And the amazing thing is that each time it happens, I'm pretty sure I'm right this time, despite the fact that I was wrong every other time. RAZ: So a 30-year-old would say, yeah, I'm different from the person I was when I was 20, but I'm now the person I am. And a 40-year-old would say, yeah, I'm different from who I was when I was 30, but I finally figured out who I am - and go on and so on and so forth. GILBERT: Not only that but the same person says that thing over and over again. Look, we all know we will change. We know that we're going to gain a few pounds and get a few wrinkles. But we think that fundamentally the people we've become - our personalities, our values, our preferences, likes and dislikes - will remain relatively stable in the future. And in that, we are wrong. RAZ: Dan and other psychologists have tested this by taking a group of people of a certain age. . . GILBERT: And you ask them how much they're going to change in the next 10 years. Then you find a group of people who are 10 years older, and you ask them how much they changed in the last 10 years. I can ask you questions like, on a scale of 1 to 10, how extroverted are you now? How extroverted do you think you'll be in 10 years? How extroverted were you 10 years ago? Now, if everyone is perfectly rational and everyone has perfect memory, those two numbers should match. What we found is no matter what the dimension of change and no matter how old the people were, those numbers never matched. RAZ: Dan explained why that is on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GILBERT: All of us are walking around with an illusion, an illusion that history, our personal history, has just come to an end. We call this the end of history illusion. An illusion that we have just recently become the people that we were always meant to be and will be for the rest of our lives. At every age, people underestimate how much their personalities will change in the next decade. And it isn't just ephemeral things like values and personality.  You can ask people about their likes and dislikes, their basic preferences. For example, name your best friend, your favorite kind of vacation. What's your favorite hobby? What's your favorite kind of music? People can name these things. We ask half of them to tell us, do you think that that will change over the next 10 years and half of them to tell us, did that change over the last 10 years. People predict that the friend they have now is the friend they'll have in 10 years, the vacation they most enjoy now is the one they'll enjoy in ten years. And yet people who are 10 years older all say, you know, that's really changed. RAZ: Does it matter which decade of life we're talking about? GILBERT: The amount of change between 20 and 30 is greater than the amount of change between 30 and 40. The pace of change does indeed slow as we age. All of us have the sense that we're coming into our own, that we're finally becoming the person we were meant to be. RAZ: Yeah. GILBERT: That's not entirely wrong. You will change less in the future than you did in the past, but you will change more in the future than you expect to. RAZ: What explains that? I mean, why are we so bad at imagining how we will change over time? GILBERT: We don't really know, but we have some good guesses. The best guess to date is that when you try to imagine yourself in the future, you can imagine changing in one direction as easily as you can imagine changing in the other. As a result of it being easy for you to imagine becoming more extroverted and to imagine becoming less extroverted, you mistakenly conclude that you won't change at all. But this is a mistake. I mean, imagine I frame the problem differently. You're walking down a road and you come to a dead end. Will you turn left or right? Well, I can imagine turning left. I can imagine turning right. That's fine. Would you conclude that as a result of not knowing which way you're going to turn, you won't turn at all? Of course not. And that problem you see that just because you don't know the direction of your turn doesn't mean turning is unlikely. And yet somehow as we move through time, because we can't predict exactly who we will be, we mistakenly take that to mean we will remain the person we are. RAZ: What do you think is helpful about having this illusion that we have just become the person that we were always meant to be? Is there, like, a reason why we feel that way? GILBERT: Well, we certainly don't know that there is something helpful about it. Every psychological tendency doesn't have to have a benefit. RAZ: Yeah. GILBERT: But if you asked me to guess what benefit might accrue to people who believe that the amount of change in front of them is quite limited, most people are fundamentally satisfied with who they are. They feel that they've finally arrived at being a pretty good person, a pretty capable person, a pretty responsible person. And as a result, the idea that any of these things might change feels a little threatening, a little undermining. So I think stasis is a comfortable illusion that all of us live with. And it might be one of the reasons why we don't believe there's as much change in the future as we're going to find out there really was. RAZ: So based on all the evidence that you've seen, can you sort of come up with a rough age where most people are actually coming into the person they were always meant to be? GILBERT: Fifty-seven (laughter). RAZ: I got it, which happens to be your age, right? GILBERT: Now, if you ask me next year, I might have a different opinion. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GILBERT: The bottom line is time is a powerful force. It transforms our preferences. It reshapes our values. It alters our personalities. We seem to appreciate this fact but only in retrospect. Only when we look backwards do we realize how much change happens in a decade. It's as if for most of us the present is a magic time. It's a watershed on the timeline. It's the moment at which we finally become ourselves. Human beings are works in progress that mistakenly think they're finished. The person you are right now is as transient, as fleeting and as temporary as all the people you've ever been. The one constant in our life is change. RAZ: I mean, it really is amazing that something like time, which seems so fixed, can be experienced in so many different ways depending on where you are in life. GILBERT: You know, the human brain just doesn't know how to think about time. If you ask most people, what's real, the present, the past or the future? They say the present. RAZ: Yeah. GILBERT: Actually they're wrong. The past and the future are both real. The present is a psychological illusion. The present is just the wall between yesterday and today. You know, if you go to the beach, you see water and you see sand, and it looks like there's a line between them, but that line is not a third thing. There's only water, and there's only sand. Similarly, all moments in time are either in the past or in the future. . . RAZ: Yeah. GILBERT: . . . Which is to say the present doesn't exist. RAZ: Psychologist Dan Gilbert teaches at Harvard. He's got lots more TED Talks that are all amazing. You can see them at ted. com. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today - shifting time, ideas about how we perceive and think about time. And do you remember when you were a kid how a day at school felt like forever?

GILBERT: Well, we certainly don't know that there is something helpful about it. Every psychological tendency doesn't have to have a benefit. RAZ: Yeah. GILBERT: But if you asked me to guess what benefit might accrue to people who believe that the amount of change in front of them is quite limited, most people are fundamentally satisfied with who they are. They feel that they've finally arrived at being a pretty good person, a pretty capable person, a pretty responsible person. And as a result, the idea that any of these things might change feels a little threatening, a little undermining. So I think stasis is a comfortable illusion that all of us live with. And it might be one of the reasons why we don't believe there's as much change in the future as we're going to find out there really was. RAZ: So based on all the evidence that you've seen, can you sort of come up with a rough age where most people are actually coming into the person they were always meant to be? GILBERT: Fifty-seven (laughter). RAZ: I got it, which happens to be your age, right? GILBERT: Now, if you ask me next year, I might have a different opinion. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) GILBERT: The bottom line is time is a powerful force. It transforms our preferences. It reshapes our values. It alters our personalities. We seem to appreciate this fact but only in retrospect. Only when we look backwards do we realize how much change happens in a decade. It's as if for most of us the present is a magic time. It's a watershed on the timeline. It's the moment at which we finally become ourselves. Human beings are works in progress that mistakenly think they're finished. The person you are right now is as transient, as fleeting and as temporary as all the people you've ever been. The one constant in our life is change. RAZ: I mean, it really is amazing that something like time, which seems so fixed, can be experienced in so many different ways depending on where you are in life. GILBERT: You know, the human brain just doesn't know how to think about time. If you ask most people, what's real, the present, the past or the future? They say the present. RAZ: Yeah. GILBERT: Actually they're wrong. The past and the future are both real. The present is a psychological illusion. The present is just the wall between yesterday and today. You know, if you go to the beach, you see water and you see sand, and it looks like there's a line between them, but that line is not a third thing. There's only water, and there's only sand. Similarly, all moments in time are either in the past or in the future. . . RAZ: Yeah. GILBERT: . . . Which is to say the present doesn't exist. RAZ: Psychologist Dan Gilbert teaches at Harvard.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today - shifting time; why time can feel different at 4 a. m. from one decade to the next and why time can definitely feel different to a physicist. SEAN CARROLL: To a physicist, time is a label on the universe. RAZ: Sean Carroll is a theoretical physicist. CARROLL: At CalTech. RAZ: And physicists like Sean think about time very differently from you and me. CARROLL: To a physicist, the universe is this thing, it's full of stuff, and it keeps happening over and over again. And this goes back to, you know, ancient astronomers. The Earth revolves around the sun, and it rotates around its axis 365 times. So the universe is filled with repetitive, cyclic moments, and time is just the label on those different moments. RAZ: Those labels - one day, one month, one year - make up what Sean and other physicists call the arrow of time, meaning that time travels in one direction. That's why you were younger in the past, while you'll be older in the future, why you remember one and not the other. But here's the problem. That difference between past and future is nowhere to be found in the laws of physics because in physics, there is no arrow of time. CARROLL: When modern physics came to be from people like Galileo and Newton up through Einstein, we realized something very gradually, which is that the deep down laws of physics don't distinguish between the past and the future. They treat them completely symmetrically as if they were just replaceable with each other. So as a physicist, there's almost more work to be done in understanding why time works the way it does than as a person on the street because you have to reconcile the fact that there is a difference between past and future with the fact that that difference doesn't appear anywhere in your fundamental equations. RAZ: In the laws of physics, there is no intrinsic difference between the past and the future. CARROLL: That is exactly right. RAZ: Which theoretically means what? CARROLL: So if you think about time going from the far, far, far past - let's say the Big Bang was not the beginning. Let's say there was sort of an infinite amount of time before the Big Bang, and there's an infinite amount of time after the present moment. It's possible there are regions of the universe where their notion of past and future are backwards compared to ours, where they call the past what we call the future and vice versa. That's completely allowed because the underlying laws of physics don't distinguish. RAZ: Sean Carroll described what this strange fact of physics might mean for our everyday idea of time and our place in the universe from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CARROLL: The universe is really big. We live in a galaxy, the Milky Way galaxy. There are about 100 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy. There are approximately 100 billion galaxies in the observable universe. One hundred billion is the only number you need to know. The age of the universe between now and the Big Bang is 100 billion in dog years. (LAUGHTER)CARROLL: Which tells you something about our place in the universe. But we would also like to understand it. As a cosmologist, I want to ask why is the universe like this? One big clue we have is that the universe is changing with time. If you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity, it would be moving away from you. And if you look at a galaxy even further away, it would be moving away faster so we say the universe is expanding. What that means, of course, is that in the past, things were closer together. In the past, the universe was more dense and it was also hotter. If you squeeze things together, the temperature goes up. That kind of makes sense to us. The thing that doesn't make sense to us as much is that the universe, at early times near the Big Bang, was also very, very smooth. At early times, those hundred billion galaxies were squeezed closer together. And you have to imagine doing that squeezing without any imperfections, without any little spots where there were a few more atoms than somewhere else 'cause if there had been, they would've collapsed under the gravitational pull into a huge black hole. Keeping the universe very, very smooth at early times is not easy. It's a delicate arrangement. It's a clue that the early universe is not chosen randomly. There is something that made it that way. We would like to know what. RAZ: Which brings us back to time. Physicists use a special term to describe that early state of the universe when everything was delicately arranged. It's called low entropy. And entropy basically means disorder. So low entropy is a state of order where everything is organized. CARROLL: Well, the thing about order versus disorder is there are many more ways to be disorderly than to be orderly. That's why if you sort of clean your room, it's not surprising that it gets messier over time. There's more ways to be messy than clean. RAZ: You can actually look that one up in any physics book. It's the second law of thermodynamics - entropy, disorder, it's always increasing. And whether you realize it or not, this law plays out all around you in everyday moments. CARROLL: Like breaking an egg, mixing cream into coffee or diving into a swimming pool and getting a big splash. But you make a movie of that and play it backwards, you instantly know that something is going on where entropy is going down, and that's weird. RAZ: OK. So what's the connection between entropy and this idea of the arrow of time - like of time having a direction. CARROLL: Well, that's a great question because time would exist with or without entropy, just like space exists even though there's no arrow of space. If you're out there in your space suit, there's no difference between up and down, left and right. RAZ: You have no idea what - right, it's all the same. CARROLL: But there's still space. No one says, oh, space doesn't exist just because there's no direction to it. So entropy gives time a direction, but time exists whether or not there's entropy. And in our universe, at one end of time, the entropy was low and we called that the past. And the other end of time, the entropy is high, and we call that the future. The part that we don't understand is why the early universe had a low entropy. That's a real puzzle that we're still struggling with today. RAZ: If there was low entropy at the beginning, if there was order, could it suggest that there was something that intended it to be that way? CARROLL: It could be. If you ask a question like that, the answer is yeah, it could be. There's many things that are possible. That's certainly something that people have thought about. There's something called the teleological argument or the argument from design for the existence of a supernatural creator that says that, you know, features of our universe, if they were very different, wouldn't have allowed for us human beings to exist. But the early universe, interestingly, the problem is not just it was quite orderly, but it was really way more orderly than it needed to be for us to be here. RAZ: Yeah. CARROLL: If you really want to make this argument that the universe is set up to allow for the existence of life or humanity or something like that, the early universe is overkill. So it seems that whatever the explanation is for why the early universe has the features it does, that's not a really good one. We need something to explain why it is so exquisitely low entropy - so many particles in such a very, very specific state. And, as physicists, we have theories - you know, we don't know which one is right - its early times as far as this big question kind of thinking goes. But it's not hard to imagine that we'll get a good physics explanation rather than reaching for something beyond the physical world. RAZ: And if physicists come up with that explanation, they might also be able to answer all kinds of questions about the arrow of time. CARROLL: Questions like, is time continuous or discrete? Is there a shortest possible interval of time or is time completely smooth? Is time something that everyone would agree is an absolutely crucial part of our best description of the universe or is time something that emerges as an approximation if we look at the universe in a right way? RAZ: OK, to most of us, do those questions sound insane? Yes. CARROLL: But these are all questions that a physicist wants to know the answer to. RAZ: But how to answer those questions is a problem that is only getting more complicated. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CARROLL: The reason the problem has gotten worse rather than better is because in 1998 we learned something crucial about the universe that we didn't know before. We learned that it's accelerating. The universe is not only expanding - if you look at that galaxy, it's moving away - you come back a billion years later and look at it again, it will be moving away faster. Individual galaxies are speeding away from us faster and faster, so we say the universe is accelerating. Unlike the low entropy of the early universe, even though we don't know the answer for this, we at least have a good theory that can explain it,  and if that theory is right, then that's the theory of dark energy. It's just the idea that empty space, itself, has energy. And every little cubic centimeter of space, whether or not there's stuff - whether or not there's particles, matter, radiation or whatever - there is still energy even in the space itself. And this energy, according to Einstein, exerts a push on the universe. It is a perpetual impulse that pushes galaxies apart from each other because dark energy, unlike matter or radiation, does not dilute away as the universe expands. The amount of energy in each cubic centimeter remains the same even as the universe gets bigger and bigger. This has crucial implications for what the universe is going to do in the future. For one thing, the universe will expand forever. Back when I was your age, we didn't know what the universe was going to do. We thought - some people thought that the universe would re-collapse in the future. Einstein was fond of this idea. But, if there's dark energy and the dark energy does not go away, the universe is just going to keep expanding forever and ever and ever - 14 billion years in the past, 100 billion dog years - but an infinite number of years into the future. RAZ: So, did time exist before the Big Bang? CARROLL: We don't know. That's an open question. I think we should be very humble about what we don't know. We should be very, you know, happy about what we do know and not hide it. But there you have a question that we just don't know the answer. RAZ: Isn't that crazy? I mean, it's not crazy that we don't know, but it's crazy that - to think about that question, to just imagine. CARROLL: I think it's amazing that we can ask the question. RAZ: Yeah, that's true. CARROLL: A hundred years ago, we didn't even know the universe was expanding, you know. The Big Bang model was put together in the 1920s. RAZ: So, before that time, we used to think that space was static and that time was static? CARROLL: Well, we used to think that space was static and that time just flowed from past to future. That's just what it was. It was one thing - you know, if Newton had been correct, then time and space are separate and each absolute in their own rights. When Einstein comes along, he realizes that space and time are connected to each other and also that space-time has a dynamical nature - that it can change. It can be warped, it can be curved. And we experience that curvature as gravity, so we know it's there. So, in your brain, you can imagine scenarios where you're warping space and time into each other so much that you hop in your rocket ship, and you zoom out for a trip, and you zip around a black hole, and you come back before you left - you actually visit yourself in the past. We can imagine this - that's like telling a story about it. We don't think it's something that actually happens in the real world. RAZ: But we can see the past in some ways. Like, you look up at a star four light-years away, and you're seeing the light from that star as it was four years ago. CARROLL: Yes, but remember, when you're looking at your spouse across the table, you're also looking at the past. RAZ: Yes. All the time. CARROLL: By a little bit. RAZ: Everything we've talked about in this conversation is the past. We cannot go back. CARROLL: It's true and, in fact, if you go into the psychology-neuroscience of it, what you are currently experiencing as the moment now, is about 80 milliseconds in the past because it takes time for your brain to put together all the data that it's receiving and construct a conscious you. RAZ: It's all slipping through my fingers. CARROLL: (Laughter) This is - one of the interesting features of our universe is that as closely related as time and space are to each other, they are different. And one of the differences is that there's three different directions of space and there's only one of time. So time is something that you experience once and for all - every moment you get to go through once. And you don't get to turn left through yesterday and visit it again. RAZ: It's like it's - there's always a clock ticking, you know. CARROLL: That's right. You know, this goes back to entropy increasing and the fact that the universe is becoming more and more disorderly over time. Because if the early universe were not in this very special orderly, low-entropy state - if it were - what we would think of as, sort of, more randomly chosen and high disorder, then nothing would happen. There'd be no ant colonies, there'd be no cells, there's be no human beings. We would be in what we call equilibrium. The universe would be a dead, unchanging static place. The only thing any - the only reason anything happens in the universe, the only reason why there is this emergent complexity as time goes on is because the early universe was really, really, really ordered, and we are sort of the tiny little spinoffs - the epiphenomena of the universe as it becomes more and more disorderly. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CARROLL: Life, itself, depends on the arrow of time. We would not be able process information, metabolize, walk and talk if we lived in thermal equilibrium. So, if you imagine a very, very big universe - an infinitely big universe - with randomly-bumping-into-each-other particles, there will occasionally be small fluctuations in the lower entropy states and they relax back. But there will also be large fluctuations. Occasionally, you will make a planet or a star or a galaxy or 100 billion galaxies. So, here's two questions for you - number one, if the universe lasts for 10 to the 10 to the 120 years, why are we born in the first 14 billion years of it, in the warm comfortable afterglow of the Big Bang? Why aren't we in empty space? I don't actually know the answer. I'm going to give you my favorite scenario. Either it's just like that - there is no explanation. This a brute fact about the universe that you should learn to accept and stop asking questions. (LAUGHTER)CARROLL: Or maybe the Big Bang is not the beginning of the universe. An egg - an unbroken egg - is a low entropy configuration and yet, when we open our refrigerator, we do not go, ha, how surprising to find this low entropy configuration in our refrigerator. That's because an egg is not a closed system - it comes out of a chicken. Maybe the universe comes out of a universal chicken. (LAUGHTER)CARROLL: Maybe there is something that naturally, through the growth of the laws of physics, gives rise to universe like ours in low-entropy configurations. If that's true, it would happen more than once. We would be part of a much bigger multiverse. That's my favorite scenario. Maybe our universe is just one of those things that happens from time to time. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Sean Carroll is a professor at CalTech.

CARROLL: It's true and, in fact, if you go into the psychology-neuroscience of it, what you are currently experiencing as the moment now, is about 80 milliseconds in the past because it takes time for your brain to put together all the data that it's receiving and construct a conscious you. RAZ: It's all slipping through my fingers. CARROLL: (Laughter) This is - one of the interesting features of our universe is that as closely related as time and space are to each other, they are different. And one of the differences is that there's three different directions of space and there's only one of time. So time is something that you experience once and for all - every moment you get to go through once. And you don't get to turn left through yesterday and visit it again. RAZ: It's like it's - there's always a clock ticking, you know. CARROLL: That's right. You know, this goes back to entropy increasing and the fact that the universe is becoming more and more disorderly over time. Because if the early universe were not in this very special orderly, low-entropy state - if it were - what we would think of as, sort of, more randomly chosen and high disorder, then nothing would happen. There'd be no ant colonies, there'd be no cells, there's be no human beings. We would be in what we call equilibrium. The universe would be a dead, unchanging static place. The only thing any - the only reason anything happens in the universe, the only reason why there is this emergent complexity as time goes on is because the early universe was really, really, really ordered, and we are sort of the tiny little spinoffs - the epiphenomena of the universe as it becomes more and more disorderly. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) CARROLL: Life, itself, depends on the arrow of time. We would not be able process information, metabolize, walk and talk if we lived in thermal equilibrium. So, if you imagine a very, very big universe - an infinitely big universe - with randomly-bumping-into-each-other particles, there will occasionally be small fluctuations in the lower entropy states and they relax back. But there will also be large fluctuations. Occasionally, you will make a planet or a star or a galaxy or 100 billion galaxies. So, here's two questions for you - number one, if the universe lasts for 10 to the 10 to the 120 years, why are we born in the first 14 billion years of it, in the warm comfortable afterglow of the Big Bang? Why aren't we in empty space? I don't actually know the answer. I'm going to give you my favorite scenario. Either it's just like that - there is no explanation. This a brute fact about the universe that you should learn to accept and stop asking questions. (LAUGHTER) CARROLL: Or maybe the Big Bang is not the beginning of the universe. An egg - an unbroken egg - is a low entropy configuration and yet, when we open our refrigerator, we do not go, ha, how surprising to find this low entropy configuration in our refrigerator. That's because an egg is not a closed system - it comes out of a chicken. Maybe the universe comes out of a universal chicken. (LAUGHTER) CARROLL: Maybe there is something that naturally, through the growth of the laws of physics, gives rise to universe like ours in low-entropy configurations. If that's true, it would happen more than once. We would be part of a much bigger multiverse. That's my favorite scenario. Maybe our universe is just one of those things that happens from time to time. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) RAZ: Sean Carroll is a professor at CalTech.

Can you say your name please? LAURA CARSTENSEN: My name is Laura Carstensen. I am a professor of psychology at Stanford University. I am also the founding director of the Stanford Center on Longevity. RAZ: So a personal question - do you mind telling me your age or roughly your age? CARSTENSEN: Oh, I'm 61 roughly. RAZ: Oh, great. CARSTENSEN: (Laughter). RAZ: So you must be happier now than you've ever been in your life. CARSTENSEN: Of course. RAZ: Yeah. But why? What's going on? Is it just today, or is it being 61? CARSTENSEN: (Laughter) No, it's getting older. RAZ: Getting older and happier, which sounds counterintuitive because when you get older, bad things start to happen to you - you get sick, your friends get sick, you can't move around as much. But Laura's crazy discovery was that as time moves forward, people actually become happier. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CARSTENSEN: That's right. Older people are happy. They are happier than middle-aged people and younger people, certainly. Study after study is coming to the same conclusion. RAZ: Here is Laura Carstensen on the TED stage. CARSTENSEN: Years ago, my colleagues and I embarked on a study were we followed the same group of people over a 10-year period. Originally, the sample was aged 18 to 94. And we studied whether and how their emotional experiences changed as they grew older. Our participants would carry electronic pagers for a week at a time, and we'd page them throughout the day and evenings at random times. And every time we paged them, we'd ask them to answer several questions - on a one-to-seven scale, how happy are you right now? How sad are you right now? How frustrated are you right now? How happy are you right now? How frustrated are you right now? How sad are you right now? Right now. And using this intense study of individuals, we find that it's not one particular generation that's doing better than the others, but the same individuals over time come to report relatively greater positive experience. And so people, as they grow older, seem to experience fewer negative emotions and just as many positive emotions as when they were younger. So on balance, life experience feels better. RAZ: Yeah. CARSTENSEN: And when scientists first discovered this finding about emotion improving with age, they referred to it as the paradox of aging. I mean, people were shocked. RAZ: But why is that? Like, our perception of time is different the older we get, and then we're also happier on balance. What about it - like, why do people say that? CARSTENSEN: Well, I remember talking to two sisters who lived together in an apartment complex, and they were talking about having lost many friends over the years. And I was saying, but there are a lot of people around here who are your age who are like you, you could meet all sorts of people. And one of them looked at me and said, you know, we just don't have time for those relationships. And I remembered looking at her. My first thought was - you look to me like you got a lot of time on your hands, you know. I mean, you're - what are you doing all day? RAZ: Right. CARSTENSEN: And I realized that she wasn't talking about time in the day. She was talking about time left in life. And I realized that at some point in life, we're never going to make a new old friend because there isn't time. RAZ: So at that moment, you were like, wait a minute, this light goes off in your head. You're thinking I get it. CARSTENSEN: Yeah. I went home, and I remember sitting in my living room staring out at the city of San Francisco and thinking it's all about time. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CARSTENSEN: Not just clock time and calendar time but life time. And if there's a paradox of aging, it's that recognizing that we won't live forever changes our perspective on life in positive ways. When time horizons are long and nebulous as they typically are in youth, people are constantly preparing, trying to soak up all of the information they possibly can, taking risks, exploring. We might spend time with people we don't even like because it's somehow interesting. You know, we might learn something unexpected. (LAUGHTER)CARSTENSEN: We go on blind dates. (LAUGHTER)CARSTENSEN: You know, after all, if it doesn't work out, there's always tomorrow. As we age, our time horizons grow shorter and our goals change. When we recognize that we don't have all the time in the world, we see our priorities most clearly; we take less notice of trivial matters; we savor her life; we're more appreciative; we're open to reconciliation; we invest in more emotionally important parts of life, and life gets better. And that's why we think people get happier as they grow older because when death isn't literally knocking at your door today but is coming closer, you know, is kind of moving into the attic and kind of hanging out in the backyard, it focuses us on life and the people and the aspects of life that matter most. RAZ: I mean, it seems like we have that capacity to also, I guess, in a way, slow down our perception of time when we want to. CARSTENSEN: Well, yes. You know, whenever I give public lectures and talk about these differences in time horizons and how they relate to goals, and younger people are preparing for this long-term future, and older people are savoring the moment - almost every time, some young person will come up to me afterwards and say how do I get old faster? You know, I like that state. How can I be in that state and live in that state? RAZ: Yeah, I mean, when you're younger, you're so future-oriented. You're thinking about what's going to happen and what my life is going to be like. And then as you get older, you don't feel that way as much. CARSTENSEN: But, you know, I - in some ways, I think of this as the silver lining of growing older is that we're relieved of the burden of the future the older we get. And a whole lot of the concerns we have in life are about the future. And as we move through life, we know where we are and where we're headed. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CARSTENSEN: In day-to-day life, this translates into greater enjoyment. But as social scientists, we continue to ask about possible alternatives. We've said, well, maybe older people report more positive emotions because they're cognitively impaired. (LAUGHTER)CARSTENSEN: We've said could it be that positive emotions are simply easier to process than negative emotions? But that's not the case. The most mentally sharp older adults are the ones who show this positivity affect the most. But it's really too simplistic to say that older people are happy. In our study, they are more positive, but they're also more likely than younger people to experience mixed emotions - sadness at the same time you experience happiness. You know, that tear in the eye when you're smiling at a friend. You know, we think this is why poignancy increases with age, too, and why that tear in the eye tends to happen when we're thinking about chapters ending. So as we move through life and we celebrate graduation from high school, then college, marriages, the birth of children - these are positive events, but they signal the end of one chapter and the beginning of a new one. And those times in life are the very same events that bring a tear to our eye at the same time we're smiling. RAZ: That's a thing, you know, like just before I came in here, I was listening to an old episode of our show. It was about space. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)HENRY: Two stars. . . RAZ: And we put my son in it because he loved to gaze at stars. He still does. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)HENRY: Yeah. There's Polaris. RAZ: And I listen to his little voice. . .

There's my little - my, like, 4-year-old is a big boy, 6. CARSTENSEN: Yeah. RAZ: It was like that feeling that, like. . . CARSTENSEN: All right. RAZ: . . . Sadness, but also it was weird. CARSTENSEN: But can you imagine any emotional experience that's richer than that? RAZ: No. CARSTENSEN: Where you're seeing the past, you're in the present, you're thinking about the future - it's all there, and it's incredibly gratifying.

It involves elephants killed for their ivory. Biologists want to pin down where the worst poaching happens, and they found a new way to do that using DNA found in the ivory. Here's NPR's Christopher Joyce. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Zoologist Sam Wasser spent years extracting DNA from elephant dung and tissue across the African continent. He used it to draw a map that shows the genetic signature of each major population, kind of like an elephant barcode. Then he started taking DNA from illegal ivory seized around the world. He matched the ivory's barcode to the population and place it came from. SAM WASSER: We wanted to see, well, what are the major hotspots that are driving this trade. JOYCE: The worldwide ivory trade starts where the animals are killed and extends to smuggling networks that reach around the world. WASSER: By focusing on these major hotspots, we can actually stop a major portion of the killing. And you can simultaneously choke the flow of ivory into these networks. JOYCE: Wasser is a professor at the University of Washington and describes his technique in the journal Science. He says he's found a few hotspots, but two really stand out. The first is a region called Tridom. It spans part of Gabon, the Republic of Congo, Cameroon and the Central African Republic. The other hotspot includes two game reserves, where elephants are supposed to be protected, in Tanzania and Mozambique. Wasser says they become the go-to places for poachers. WASSER: No one expected, including myself, that virtually 100 percent of these seizures over the last decade would come from just two places. I mean, who would've thought that? JOYCE: Now, wildlife experts suspect that poachers have descended on these places. But it's hard to catch them in the act or head off shipments before they leave the continent. Where authorities often do intercept a big ivory shipment is in ports in Asia, the world's largest ivory market. The ivory is often in a shipping container. Conservation biologist George Wittemyer of Colorado State University says the container can only be traced back to its last exit port in Africa. GEORGE WITTEMYER: What we haven't known before is the origination of the ivory within Africa and its movement in Africa to the port of export. JOYCE: But now DNA can link ivory in a port in China to a game preserve in Tanzania. That's hard evidence to show African governments what's going on within their borders. As for what goes on outside Africa - in countries like China, where people buy lots of illegal ivory - conservationists say there's been progress as well. Leigh Henry tracks the ivory trade for the World Wildlife Fund. She says China recently announced it will soon crack down on illegal ivory trading there. LEIGH HENRY: We've never really seen an admission from China that they are part of the problem. JOYCE: But Henry says China is watching closely what the U. S. does with its illegal ivory trade. It's a fraction of China's market but still significant. HENRY: China has said very directly that they cannot act alone, that they expect other countries to take similar actions to clamp down on their ivory markets and pointed specifically to the U. S. JOYCE: The U. S. government has drafted new regulations that will limit trade in ivory here. They're due out any time. Henry acknowledges, however, that international efforts to stifle demand for ivory moves slowly. In the meantime, DNA tracking could help slow the rate of poaching at the source.

FLATT: Rob Tanner and his brother-in-law Troy Capps are hiking around juniper trees and bitterbrush in the high-desert terrain of Central Oregon. The men are looking for antlers that were shed by elk or deer. It's called shed hunting. TANNER: It's just an adrenaline rush. It's like, oh, you know, this could be the one. FLATT: They're seeing hoof tracks and bushes nibbled by deer. TROY CAPPS: We're in the prime right here. FLATT: Capps spots something on the ground, but these are signs of people, not deer. It's not the first time they've seen this, and it's got them fuming. To protect animals and their habitat, motorized vehicles are barred from this area in winter and early spring. CAPPS: That's a four-wheeler. I mean, they're probably out here, you know, running around and that's - that's wrong. FLATT: Capps and Tanner started Oregon Shed Hunters 10 years ago to promote ethical shed hunting. They say legit shed hunters don't cut fences. They don't destroy habitat. They don't harass animals to get them to drop their antlers. But it happens, and that's where Richard Mann comes in. He's a wildlife enforcement captain with the state of Washington. He says people sometimes jump the gun. They go in to closed areas and collect shed antlers early. This happens in the winter, right before elk naturally shed their antlers. It's also when elk are at their most vulnerable and hungry and sometimes sick. RICHARD MANN: People are ruining these elk while they're really in poor condition physically. They may not drop dead on sight, but some of them do. Once they get off, they don't recover from that kind of stress. FLATT: In Washington, people caught trespassing can be fined up to $1,000. But antler racks can sell for up to $35 per pound. A set from a trophy animal - the kind most likely to end up on a wall somewhere - can bring in thousands. MANN: Everything's together. FLATT: The volunteer group Eyes In The Woods helps law enforcement catch people lured by the potentially big payday. The group is setting up cameras to spot trespassers in Central Washington's Oak Creek Wildlife Area. Kyle Winton co-founded Eyes In The Woods. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: All right. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Ladder. FLATT: The team secures cameras to bear boxes. They screw on antennas and strap the boxes to trees. Then they wait. So far this season, four people have been nabbed. Trespassers will sneak into protected areas and stockpile antlers. Then they come back the night before antler season begins. In the morning, they walk out with their antlers and try to blend in with law-abiding shed hunters. KYLE WINTON: It's kind of suspicious when you see somebody coming out with 10 or 12 antlers at 9 o'clock in the morning. FLATT: The night before it opens to the public, Winton and his volunteers roam the preserve in search of poachers. They radio in updates on their patrols. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: I got a few people who went in early at the junction. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Let him go. FLATT: By the time the gates open in the morning, queues of cars, horses and people stream in. Many waited a sleepless night so they could go in first. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: Just over the crest there. . . FLATT: In the afternoon, shed hunters of all ages show off their prizes. Seven-year-old Bobbi Cline found an antler pretty close to the gate. It's almost as big as her. BOBBI CLINE: I'm holding an elk rack that we found. We found it in the bushes. FLATT: Her parents say that if the family collects enough antlers, someday they'd like to make a chandelier. How soon they're able to do that may depend on the success of wildlife officials and volunteers in stamping out antler poaching. For NPR News, I'm Courtney Flatt. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   Antlers are in high demand these days, not just as rustic decor, but for things like doggie chew bones. And that fuels a new threat to deer and elk in the Pacific Northwest. In the wild, stress and natural factors can cause the animals to shed antlers from time to time and some people collect them. But others see antlers as moneymaking opportunities and break the law. They don't wait for the antlers to fall. They harass or kill animals to get their prized racks. Courtney Flatt from Northwest Public Radio reports on the effort to stop this poaching.

But as the fracking boom unlocks huge quantities of natural gas, the nation's electric grid is changing. Power plants are increasingly turning to natural gas, a low-cost, cleaner-burning fossil fuel. That shift is driven by economics and also regulations. Marie Cusick of member station WITF reports. MARIE CUSICK, BYLINE: Decked out in a hard hat and safety goggles, Bill Pentak stands in the middle of a construction site. He's looking up at his company's latest project towering overhead, a new natural gas power plant. BILL PENTAK: This plant was sited precisely where it is because of its access to the abundant, high-quality natural gas that's found a mile to two miles beneath our feet. CUSICK: He's referring to the Marcellus Shale underfoot. In recent years, this part of north-central Pennsylvania has become one of the most productive gas fields in the world. Pentak works for Panda Power Funds, a Dallas, Texas-based company that has two more gas plants planned for Pennsylvania. The projects are part of a bigger story. The electric grid is shifting away from coal toward gas. PENTAK: What's taking place here is taking place across the United States. CUSICK: It's a trend Gary Helm is watching. He studies emerging markets for the PJM Interconnection. That's the regional grid organization for the mid-Atlantic U. S. and Midwest. It's sort of like an air traffic controller for the power system, helping keep the lights on for 61 million people. GARY HELM: We see, down the road, definitely a lot of gas coming online. CUSICK: That's because the fracking boom freed up a lot more cheap gas. Up until the mid-2000s, about half the electricity in the U. S. was produced by burning coal, 20 percent or less came from gas. Tyler Hodge is an analyst with the U. S. Energy Information Administration. He says these days, coal has dropped to about 40 percent of the nation's power while gas now accounts for nearly a third. TYLER HODGE: Definitely the mid-Atlantic and Pennsylvania regions especially are showing some significant shifts towards natural gas. CUSICK: Coal plants are also retiring as the Obama administration pushes its climate change action plan, which would require the country to cut carbon emissions by 30 percent from 2005 levels by the year 2030. Back at the construction site, Bill Pentak stands next to the plant's generator and points out that gas has an advantage in all this. As more renewables come online, gas plants can ramp up and down quickly. So when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing, he says gas can fill in the gaps. PENTAK: You have to have something that can be quickly dispatched to make up for that lost power, or it threatens the reliability of the grid. CUSICK: That's not to say using more gas doesn't pose some problems. Although gas produces about half the carbon emissions that coal does when you burn it, there's still uncertainty within the scientific community about its overall climate impact. Christina Simeone is with the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania. She says drilling and transporting gas leads to the leakage of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. CHRISTINA SIMEONE: When you look at gas production, you look at coal production, you know, these are imperfect resources that do have impacts just like all of these resources are imperfect and they all have impacts. CUSICK: The U. S. Energy Information Administration is projecting that gas power generation will become increasingly common under the Obama administration's climate plan. The agency expects the regulations would cause more coal plants to shut down, and gas will begin to take its place, followed by more renewable energy. For NPR News, I'm Marie Cusick.

What you're picturing is a real-life island off the coast of Puerto Rico. NPR's Anders Kelto went there. ANDERS KELTO, BYLINE: It's sunrise and a group of scientists are climbing into a boat. They're wearing khaki shorts and boots. Some have backpacks. Someone fires up the engine, and the boat begins to cross a calm channel of water. Up ahead, I can see the island - steep cliffs, lush green trees. The boat docks, and as we get out, we scrub the soles of our shoes with a brush - dip them in this pink disinfecting liquid. We step onto the island, and right away, I hear this sort of spooky grunting noise. (SOUNDBITE OF GRUNTING NOISE)KELTO: I can't tell where it's coming from, and then, up in a tree, I see two beige monkeys looking down. GISELLE CARABALLO-CRUZ: Just be careful they don't pee on you. KELTO: That's Angie Ruiz. She's part of a team of researchers from the University of Puerto Rico who manage this island, called Cayo Santiago. Ruiz actually has one of the best job titles ever - monkey island census taker. But her warning about not getting peed on is serious. These monkeys naturally carry Herpes B, a virus that can be deadly to humans. So, rule number one on Cayo Santiago, don't get peed on by the monkeys.

The Web version and name identifiers in the transcript have been corrected. Because NPR transcripts reflect what was said on the air, there are references to \"Angie Ruiz\" and \"Ruiz\" on this page. In each case, that's what correspondent Anders Kelto said. Those were mistakes. He should have said \"Giselle Caraballo-Cruz\" and in later references, \"Caraballo-Cruz. \"]We walk along a dirt path, toward a large metal cage. It's where the scientists eat lunch. CARABALLO-CRUZ: So, we have our resting areas, our eating areas. We're the ones in the cages, and the monkeys are free. KELTO: It's like a zoo where the monkeys come to see the humans. CARABALLO-CRUZ: Exactly, and they can see us eating. KELTO: (Laughter) Rule number two, the monkeys are the free ones. But it's not time for the humans to eat just yet, so we keep walking up a steep hill. Ruiz spots a small monkey off the side of the trail, and suddenly she veers way to the left, and she gestures at me to follow. CARABALLO-CRUZ: If you see a baby running around on the road, stay away from it 'cause chances are, mom's around and. . . KELTO: And she's protective. CARABALLO-CRUZ: Oh, yeah, and they come out of nowhere. KELTO: But, she says, if you see a male monkey, don't be intimidated because the males like to mess with people. Recently, she says, there was a researcher - a college student - who let a monkey bully her. CARABALLO-CRUZ: The monkey would actually chase her. Eventually, she like - I told her, grab a rock, show them the rock, and they'll know what happens after you show them the rock. And they'll stop picking on you. And eventually, then they all stopped picking on her. KELTO: And that's rule number three of Cayo Santiago, stay from the babies, but show the males who's boss. We get to the top of the hill and the view is spectacular. The mainland of Puerto Rico is behind us, open ocean in front. A white pickup truck drives past and some men get out and unload big white bags of monkey chow. It looks like dog food. And suddenly, there are monkeys everywhere. (SOUNDBITE OF MONKEYS)KELTO: They're coming down from the trees and walking right by our legs to get to the food, and monkey fights are breaking out all around me. My heart is totally pounding. And in this chaos, a researcher named Sean Coyne is just calmly walking among the primates. Hey, can I walk with you while you work? SEAN COYNE: Sure. KELTO: It's not too distracting? COYNE: Not at all. KELTO: OK. So, can you tell me what you're doing? COYNE: Right now I'm just looking to collect fecal samples to analyze for hormones. The morning's the best time. When they first wake up, they all tend to go to the bathroom when they first move. KELTO: Coyne is a grad student at the University of Chicago and spends a lot of time on the island. He's studying how hormone levels affect monkeys' sexual development. He says that translates into a lot of time scooping up monkey poo. COYNE: Yeah, my mom's so proud. But, all in the name of science. KELTO: The work here isn't glorious and it can be dangerous, but a lot of important science on primate behavior has happened here over the years. And coming here is sort of a rite of passage for many biologists. The island is the oldest wild primate research center in the world. It was created in the 1930s. Back then, biologists were spending a lot of time chasing monkeys around the jungles of Asia and Africa. The idea was to make things easier by putting the monkeys on a small island closer to the U. S. RICHARD RAWLINS: Where the animals were always there could easily be accessed and large amounts of data could be collected within a short amount of time. KELTO: That's Richard Rawlins, the former director of research on Cayo Santiago. He says about 500 rhesus macaques were brought here from India in 1938. It was a mission with a lot of challenges. About 50 monkeys, he says, died at sea during a 47-day voyage. And the scientists didn't really know how to set up the island before the monkeys arrived. RAWLINS: They planted fruit trees with the naive idea that these trees would be sufficient to sustain the monkeys, and they wouldn't have to buy food for them. KELTO: But, he says, that didn't work out well. RAWLINS: The monkeys, once on the island, had been eating this hulled rice for 47 days, instantly went over and vaporized all the stuff that had been planted (laughter). KELTO: So, scientists had to feed the monkeys. But for long stretches of time, there was no money. Many animals died of starvation and malnutrition. But Rawlins says, a few dedicated researchers helped the colony survive. Angie Ruiz, the monkey census taker, says today the colony faces a different threat. CARABALLO-CRUZ: People coming on the island without permission and having tuberculosis or having any illnesses that they can transmit to the monkeys. KELTO: She says people sometimes sneak tourists onto the island. And fishermen come here to catch hermit crabs. Ruiz says, if any of those visitors transmit a disease to the monkeys, it would move incredibly quickly through the whole colony. And on top of the risks to the monkeys, she says, these people are putting their own lives at risk. CARABALLO-CRUZ: It's dangerous to come out here and if you don't know the protocol, if you don't know what to do if you get an exposure, you could get sick. KELTO: Or you could die, she says. But there's a problem. The researchers can't legally prevent people from coming on shore. CARABALLO-CRUZ: The problem we have is that anything the water touches is public property. KELTO: The government has proposed a bill that would make the island a private research facility, open only to scientists. But the bill hasn't yet passed. So, the researchers just keep hoping that everyone - monkeys and humans - stay healthy. Anders Kelto, NPR News, Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico.

KELTO: The government has proposed a bill that would make the island a private research facility, open only to scientists. But the bill hasn't yet passed. So, the researchers just keep hoping that everyone - monkeys and humans - stay healthy.

It's the same for crimes against nature and southern Oregon is home to the world's only forensics lab dedicated solely to wildlife crime. With high-tech tools, the lab's shedding new light on illegal logging around the world. Jes Burns from Oregon Public Broadcasting has our story. JES BURNS, BYLINE: There's a small woodshop at the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Forensics Lab in Ashland, Ore. , but there's no sawdust or power tools. This shop is more like an archive, holding samples of some of the rarest woods on the planet. KEN GODDARD: African mahogany, Brazilian ebony, mahogany from the coastal south of Mexico. These woods have come from all over. BURNS: Lab director Ken Goddard flips through wooden planks the size of cell phones. The samples lay neatly on dozens of shelves. They're used to help identify illegal shipments of rare woods protected by international treaty. GODDARD: Basically, you would not continue investigation unless you are pretty sure you're dealing with endangered or threatened species. BURNS: With shipments of processed wood, this can be challenging because the limbs, leaves and DNA-rich sapwood have been removed. Just a few steps down the hall from the woodshop, deputy lab director Ed Espinoza leads the center's new forensic work on timber. ED ESPINOZA: If somebody had just called me out of the blue, first saying, can you identify wood with your mass spec, I would've said no, that's crazy. BURNS: The mass spec here is a relatively new kind of mass spectrometer. This one is called DART-TOF - or DART for short. And yes, it doesn't look or sound like much. It's more like a humming laser printer with a propane cylinder attached. That humble exterior hides some powerful technology. A few years back, an investigator asked if the lab could identify the wood confiscated in an alleged illegal shipment of agarwood, a protected incense tree. It struck Espinoza that he may be able to use the DART to identify the aromatic wood, which is used to make perfume. ESPINOZA: Originally, we had no idea if it was going to pan out or not. But I knew if it had an odor - this instrument is kind of like a massive nose, almost. BURNS: Espinoza shaved off a small sliver of the wood. With tweezers, he fed a sample into the DART. It needed just seconds to whiff the compounds and identify agarwood's unique chemical signature. ESPINOZA: It didn't occur to me until after the fact that I could apply it to other types of wood. BURNS: Espinoza and his team began collecting baseline samples of protected trees from around the world. These are the ones now stored in the lab's woodshop. In April, the Wildlife Forensics Lab became the first and only facility internationally certified to tell law enforcement that one sample is, say, legally traded Amazonian rosewood, versus contraband Brazilian rosewood. Shelley Gardner is the illegal logging program coordinator for the U. S. Forest Service. She says the new DART technology gives law enforcement a better chance to stop illegally harvested wood from becoming someone's guitar or a new dining room set. SHELLEY GARDNER: With that knowledge, I think their interests increase knowing that they can, if they are investigating a case, send a sample to a laboratory. BURNS: OK, so tree cases aren't as exciting or appealing as chasing tiger or ivory traffickers, but international timber tracking is a huge global business. Interpol estimates it's worth up to $100 billion a year. And lab director Ken Goddard says there are broader conservation goals at play. GODDARD: I think these wood cases are far more important than just the wood. I mean, trees can be re-grown. They are replaceable. That may not be true for the species that lived in that forest. BURNS: That's why disrupting illegal logging can save more than just a tree. It can also protect the homes of mammals, birds and insects. For NPR News, I'm Jes Burns.

The high court said the agency should have first considered how much it would cost power plants to do that. As NPR's Christopher Joyce reports, the decision comes too late for most power companies, but it could affect future regulations. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: When you burn coal or oil, you create airborne mercury. It's toxic and can end up in fish we eat. In 1990, Congress advised EPA to use the Clean Air Act to limit mercury. The agency set rules for many industries like cement makers and waste incinerators. Then EPA eventually added power plants, and most reduced their mercury emissions. But many also sued, along with the coal industry, in over 20 states. They said the EPA should not decide to adopt expensive new regulations without first considering what it will cost us. In its decision in Michigan versus EPA, the Supreme Court said to industry, you're right. Jeff Holmstead is an attorney with Bracewell and Guliani which represents utilities. He says the ruling is narrow, but the court clearly rebuked EPA. JEFF HOLMSTEAD: Before it decides to regulate something, it needs to take into account the cost of those regulations. It can't just turn a blind eye. JOYCE: Now, this ruling only applies to the Clean Air Act and its mercury standards, but Holmstead says it could affect future EPA regulations. Here's why. Usually companies still have to comply with regulations even while they're fighting them in court. In the case of mercury, industry spent billions to comply even while they were suing to stop them. And even though the court didn't throw the regulations out, it said EPA has to start over now. Holmstead says now businesses may insist that EPA wait for the courts before enforcing new rules. HOLMSTEAD: While you're going through that process, you need to put the regulation on hold, and what happened today certainly makes it much more likely. JOYCE: But the ruling comes too late for those power plants that have already made plans to install equipment to cut mercury. And Ann Weeks of the Clean Air Task Force says that's not likely to be reversed. ANN WEEKS: The horse is out of the barn. The protection's already are rolling forward, and utilities are making decisions accordingly. JOYCE: Weeks points out that the EPA eventually did do a cost-benefit analysis years after it decided to regulate mercury. The Supreme Court said that was too late. But she says EPA did set the dollar value of the public health benefits at nine times the cost to industry of complying. She says that clearly justifies regulating the industry and expects EPA will continue to do so. WEEKS: Obviously we are all going to work to make sure that, you know, some kind of protection remains in place while EPA does its consideration that it has to do now. JOYCE: The high court says that consideration must take place at the circuit court for the District of Columbia Weeks says it's possible the EPA will have to do another cost analysis.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RATH: If just one lumbering, bandaged monster can instill such terror in Abbott and Costello and Brendan Fraser, imagine being surrounded by 8 million mummies. That's the situation Salima Ikram found herself in, but she couldn't have been happier. She's an Egyptologist with the American University In Cairo and says these mummies are especially exciting because they're dogs - 8 millions dogs, mummified to honor Anubis, the jackal-headed god of the afterlife. Ikram says the discovery of the dogs has opened a new perspective on ancient Egyptians and their religion. SALIMA IKRAM: Each mummy would be sort of a symbol of something a pilgrim had given as a gift to the God. So nowadays, people go to a church and light a candle, but the Egyptians were in for the long haul. So instead of a candle, they would offer a mummy. So clearly this means that there were a lot of very religious people out there who were asking Anubis for intercession and for help for a variety of things. RATH: So tell us about these catacombs. Being in this tiny, dark space around mummies is something that would terrify a lot of people. It sounds like you are having a ball. IKRAM: Oh, yes, absolutely having a blast. I mean, these were some of the largest catacombs I've been in. But when they're filled with dead things, they're a bit more crowded. RATH: (Laughter) Did - does this change our understanding of ancient Egyptian religion or add to it in some way? IKRAM: Well, it certainly adds to our knowledge of ancient Egyptian religion because, I mean, the mass - the sheer number of these mummies - about 8 million - tells us that, even within 400 years or 500 years, when this catacomb was active, it tells us a bit about the sort of - how animals were viewed, because they were viewed with reverence, but at the same time, they were useful things. And you don't get 8 million mummies without having puppy farms, and some of these dogs were killed deliberately so that they could be offered. So for us, that seems really heartless. But for the Egyptians, they felt that the dogs were going straight up to join the eternal pack with Anubis, and so they were going off to a better thing. RATH: I'm actually a Hindu. Gods with animal heads doesn't seem that strange to me, but it still - it seems like the Egyptian - the ancient Egyptian religious relationship with animals is a different kind of thing. IKRAM: Well, I mean, I actually use Hindu mythology to explain ancient Egyptian religion, as well as the idea of Catholicism with lots and lots of saints. In a way, they're just sort of different facets of the one. So you have this great, powerful entity, but because that's too big for most people to comprehend, there are different aspects of that oneness that are the manifestations of the other gods. And since all the gods and divinity is associated with nature, the faces of the gods are also associated with different animals that have the same attributes as the gods do. So, for example, Anubis, God of embalming and travel, is associated with canines because they run through the deserts, they don't lose their way, and you find them around graveyards. You also have, you know, for example, the goddess Bastet is a cat, and she is goddess of beauty and self-indulgence, which, I think, I don't need to explain when you're talking about cats. RATH: (Laughter) Have you explored all the catacombs so far, or do you think there's more still to discover? IKRAM: We have been into as many of the tunnels as we could, because some of them are very dangerous. But this means that for future generations, there will be things to explore and discoveries to be made. RATH: Salima Ikram is a professor of Egyptology at the American University in Cairo. Salima, thanks very much. IKRAM: Thank you very much. ARUN RATH, HOST:  Mummies. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RATH: If just one lumbering, bandaged monster can instill such terror in Abbott and Costello and Brendan Fraser, imagine being surrounded by 8 million mummies. That's the situation Salima Ikram found herself in, but she couldn't have been happier. She's an Egyptologist with the American University In Cairo and says these mummies are especially exciting because they're dogs - 8 millions dogs, mummified to honor Anubis, the jackal-headed god of the afterlife. Ikram says the discovery of the dogs has opened a new perspective on ancient Egyptians and their religion. SALIMA IKRAM: Each mummy would be sort of a symbol of something a pilgrim had given as a gift to the God. So nowadays, people go to a church and light a candle, but the Egyptians were in for the long haul. So instead of a candle, they would offer a mummy. So clearly this means that there were a lot of very religious people out there who were asking Anubis for intercession and for help for a variety of things. RATH: So tell us about these catacombs. Being in this tiny, dark space around mummies is something that would terrify a lot of people. It sounds like you are having a ball. IKRAM: Oh, yes, absolutely having a blast. I mean, these were some of the largest catacombs I've been in. But when they're filled with dead things, they're a bit more crowded. RATH: (Laughter) Did - does this change our understanding of ancient Egyptian religion or add to it in some way? IKRAM: Well, it certainly adds to our knowledge of ancient Egyptian religion because, I mean, the mass - the sheer number of these mummies - about 8 million - tells us that, even within 400 years or 500 years, when this catacomb was active, it tells us a bit about the sort of - how animals were viewed, because they were viewed with reverence, but at the same time, they were useful things. And you don't get 8 million mummies without having puppy farms, and some of these dogs were killed deliberately so that they could be offered. So for us, that seems really heartless. But for the Egyptians, they felt that the dogs were going straight up to join the eternal pack with Anubis, and so they were going off to a better thing. RATH: I'm actually a Hindu. Gods with animal heads doesn't seem that strange to me, but it still - it seems like the Egyptian - the ancient Egyptian religious relationship with animals is a different kind of thing. IKRAM: Well, I mean, I actually use Hindu mythology to explain ancient Egyptian religion, as well as the idea of Catholicism with lots and lots of saints. In a way, they're just sort of different facets of the one. So you have this great, powerful entity, but because that's too big for most people to comprehend, there are different aspects of that oneness that are the manifestations of the other gods. And since all the gods and divinity is associated with nature, the faces of the gods are also associated with different animals that have the same attributes as the gods do. So, for example, Anubis, God of embalming and travel, is associated with canines because they run through the deserts, they don't lose their way, and you find them around graveyards. You also have, you know, for example, the goddess Bastet is a cat, and she is goddess of beauty and self-indulgence, which, I think, I don't need to explain when you're talking about cats. RATH: (Laughter) Have you explored all the catacombs so far, or do you think there's more still to discover? IKRAM: We have been into as many of the tunnels as we could, because some of them are very dangerous. But this means that for future generations, there will be things to explore and discoveries to be made. RATH: Salima Ikram is a professor of Egyptology at the American University in Cairo.

(SOUNDBITE OF FIREWORKS)WESTERVELT: Fire in the hole. Tonight, as you oooh and awe to brilliant reds and whites and blues bursting in air, you might wonder about the artistry and chemistry that go into those awesome displays. Harry Gilliam can explain. He's the founder of Skylighter in Round Hill, Va. They supply material for the manufacture of all kinds of pyrotechnics. Harry Gilliam joins us now. Welcome to the program. HARRY GILLIAM: Thanks. WESTERVELT: Mr. Gilliam, first of all, so how do you make all those wonderful colors? What are the building blocks? GILLIAM: The colors stem from different elements, so, for instance, strontium - the element strontium - produces red. And it will always - we don't just use strontium. It comes in a composition; for instance, strontium nitrate. Greens will come from something called barium nitrate. Blue typically comes from copper. And so the different colors are all achievable by elements that we use that are in different chemical compositions that we use in pyrotechnics. WESTERVELT: Mr. Gilliam, is there an exact recipe to this or is there some flexibility and creativity allowed in making these fireworks? GILLIAM: Well, there's both. If you're smart and if you're just starting out, you really ought to use a recipe and it's sort of like cooking. You'd start with a cookbook and you'll have a good recipe. You'll have a list of the ingredients. You'll have an instruction for what the sequence is - what to do first, what to do next - but once you know what you're doing, there's a lot of flexibility. So, for instance, when you and I look at what we call an aerial shell, which is that thing we see up in the air that explodes and throws out those little points of light with different colors, I may have made an aerial shell that had red points of light last week and if I want to do it green this week then I can just substitute one chemical typically and change the color of that. Or I can have the stars, which are those little things we see come out of the shell, I can have those actually change colors. They may come out of the shell as green, but over a period of a few seconds they may change to red and then end in the silver color. So we can do all kinds of things. If we can think it up, we can usually do it. WESTERVELT: Tell us your chef secret. How do those stars change colors? GILLIAM: (Laughter) Well, it happens a couple of ways, but one simple way is we roll stars. We make them round and we do those in layers, just sort of like we roll a snowball up in the front yard for a snowman. WESTERVELT: You also sell the materials to hobbyists who make their own fireworks. It's a little bit alarming. Is that allowed everywhere? GILLIAM: Depending on where you are, it's allowed federally just about everywhere in the country. And inside the set of federal regulations there are a number of clubs in this country where people join these clubs, sort of like we have high-powered rocketry clubs. And people will join those clubs and they can go and make fireworks legally. They can get instruction and learn from people who know how to do it and learn how to be safe and basically keep themselves alive and out of trouble. And then they can shoot those fireworks, typically in a club environment, a lot of times for a whole weekend. These clubs will get together and guys will make fireworks and then have a display at the other end of the weekend. So there are controls on it, and depending on what state you're in, and even what county and city you're in, it's legal. In other places it's not legal, but federally, the U. S. government says yep, you can make your own fireworks if it's for a hobby. WESTERVELT: So what are your plans for tonight? Do you get the night off or no? GILLIAM: No. I've got a fireworks display tonight. We're doing a fundraiser out near Round Hill where I live and probably got about 500 people coming to it and going to have a really pretty display tonight. WESTERVELT: Harry Gilliam - he's a pyrotechnician and founder of Skylighter in Round Hill, Va. Thanks so much and happy Fourth. GILLIAM: Happy Fourth to you, have a good time, stay safe.

And though it's extremely rare, sometimes those sharks do attack humans. But seven shark attacks off the North Carolina coast alone since June has surprised even the most seasoned shark watchers. We reached out to George Burgess, the director of the International Shark Attack File at the Florida Museum of Natural History. Thanks so much for joining us, Mr. Burgess. GEORGE BURGESS: I'm glad to be with you. NEARY: So just for starters, do we know what is causing this increase in shark attacks? BURGESS: We have sort of a perfect storm going there with the - a series of things; some that we know and some that we don't, going on. There's environmental factors, such as an early summer or warm temperatures. And of course, it's sea turtle nesting season; when the sea turtles leave the water to go lay their eggs on the shoreline and coming and going, they're pretty vulnerable to big sharks. Of course, it's summertime, school is out, family vacations - never been more people in the water. Now. . . NEARY: But is - doesn't happen every summer? What's the difference this summer? BURGESS: Precisely, I was going to say, now does that explain the seven we've had in three weeks and the answer is no. There's some other stuff going on here that we don't know about - we'll call it an x-factor - probably oceanographic factors are involved. NEARY: Is there anything in particular that would make a shark attack? BURGESS: All shark attacks are, of course, fundamentally motivated by feeding and probably 90 percent of all shark bites - they're quick grabs and let-go's by small sharks. But a small percentage of those are done by the big boys and girls - the larger sharks that, when they bite - whether it's intentional or unintentional - results in major injuries, and unfortunately, that's what we're seeing the North Carolina. We've had several of these bites that are the real thing. NEARY: I believe I read about one man who sort of punched the shark away from him. I mean, is that an appropriate response? Should you try to do that? BURGESS: Oh, absolutely, yes. There's nothing to be gained by playing dead here. If a shark is actually coming to grab you, if you can give it a pop on its nose, more than likely it will veer off; take advantage of that time, of course, to get out of the water. NEARY: Do you have any concern that these recent attacks will cause more people to hunt sharks - to try and kill sharks? BURGESS: Anytime a community has its first \"Jaws\"-like scare, the first thing that occurs is there's fear in the community; the second, there's denial and then the third is retribution. Let's hope we don't get to the revenge stage. The chance of catching the actual shark that was involved in this are slim to none. NEARY: You know, with all this news, people might have the idea that the waters are infested with sharks, but what is the shark population really like? BURGESS: The shark population in the United States and around the world are at, perhaps, all-time lows. On the other hand, the human population continues to rise every year, and we have no curbing of that. And fundamentally, shark attack that is driven by the number of humans in the water, more than the number of sharks. And when areas such as the Carolinas become popular tourist destinations, as they have, there's more people entering the water. You're going to end up having more shark bites.

It's a ratings bonanza for the Discovery Channel. Last year, more than 40 million people tuned in. Shark Week kicked off this weekend with the most hours of programming ever in its nearly three-decade history. Still, as NPR's Neda Ulaby reports, many scientists think the huge audiences and the hype have come at the expense of real science. NEDA ULABY, BYLINE: A generation of shark scientists cut their teeth on Shark Week. . . JONATHAN DAVIS: I've loved sharks since I was a little kid. ULABY: . . . Including marine biologist Jonathan Davis, who's 29. DAVIS: I've always dreamed of being on Shark Week. It was my ultimate goal when I was a kid. I always watched it, and it was extremely informative when I was younger. ULABY: So imagine Davis's joy when Shark Week producers called him two years ago to make a documentary - they said - about his research on bull sharks in Louisiana's Lake Pontchartrain. As a graduate student at the University of New Orleans, Davis was thrilled when they paid for a day of tracking and tagging sharks. The producers interviewed Davis about his work, and at the end, he says, they casually asked if he'd ever heard of a legendary shark of the bayous called the Rooken. DAVIS: And I said no, of course not. That sounds like a ridiculous fisherman's story. ULABY: You can guess what happened next. (SOUNDBITE OF TV MOVIE, \"VOODOO SHARK\")UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR #2: Could this be the Rooken? ULABY: To his horror, Davis found himself featured on a documentary - I'm air-quoting here - that had little to do with his research. (SOUNDBITE OF TV MOVIE, \"VOODOO SHARK\")UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR #2: A Voodoo shark - few have seen it and lived to tell the tale. ULABY: \"Voodoo Shark\" strongly suggested that Davis believed in the Rooken. (SOUNDBITE OF TV MOVIE, \"VOODOO SHARK\")UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR #2: Jonathan Davis and his team of scientists arrive at their first destination. They believe that if there is a monster shark entering Lake Pontchartrain, it would likely be sticking to this area. DAVIS: There's no way I could've known that they were going to portray it like that. ULABY: \"Voodoo Shark\" shows Davis and his team doing real research - pulling sharks out of the water and tagging them on the deck. Davis says he did not see any unusual sharks. What was unusual was a producer's reaction when they hooked a big one. DAVIS: One of the guys was like, oh, maybe you should just let it just bite you, that would be so exciting. And I was just thinking myself, are you kidding me? You really think I'm going to let this shark bite me just for ratings? Are you serious? ELLEN PRAGER: As a scientist, it drives me insane. ULABY: Ellen Prager is a marine scientist who's taught at the University of Miami. She also writes books about sharks for little kids. She says she and her colleagues have a list of things that drive them crazy about Shark Week. (SOUNDBITE OF UNIDENTIFIED TV SHOW)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: And how do we stay off the menu? UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Get ready to survive a shark feeding frenzy. ULABY: The emphasis on sharks attacking people and feeding frenzies. PRAGER: That's not typically what you see in nature. And in fact, some of the shark researchers I know have hardly ever even seen sharks feeding in the wild. ULABY: Then there's the frenzy of factual errors. David Shiffman studies sharks at the University of Miami. He's spent the past few years calling out Shark Week in public. DAVID SHIFFMAN: Shark Week, two years ago, did not appreciate when I recommended an 8-year-old neighbor to fact-check the scripts for them because that 8-year-old knew more about sharks than whoever was writing those scripts did. ULABY: All these scientists agree that Shark Week hit bottom two years ago with an infamous fictionalized documentary. (SOUNDBITE OF TV MOVIE, \"MEGALODON: THE MONSTER SHARK LIVES\")UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR #3: Megalodon, the serial killer of the seas, was a vicious 100-foot, 80-ton shark. ULABY: Megalodon also happens to be extinct, and has been for more than a million years. But Discovery resurrected Megalodon with made-up stories of sightings and attacks. The narrator even threw in some exciting Nazi connections. (SOUNDBITE OF TV MOVIE, \"MEGALODON: THE MONSTER SHARK LIVES\")UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: If the shark that's in the Nazi U-boat photo is in fact the same shark that's in the shark iPhoto that was taken just after the boat attack, then that means there's been a 50-ton monster in these waters for over 70 years. ULABY: \"Megalodon: The Monster Shark Lives\" was the highest-rated program in Shark Week history. Even though the network ran a disclaimer saying it was fake, experts like David Schiffman were unimpressed. SHIFFMAN: It was presented in such a way that you could very easily watch it and not know it was fictional. ULABY: But Discovery says it's turning over a new leaf - or a new fin - when it comes to Shark Week, says Howard Swartz, who recently took over as head of development and production. HOWARD SWARTZ: This year, we're focusing quite a bit on research and science, more so probably than we have in the past. ULABY: The Discovery Channel has promised no more fake documentaries. SWARTZ: We toyed with a lot of different types of storytelling over the years, and I just think now it's in a forward-looking direction. I think we want to focus more on the research angle. ULABY: But how do you make anything as sexy as a 50-ton Nazi-affiliated shark? Swartz says you go to Cuba, where there are stories about a monster great white roaming the coasts. SWARTZ: Allegedly, a 21-foot, 7,000-pound great white. So the question was, you know, was that the biggest great white ever caught? And if it was, is there something unique to these Cuban waters that these animals are growing so big or attracting animals so big? ULABY: This year, Shark Week sent some of its shows in advance to some critics, including David Schiffman. He says sharks need the Discovery Channel to not demonize them. SHIFFMAN: When I say 1 out of every 4 species of sharks, skates and rays are threatened with extinction, there are some people that say, good, there should be more of them going extinct - sharks are bad, sharks are scary. But they're not. ULABY: Shiffman says sharks are beautiful and wild. He hopes this this year's Shark Week will make them reality stars. Neda Ulaby, NPR News.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Get ready to survive a shark feeding frenzy. ULABY: The emphasis on sharks attacking people and feeding frenzies. PRAGER: That's not typically what you see in nature. And in fact, some of the shark researchers I know have hardly ever even seen sharks feeding in the wild. ULABY: Then there's the frenzy of factual errors. David Shiffman studies sharks at the University of Miami. He's spent the past few years calling out Shark Week in public. DAVID SHIFFMAN: Shark Week, two years ago, did not appreciate when I recommended an 8-year-old neighbor to fact-check the scripts for them because that 8-year-old knew more about sharks than whoever was writing those scripts did. ULABY: All these scientists agree that Shark Week hit bottom two years ago with an infamous fictionalized documentary. (SOUNDBITE OF TV MOVIE, \"MEGALODON: THE MONSTER SHARK LIVES\") UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR #3: Megalodon, the serial killer of the seas, was a vicious 100-foot, 80-ton shark. ULABY: Megalodon also happens to be extinct, and has been for more than a million years. But Discovery resurrected Megalodon with made-up stories of sightings and attacks. The narrator even threw in some exciting Nazi connections. (SOUNDBITE OF TV MOVIE, \"MEGALODON: THE MONSTER SHARK LIVES\") UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: If the shark that's in the Nazi U-boat photo is in fact the same shark that's in the shark iPhoto that was taken just after the boat attack, then that means there's been a 50-ton monster in these waters for over 70 years. ULABY: \"Megalodon: The Monster Shark Lives\" was the highest-rated program in Shark Week history. Even though the network ran a disclaimer saying it was fake, experts like David Schiffman were unimpressed. SHIFFMAN: It was presented in such a way that you could very easily watch it and not know it was fictional. ULABY: But Discovery says it's turning over a new leaf - or a new fin - when it comes to Shark Week, says Howard Swartz, who recently took over as head of development and production. HOWARD SWARTZ: This year, we're focusing quite a bit on research and science, more so probably than we have in the past. ULABY: The Discovery Channel has promised no more fake documentaries. SWARTZ: We toyed with a lot of different types of storytelling over the years, and I just think now it's in a forward-looking direction. I think we want to focus more on the research angle. ULABY: But how do you make anything as sexy as a 50-ton Nazi-affiliated shark? Swartz says you go to Cuba, where there are stories about a monster great white roaming the coasts. SWARTZ: Allegedly, a 21-foot, 7,000-pound great white. So the question was, you know, was that the biggest great white ever caught? And if it was, is there something unique to these Cuban waters that these animals are growing so big or attracting animals so big? ULABY: This year, Shark Week sent some of its shows in advance to some critics, including David Schiffman. He says sharks need the Discovery Channel to not demonize them. SHIFFMAN: When I say 1 out of every 4 species of sharks, skates and rays are threatened with extinction, there are some people that say, good, there should be more of them going extinct - sharks are bad, sharks are scary. But they're not. ULABY: Shiffman says sharks are beautiful and wild. He hopes this this year's Shark Week will make them reality stars.

But Triceratops is not the only horned dinosaur or even the most interesting one.

NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Triceratops was discovered over a century ago and has long reigned as the quintessential horned dinosaur. DAVID EVANS: Yeah. I remember when I was a kid, Triceratops certainly loomed large in our household. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That's paleontologist David Evans of the Royal Ontario Museum. He says Triceratops was his sister's favorite. He preferred T. rex. EVANS: So we kind of had the classic argument about which one was better when I was maybe 5 years old. GREENFIELDBOYCE: These days, he works with Michael Ryan of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. Together, these guys have just announced the discovery of a new horned dinosaur. They named it Wendiceratops after the fossil hunter who found it in Canada, Wendy Sloboda. Wendiceratops lived about 79 million years ago, so it's one of the oldest-known horned dinosaurs. EVANS: It was about 20 feet long and weighed between one and two tons. That's about the size of a big hippo. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Evans says its distinctive feature is a highly decorated frill around its neck.

It's the earliest occurrence of a prominent nose horn.

And then there are the slackers - that's right, there are lazy ants down there. Dr. Anna Dornhaus is an associate professor at the University of Arizona, and she's involved in a new report identifying idle ants. It was just published in the journal Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, and she joins us now. Welcome to the program. ANNA DORNHAUS: Thank you very much. SIEGEL: Who are these slackers and what are they not doing? DORNHAUS: Well, it actually turns out they're the majority of the ants. This is something that we have been describing previously very informally, but now we've really nailed it down and showed that most of the work is done by a very small fraction of the ants in the colony. So a large number of ants actually don't seem to participate in all that work that you were describing. SIEGEL: They're just hanging around, or giving moral support? What are they doing? DORNHAUS: (Laughter). Yes, we think that they are not lazy for some kind of selfish reason that they want to slack off or just relax and watch TV, but they are really not doing anything at all. They're just standing there motionless. And our new idea is that we think that that inactivity actually plays a crucial role in the organization of the colony as a whole. SIEGEL: How is that? How would the inactivity of the majority of ants play such a vital role? DORNHAUS: Well, there are probably are multiple explanations, but what I find particularly interesting is that we have shown that in order to make sure that the right number of workers are allocated to all the particular jobs that have to be done, it's beneficial if the colony has some excess workers - essentially, extra workers, more than the number that they need to get the work completed because it just makes that process run more smoothly - of actually figuring out who has to do what. SIEGEL: So you have discovered the theory of surplus ant labor, is what you have found. DORNHAUS: Yes, indeed. It's also possible that they are, in part, storing food. So these ants that are just standing around may actually have full stomachs, and not just for themselves, but they regurgitate food to other ants when they need it. But we think that the main explanation has to do with this structure of how the colony's organized. SIEGEL: And are these ants - who you assume would be - inactive throughout their entire lives, or have you discovered retired ants in these colonies who used to do something else? DORNHAUS: These particular ants that we're studying, they actually live for a few years, so we have an ongoing study trying to find retired ants (laughter), which is quite possible that some of them are senescing and therefore not able to work as much as the other ants. SIEGEL: I read a description of what you did here, and this involved actually painting - with very small dots I assume - painting the ants to track their behavior over several days. DORNHAUS: Yes, indeed. And that is one of the major activities that my students are doing over the summer, so we take these individual ants, which are about three millimeters long - that's about the size of a capital I on your printed page - we briefly anesthetize them, and then under a microscope with a very thin wire, we paint each individual ant with an individual specific color code so we can recognize them. SIEGEL: Are these graduate students, by the way, or are they undergraduates who are painting the ants? DORNHAUS: Both, and actually even post-docs and sometimes high school students.

This is making the animal world happy, particularly insects. Take the tarantula hawk wasp for example. What - you've never heard of it? Well, it's so big and so nasty that it attacks tarantulas, who are, as you know, themselves big and nasty. Texas Parks and Wildlife invertebrate biologist Ben Hutchins joins me now from Austin to tell us about this wasp. Hi, Ben. BEN HUTCHINS: Hi. GOODWYN: OK, so I've been doing a little research and the tarantula hawk can wrestle and then throw these big, hairy Texas tarantulas onto their backs and then sting them into submission. How in the world is this possible? HUTCHINS: Well, it's a pretty spectacular show. And, you know, we actually have several different species of tarantula hawk, and each one has its own different approach. So some will actually flip over onto their back and crawl upside down underneath of the tarantula to sting the tarantulas. Others will dart under there and grab the rear leg of the tarantula and then flip it over. And the tarantula hawk will actually use its back legs to pin down the tarantula's fangs to keep itself from getting bit. And then it delivers that sting, usually at a chink in the armor of the tarantula, so at joints in the legs or in the abdomen of the tarantula. And they can sting multiple times as well, so they'll get in there and make sure that that tarantula is paralyzed. GOODWYN: So after the wasp sneaks under, it stings the tarantula. Then what does the wasp do? HUTCHINS: Paralysis sets in almost instantaneously. In a second or two the tarantula is completely incapacitated, but still alive. And the tarantula hawk will then drag that tarantula to a burrow. So this could be the tarantula's own burrow. It could be a burrow that the tarantula hawk has dug itself. And it'll drag the tarantula down in there and place the tarantula upside down and it'll lay a single egg on the body of the tarantula. In a few days, that egg will hatch and the larvae will begin to feed on the living tarantula. GOODWYN: And the spider is still paralyzed. HUTCHINS: That's right. So interestingly enough, if the egg doesn't hatch, the tarantula can actually recover and go on its way. But more often that larvae will hatch and eat its way into the living but still paralyzed tarantula, and it'll feed on that tarantula for several weeks. And at least some species will selectively feed on non-vital organs first to keep the tarantula alive longer. GOODWYN: What would happen to me if I stepped on this wasp? HUTCHINS: The tarantula hawk is a bit infamous in that it has one of the more painful stings known to man. There are actually a number of sting pain indices and in all of these indices the tarantula hawk ranks right up top in that the pain associated with this sting has been described as traumatic, debilitating, instantly excruciating, so it's bad. You don't want to step on these guys. GOODWYN: Have you ever seen one of these wrestling matches? Are the wasps easily found and seen? HUTCHINS: Unfortunately, I've never seen the show. I can't wait, though. The day that I see a tarantula hawk come in contact with a tarantula I'm going to sit back and enjoy this dance. But you can see the tarantula hawks. They're actually quite common and quite conspicuous on the landscape, particularly throughout the southwest and indeed all the way from California to Virginia. GOODWYN: Do tarantula wasps have interest in humans? HUTCHINS: They do not. So as long as you're not explicitly harassing this animal, as long as you're not trying to step on it or grab it, it's going to leave you alone. And, in fact, you can walk right up to them and watch them as they forage and hunt for tarantulas. GOODWYN: Ben Hutchins - invertebrate biologist for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.

S. News and World Report, students are showing more interest in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math. DAVID GREENE, HOST: Black students in particular are making big gains earning advanced degrees. Women are also keeping pace, although large ethnic and gender gaps remain. MONTAGNE: We wanted to know more about the diverse men and women who are already working in American tech and science - the pioneers. And this past spring, for our series #RaceOnTech, we issued a social media callout to link up with them. Nearly 200 people came our way, and we picked 14 of them to feature. NPR's Michel Martin learns more about one. MICHEL MARTIN, BYLINE: Today we meet biologist Mamie Parker, a fish and wildlife specialist sent our way from member station WEAA in Baltimore. Welcome, Dr. Parker, thanks so much for joining us. MAMIE PARKER: Thank you so much for having me. MARTIN: Now, you know I want to know how you got into this field. Did you grow up in a rural area? Were you always fascinated by wildlife? PARKER: I have to say that I was. My mother was an avid angler, sharecropper, had 11 children - I'm number 11. The rest of the boys and girls did not want to be outdoors, but she wanted a companion and taught me life lessons out there. She passed away when I was fairly young, and I decided to do this in her honor. MARTIN: Well, how did you figure out how to make a career out of this interest of yours? PARKER: Well, that is really interesting because I did not see anyone that looked like me doing this type of work. But when I was in ninth grade, I heard the song by Marvin Gaye \"Mercy, Mercy Me\" things are like they used to be, and he talked about the pollution in the air and the wind that was blowing poison and the radiation and all of that. And so it was at that point when I decided, you know, I want to see what I can do about this. So I found out about U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service from a recruiter. Hannibal Bolton was his name and he was looking for interns. But he wanted me to leave Arkansas and head off to Wisconsin. And that was quite frightening for a Southern girl like myself that had hardly been north of Little Rock. But what he said made a lot of sense - you can get paid to do what you like to do best (laughter). Before I knew it, I had 20 years of service doing a lot in the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. MARTIN: What's your specific expertise? I understand that you have a doctorate in ecology. What do you do? PARKER: Well, what do I do (laughter)? Well, I am a generalist. I work mostly on environmental impacts. So if they're building a bridge or a highway in an area where they're going to cross a river or a stream then I have a job to say, well, it'd be better if you placed it here, there or it would be better if you didn't do this at all, but if you were going to do it, here are some of the things that you can do to mitigate the impacts to the resources. MARTIN: I just wanted to go back to something you said earlier that it was unusual to see somebody like you in that field. Do you mean as a woman or do you mean as an African-American or most especially as an African-American woman? PARKER: Quite frankly, it was both. I remember my first job here in the D. C. area and the janitors in the building, they just kept coming and peeking in and I thought, what are they looking at (laughter)? And finally I saw one in the bathroom and she said I've been here for almost 40 years and she said no African-American woman has been in here except to clean this office. And for her, it was a proud moment. MARTIN: Can I ask how that made you feel? PARKER: Well, I think that it made me feel somewhat motivated to make sure that doesn't happen again where they will be able to see others. So I was inspired, but it is also a sad feeling because you mention pioneers. Michel, pioneers are very lonesome people. As you know, and you've heard people say, to whom much is given much is expected. So I saw it, too, as a responsibility to try to do well and be well in that role. MARTIN: Well, you've also been recognized for your leadership in protecting our waters from invasive species. Has your distinctive profile within this field been a help or a hindrance to you when you're really honest with yourself? PARKER: If I had to really think hard about it, it's been a help to me because of being unique and different in the field. On the other hand, I think the standards for women and minorities are still very high. And therefore, I feel like I have to work really, really harder than most to be successful in this field. And not just me, but most women in. . . MARTIN: Well, why is that though? Because people thought you couldn't take the rigors of fieldwork, or what was the hurdle you were fighting to get over? PARKER: I had many of them. First of all, you're right. Men didn't assume that we could get out there and work the boats and get out in the water. They didn't think we could work by ourselves out in the woods. They thought we'd be afraid of things like that. Not all men, I want to make it clear, but many did. I also was a Southerner going to the north, had a strong accent in their minds, so dealing with the actual stereotypes of different people from different parts of the country was even a challenge for me. And then the biggest challenge is not having family or friends in many of those places because I was pretty isolated. MARTIN: So bringing it to the present moment, there's been a lot of new attention to the whole question of diversity within the STEM workforce - and once again, that's science, technology, engineering and math. Given your long history in this field, what are your thoughts about that? PARKER: I think people from community of color really suffer a lot, again, from isolation, from feeling the need to prove themselves. And over time, it becomes very difficult to continue to work at a pace like that, and you have to really believe that the benefits outweigh the costs. And then also mentors are so important - having the right individual there for you when you think about quitting or you want to cry. And a lot of times I had to cry on the shoulders of those janitors in that building. You know, they were the ones that were there for me, telling me to get up and get back in the race again, you know? So there are people out there that can help children and adults now in the field. MARTIN: Mamie Parker holds a doctorate in ecology. She is now retired. She's a former assistant director at the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and she joined us here in Washington, D. C. Dr. Parker, thanks so much for speaking with us. PARKER: Thank you for having me. MARTIN: You can also share your stories and follow the digital footprint of Native American, Latino, Asian and African-Americans on the cutting edge of innovation using the hashtag #RaceOnTech. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  According to a recent study by U. S. News and World Report, students are showing more interest in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  Black students in particular are making big gains earning advanced degrees. Women are also keeping pace, although large ethnic and gender gaps remain. MONTAGNE: We wanted to know more about the diverse men and women who are already working in American tech and science - the pioneers. And this past spring, for our series #RaceOnTech, we issued a social media callout to link up with them. Nearly 200 people came our way, and we picked 14 of them to feature. NPR's Michel Martin learns more about one. MICHEL MARTIN, BYLINE: Today we meet biologist Mamie Parker, a fish and wildlife specialist sent our way from member station WEAA in Baltimore. Welcome, Dr. Parker, thanks so much for joining us. MAMIE PARKER: Thank you so much for having me. MARTIN: Now, you know I want to know how you got into this field. Did you grow up in a rural area? Were you always fascinated by wildlife? PARKER: I have to say that I was. My mother was an avid angler, sharecropper, had 11 children - I'm number 11. The rest of the boys and girls did not want to be outdoors, but she wanted a companion and taught me life lessons out there. She passed away when I was fairly young, and I decided to do this in her honor. MARTIN: Well, how did you figure out how to make a career out of this interest of yours? PARKER: Well, that is really interesting because I did not see anyone that looked like me doing this type of work. But when I was in ninth grade, I heard the song by Marvin Gaye \"Mercy, Mercy Me\" things are like they used to be, and he talked about the pollution in the air and the wind that was blowing poison and the radiation and all of that. And so it was at that point when I decided, you know, I want to see what I can do about this. So I found out about U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service from a recruiter. Hannibal Bolton was his name and he was looking for interns. But he wanted me to leave Arkansas and head off to Wisconsin. And that was quite frightening for a Southern girl like myself that had hardly been north of Little Rock. But what he said made a lot of sense - you can get paid to do what you like to do best (laughter). Before I knew it, I had 20 years of service doing a lot in the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. MARTIN: What's your specific expertise? I understand that you have a doctorate in ecology. What do you do? PARKER: Well, what do I do (laughter)? Well, I am a generalist. I work mostly on environmental impacts. So if they're building a bridge or a highway in an area where they're going to cross a river or a stream then I have a job to say, well, it'd be better if you placed it here, there or it would be better if you didn't do this at all, but if you were going to do it, here are some of the things that you can do to mitigate the impacts to the resources. MARTIN: I just wanted to go back to something you said earlier that it was unusual to see somebody like you in that field. Do you mean as a woman or do you mean as an African-American or most especially as an African-American woman? PARKER: Quite frankly, it was both. I remember my first job here in the D. C. area and the janitors in the building, they just kept coming and peeking in and I thought, what are they looking at (laughter)? And finally I saw one in the bathroom and she said I've been here for almost 40 years and she said no African-American woman has been in here except to clean this office. And for her, it was a proud moment. MARTIN: Can I ask how that made you feel? PARKER: Well, I think that it made me feel somewhat motivated to make sure that doesn't happen again where they will be able to see others. So I was inspired, but it is also a sad feeling because you mention pioneers. Michel, pioneers are very lonesome people. As you know, and you've heard people say, to whom much is given much is expected. So I saw it, too, as a responsibility to try to do well and be well in that role. MARTIN: Well, you've also been recognized for your leadership in protecting our waters from invasive species. Has your distinctive profile within this field been a help or a hindrance to you when you're really honest with yourself? PARKER: If I had to really think hard about it, it's been a help to me because of being unique and different in the field. On the other hand, I think the standards for women and minorities are still very high. And therefore, I feel like I have to work really, really harder than most to be successful in this field. And not just me, but most women in. . . MARTIN: Well, why is that though? Because people thought you couldn't take the rigors of fieldwork, or what was the hurdle you were fighting to get over?

Sometimes our eyes just get drawn to that first thing on a list. Maybe it's the top special on the menu or the first movie on the marquee. It might not be rational, but the order of things on a list can really affect how we choose things, even, it turns out, for a group of people who we'd like to think are some of the most rational people in the world - economists. And if this sounds like a setup to bring in social science correspondent, Shankar Vedantam, it is. Hi, Shankar. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: (Laughter) Hi, David. GREENE: So what is being studied here? VEDANTAM: Well, I'm not sure it actually set out to study the rationality of economists, David, but this new research ended up doing just that. Here's the background you need to know. There's a very important organization known as the National Bureau of Economic Research. And what it does, the bureau collects all the top economic research that's been done recently and sends out an email, and basically it says you should know about all this important stuff that's happened recently. I spoke to Ina Ganguli at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, and she told me this weekly email was extremely influential. INA GANGULI: What's neat is that it actually goes out - this email - to quite a few individuals. It goes out to over 23,000 subscribers. And it's actually a mix of both academic economists, but other - you know, students, people in - you know, government, policymakers. So it's - you know, it's the range of people who are receiving this email every Monday morning at 10 a. m. GREENE: This is like one of the news roundups that journalists might get except the headlines are actually from academic economic research papers. VEDANTAM: That's exactly right. Now, here's the thing to remember, David. The studies and papers that are listed in this email are not listed in order of importance, so the order is random. Now, each study title comes with a link, so you have to click on the link. And then it opens up a short abstract, a little summary of the paper. And then you have to click on the abstract in order to open up the full article. Ganguli and her colleagues, Daniel Feenberg, Patrick Gaule and Jonathan Gruber, analyzed how often subscribers click on these links, and what they found is that the order of the articles matters enormously. So just by chance if your study happened to be the first one listed - boom - you get clicked on a lot, you get downloaded a lot, you get a lot of attention. GREENE: Why did I have this image of economists being the type of people who would actually read down and sort of look at sort of studies that would interest them the most instead of just grabbing the first one? VEDANTAM: Yeah. Now, in fairness, David, you know, we've known this happens a lot with a lot of other people. It turns out this affects economists as well. This is sometimes called a primacy effect - the item at the top of the list gets a lot more attention than the fifth or sixth thing. But here's the thing. This isn't like what you and I do every day during our day jobs, David, where we look at the first cat video rather than the fifth cat video. GREENE: Speak for yourself, Shankar. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: So the many subscribers on this list are professional economists. And here's the important thing - when they find articles that they like, they cite these articles in their own work, and this has big ramifications. We often judge the quality of researchers by seeing how often they get cited. The citations rate, in other words, as a measure of the quality of the work. And if you get cited a lot, you get important positions, you get tenure, you might be invited to sit at the table to make important policy decisions. And what Ganguli and her colleagues find is that professional economists are citing the first article in this list far more than other articles. Here she is again. GANGULI: The most striking, I think, the most, you know, biggest contribution of our paper, I think, in a sense, is that we see a 27 percent increase in citations. And so what this means is that people are then subsequently citing this research more in their own work because this paper was listed first. So the ordering is leading to these almost 30 percent increases in the attention that people are giving to these papers. GREENE: And I imagine these papers, it doesn't just mean, you know, economists who write them getting tenure and things like that. I mean, it could almost drive the conversation about what's important in the national or global economy at that moment. VEDANTAM: I think that's right, David. And I think this work in general vindicates sort of the insight of behavioral economists, who have always argued that human nature and human psychology play a very important role in how we make decisions, even decisions that we think of as rational. So speaking for myself, I am going to pay much more attention to that fifth cat video because it actually might be a much better cat video than the first one. GREENE: Shankar, you're always at the top of our list. VEDANTAM: Thank you, David.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today - finite ideas about the resources we use and how to make the most of what's left. JON FOLEY: I mean, think about the great American story, right? A bunch of white guys from Europe show up on the East Coast and think the land is theirs, and they just plow across the continent and use more and more and more. Just go west, young man, and there'll be more resources. But. . . RAZ: But, says Jon Foley. . . FOLEY: . . . Well, we hit the Pacific and we had to stop (laughter), you know? And there isn't any more. We've run out. We have run out of planet, in fact. RAZ: Jon Foley is an ecologist who runs the California Academy of Sciences. FOLEY: And one thing that I talk about a lot with folks is that, you know, think about the last 50 years. In the last 50 years, the human population more than doubled. Our use of food and water more than tripled and our use of fossil fuels more than quadrupled in just 50 years. RAZ: Wow. FOLEY: That means - yeah, isn't that crazy? RAZ: Yeah, crazy. FOLEY: That means that, in a single lifetime, the world has changed more than all of human history combined. RAZ: Wow. But one change, Jon says, beats all the others. FOLEY: Agriculture's probably the biggest thing we've ever done to the planet. RAZ: And the one thing that makes agriculture possible - water. FOLEY: It turns out 70 percent or 90 percent, depending how you do the bookkeeping, of all the water consumed by people around the world is used for one thing - irrigating crops. RAZ: Jon Foley says that water and food are connected in a way that is just not sustainable. So think about California, for example. FOLEY: Water problems in California are, in the first order, a food problem. The biggest consumer of water in California right now is alfalfa. Alfalfa alone is using more water than all of the humans in California combined, and most of it's being shipped overseas to use as dairy food, you know, for cows in the Middle East or in China. So we're exporting California water to the Middle East or China to make milk somewhere else. And so we've underpriced water, we've over exploited it. We don't actually regulate how people pump groundwater out of the ground, you can do that as much as you like. We just use too much. RAZ: In fact, Jon argues that agriculture is the most powerful force unleashed on the planet since the end of the Ice Age. And even though it's using up a lot of our land and a ton of our water, he's not saying we should stop growing food, but that we have to be smarter about the way we grow it. Here's John on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FOLEY: This is a photograph flying into Arizona, and when you look at it, you're like, what are they growing here? It turns out they're growing lettuce in the middle of the desert, using water sprayed on top. But what's really interesting is this water's got to come from someplace, and it comes from here - the Colorado River, irrigating the desert for food or maybe golf courses in Scottsdale, you take your pick. Well, this is a lot of water, and again, we're mining water and using it to grow food. We've literally consumed an entire river for irrigation. And if anything, we're going to have the demands on agriculture increase into the future. It's not going to go away. It's going to get a lot bigger, mainly because of growing population. We're 7 billion people today, heading towards at least nine. More importantly, changing diets - as the world becomes wealthier as well as more populous, we're seeing increases in dietary consumption of meat, which take a lot more resources than a vegetarian diet does, so more people eating more stuff and richer stuff. And of course, we have to replace oil with other energy sources that will ultimately have to include some kinds of biofuels and bioenergy sources. So you put these together, it's really hard to see how we're going to get to the rest of the century without at least doubling global agricultural production. RAZ: But if we keep doing that, I mean, we're going to have to start, like, rationing water all around the world - like, how much people use of it and maybe drink and how people grow food and how much of it they get. FOLEY: Like a \"Mad Max\" movie, essentially (laughter). RAZ: Yeah, like a \"Mad Max\" movie, right? Like \"Mad Max. \" Here's my question - is that where we're headed? Like, if we do nothing, is that where we're going? And can we - you know, do you think that we'll be able to kind of make that not happen? FOLEY: You know, it's kind of funny, given the business that I'm in, but I'm actually an optimist. I guess I - maybe it's not optimism, but I have hope. Hope's different than optimism. RAZ: Yeah. FOLEY: And my hope is that we can change that narrative, that humans at their best, when they're pushed into a corner and really see a problem, actually respond magnificently. And technology can help. I'm a big fan of drip irrigation. I'm a big fan of organic farming methods that tend to hold more moisture in the soil, getting rid of lawns, getting rid of things that kind of waste water really conspicuously. Let's tighten up our infrastructure. Let's cover canals so they don't evaporate. Let's get the pipes' leaks fixed. And there are lots and lots of things like that we can do. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FOLEY: Now, when I talk about this, people often tell me, well, isn't blank the answer - organic food, local food, GMOs, new trade subsidies, new farm bills? And, yeah, we have a lot of good ideas here, but not any one of these is a silver bullet. In fact, what I think they are is more like silver buckshot, and I love silver buckshot. You put it together, and you've got something really powerful. But we need to put them together. So what we have to do, I think, is invent a new kind of agriculture that blends the best ideas of commercial agriculture and the green revolution with the best ideas of organic farming and local food and the best ideas of environmental conservation, not to have them fighting each other, but for to have them collaborating together. RAZ: But this is hard, right - I mean, to get people to focus on a problem that's - that's, like, not in their face, it doesn't seem so urgent. FOLEY: Well, I think a lot of folks would argue that, you know, we're fighting millions of years of evolution as Homo sapiens and thousands of years of history as civilized humans, that it tells us that we should be out there exploiting resources so we could survive to the next day. RAZ: Yeah. FOLEY: But if it meant using a little more soil or a little more land or grabbing a few extra animals to eat, that was our job. I mean, we went from - all of human history, we were basically insignificant compared to the size of the earth. And now, suddenly, in one generation or so, we've flipped it around. Now, humans are bigger than the earth. Our appetite for resources is bigger than what the earth can actually provide. That's never happened before, so we're trying to get as smart as possible, in a generation or two, to undo millions of years of our evolution and thousands of years of history. That's really hard. RAZ: Yeah. FOLEY: But we're getting smarter, just as we're also getting dumber (laughter) about the planet. And I'd like to tip the scales to see how we can make the smarter win out. RAZ: That's Jon Foley. He's an ecologist and the executive director of the California Academy of Sciences. You can see his entire talk at ted. npr. org.

And of course, we have to replace oil with other energy sources that will ultimately have to include some kinds of biofuels and bioenergy sources. So you put these together, it's really hard to see how we're going to get to the rest of the century without at least doubling global agricultural production. RAZ: But if we keep doing that, I mean, we're going to have to start, like, rationing water all around the world - like, how much people use of it and maybe drink and how people grow food and how much of it they get. FOLEY: Like a \"Mad Max\" movie, essentially (laughter). RAZ: Yeah, like a \"Mad Max\" movie, right? Like \"Mad Max. \" Here's my question - is that where we're headed? Like, if we do nothing, is that where we're going? And can we - you know, do you think that we'll be able to kind of make that not happen? FOLEY: You know, it's kind of funny, given the business that I'm in, but I'm actually an optimist. I guess I - maybe it's not optimism, but I have hope. Hope's different than optimism. RAZ: Yeah. FOLEY: And my hope is that we can change that narrative, that humans at their best, when they're pushed into a corner and really see a problem, actually respond magnificently. And technology can help. I'm a big fan of drip irrigation. I'm a big fan of organic farming methods that tend to hold more moisture in the soil, getting rid of lawns, getting rid of things that kind of waste water really conspicuously. Let's tighten up our infrastructure. Let's cover canals so they don't evaporate. Let's get the pipes' leaks fixed. And there are lots and lots of things like that we can do. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) FOLEY: Now, when I talk about this, people often tell me, well, isn't blank the answer - organic food, local food, GMOs, new trade subsidies, new farm bills? And, yeah, we have a lot of good ideas here, but not any one of these is a silver bullet. In fact, what I think they are is more like silver buckshot, and I love silver buckshot. You put it together, and you've got something really powerful. But we need to put them together. So what we have to do, I think, is invent a new kind of agriculture that blends the best ideas of commercial agriculture and the green revolution with the best ideas of organic farming and local food and the best ideas of environmental conservation, not to have them fighting each other, but for to have them collaborating together. RAZ: But this is hard, right - I mean, to get people to focus on a problem that's - that's, like, not in their face, it doesn't seem so urgent. FOLEY: Well, I think a lot of folks would argue that, you know, we're fighting millions of years of evolution as Homo sapiens and thousands of years of history as civilized humans, that it tells us that we should be out there exploiting resources so we could survive to the next day. RAZ: Yeah. FOLEY: But if it meant using a little more soil or a little more land or grabbing a few extra animals to eat, that was our job. I mean, we went from - all of human history, we were basically insignificant compared to the size of the earth. And now, suddenly, in one generation or so, we've flipped it around. Now, humans are bigger than the earth. Our appetite for resources is bigger than what the earth can actually provide. That's never happened before, so we're trying to get as smart as possible, in a generation or two, to undo millions of years of our evolution and thousands of years of history. That's really hard. RAZ: Yeah. FOLEY: But we're getting smarter, just as we're also getting dumber (laughter) about the planet. And I'd like to tip the scales to see how we can make the smarter win out. RAZ: That's Jon Foley. He's an ecologist and the executive director of the California Academy of Sciences.

I'm Guy Raz. So like a lot of people, back in the late '70s, Mark Plotkin had a really bad trip. MARK PLOTKIN: The worst experience of my life was taking ayahuasca with a shaman from the Colombian Amazon, and in that, I witnessed my death. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Mark Plotkin is an ethnobotanist, which means he studies plants, specifically plants that grow in the Amazon. And because he's interested in the medicinal power of those plants to heal, Mark will spend a lot of time communing with the native tribes who use those plants to brew things like a tea called ayahuasca. PLOTKIN: Well, we would describe it as a hallucinogen, a term the Indians don't like. They call it remedio - a medicine. It's the original medicine, the most important medicine. RAZ: A medicine used to welcome guests, a medicine only the rudest guest would refuse and a medicine that Mark was offered that day in the Colombian Amazon. PLOTKIN: And I drank the first cup, and I felt pretty good. And then, a couple hours later, they will either say to you, you should drink another cup, or, do you want another cup, or, don't drink another cup. And I recalled he offered it to me or I asked for it, and I took it, and it just went downhill from there. RAZ: Like, right away? PLOTKIN: Yeah, right away. RAZ: What do you remember? PLOTKIN: Just crying and screaming and wishing I was dead. RAZ: What did you feel like? PLOTKIN: I was in my misery and I wanted to be put out of it. It was terrible. RAZ: You were in pain - nausea? I mean. . . PLOTKIN: All of that. RAZ: So how did you experience death? PLOTKIN: I saw myself die and dead, but painful and horrible and terrible. It wasn't like I just floated to the top of the room and there I was. It was awful. And then it got worse. I ended up vomiting purple, phosphorescent scorpions. RAZ: Mark is not speaking literally. PLOTKIN: And, you know, the shamans say, when you take ayahuasca, you get out of it what you need to. And so afterwards, I said to the shaman, why did you do that to me? And he said, the fate of my culture, the fate of my forest is joined with that of you and your organization. I wanted you to experience death so you would never fear it again. And the point here is not that shamans have all the answers, ayahuasca has all the answers - they don't, and it doesn't. The fact is that some of these systems of healing, some of these magic plants can do things that we cannot. RAZ: So you've probably heard this before, that the Amazon is the most biodiverse place on Earth, full of natural resources with potentially life-saving medical applications. But it's most valuable resource is, quite possibly, knowledge - the secrets that only native tribes know about. Knowledge that Mark Plotkin described from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PLOTKIN: Four years ago, I injured my foot in a climbing accident, and I went to the doctor. She gave me heat, cold, aspirin, narcotic painkillers, anti-inflammatories, cortisone shots. Didn't work. Several months later, I was in the northeast Amazon, walked into a village, and the shaman said, you're limping. And I'll never forget this as long as I live. He looked me in the face and he said, take off your shoe and give me your machete. (LAUGHTER)PLOTKIN: He walked over to a palm tree and carved off a fern, threw it in the fire, applied it to my foot, threw it in a pot of water and had me drink the tea. The pain disappeared for seven months. When it came back, I went to see the shaman again. He gave me the same treatment and I've been cured for three years now. Who would you rather be treated by (laughter)? (APPLAUSE)PLOTKIN: Now, make no mistake. Western medicine is the most successful system of healing ever devised, but there's a saying in Suriname that I dearly love - the rain forests hold answers to questions we have yet to ask. But as you all know, it's rapidly disappearing here Brazil, in the Amazon, around the world. RAZ: The world is full of finite resources. Some of them we don't tap into like we should, and some we use as if they'll never run out. Our show today, finite ideas about preserving the dwindling resources on the one planet we inhabit and how to make the most of what's left, from water. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: We've underpriced water. We've overexploited it. We don't actually regulate it. We just use too much. RAZ: . . . To oil. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: There are no non-radical solutions left. Such is the extent of the climate crisis that we really need to be doing a lot of really new thinking. RAZ: . . . To things you might not think about as valuable resources. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Just like with oil, it's getting more and more difficult to tap into pools of antibiotic effectiveness. RAZ: . . . And how to use just. . . PLOTKIN: You know. . . RAZ: . . . What we need. PLOTKIN: . . . One of the things that I see in working with and studying indigenous cultures is the concept of the finite and the concept of gratitude. Indians spend a lot of time thanking the gods of the forest, thanking the animals of the forest, not taking more than they need. RAZ: Mark Plotkin has been studying those indigenous cultures in the Amazon since 1977. PLOTKIN: And I've been going many times a year ever since, often extended periods in the good old days when I was a graduate student. RAZ: Mark follows tribesmen through the rainforest, asking about plants and herbs, how they use them, speaking their language. PLOTKIN: The two tribal languages in which I deal are Surnamantomo (ph), which is the predominant trading language in the northeast Amazon, and Trio. RAZ: That second language Mark speaks, Trio, is spoken by just 4,000 people, and most of them live in tribes along the border between Brazil and the country of Suriname. And those tribes generally don't keep records. They don't write down what they know about the local plants. So Mark learned Trio, in part, to help preserve that knowledge that might have otherwise been lost to history, knowledge that could contain secrets to new medicines. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PLOTKIN: My colleague, the late, great Loren McIntyre, discoverer of the source lake of the Amazon, Laguna McIntyre in the Peruvian Andes, was lost on the Peru-Brazil border about 30 years ago. He was rescued by a group of isolated Indians called the Matses. They beckoned for him to follow them into the forest, which he did. There, they took out palm leaf baskets. There, they took out these green monkey frogs, and they began licking them. It turns out they're highly hallucinogenic. McIntyre wrote about this, and it was read by the editor of High Times magazine. You see that ethnobotanists have friends in all sorts of strange cultures. This guy decided he would go down to the Amazon and give it a whirl - or give it a lick, and he did. And he wrote, my blood pressure went through the roof, I lost full control of my bodily functions, I passed out in a heap, I woke up in a hammock six hours, felt like God for two days. (LAUGHTER)PLOTKIN: An Italian chemist read this and said, I'm not really interested in the theological aspects of the green monkey frog. What's this about the change in blood pressure? Now, there's an Italian chemist who's working on a new treatment for high blood pressure based on peptides in the skin of the green monkey frog, and other scientists are looking at a cure for drug-resistant Staph aureus. How ironic if these isolated Indians and their magic frog proved to be one of the cures. RAZ: So years ago, pharmaceutical companies would actively look for potential sources of medicine in places like the Amazon, and from that came. . . PLOTKIN: . . . Novocaine from the coca plant of South America. The first anesthesia was from curare arrow poison alkaloids from the Amazon. Pilocarpine is what they used to put in our eyes at the doctor's office to dilate our pupils. RAZ: But today, because technology has made it so much easier to make drugs from synthetic materials, pharmaceutical companies aren't that interested in trudging through the rain forests to find new ones, which means there could be useful plant and animal species in the rain forest we don't even know about and aren't working to conserve. PLOTKIN: Every species is a genius at something. That's why they survive. It wasn't me who said that, it was Leonardo da Vinci. So doesn't it make sense to save all these pieces? What I also want to add is it's not just about a utilitarian approach to conservation - let's save it because it's a cure for cancer, let's save it because it may help us with global warming - I want to save it because it's there. RAZ: I mean, so if there is all this potential information that we don't know, I mean, could there be tribes out there with that knowledge that we don't even know exist? PLOTKIN: I do believe there are isolated tribes that have had no contact with the outside world, assuming the outside world are guys like you or me, and not maybe the next tribe over that they may have traded with because I've never met a member of a lost tribe who lost. These guys know the forest far better than we do. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PLOTKIN: Uncontacted peoples hold a mystical and iconic role in our imagination. These are the people who truly live in total harmony with nature. Why are these people isolated? They know we exist. They know there's an outside world. This is a form of resistance. They have chosen to remain isolated, and I think it is their human right to remain so, but the world is changing. With the diminishment of the civil war in Columbia, the outside world is showing up. To the north, we have illegal gold mining, also from the east from Brazil. There's increased hunting and fishing for commercial purposes. We see illegal logging coming from the south. And in Peru, there's a very nasty business. It's called human safaris. They will take you in to isolated groups to take their picture. Of course, when you give them clothes, when you give them tools, you also give them diseases. We call these inhuman safaris. Now, remember, these are preliterate societies. The elders are the libraries. Every time a shaman dies, it's as if a library has burned down. RAZ: And Mark says, to preserve that knowledge, information which could someday lead to new medicines, means we almost have to think about that knowledge like a valuable resource that's disappearing fast. PLOTKIN: So better protection of national parks, better protection of indigenous lands, penalties - economic penalties for destroying forests in stupid ways. We know all the answers here, but the human animal, the capitalist system doesn't always do things the right way, the most efficient way, the quickest way. The Greeks and the Romans ran the world for many years, and their empires pooped out for many reasons, one of which is the Greek and the Roman armies ran on wood. Their catapults were made of wood. Their ships were made of wood. Their chariots were made of wood. Their weapons were made of wood. There's no forest left in Italy or Greece. So we consider ourselves, here in the West, as the heir to that great Greco-Roman tradition - logical man, philosophy, thinking, science. Well, they destroyed their environment, and they disappeared. I hope we're not making the same mistake. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PLOTKIN: So the question is, in conclusion, is what the future holds. Let's think differently. Let's make a better world. If the climate's going to change, let's have a climate that changes for the better, rather than for the worse. Let's live on a planet full of luxuriant vegetation, in which isolated peoples can remain in isolation, can maintain that mystery and that knowledge if they so choose. Let's live in a world where the shamans live in these forests and heal themselves and us with their mystical plants and their sacred frogs. Thanks again.

And here's a story about something we don't normally think of as a resource at all. We heard about it from Ramanan Laxminarayan. He's an economist who studies the patterns of disease. And the story begins in late December 1940, in Oxford, England. RAMANAN LAXMINARAYAN: And there's this policeman who shows up at the infirmary in Oxford. And on his day off from work, he had been scratched by a rose thorn, apparently. RAZ: The policeman was a guy named Albert Alexander, and that little scratch had turned into a nasty infection. LAXMINARAYAN: His entire side of his cheek is infected and swollen. His eyes were so badly infected that they had to take his eyes out. There's a giant abscess on his face. RAZ: Now, remember, back in 1940, infections were a leading cause of death. Most of the soldiers in major wars didn't die from being shot, they died from infected wounds. LAXMINARAYAN: If someone had an infection from a simple scratch, they could just wait it out. There was a good chance of dying. RAZ: But it just so happened that at a lab not too far from this particular hospital in Oxford, where Albert Alexander wound up, researchers were working on an experimental new drug. . . LAXMINARAYAN: Which was capable of killing bacteria. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: It had been discovered purely by accident a couple of years earlier that was made from a type of mold. But the researchers didn't know if the drug was safe enough to use on a human being. It had never been tested. And by chance, they found out about Albert Alexander. LAXMINARAYAN: And they figured this person was going to die anyway and so why not try out this drug? And they give him this drug. The first day, already, he starts looking a little better. His appetite returns. Second day, he looks a whole lot better. RAZ: Day three, even better. Day four, much better. LAXMINARAYAN: Fifth day, it looks like this man may actually live, and then they run out of penicillin. RAZ: Penicillin - the very first antibiotic. So they run out of penicillin, and then what? LAXMINARAYAN: He died. RAZ: Wow. LAXMINARAYAN: But you have to remember, this was such a remarkable experiment to have even worked out because somehow this drug worked in this patient and opened up this entire era of medicine. Everything that we know as modern medicine really goes back to that particular day, when Albert Alexander lived because of penicillin. RAZ: And that was the start of the antibiotics revolution. LAXMINARAYAN: The fact that you could keep an infection at bay from the body meant that you could now perform surgeries. You could perform long surgeries. And because of that, you could have transplants. You could have a root canal. All of these were made possible by the fact that we have antibiotics. RAZ: We're talking about basically, a miracle drug, I mean, arguably one of the most effective and important medical advancements in human history. LAXMINARAYAN: Absolutely. RAZ: Antibiotics completely transformed human life spans overnight, but the antibiotics revolution is starting to unravel. According to the Centers for Disease Control, twice as many Americans now die each year from infections that can't be cured within antibiotics than from HIV-AIDS. And that problem is getting worse. LAXMINARAYAN: In fact, even as recently as, say, 15 or 18 years ago, I don't recall actually knowing a patient with a resistant infection. But what has happened in the last 10 years has been a remarkable increase in the actual number of people who are dying or are not able to get better because they carry a resistant infection. RAZ: And by the middle this century, more people will die from infections than from cancer if the problem isn't solved. It would be like winding the clock back to 1940. So the question is how did the miracle drug turn into a global health threat? Well, the short answer is we've been overusing them on humans and animals. And the more we use antibiotics, the more opportunities bacteria have to develop resistance. LAXMINARAYAN: And in some instances, some antibiotics have stopped working entirely. We have used antibiotics in many insistences inappropriately. We've used them on farms, presumably to keep animals healthy, but really to help them get fatter a little faster. To save a few pennies per pound of meat, we've squandered what are really the crown jewels of modern medicine. RAZ: Which is why Ramanan says we need to think of antibiotics in a completely different way. We need to think of them like we think of oil or water - as a resource that needs to be protected. Ramanan explained his idea from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)LAXMINARAYAN: Now, it turns out that there's something fundamental about antibiotics which make it different from other drugs, which is that if I misuse antibiotics or I use antibiotics, not only am I affected, but others are affected as well, in the same way as if I choose to drive to work or take a plane to go somewhere, that the costs I impose on others through global climate change go everywhere, and I don't necessarily take these costs into consideration. Now, that's a problem that's similar to another area that we all know about, which is of fuel use and energy, and of course energy use both depletes energy as well as leads to local pollution and climate change. And typically, in the case of energy, there are two ways in which you can deal with the problem. One is we can make better use of the oil that we have. And that's analogous to making better use of existing antibiotics, and we can do this in a number of ways that we'll talk about in a second. But the other option is the drill, baby, drill option, which, in the case of antibiotics is to go find new antibiotics. Now, these are not separate. They're related because if we invest heavily in new oil wells, we reduce the incentives for conservation of oil in the same way that's going to happen for antibiotics. The reverse is also going to happen, which is that if we use our antibiotics appropriately, we don't necessarily have to make the investments in new drug development. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: I mean, the amazing thing about all this is that there no alternatives to antibiotics, right, like in terms of effectiveness? I mean, we have to solve this problem or we're in big trouble. LAXMINARAYAN: You're absolutely right, and this is what really worries me about this problem. The only alternatives we have are to prevent the infection with vaccines or infection control or what have you. But honestly, we really don't have a substitute for antibiotics. And no one has figured out that, say, in 50 years from now, we won't need antibiotics because we have X. Maybe X will appear, but right now, no one is able to see through to see what this X really will be. We really don't have a substitute for antibiotics. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)LAXMINARAYAN: Now, this is clearly not a game that can be sustained or one that we can win by simply innovating to stay ahead. And there are ideas that we can borrow from energy that are helpful in thinking about how we might want to do this in the case of antibiotics as well. Now, if you think about how we deal with energy pricing, for instance, we'd consider emissions taxes, which means we're imposing the costs of pollution on people who actually use that energy. We might consider doing that for antibiotics as well, and perhaps that would make sure that antibiotics actually get used appropriately. And certainly consumer education works. Very often, people overuse antibiotics without necessarily - or prescribed too much without necessarily knowing that they do so. And feedback mechanisms have been found to be useful both on energy - when you tell someone that they're using a lot of energy during peak hour, they tend to cut back. And the same sort of example has been performed even in the case of antibiotics. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: We can't stop using antibiotics. It's not an option. That is not an option to solve this problem. It has to be about dramatically reducing how much we use them. LAXMINARAYAN: It has to be about reducing how we use them, changing how we use them, being clever about how we use them. So for instance, just imagine if we had a technology which - you know, it was a pill that you ingested with the antibiotic that the minute the antibiotic had done its work in the site of infection, that this pill would then absolve the remaining antibiotic so that the antibiotic wasn't running around willy-nilly around your body killing bacteria and creating resistance. That would dramatically reduce the collateral damage that the antibiotic will do. RAZ: Yeah, I had to take antibiotics for 10 days. But after, you know, 48 hours, I felt fine. And probably after five days, it was gone, but you still have to take it for 10 days. LAXMINARAYAN: You know, the history of that is very interesting. The earliest antibiotics were never actually tried-out in clinical trials of the kind we have today because most of our antibiotics predate the laws that required the randomized trials. So much of what we know about how long antibiotic therapy needs to be is by trial-and-error that goes back to Albert Alexander. RAZ: Wow. LAXMINARAYAN: So Albert Alexander, five days didn't work for him, so they didn't want to take a chance. They said 10 or 14 days of therapy, and that's what you have to go with. RAZ: And that may be contributing to the problem - that we are taking it for too long. LAXMINARAYAN: Absolutely. Now, you've got to remember here on the one hand, the main actor in our society who is handing out antibiotics is a doctor. RAZ: Yeah. LAXMINARAYAN: The doctor cares about the patient that's sitting in front of him or her. And if she sees a patient with some likelihood that the infection may come back in five days or six days if she didn't treat for long enough, then, you know, she just wants to provide an antibiotic for 10 days, or maybe even 14 days because that's what protects the patient. But that's not what protects the rest of society. But the doctor is not hired to protect the rest of society. She's there to protect the patient, and that's what she does. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)LAXMINARAYAN: We've had these technologies to control nature only for the last 70, 80 or 100 years and essentially, in a blink, we have squandered our ability to control because we have not recognized that natural selection and evolution was going to find a way to get back. And we need to completely rethink how we're going to use measures to control biological organisms and rethink how we incentivize the development, introduction - in the case of antibiotics prescription - of these valuable resources. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Ramanan Laxminarayan, he's an economist who studies the patterns of disease and directs the Center for Disease, Dynamics, Economics and Policy. You can see his entire talk at ted. com. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Coming up on the show, a future without oil that doesn't have to be like a \"Mad Max\" movie. I'm Guy Raz, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. GUY RAZ, HOST:  So on the show today, we're talking about finite resources. And here's a story about something we don't normally think of as a resource at all. We heard about it from Ramanan Laxminarayan. He's an economist who studies the patterns of disease. And the story begins in late December 1940, in Oxford, England. RAMANAN LAXMINARAYAN: And there's this policeman who shows up at the infirmary in Oxford. And on his day off from work, he had been scratched by a rose thorn, apparently. RAZ: The policeman was a guy named Albert Alexander, and that little scratch had turned into a nasty infection. LAXMINARAYAN: His entire side of his cheek is infected and swollen. His eyes were so badly infected that they had to take his eyes out. There's a giant abscess on his face. RAZ: Now, remember, back in 1940, infections were a leading cause of death. Most of the soldiers in major wars didn't die from being shot, they died from infected wounds. LAXMINARAYAN: If someone had an infection from a simple scratch, they could just wait it out. There was a good chance of dying. RAZ: But it just so happened that at a lab not too far from this particular hospital in Oxford, where Albert Alexander wound up, researchers were working on an experimental new drug. . . LAXMINARAYAN: Which was capable of killing bacteria. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: It had been discovered purely by accident a couple of years earlier that was made from a type of mold. But the researchers didn't know if the drug was safe enough to use on a human being. It had never been tested. And by chance, they found out about Albert Alexander. LAXMINARAYAN: And they figured this person was going to die anyway and so why not try out this drug? And they give him this drug. The first day, already, he starts looking a little better. His appetite returns. Second day, he looks a whole lot better. RAZ: Day three, even better. Day four, much better. LAXMINARAYAN: Fifth day, it looks like this man may actually live, and then they run out of penicillin. RAZ: Penicillin - the very first antibiotic. So they run out of penicillin, and then what? LAXMINARAYAN: He died. RAZ: Wow. LAXMINARAYAN: But you have to remember, this was such a remarkable experiment to have even worked out because somehow this drug worked in this patient and opened up this entire era of medicine. Everything that we know as modern medicine really goes back to that particular day, when Albert Alexander lived because of penicillin. RAZ: And that was the start of the antibiotics revolution. LAXMINARAYAN: The fact that you could keep an infection at bay from the body meant that you could now perform surgeries. You could perform long surgeries. And because of that, you could have transplants. You could have a root canal. All of these were made possible by the fact that we have antibiotics. RAZ: We're talking about basically, a miracle drug, I mean, arguably one of the most effective and important medical advancements in human history. LAXMINARAYAN: Absolutely. RAZ: Antibiotics completely transformed human life spans overnight, but the antibiotics revolution is starting to unravel. According to the Centers for Disease Control, twice as many Americans now die each year from infections that can't be cured within antibiotics than from HIV-AIDS. And that problem is getting worse. LAXMINARAYAN: In fact, even as recently as, say, 15 or 18 years ago, I don't recall actually knowing a patient with a resistant infection.

I'm Guy Raz. We're talking about how to use and preserve finite resources on the show today, which few people in all of human history did better than MacGyver from that '80s TV show. NAVI RADJOU: MacGyver was my and remains my favorite TV action hero. RAZ: This is Navi Radjou. He's an innovation consultant and MacGyver fan. RADJOU: He will find himself in all kinds of crazy places, you know, in a prison cell, in somewhere in, you know, South America or whatever it is. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MACGYVER\")RICHARD DEAN ANDERSON: (As MacGyver) All right, MacGyver, think - rope. . . RADJOU: And he would just look around, and he will find some resources. . . . (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MACGYVER\")ANDERSON: (As MacGyver) . . . A smoke alarm, sheets of plywood. RADJOU: . . . That for us doesn't look like something to create a solution. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MACGYVER\")ANDERSON: (As MacGyver) It just might work. RADJOU: But he can do it. RAZ: That dude made, like, jetpacks out of toilet rolls. RADJOU: Yes, yes. I mean, what I like about this guy is that, you know, unlike James Bond, he doesn't wear a fancy suit, he doesn't have a Rolex. RAZ: James Bond had Q. MacGyver had toilet rolls. RADJOU: (Laughter) Exactly. MacGyver is like - you know, he's a one-man show. RAZ: Navi is probably such a MacGyver enthusiast because he grew up in a place where he had to be resourceful - in the city of Pondicherry, India. RADJOU: It's a very dry climate, so you don't have, you know, much water. Electricity was in short supply. For me, it's like living with less is almost like the norm. RAZ: About 18 years ago, Navi moved to Silicon Valley, and he started consulting for tech companies. And instead of being wowed by their innovation, he was baffled by how casually they were wasting basic resources. RADJOU: The one thing that struck me all the time is to see in the evenings all these office buildings being lit up. That's something I never understood is, like, you know, there's nobody working there after 6-7 p. m. , but I just see, like, it's all lit up. RAZ: The other resource Navi noticed companies squandering? Money, specifically when it came to research and development. RADJOU: Just because you invest more in R and D doesn't make a company more innovative. Maybe we need to look at a different way of innovating. RAZ: Maybe innovation, he thought, would happen in a more constrained environment. RADJOU: Because when you put a limitation on resources, you remove the limitation - right? - on creativity because necessity is the mother of invention. RAZ: Navi calls this idea frugal innovation, and he believes big tech companies could learn from inventors in the developing world. Here's his TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)RADJOU: For the past seven years, I have met and studied hundreds of entrepreneurs in India, China, Africa and South America, and they keep amazing me. Many of them did not go to school. They don't invent stuff in big R and D labs. The street is the lab. Why they do that? Because they don't have the kind of basic resources we take for granted like capital energy, and basic services like healthcare, education are also scarce in those regions. Take Mansukh Prajapati, a potter in India. He has created a fridge made entirely of clay that consumes no electricity. It can keep fruits and vegetables fresh for many days. In Africa, if you run off of your cell phone battery, don't panic. You'll find some resourceful entrepreneurs who can recharge your cell phone using their bicycles. Let's go to Lima in Peru, a region with high humidity and receives only one inch of rainfall each year. An intern in college in Lima designed a giant advertising billboard that absorbs air humidity and converts it into purified water generating over 90 liters of water every day. That can literally create water out of thin air. In India, we call it jugaad. Jugaad is a Hindi word that means an improvised fix, a clever solution born in adversity. RAZ: Yeah, I mean, in some ways, you're more liberated when you don't have as many resources. RADJOU: I think so because I always believe that when you have nothing to lose, the sky is the limit, right? RAZ: Yeah. RADJOU: So I think that a lot of big companies after a while stop innovating and die like Kodak - right? - who missed completely the digital revolution - is because they become so risk covers. So that means they have too much to lose. So when you have too much to lose, you only take baby steps, you know, in terms of discovering new things. But when you start from the bottom, you have nothing to lose. You are like an underdog. So when you are more on the offensive, you tend to innovate. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)RADJOU: I believe that the only way we can sustain growth and prosperity in the West is if we learn to do more with less. The good news is that's starting to happen. Several Western companies are now adopting frugal innovation to create affordable products for Western consumers. Let me give an example. In China, the R and D engineers of Simmons Healthcare have designed a CT scanner that is easy enough to be used by less qualified health workers like nurses and technicians. This device can scan more patients on a daily basis and yet consumes less energy, which is great for hospitals but is also great for patients because it reduces the cost of treatment by 30 percent and radiation dosage by up to 60 percent. This solution was initially designed for the Chinese market, but now it's selling like hotcakes in U. S. and Europe where hospitals are pressured to deliver quality care at lower cost. Ultimately, you'd like to see developed countries and developing countries come together and co-create frugal solutions that benefit the entire humanity. RAZ: So it sounds like you're proposing that we completely reimagine the way we make things. RADJOU: I would say yes, absolutely. We have to fundamentally redesign products, rethink the whole supply chain. My feeling is that what you begin to see is that companies also are now recognizing and research shows more and more there is indeed, in a way, a growing awareness among consumers around issues related to the environment. So they also expect companies to behave, you know, more environmentally responsible way. So I think it's going to happen, you know, gradually in the U. S. But when I look at Europe or Asia, I actually see a lot more aggressive moves by the governments, by citizens and by companies to actually embrace new innovation techniques that are more resource-efficient. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)RADJOU: As an Indian-born French national who lives in the United States, my hope is that we can harness the collective ingenuity of innovators from around the world to co-create frugal solutions that will improve the quality of life of everyone in the world while preserving our precious planet. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Navi Radjou - he is the co-author of the books \"Frugal Innovation\" and \"Jugaad Innovation. \" You can see his entire talk at ted. com.

This solution was initially designed for the Chinese market, but now it's selling like hotcakes in U. S. and Europe where hospitals are pressured to deliver quality care at lower cost. Ultimately, you'd like to see developed countries and developing countries come together and co-create frugal solutions that benefit the entire humanity. RAZ: So it sounds like you're proposing that we completely reimagine the way we make things. RADJOU: I would say yes, absolutely. We have to fundamentally redesign products, rethink the whole supply chain. My feeling is that what you begin to see is that companies also are now recognizing and research shows more and more there is indeed, in a way, a growing awareness among consumers around issues related to the environment. So they also expect companies to behave, you know, more environmentally responsible way. So I think it's going to happen, you know, gradually in the U. S. But when I look at Europe or Asia, I actually see a lot more aggressive moves by the governments, by citizens and by companies to actually embrace new innovation techniques that are more resource-efficient. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) RADJOU: As an Indian-born French national who lives in the United States, my hope is that we can harness the collective ingenuity of innovators from around the world to co-create frugal solutions that will improve the quality of life of everyone in the world while preserving our precious planet. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE) RAZ: Navi Radjou - he is the co-author of the books \"Frugal Innovation\" and \"Jugaad Innovation. \" You can see his entire talk at ted. com.

Two years ago, he threw himself into researching ants - how to make them in the movie both scientifically accurate and relatable. MORRISON: Well, first and foremost, its hair.

BRADY: Good girls though. JESOVNIK: (Laughter). ULABY: Wait - good girls. The two scientists say this is \"Ant-Man's\" only flaw. Hollywood, says Jesovnik, always assigns ants the wrong gender. JESOVNIK: It's always boys and girls or boys, and ants really are only girls, mostly. ULABY: OK, Ant-Man is a fictional character in the Marvel universe. Jesovnik has no quibbles with his gender. But real ants crawling out in the world are pretty much all female. Male ants have short little lives. They live in the colony, mate with the queen, guard her and die.

That is what it says in the State of the Climate report. It's put together every year by more than 400 scientists from around the world. Among the findings is a big spike in ocean temperatures. NPR's Christopher Joyce has the details. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: For the past 24 years, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been gathering data from around the world on climate trends. The word on 2014 is, on average, the hottest ever on land and in the ocean. Deke Arndt is a climate scientist with NOAA and a report author. He points out that it's the lower atmosphere that's warming, not the upper atmosphere, just as the amount of greenhouse gases in the lower atmosphere continues to increase. That's not a coincidence. DEKE ARNDT: The changes that we are seeing in the lower part of the atmosphere are driven by a change in the composition of the atmosphere. If an external forcing such as the sun or some orbital phenomenon were to be driving the warming, we would see warming across the board in most of the atmosphere. And we don't. JOYCE: This year's hottest ever record is the third time that's happened in the past fifteen years. The annual spike in ocean temperatures, specifically in the upper 2,000 feet of water in most of the world's oceans, was especially big last year. Greg Johnson is an ocean scientist at NOAA. GREG JOHNSON: You can sort of think of ocean warming as being global warming since that's where most of the global warming goes. JOYCE: Johnson says a lot of extra heat has been trapped in the lower atmosphere over the past several decades, and the ocean is going to continue to suck it up and get warmer. Moreover, the oceans expand when they get warmer. That raises sea levels, which - again, no coincidence - reached their highest point last year as well. Glaciers continued to melt and the extent of Arctic sea ice kept shrinking as well. On the temperature front, Europe was hotter than ever. But it wasn't hotter than blazes everywhere. The eastern U. S. got a break. The winter there was especially cold, which led some climate skeptics to question the whole idea of climate change. Jessica Blunden, the climate scientist and report author who consults for NOAA, says the East was just an outlier. JESSICA BLUNDEN: For example, the lower latitudes, both Eastern North America and parts of Russia, were well below average during this period, up to 10 degrees Fahrenheit below average. But then in the higher latitudes - Alaska, for example, was super warm for this time of year, 18 degrees above average in late January. JOYCE: So the eastern U. S. got lucky if you consider record-breaking snow and cold weather lucky. Keith Seitter, head of the American Meteorological Society, which published the report, found that ironic. KEITH SEITTER: I'm here in Boston. We had an incredibly tough winter. But that doesn't change the fact that the globe is getting warmer. And 2014 really represents kind of a landmark year in that respect. JOYCE: As the climate report shows, weather is local; climate is global. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

He explains, in his fascinating book, \"The Reason For Flowers. \"BUCHMANN: The reason for flowers is actually one word - sex. So flowers are literally living scented billboards that are advertising for sexual favors, whether those are from bees, flies, beetles, butterflies or us because quite frankly, most of the flowers in the world have gotten us to do their bidding. But that's only the first stage because - right? - flowers, if they're lucky, turn into fruits. And those fruits and seeds feed the world.

BUCHMANN: They do. One of my favorite memories is in the - roaming the Napa foothills as a UC Davis grad student. And I would go to the wineries, of course, and then in between, I would go find western spice bush, which is this marvelous flower that kind of smells like a blend between a Cabernet and rotten fruit.

RATH: Let's talk about the flower supply chain now because you get into that, and it's vast and pretty amazing. So say I'm in Manhattan, you know, in the flower district around 28th Street. BUCHMANN: Right. RATH: All those amazing flowers - where are they coming from? BUCHMANN: Wow. They're coming from around the world. Domestically in the U. S. , we probably raise only about 30 percent of our flowers, and those are coming from California and Florida. But you know, globally, there are about 15 billion stems per year. And in the U. S. , we buy about 4 billion cut stems a year, maybe 10 million flowers per day. But the vast majority of the flowers that we find in our big-box stores or farmers markets are pretty much coming from Columbia and Ecuador, followed by Costa Rica. And virtually all of those are coming into the Miami International Airport. So you may not realize it when you're flying in, but below your feet in the cargo hold, there's some perishable flowers as cargo. And they're also coming in in airplanes, jumbo jets that are totally stripped - no seats and just crammed with boxed flowers. They have a huge carbon footprint. Millions and millions of them are inspected, bought and sold and then get back on a plane to go somewhere else in the world. RATH: I kept thinking about how it's wild how, you know, we're attracted to some of the same things that other animals are, like our sense of maybe what is sweet or what's pretty. Obviously, that must be kind of the same because we like these things too. BUCHMANN: Exactly. Floral beauty has beguiled us along with the birds and the bees. Flowers come in a myriad of shapes, colors, scents and sizes. But they seem to have almost universal appeal. And every culture that I researched has a love for flowers. And I mean, we use them for - obviously in the decorative and fine arts and prose and poetry. I mean, we don't really have petroglyphs about flowers. Those are usually big, fierce game animals.

Pluto is also billions of miles from the Sun, so it's cold. But according to these first photos, cold with ice, not stone - mountains of ice as tall as the Rockies and only about a hundred million years old in a solar system that's been around more than 4. 5 billion years. Who would have supposed that there were ice mountains, project scientist Hal Weaver asked at a press conference? It's just blowing my mind. Imagine what it must take to blow the mind of a space scientist. Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute, the mission's chief scientist, says that icy, soaring peaks on Pluto should, quote, \"send a lot of geophysicists back to the drawing boards. \" It's not what the smartest people expected to see. These pictures also show Pluto to be a relatively unblemished babe among celestial bodies. It has those ice mountains but no impact craters, as they're called, caused by the crash of meteorites or other flotsam from space. The scientists say this suggest that Pluto could still smolder below its surface, swelling with energy from the decay of radioactive material or even an underground ocean. Dr. Stern said, I don't think any one of us could've imagined that it was this good of a toy store, which is how a great scientist may see a planet of surprises. Stephen Hawking of Cambridge sent a message to the New Horizons team, in which he called Pluto a distant, icy world on the edge of our solar system. The revelations of New Horizons may help us to understand better how our solar system was formed. We explore because we are human and we long to know. And New Horizons will go on sailing deeper and deeper into deep space and into our imaginations as long as the plutonium aboard can propel it - perhaps until the 2030s. The great intrepid voyages of the 15th century's age of discovery revealed surprises, riches and how different people in disparate places share the same world. The voyages of the 21st century may help us learn how much larger the world is than our world alone. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SIMON: And you're listening to NPR News.

GORDEMER: But you don't have to be a mutant to read minds. Jack Gallant is a professor at UC Berkeley, and he can literally see what's on your mind. JACK GALLANT: Your eye is sort of like a camera. There's an image of the world on the back of your eye, and that image is projected on the back of your brain. And we can record blood flow signals and translate those signals back into the picture that you saw. GORDEMER: In other words, Gallant has been recording images from people's brains and playing them back like a movie. The process starts by showing test subjects a bunch of random movie clips. GALLANT: And then people watched these clips while we were recording their brain activity by means of MRI. GORDEMER: The MRI data was fed into a computer which reconstructed what the person saw. Now the images aren't super clear, but you can make out what's going on. GALLANT: They have this dreamy quality, as if you're looking through the world through a thick piece of gauze. You might be able to tell that there was somebody speaking, but you wouldn't be able to tell if it was a man or a woman. GORDEMER: The technology is kind of primitive right now, but as it improves, the list of things that potentially can be plucked from your brain gets kind of scary. GALLANT: We'll be able to decode the things you are looking at, the internal dialogue you're having with yourself as you talk to yourself throughout the day, your feelings.

NPR's Richard Harris reports on a new study that finds that this end-of-life treatment often harms a patient's quality of life. RICHARD HARRIS, BYLINE: Chemotherapy often helps cancer patients live for many more years, and it can even be considered a cure. But there comes a time for some cancer patients when doctors know the treatment has failed and patients with advanced cancer likely have less than six months left to live. HOLLY PRIGERSON: Chemotherapy is not meant to cure people like that. HARRIS: Holly Prigerson at the Weill-Cornell Medical College says those patients are still sometimes given chemotherapy with the hope that it might slightly prolong their lives or make them more comfortable. She and her colleagues decided see whether chemotherapy in this circumstance actually does improve a patient's quality of life. So they talked to the patient's caregivers and asked them how the patient fared during the final week of life. PRIGERSON: They assessed things like their mood, how anxious they were, their physical symptoms and their overall quality of life. HARRIS: A report in the journal JAMA Oncology finds that chemotherapy often harmed these patients at the end, reducing their quality of life, and it didn't extend their lives either. This was even the case for patients who had been able to keep active and felt relatively OK when this new round of chemotherapy was started. PRIGERSON: The conventional wisdom is that patients and oncologists think, why not? I've nothing to lose. And I think the wake-up call from these data really is to say, well, there are harms being done, and there is a cost to getting chemo so late. HARRIS: Prigerson says some people may still opt for chemotherapy in these circumstances, but she says patients and doctors need to better understand the pluses and minuses of treatment at the end of life. PRIGERSON: I think some patients would say, I don't care; I want to be on chemotherapy. It gives me something to do, and it makes me feel like I'm fighting my cancer. That's fine if patients know that the likelihood of them benefitting from getting that chemotherapy is still remote, and it will probably make them feel sicker because of toxicities and side effects of the treatment. CHARLES BLANKE: I think this paper strongly argues that giving chemotherapy near the end of life, that is in patients with terminal cancer, should not be the default and oncologist should have a very darn-good reason if they want to do so. HARRIS: Dr. Charles Blanke at the Oregon Health and Science University says it's time to change this accepted medical practice. Doctors, he says, too often equate treatment with hope. BLANKE: If the doctor really doesn't expect you to be around in six months, it's probably better to focus your time on something that's not chemotherapy. HARRIS: For example, pain relief, mood issues, sleep disturbances and other problems that can affect a patient's quality of life. But Dr. Lowell Schnipper, who helped draft guidelines at the American Society for Clinical Oncology, says he's not ready to abandon them just yet. LOWELL SCHNIPPER: I think this is a wake-up call to talk to our patients. HARRIS: He says patients do need to hear a doctor say that a situation is truly dire when it is. But each patient is different, and novel approaches may sometimes be worth trying, even in patients like this. Still, Schnipper says doctors haven't spent enough time to consider quality of life issues in these circumstances.

Today, we're going to celebrate one particular camping trip - a famous one way back in 1858. Ralph Waldo Emerson, the great philosopher, essayist and poet, set out into New York's Adirondack Mountains, and he took with him some of the most famous artists, scientists and thinkers of his day. North Country Public Radio's Brian Mann retraced Emerson's journey. BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: I set out early in the morning in my canoe with environmental activist and writer Bill McKibben and our guide, Mike Carr with the Nature Conservancy. Our idea is to paddle as closely as possible the route Emerson and a bunch of his friends took 157 years ago. MIKE CARR: They came down through Stony Creek Ponds, just upstream, and floated down the Raquette. MANN: Emerson was in his 50s when he made the trip, already a famous poet and essayist. He came from Boston when the Adirondack Mountains were still really remote, a howling wilderness north of Albany. Getting here took days of travel by train and wagon and boat. On this day, it feels like nothing much has changed. We drift the current down the big river, under white pines as tall and straight as ship masts. We see beaver and an otter creasing the water. McKibben points out an eagle sweeping ahead of us. BILL MCKIBBEN: Wow, we're in - deep in paradise here, man. MANN: Emerson's journey here was famous even while it was going on. The newspapers found out what he was up to, and people started calling it the Philosopher's Camp. The party included one of the great scientists of the day, a guy named Louis Agassiz, also a lawyer named Ebenezer Hoar, who would later serve as attorney general of the United States. They passed through this vast meadow that links the Raquette River to Follensby Pond, where they planned to make camp. It's so quiet we can hear the wind as it lays the grass side to side. MCKIBBEN: That play of water and pickerel lily and grass and big pines on the edge - it's magnificent. MANN: The next hour, we cross the open reach of the lake. One of the men on Emerson's trip was a painter, William James Stillman. He painted the scene of the Philosopher's Camp, with Emerson standing at the middle and Agassiz off to one side, dissecting a trout. Using Stillman's painting as a guide, we're able to home in on the low-rise where they camped, wading ashore through bog laurel and lilies. This it? CARR: Yeah, they dammed this up. MANN: Bushwhacking through the woods, McKibben and Carrr find the spring where Emerson drank and huge boulders that may be the ones in Stillman's painting. CARR: It really feels like hallowed ground. You know, we're standing in a hardwood stand with giant sugar maple and black cherry, big white birch here. MCKIBBEN: You know, we're used to thinking of sort of spiritual pilgrimages or we go to Fenway Park or, you know, we have these historical pilgrimages, where we go off to a battlefield or something. But what we come here to remember is this particular spark of intellectual energy. MANN: The reason we followed Emerson's journey this summer is that a new book has been published about the Philosopher's Camp and the men who gathered here. The writer, James Schlett, meets us at the lake. He says Emerson wasn't really much of an outdoorsman. He preferred his nature in small doses, in gardens and farm fields. But the poet wound up loving this place.

For NPR News, I'm Brian Mann in New York's Adirondack Mountains. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:  It's high summer, and for many of us, that means it's time to go camping. Today, we're going to celebrate one particular camping trip - a famous one way back in 1858. Ralph Waldo Emerson, the great philosopher, essayist and poet, set out into New York's Adirondack Mountains, and he took with him some of the most famous artists, scientists and thinkers of his day. North Country Public Radio's Brian Mann retraced Emerson's journey. BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: I set out early in the morning in my canoe with environmental activist and writer Bill McKibben and our guide, Mike Carr with the Nature Conservancy. Our idea is to paddle as closely as possible the route Emerson and a bunch of his friends took 157 years ago. MIKE CARR: They came down through Stony Creek Ponds, just upstream, and floated down the Raquette. MANN: Emerson was in his 50s when he made the trip, already a famous poet and essayist. He came from Boston when the Adirondack Mountains were still really remote, a howling wilderness north of Albany. Getting here took days of travel by train and wagon and boat. On this day, it feels like nothing much has changed. We drift the current down the big river, under white pines as tall and straight as ship masts. We see beaver and an otter creasing the water. McKibben points out an eagle sweeping ahead of us. BILL MCKIBBEN: Wow, we're in - deep in paradise here, man. MANN: Emerson's journey here was famous even while it was going on. The newspapers found out what he was up to, and people started calling it the Philosopher's Camp. The party included one of the great scientists of the day, a guy named Louis Agassiz, also a lawyer named Ebenezer Hoar, who would later serve as attorney general of the United States. They passed through this vast meadow that links the Raquette River to Follensby Pond, where they planned to make camp. It's so quiet we can hear the wind as it lays the grass side to side. MCKIBBEN: That play of water and pickerel lily and grass and big pines on the edge - it's magnificent. MANN: The next hour, we cross the open reach of the lake. One of the men on Emerson's trip was a painter, William James Stillman. He painted the scene of the Philosopher's Camp, with Emerson standing at the middle and Agassiz off to one side, dissecting a trout. Using Stillman's painting as a guide, we're able to home in on the low-rise where they camped, wading ashore through bog laurel and lilies. This it? CARR: Yeah, they dammed this up. MANN: Bushwhacking through the woods, McKibben and Carrr find the spring where Emerson drank and huge boulders that may be the ones in Stillman's painting. CARR: It really feels like hallowed ground. You know, we're standing in a hardwood stand with giant sugar maple and black cherry, big white birch here. MCKIBBEN: You know, we're used to thinking of sort of spiritual pilgrimages or we go to Fenway Park or, you know, we have these historical pilgrimages, where we go off to a battlefield or something. But what we come here to remember is this particular spark of intellectual energy. MANN: The reason we followed Emerson's journey this summer is that a new book has been published about the Philosopher's Camp and the men who gathered here. The writer, James Schlett, meets us at the lake. He says Emerson wasn't really much of an outdoorsman. He preferred his nature in small doses, in gardens and farm fields. But the poet wound up loving this place. JAMES SCHLETT: And it was a very meditative moment - just Emerson there standing among these giant trees, taking it all in in the quiet, away from the rabble of the camp. MANN: This may be the biggest legacy of the Philosopher's Camp. This was the moment when one of our deepest thinkers on nature and the spirit took his deepest dive into a truly wild place, one that still boasted wolves and bears and mountain lions.

Most of the colonists who arrived in 1607 died shortly thereafter from famine, disease or battles with Native Americans. Now archaeologists have identified the remains of some of the colony's most notable casualties. NPR's Christopher Joyce visited the site and brings us this story on the fate of the Jamestown elite. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: At Jamestown, the emerald green grass rolls down to the James River, and a steady breeze keeps the mosquitoes at bay. Preservation Virginia runs this historical site, and Bill Kelso is the top archaeologist there. Five years ago, he hit a jackpot. BILL KELSO: In 2010 we found a series of gigantic postholes. JOYCE: The posts in those holes had been 4 feet square. They had supported a building - the colony's first church, built in 1608. The church was gone. However. . . KELSO: We could see where there were four burials in the very east end of this rectangular pattern. JOYCE: It had been an Anglican church. The east end would have been the holiest spot, the chancel. KELSO: The most holy part, you know, that's where you'd have the communion table and the altar and those kinds of things at the end. JOYCE: To be buried in the chancel, you had to be special. KELSO: Chancel is reserved for the really high status people. So we decided we were going to excavate these. JOYCE: With help from the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History, they exhumed the remains. They were four men. The bones were in bad shape and no sign of who they were nor what they died from. But an historical account of Jamestown by colonist George Percy on a plaque near the church site gives some hints. KELSO: This is George Percy in 1607. He reports that our men were destroyed with cruel diseases and swellings, burning fevers and by wars. And some departed suddenly, but for the most part, they died of near famine. JOYCE: England's Virginia Company had sent the men to America to find wealth. Most died within three years. Life was hell - the church, their spiritual refuge and, according to James Horn, the president of Jamestown Rediscovery Foundation, part of their reason for being there. JAMES HORN: It's not just about the commercial. It's about establishing English society in America. And English society without the Church of England at this time is unthinkable. JOYCE: So who would merit burial in the chancel? The graves did offer some clues. In one, they found a silk sash woven with silver sequins. In another, they found part of a leading staff, a wooden staff a military officer would hold. And along with it, the most intriguing object. MERRY OUTLAW: We keep it locked up. JOYCE: Merry Outlaw is curator of Jamestown's artifacts. She retrieves a shiny silver box from a cabinet, two inches long, an inch wide. It had been laid on the coffin in one of the graves. Outlaw has seen thousands of artifacts from Jamestown, but this one is top of the heap. OUTLAW: It's unique, nothing else like it. JOYCE: It was too fragile to open, so the team did a CT scan of it. Inside, a tiny lead capsule and some bone fragments. KELSO: Lead vessel - it would hold holy water, oil or blood. And the bone would be that of a saint. Put together, this is a very holy object. JOYCE: And there is a letter M scratched into it. KELSO: Yes. That stands for mystery. We don't know what - still an enigma. JOYCE: But this was quite clearly a reliquary, a containment of holy relics and normally a Catholic object. That was puzzling. The colonists were Church of England. They considered Catholics their spiritual enemies. So these were the clues in the dirt. Back at the Smithsonian in Washington, D. C. , forensic anthropologist Douglas Owsley started work on the bones. One clue - lead in the bones - it was high. In those days, people sometimes ate from pewter or glazed bowls and cups which contained lead. DOUGLAS OWSLEY: You're going to get him some exposure. But if you're from a high status family, you're going to get more. JOYCE: Because metal ware was more expensive. The bones also showed high levels of nitrogen, suggesting these men had grown up eating more meat than most. And their long bones did not bear the marks of heavy muscle attachments. OWSLEY: These are good size men, but they are not muscled up strongly. It's characterizing their background and lifestyle. It's a little clue, but we look at all these lines of evidence and tie it together. JOYCE: By combining the physical evidence with historical documents, the team finally identified these buried men. They were the colony's elite. Reverend Robert Hunt, the first pastor of the colony. He arrived in 1607. He soon lost all his possessions in a fire. The next year, he died at age 39. Captain William West - he was a gentleman and a relative of the colony's first governor. He died in 1610 at age 24 fighting Indians. The silver sash was in his coffin. Sir Ferdinando Wainman, a soldier, horseman and an English knight - he'd been in charge of ordinance and horses. He died in 1610 at age 34. And finally, Captain Gabriel Archer - here was the answer to the puzzle of the reliquary. His family, in fact, was Catholic and had been persecuted for that in England. He was probably the owner. He died in 1609 at age 34, and the reliquary went into the earth with him. Owsley says the ages are approximate and identifications are 85 percent sure. And certainly, questions remain. For example, why was a Catholic there? OWSLEY: We surely don't have all the answers, and we certainly want this to open the discussion and lead to more research. JOYCE: Research on everything from tooth decay to bone shape to bone chemistry that will illuminate the lives of the first English settlers in America from what they left behind.

DAVID AGUS: Yeah, you know, we're on the edge of the cliff. We're willing to take risks. Our patients are willing to take risks. RAZ: This is David Agus; he's also a cancer doctor and a professor at USC Medical School. AGUS: So it's really an exciting time where all of a sudden, the change of progress versus time is happening, and hopefully we're starting to make differences. RAZ: But still, right now, this is David Agus's reality. AGUS: Two to three times a week, I look someone in the eye and say I have no more drugs to treat your cancer. There are remarkable pills that can stop leukemia - certain kinds of it in its track - certain kinds of lung cancer, certain kinds of kidney cancer with immunotherapy - small little wins. But the big picture is not a dramatic benefit. And so we need to reassess where we are. RAZ: And what David Agus has been arguing is that the way we approach the fight against cancer is all wrong; that cancer isn't just lung cancer or breast cancer or prostate cancer, but it's more about the environment where the cancer lives - the entire body. AGUS: And so there are millions of contexts in the body. And I look at it like you're driving to LA to San Francisco. And if I take a car and take it apart and look at every piece of the car, it doesn't tell me how long it takes to get from LA to San Francisco. I forgot the weather, the traffic, how much caffeine the driver drank, the bladder size of the driver 'cause they all matter. And in the cancer world, as with many other diseases, all we're doing is we're studying the car. We're studying the cancer cell, and we forget to study everything else. And so I think the future of cancer research is not just studying that cell, but it's studying the environment, studying the whole system - who the host is, who the patient is. RAZ: And David says one of the things that's holding us back from approaching cancer as a whole system is the way we talk about it. David picks up this idea from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)AGUS: So one of the fundamental problems we have in cancer is that right now, we describe it by a number of adjectives - symptoms. I'm tired, I'm bloated, I have pain, et cetera. You then have some anatomic descriptions. You get that CAT scan. There's a three centimeter mass in the liver. You then have some body part descriptions. It's in the liver, in the breast, in the prostate. And that's about it. So our dictionary for describing cancer is very, very poor. It's basically symptoms. It's manifestations of a disease. What's exciting is the government has spent 400 million dollars, and they've allocated another billion dollars to what we call The Cancer Genome Atlas project. So it is the idea of sequencing all of the genes in the cancer and giving us a new lexicon, a new dictionary to describe it. So obviously, the technology is here today, and over the next several years, that will change. You will no longer go to a breast cancer clinic. You will go to a HER2 amplified clinic or an EGFR activated clinic. And they will go to some of the pathogenic lesions that were involved in causing this individual cancer. RAZ: OK, so right now, if you're diagnosed with, say, breast cancer, right, you go to a breast-cancer specialist, and the doctor prescribes a standard treatment - usually a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, maybe radiation. But here's the thing. . . AGUS: There are probably dozens of kinds of breast cancer, dozens of kinds of prostate and lung cancer. And so going forward, we're going to start to define the parameters. I'm going to look at it and say this cancer can only live in the breast so just surgery is all we need. Or this one grows like a tree so we need to do surgery with radiation. Or this one can live elsewhere in the body so we need to give chemotherapy. So I think that's going to be the fundamental change here is that we're going to start to treat that whole individual, that complex system rather than just the cell. RAZ: David's idea here is that while we should treat cancer in the context of the body as just one part of a larger, complex system, we can do that without necessarily understanding how it all works. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)AGUS: The goal of me as a cancer doctor is not to understand cancer. And I think that's been the fundamental problem over the last five decades is that we have strived to understand cancer. The goal is to control cancer. And so the problem is, is that it's not just one system; it's multiple systems on multiple scales. It's a system of systems. What we're talking about in the body and cancer is starting to model it like a complex system. Well, the bad news is, is that these robust, and robust is a keyword, emergent systems are very hard to understand in detail. The good news is you can manipulate them. You can try to control them without that fundamental understanding of every component. RAZ: So you're saying we don't really need to understand cancer? I mean, there's just going to be things that we're never going to understand - we just have to accept and that's OK? AGUS: No question about it. We are never going to understand the complex things that are going on with these 20,000, 30,000 genes in the cell and then each of the cells that are contributing to all the environmental things and how they're connecting to it. Do you think anybody truly understands the economy? RAZ: No. AGUS: No, but at the same time, we can control it. We can raise interest rates, we can change money supply and other things we know can affect the economy in certain ways. That's how cancer's going to go. You know, a critical trial was done about 15 years ago where they took women with premenopausal breast cancer. And after treatment, when we normally wait until the reoccur and treat again, they divided the group into two. One got a drug that builds bone, a drug for osteoporosis, and one got placebo. And in that trial, they reduced recurrence of the breast cancer by over 40 percent. Why? Because breast cancer metastasizes to bone. RAZ: Wow. AGUS: So one of the most dramatic benefits across any cancer trial, and it was a drug that didn't even touch the cancer; it changed the system. RAZ: So I mean, if we eventually start to treat cancer more like part of a system - I mean, how far could this go? Like, what would a visit to a doctor's office be like? AGUS: Well, I think the doctor's visit of the future will be you go in, and we prick your finger and take a drop of blood. And that blood gives you a profile of everything going on at a moment in time. So it tells you what's going on; it's the state of the system, whether you're in a health state or a cancer state. So in the future when I treat the cancer, I may also change your body so the cancer doesn't want to go elsewhere and grow and make it inhospitable if you will. At the same time, I'm going to look and say why did he or she get cancer? Well, they had significant inflammation, and their body was receptive because this kind of tissue allows other cells to grow rather than just normal cells. And I'm going to change that or attempt to change that. So defining the system is going to be key. RAZ: I mean, if you think about, like, HIV-AIDs, right? I mean, 20 years ago this was a death sentence, and now, people live full lives with it. We've just figured out a way to control it. So I mean, sounds like what you're saying is that the goal isn't to cure cancer, but to kind of make sure that people can live with it. AGUS: Exactly, it's to stop it from growing. You know, listen, a tie is just as good as a win in a sense, right. If I stop a cancer from growing, and you live with cancer and die with cancer, it's just as good as me going these crazy, heroic, toxic ways to try to get rid of it. So, you know, people, as you alluded to, live a whole, normal life now with HIV by taking a medicine that suppresses it. I want to go that same direction in cancer. I want to change you so the cancer stops growing, and you can live a very fruitful and productive life and play with your children and your grandchildren and live till a ripe old age, which is what we all dream of. RAZ: David Agus - he teaches at the USC Med School where he heads up the Center for Applied Molecular Medicine. You can find his full talk at ted. com. More ideas about fighting cancer in a moment. I'm Guy Raz, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. GUY RAZ, HOST:  Are you also optimistic about where we're headed? DAVID AGUS: Yeah, you know, we're on the edge of the cliff.

AGUS: And so there are millions of contexts in the body. And I look at it like you're driving to LA to San Francisco. And if I take a car and take it apart and look at every piece of the car, it doesn't tell me how long it takes to get from LA to San Francisco. I forgot the weather, the traffic, how much caffeine the driver drank, the bladder size of the driver 'cause they all matter. And in the cancer world, as with many other diseases, all we're doing is we're studying the car. We're studying the cancer cell, and we forget to study everything else. And so I think the future of cancer research is not just studying that cell, but it's studying the environment, studying the whole system - who the host is, who the patient is. RAZ: And David says one of the things that's holding us back from approaching cancer as a whole system is the way we talk about it. David picks up this idea from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) AGUS: So one of the fundamental problems we have in cancer is that right now, we describe it by a number of adjectives - symptoms. I'm tired, I'm bloated, I have pain, et cetera. You then have some anatomic descriptions. You get that CAT scan. There's a three centimeter mass in the liver. You then have some body part descriptions. It's in the liver, in the breast, in the prostate. And that's about it. So our dictionary for describing cancer is very, very poor. It's basically symptoms. It's manifestations of a disease. What's exciting is the government has spent 400 million dollars, and they've allocated another billion dollars to what we call The Cancer Genome Atlas project. So it is the idea of sequencing all of the genes in the cancer and giving us a new lexicon, a new dictionary to describe it. So obviously, the technology is here today, and over the next several years, that will change. You will no longer go to a breast cancer clinic. You will go to a HER2 amplified clinic or an EGFR activated clinic. And they will go to some of the pathogenic lesions that were involved in causing this individual cancer. RAZ: OK, so right now, if you're diagnosed with, say, breast cancer, right, you go to a breast-cancer specialist, and the doctor prescribes a standard treatment - usually a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, maybe radiation. But here's the thing. . . AGUS: There are probably dozens of kinds of breast cancer, dozens of kinds of prostate and lung cancer. And so going forward, we're going to start to define the parameters. I'm going to look at it and say this cancer can only live in the breast so just surgery is all we need. Or this one grows like a tree so we need to do surgery with radiation. Or this one can live elsewhere in the body so we need to give chemotherapy. So I think that's going to be the fundamental change here is that we're going to start to treat that whole individual, that complex system rather than just the cell. RAZ: David's idea here is that while we should treat cancer in the context of the body as just one part of a larger, complex system, we can do that without necessarily understanding how it all works. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) AGUS: The goal of me as a cancer doctor is not to understand cancer. And I think that's been the fundamental problem over the last five decades is that we have strived to understand cancer. The goal is to control cancer. And so the problem is, is that it's not just one system; it's multiple systems on multiple scales. It's a system of systems. What we're talking about in the body and cancer is starting to model it like a complex system. Well, the bad news is, is that these robust, and robust is a keyword, emergent systems are very hard to understand in detail. The good news is you can manipulate them. You can try to control them without that fundamental understanding of every component. RAZ: So you're saying we don't really need to understand cancer? I mean, there's just going to be things that we're never going to understand - we just have to accept and that's OK? AGUS: No question about it. We are never going to understand the complex things that are going on with these 20,000, 30,000 genes in the cell and then each of the cells that are contributing to all the environmental things and how they're connecting to it. Do you think anybody truly understands the economy? RAZ: No. AGUS: No, but at the same time, we can control it. We can raise interest rates, we can change money supply and other things we know can affect the economy in certain ways. That's how cancer's going to go. You know, a critical trial was done about 15 years ago where they took women with premenopausal breast cancer. And after treatment, when we normally wait until the reoccur and treat again, they divided the group into two. One got a drug that builds bone, a drug for osteoporosis, and one got placebo. And in that trial, they reduced recurrence of the breast cancer by over 40 percent. Why? Because breast cancer metastasizes to bone. RAZ: Wow. AGUS: So one of the most dramatic benefits across any cancer trial, and it was a drug that didn't even touch the cancer; it changed the system. RAZ: So I mean, if we eventually start to treat cancer more like part of a system - I mean, how far could this go? Like, what would a visit to a doctor's office be like? AGUS: Well, I think the doctor's visit of the future will be you go in, and we prick your finger and take a drop of blood. And that blood gives you a profile of everything going on at a moment in time. So it tells you what's going on; it's the state of the system, whether you're in a health state or a cancer state. So in the future when I treat the cancer, I may also change your body so the cancer doesn't want to go elsewhere and grow and make it inhospitable if you will. At the same time, I'm going to look and say why did he or she get cancer? Well, they had significant inflammation, and their body was receptive because this kind of tissue allows other cells to grow rather than just normal cells. And I'm going to change that or attempt to change that. So defining the system is going to be key. RAZ: I mean, if you think about, like, HIV-AIDs, right? I mean, 20 years ago this was a death sentence, and now, people live full lives with it. We've just figured out a way to control it. So I mean, sounds like what you're saying is that the goal isn't to cure cancer, but to kind of make sure that people can live with it. AGUS: Exactly, it's to stop it from growing. You know, listen, a tie is just as good as a win in a sense, right. If I stop a cancer from growing, and you live with cancer and die with cancer, it's just as good as me going these crazy, heroic, toxic ways to try to get rid of it. So, you know, people, as you alluded to, live a whole, normal life now with HIV by taking a medicine that suppresses it. I want to go that same direction in cancer. I want to change you so the cancer stops growing, and you can live a very fruitful and productive life and play with your children and your grandchildren and live till a ripe old age, which is what we all dream of.

I'm Guy Raz. On today's show, ideas about where we're headed in the fight against cancer, and we've been hearing about some of the super-advanced research that's revolutionizing our approach to cancer. But what if fighting cancer could be as simple as a healthy breakfast? DEAN ORNISH: (Laughter). RAZ: Yeah, what did you have? ORNISH: I had a bowl of whole-grain cereal with some blueberries and some low-sugar soymilk. RAZ: So listen up here. Take some notes. This is Dean Ornish. He's a professor of clinical medicine at UC San Francisco. But he's probably best known for the Dean Ornish Program. It's a lifestyle that includes. . . ORNISH: A whole foods, plant-based diet, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, soy products, moderate exercise, such as walking half an hour a day, various stress management techniques, yoga and meditation, and social support - really, love and intimacy - or in simple terms, you know, eat well, move more, stress less and love more. RAZ: And all of these things, he says, could help prevent, maybe even reverse, conditions like heart disease or type 2 diabetes and even slow the progression of some cancers. Now, that idea might not seem new today, but Dean Ornish was one of the very first doctors to actually test it out about 10 years ago. ORNISH: So we began a study with 93 men who had biopsy-proven prostate cancer and who had elected, for reasons unrelated to our study, not to be treated conventionally. RAZ: Meaning they didn't want to have surgery. ORNISH: They didn't want to have surgery or radiation or chemotherapy. So we found that by taking men who had decided not to be treated conventionally, we could then randomly divide them into two groups, put half of them on this intensive lifestyle program and half of them on their, you know, usual care. And then we measure them after a year. RAZ: So for half the men, the Dean Ornish Program, and the other half made no lifestyle changes. Dean picks up the story from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ORNISH: What we found was that after a year, none of the experimental group patients who made these lifestyle changes needed treatment, whereas six of the control group patients needed surgery or radiation. When we looked at their PSA levels, which is a marker for prostate cancer. . . RAZ: OK, so just to break in here. PSA stands for prostate specific antigen. It's a protein, and high levels of PSA in your blood usually indicates prostate cancer. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ORNISH: When we looked at their PSA levels, they got worse in the control group, but they actually got better in the experimental group, and these differences were highly significant. And then I wondered, was there any relationship between how much people change their diet and lifestyle, whichever group they were in, and the changes in PSA? And sure enough, we found a dose-response relationship, and in order for the PSA to go down, they had to make pretty big changes. RAZ: So the bigger the lifestyle changes, the bigger the drop in PSAs. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ORNISH: And finally I said, I wonder if there's any relationship between how much people change and how much it inhibited their tumor growth. And this really got me excited because, again, we found the same pattern - the more people change, the more it effected the growth of their tumors. And whether or not you have conventional treatment, in addition, if you make these changes, it may help reduce the risk of recurrence. RAZ: So Dean's talking about pretty big results for these men just from adopting a semi-vegan diet, walking, yoga, meditation and more time around the people they loved. ORNISH: We looked at some of the mechanisms to help explain why that may be true. We found, for example, that over 500 genes were changed in just three months. In fact, turning on the good genes that protect us and particularly down-regulating the - what are called oncogenes, that promote prostate, breast and colon cancer. The good ones were turned on, the bad ones were turned off. We then found that telomeres, the ends of our chromosomes that control aging, and as they're likened to the plastic tips at the ends of shoelaces that keep your shoelace from unraveling, they help to keep your DNA from unraveling. And normally, as we get older, our telomeres get shorter. And as our telomeres get shorter, our risk of cancer and heart disease and dementia and pretty much everything goes up correspondingly. We found that these same lifestyle changes could lengthen telomeres by about 10 percent in men with early-stage prostate cancer. You know, so often people say, oh, I've just got bad genes, you know, what can I do about? Well, it turns out you can do a lot, and much more quickly than we had once thought possible if you simply make intensive changes in diet and lifestyle. RAZ: So when you started looking into this kind of thing, right, like, basically lifestyle changes, were your colleagues or other doctors saying, like, this is crackpot stuff? ORNISH: Oh, very much so. They'd say, oh, this is so touchy-feely. And I'd say yeah, no, no, look at our quantitative arteriograms and our cardiac positron emission tomography and radionuclide ventriculography and blah, blah, blah. And then one day I said, you know, this is touchy-feely. That's what makes it work so well. And we know that these things affect the quality of our lives, but they actually affect our survival. You know, study after study have shown that people who are lonely and depressed are 3 to 10 times more likely to get sick and die prematurely when compared to those who have a sense of love and connection and community. And so we bring that into our program, not as something that's confounding, but as what enables people to make sustainable changes because it fulfills a deep, primal need for connection and community - this human need that we have. Now again, a skeptic might say, oh, give me a break. You mean talking about my feelings is going to help me live longer if I've got cancer, please. And yet, that's what these studies show because we are touchy-feely creatures. We are creatures of community. RAZ: There are a lot of studies that - a lot of what determines who gets cancer and who doesn't is just bad luck. ORNISH: Well, there is an element of luck or mystery or karma or destiny or whatever, you know, system you want to put this in. But that doesn't mean that if you change your lifestyle, you're going to be guaranteed you're never going to get cancer or heart disease or other conditions. And nor is it true that it's all random either. They're somewhere in the middle. But we have more control than we had once thought, and I find that very empowering. And it does give many people new hope and new choices that they didn't have before. And so what I find really makes these changes sustainable is not fear of dying, it's joy of living. That when you change your diet and exercise and do yoga and meditation and have more love and support in your life, most people find that they feel so much better so quickly, it reframes the reason for making these changes from fear to joy and pleasure, and that ultimately is what makes them worth doing. RAZ: Dean Ornish, he's a professor of medicine at UC San Francisco. His TED talk is at ted. com. By the way, if you're curious, we've put up links to his studies on lifestyle and prostate cancer. You can find them at ted. npr. org. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz.

I'm Guy Raz. Jorge Soto grew up in Mexico. His parents are both doctors there, and like doctors anywhere, they work a lot. So when Jorge was a kid, his Aunt Maty was the one who would look after him. JORGE SOTO: So she used to take care of me. We played video games together. She even taught me how to cook. So she was that kind of person. She took care of me whenever I needed. RAZ: Today, Jorge is an engineer. He lives in the Bay Area now. And it was only recently his Aunt Maty was the one who needed taking care of. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: Almost a year ago, my aunt started suffering back pains. She went to see a doctor, and they told her that it was a normal injury for someone that had been playing tennis for almost 30 years. They recommended her do some therapy. RAZ: That was Jorge on the TED stage in 2014. His aunt, she wasn't suffering from a tennis injury. She had lung cancer. But it would take months and a series of different tests before they even diagnosed it. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: Her lifestyle was almost free of risk. She never smoked a cigarette. She never drank alcohol, and she had been playing sports for almost half her life. So it was - she didn't fit the profile of a person that you could suspect that has lung cancer. RAZ: Which is why an injury or a nasty infection, at least initially, seemed more likely. SOTO: She also used to volunteer at a hospital. So they actually thought that it was tuberculosis. So they did a study for tuberculosis. It was negative so that was the moment when they decided, OK, let's go biopsy because we have no idea what it is. RAZ: And at this point, when Jorge's aunt got a biopsy, that's when you'd expect things to finally move faster. But, in fact, it was just the opposite. SOTO: Well, Mexico, although it's an emerging economy and we have very sophisticated hospitals in general - still, if she wanted to get her biopsy done, she needed to travel five hours to Mexico City to the closest hospital that could process her biopsy. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: And two weeks later, the results of the biopsy came back. It was stage three lung cancer. RAZ: And at that stage, stage three, only eight percent of people live beyond five years. Now, the thing is Jorge's aunt wasn't diagnosed any differently in Mexico than she would have been anywhere else. The only difference there was that it took a lot more time. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: But that process of going back and forth with new tests, different doctor, describing symptoms, discarding diseases over and over was stressful and frustrating. And that is the way cancer diagnoses have been done since the beginning of history. However, today, my aunt, she's fighting bravely and going through this process with a very positive attitude. RAZ: Again, this was Jorge in late 2014 when he gave his TED Talk. SOTO: And one month or so after the TED Talk, the cancer spread in - all over her body, and we spent Christmas and New Year's Eve together, all - the entire family. And she knew what was going to happen, and everybody knew, and we enjoyed our time together. And she was very calm and happy. RAZ: That must have been so hard. SOTO: Yeah. Yeah, it's a very unfair disease. It's very unfair that - both how it's being diagnosed and how it's being treated. RAZ: The tragic irony of this story is that long before his Aunt Maty died of cancer and even during her struggle to get a diagnosis, Jorge Soto was in a lab in Silicon Valley working on an invention to make cancer easier to detect. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: Today, cancer detection happens mainly when symptoms appear; that is in stage three or four. And I believe that is too late. It is too expensive for our families. It is too expensive for humanity. It not only cost us billions of dollars, but it also cost us the people we love. One out of three people sitting in this audience will be diagnosed with some type of cancer, and one out of four will die because of it. RAZ: So how do we change those numbers? Because the story they now tell is that you or someone close to you will get this disease. So we're going to spend this hour looking at where we are in the fight against cancer, and how a whole new way of thinking about it could change how we treat it, maybe even live with it, more like a chronic disease than a fatal one. SOTO: I think, in general in the next 10 to 15 years, cancer, it will be a very controllable disease. It will be a condition like HIV or diabetes. It is not good news, but it is not tragic news. RAZ: So to get to that point, Jorge Soto and a team of scientists are working on a way to give cancer patients the one thing his aunt didn't have - time. Here's more from Jorge's TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: Today, the majority of people still don't have access to early cancer detection methods, even though we know that catching cancer early is basically the closest thing we have two a silver bullet cure against it. We know that we can change this in our lifetime, and that is why my team and I have decided to begin this journey; this journey to try to make cancer detection at the early stages easier, cheaper, smarter and more accessible than ever before. The context, of course, is that we're living at a time where technology is disrupting our present at exponential rates. And based on recent scientific discoveries, we believe that we have found a reliable and accurate way of detecting several types of cancer at the very early stages through a blood sample. We do it by detecting a set of very small molecules that secrete freely in our blood called microRNAs. RAZ: So microRNAs - these are basically tiny molecules that are associated with specific cells and tissues in our bodies. Scientists first discovered this in 1993. SOTO: So, for example, there are set of microRNAs that should only be found in the heart, a set of microRNAs that should only be found in the liver and so on. RAZ: And until pretty recently. . . SOTO: . . . That's what we knew. But in 2008. . . RAZ: In 2008, Scientists discovered that damage to specific parts of the body releases specific microRNAs into the bloodstream. SOTO: For example, microRNA-1, that's the heart microRNA. RAZ: If that microRNA pattern is floating around in your blood. . . SOTO: . . . That means that there's a problem with heart, and the heart cells are being broken apart. RAZ: So microRNA is like - it's like this little bubble inside of your bloodstream that's saying wait, I have this information, you may want to know it. SOTO: Yeah. I shouldn't be here. RAZ: But there's a problem with microRNAs. SOTO: You cannot detect them with existing technology. RAZ: At least not easily. SOTO: The technology today that detects microRNAs are either extremely expensive, like a sequencer, and they require highly trained scientists. RAZ: So Jorge and his team are working on a new way to test for microRNAs, these very small biomarkers that could indicate cancer in its early stages. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: We believe that we have found a way to do so. And this is the first time that we're sharing in public. Let me do a demonstration. RAZ: OK, so just to pause here - what Jorge did on the TED stage was very visual. So I'm just going to interrupt his flow for a moment to describe it. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: Imagine that next time you go to your doctor and do your next standard blood test. RAZ: So imagine a simple blood test at your next doctor's visit. SOTO: Any neighborhood lab can do it. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: And puts it in a standardized well plate like this one. RAZ: So you take your blood sample and you drop it into 96 tiny wells on a specially designed plastic lab plate. It's about the size of an iPhone 6 Plus. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: Each well of these plates. . . RAZ: And each well is coated with a specific biochemical agent. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: . . . That is looking for a specific microRNA, acting like a trap that closes only when the microRNA is present in the sample. RAZ: The biochemical agents in those traps are specially designed to react in the presence of specific microRNAs. So after you've dropped in the blood sample, you take that plate. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: You put the plate inside a device like this one. RAZ: He shows a sealed device, it's about the size of a crockpot. SOTO: It's just creating heating conditions and luminosity conditions. RAZ: The conditions for a chemical reaction to begin. And then, a step that makes this technology cheaper and easier than anything out there. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: And then you can put your smartphone on top of it. A smartphone is a connected computer. And it's also a camera; good enough for our purpose. RAZ: A smartphone sitting on top of the device runs an app. SOTO: That is taking pictures. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: The smartphone is taking pictures. RAZ: And the smartphone can detect which of those biochemical wells start to glow if specific microRNAs are trapped. SOTO: It takes pictures every minute. (SOUNDBITE OF CAMERA SHUTTER)SOTO: And it's comparing which ones are shining, how much and how fast and sending that information to our servers. RAZ: A smartphone uses cloud data to analyze the photos. There's no highly trained doctor that needs to interpret the data. And it means that this test can go anywhere a smart phone can. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: This entire process lasts around 60 minutes. But when the process is over, this inside is a real sample where we just detected pancreatic cancer. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: OK, this was amazing to see. It's incredible, but for now, the machine can only test for a few very specific cancers. And then there's another obstacle, which is that microRNAs don't just appear in blood when you have cancer, they can also show up. . . SOTO: If you had, let's say, a hard party last night. RAZ: When you have a hangover. SOTO: You will find the microRNAs circulating. So we need to understand. . . RAZ: Or a broken arm or a cold - microRNAs will be detectable. But Jorge's test is getting better and better at figuring out the difference. And if the tests continue to show encouraging results, it could be a standard part of your annual physical within the next three years. SOTO: And I don't think it will replace 100 percent all the other screening tests that we have today in three years, but it will be much more available. And let's say in the next 10 years, medicine will change forever. It will not be reactive, it will be prevented. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOTO: Let me say very clearly that we are at the very early stages. But so far, we have been able to successfully identify the microRNA pattern of pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer and hepatic cancer. And currently, we're doing a clinical trial in collaboration with the German Cancer Research Center with 200 women for breast cancer. (APPLAUSE)SOTO: It is single, noninvasive, accurate and affordable test that has the potential to dramatically change how cancer procedures and diagnostics have been done. Since we are looking for the microRNA patterns in your blood at any given time, you don't need to know which cancer you're looking for. You don't need to have symptoms. You only need one milliliter of blood and a relatively simple array of tools. And I am certain that in the very near future, because of this and other breakthroughs that we're seeing every day in life sciences, the way we see cancer will radically change. It will give us a chance of detecting it early, understanding it better and finding a cure. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Jorge Soto. He's an early detection cancer engineer. His company is called Miroculus. Their cancer detection technology, by the way, will be made open source. You can see Jorge's talk at ted. com. More ideas about fighting cancer in a moment. I'm Guy Raz, and this is the TED Radio Hour from NPR. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. Jorge Soto grew up in Mexico. His parents are both doctors there, and like doctors anywhere, they work a lot. So when Jorge was a kid, his Aunt Maty was the one who would look after him. JORGE SOTO: So she used to take care of me. We played video games together. She even taught me how to cook. So she was that kind of person. She took care of me whenever I needed. RAZ: Today, Jorge is an engineer. He lives in the Bay Area now. And it was only recently his Aunt Maty was the one who needed taking care of. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SOTO: Almost a year ago, my aunt started suffering back pains. She went to see a doctor, and they told her that it was a normal injury for someone that had been playing tennis for almost 30 years. They recommended her do some therapy. RAZ: That was Jorge on the TED stage in 2014. His aunt, she wasn't suffering from a tennis injury. She had lung cancer. But it would take months and a series of different tests before they even diagnosed it. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SOTO: Her lifestyle was almost free of risk. She never smoked a cigarette. She never drank alcohol, and she had been playing sports for almost half her life. So it was - she didn't fit the profile of a person that you could suspect that has lung cancer. RAZ: Which is why an injury or a nasty infection, at least initially, seemed more likely. SOTO: She also used to volunteer at a hospital. So they actually thought that it was tuberculosis. So they did a study for tuberculosis. It was negative so that was the moment when they decided, OK, let's go biopsy because we have no idea what it is. RAZ: And at this point, when Jorge's aunt got a biopsy, that's when you'd expect things to finally move faster. But, in fact, it was just the opposite. SOTO: Well, Mexico, although it's an emerging economy and we have very sophisticated hospitals in general - still, if she wanted to get her biopsy done, she needed to travel five hours to Mexico City to the closest hospital that could process her biopsy. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SOTO: And two weeks later, the results of the biopsy came back. It was stage three lung cancer. RAZ: And at that stage, stage three, only eight percent of people live beyond five years. Now, the thing is Jorge's aunt wasn't diagnosed any differently in Mexico than she would have been anywhere else. The only difference there was that it took a lot more time. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SOTO: But that process of going back and forth with new tests, different doctor, describing symptoms, discarding diseases over and over was stressful and frustrating. And that is the way cancer diagnoses have been done since the beginning of history. However, today, my aunt, she's fighting bravely and going through this process with a very positive attitude. RAZ: Again, this was Jorge in late 2014 when he gave his TED Talk. SOTO: And one month or so after the TED Talk, the cancer spread in - all over her body, and we spent Christmas and New Year's Eve together, all - the entire family. And she knew what was going to happen, and everybody knew, and we enjoyed our time together. And she was very calm and happy. RAZ: That must have been so hard. SOTO: Yeah. Yeah, it's a very unfair disease. It's very unfair that - both how it's being diagnosed and how it's being treated. RAZ: The tragic irony of this story is that long before his Aunt Maty died of cancer and even during her struggle to get a diagnosis, Jorge Soto was in a lab in Silicon Valley working on an invention to make cancer easier to detect. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SOTO: Today, cancer detection happens mainly when symptoms appear; that is in stage three or four. And I believe that is too late. It is too expensive for our families. It is too expensive for humanity. It not only cost us billions of dollars, but it also cost us the people we love. One out of three people sitting in this audience will be diagnosed with some type of cancer, and one out of four will die because of it. RAZ: So how do we change those numbers? Because the story they now tell is that you or someone close to you will get this disease. So we're going to spend this hour looking at where we are in the fight against cancer, and how a whole new way of thinking about it could change how we treat it, maybe even live with it, more like a chronic disease than a fatal one. SOTO: I think, in general in the next 10 to 15 years, cancer, it will be a very controllable disease. It will be a condition like HIV or diabetes. It is not good news, but it is not tragic news. RAZ: So to get to that point, Jorge Soto and a team of scientists are working on a way to give cancer patients the one thing his aunt didn't have - time. Here's more from Jorge's TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SOTO: Today, the majority of people still don't have access to early cancer detection methods, even though we know that catching cancer early is basically the closest thing we have two a silver bullet cure against it. We know that we can change this in our lifetime, and that is why my team and I have decided to begin this journey; this journey to try to make cancer detection at the early stages easier, cheaper, smarter and more accessible than ever before. The context, of course, is that we're living at a time where technology is disrupting our present at exponential rates. And based on recent scientific discoveries, we believe that we have found a reliable and accurate way of detecting several types of cancer at the very early stages through a blood sample. We do it by detecting a set of very small molecules that secrete freely in our blood called microRNAs. RAZ: So microRNAs - these are basically tiny molecules that are associated with specific cells and tissues in our bodies. Scientists first discovered this in 1993. SOTO: So, for example, there are set of microRNAs that should only be found in the heart, a set of microRNAs that should only be found in the liver and so on. RAZ: And until pretty recently. . . SOTO: . . . That's what we knew. But in 2008. . . RAZ: In 2008, Scientists discovered that damage to specific parts of the body releases specific microRNAs into the bloodstream. SOTO: For example, microRNA-1, that's the heart microRNA. RAZ: If that microRNA pattern is floating around in your blood. . . SOTO: . . . That means that there's a problem with heart, and the heart cells are being broken apart. RAZ: So microRNA is like - it's like this little bubble inside of your bloodstream that's saying wait, I have this information, you may want to know it. SOTO: Yeah. I shouldn't be here. RAZ: But there's a problem with microRNAs. SOTO: You cannot detect them with existing technology. RAZ: At least not easily. SOTO: The technology today that detects microRNAs are either extremely expensive, like a sequencer, and they require highly trained scientists. RAZ: So Jorge and his team are working on a new way to test for microRNAs, these very small biomarkers that could indicate cancer in its early stages. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SOTO: We believe that we have found a way to do so. And this is the first time that we're sharing in public. Let me do a demonstration. RAZ: OK, so just to pause here - what Jorge did on the TED stage was very visual. So I'm just going to interrupt his flow for a moment to describe it. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SOTO: Imagine that next time you go to your doctor and do your next standard blood test. RAZ: So imagine a simple blood test at your next doctor's visit. SOTO: Any neighborhood lab can do it. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SOTO: And puts it in a standardized well plate like this one. RAZ: So you take your blood sample and you drop it into 96 tiny wells on a specially designed plastic lab plate. It's about the size of an iPhone 6 Plus. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SOTO: Each well of these plates. . . RAZ: And each well is coated with a specific biochemical agent. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SOTO: . . . That is looking for a specific microRNA, acting like a trap that closes only when the microRNA is present in the sample. RAZ: The biochemical agents in those traps are specially designed to react in the presence of specific microRNAs. So after you've dropped in the blood sample, you take that plate. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SOTO: You put the plate inside a device like this one. RAZ: He shows a sealed device, it's about the size of a crockpot. SOTO: It's just creating heating conditions and luminosity conditions. RAZ: The conditions for a chemical reaction to begin. And then, a step that makes this technology cheaper and easier than anything out there. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SOTO: And then you can put your smartphone on top of it. A smartphone is a connected computer. And it's also a camera; good enough for our purpose. RAZ: A smartphone sitting on top of the device runs an app. SOTO: That is taking pictures. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SOTO: The smartphone is taking pictures. RAZ: And the smartphone can detect which of those biochemical wells start to glow if specific microRNAs are trapped. SOTO: It takes pictures every minute. (SOUNDBITE OF CAMERA SHUTTER) SOTO: And it's comparing which ones are shining, how much and how fast and sending that information to our servers.

(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SOTO: This entire process lasts around 60 minutes. But when the process is over, this inside is a real sample where we just detected pancreatic cancer. (APPLAUSE) RAZ: OK, this was amazing to see. It's incredible, but for now, the machine can only test for a few very specific cancers. And then there's another obstacle, which is that microRNAs don't just appear in blood when you have cancer, they can also show up. . . SOTO: If you had, let's say, a hard party last night.

I'm Guy Raz. Today on the show, ideas about where we are and where we're headed in the fight against cancer. And one place at the front lines of the battle is a research lab in Boston. It's called the Bradner Lab. And on its website, there's a little tab that you can click. It's up on the right-hand corner, and it just says request probes. JAY BRADNER: That's right. RAZ: Yeah. And what does that do? BRADNER: So the probe request button will trigger a page where scientists around the world can learn about molecules that our lab has created and have made available for open-source drug discovery. RAZ: Jay Bradner is the guy who makes the probes. BRADNER: I'm a physician at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. RAZ: And by probes, we mean molecules - molecules that could act like drugs in the fight against cancer. And after Jay Bradner and his lab develop these molecules, they share them. And in the world of drug development, that's kind of a new thing. BRADNER: You see, pharmaceutical science is perhaps one of the most secretive fields in technology development, second only perhaps to defense contractors. I think that we're starting to see this change. RAZ: He described why that change has started to happen just in the past 10 years and what it could mean for the future from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BRADNER: It's fair to say that in these 10 years, we've witnessed absolutely the start of a scientific revolution, that of genome medicine. We know more about the patients that enter our clinic now than ever before. And we're able finally to answer the question that's been so pressing for so many years - why do I have cancer? This information is also pretty staggering. You might know that so far in just the dawn of this revolution, we know that there are perhaps 40,000 unique mutations affecting more than 10,000 genes and that there are 500 of these genes that are bona fide drivers - causes of cancer. Yet comparatively, we have about a dozen targeted medications. And this inadequacy of cancer medicine really hit home when my father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. It's been known for decades what causes this malignancy. It's three proteins - Ras, Myc, P53. This is old information we've known since about the '80s, yet there's no Ras, no Myc, no P53 drug. And you might fairly ask why is that? And the very unsatisfying, yet scientific answer is it's too hard. RAZ: And the reason why it's too hard is because so far, scientists haven't been able to figure out how to switch off or block most of the genes that cause cancer. BRADNER: To put it simplistically, there's a gene called Myc. This gene is in your body to activate, like the conductor of an orchestra, the five to 15 percent of genes in your genome involved in cell duplication. RAZ: So Myc, which is one of the most well-studied genes, tells your cells to grow. But cancer. . . BRADNER: . . . Almost uniformly. . . RAZ: Sends Myc into overdrive. It hijacks the genes, tells cells to keep dividing and dividing and dividing and dividing. . . BRADNER: You see, if we could inhibit Myc, it would have historic value in the treatment of cancer. But at this moment, this Myc gene, this central conductor of the cancer growth symphony, is considered undruggable. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BRADNER: Which is like calling a computer unsurfable or the moon unwalkable. It's a horrible term of trade. But what it means is that we've failed to identify a greasy pocket in these proteins into which we, like molecular locksmiths, can fashion an active, small, organic molecule or drug substance. RAZ: So this is actually a very physical problem. Scientists need to know what kind of shape a specific protein has in order to design a drug molecule that can bind to it and then block it or even change it. And in the past couple of years, new technologies have led to huge leaps forward in how scientists are tackling that problem. BRADNER: Such as the use of three-dimensional pictures that can help to find nooks and crannies where a drug molecule might bind. RAZ: The place where a drug molecule could bind, by the way, is called the target. BRADNER: There have been advances in chemistry, a reconsideration of what does a molecule need to look like in order to occupy its target? Imagine reinventing the key. RAZ: And those advances in chemistry. . . BRADNER: . . . Together. . . RAZ: . . . Jay Bradner says. . . BRADNER: . . . Have created now, I believe, enough examples of molecules targeting undruggable targets that truly nothing is undruggable. RAZ: Including even the Myc gene. BRADNER: The Myc gene that turns on the growth program of the human cell, like the conductor of an orchestra. RAZ: Jay and his team of researchers knew that Myc played a big role in the growth of certain cancers. And they thought that that role might have something to do with a certain protein called BRD4. BRADNER: BRD4, it does not stand for Bradner. I wish that it did. This BRD4 protein is very important because the Myc gene we hypothesized might require BRD4 as a cofactor or a drinking buddy. RAZ: BRD4, they guessed, often got Myc into a lot of trouble. So Jay Bradner's idea was. . . BRADNER: . . . To circumvent the behaviors of the master cancer-causing gene, Myc. RAZ: They needed a drug molecule specifically designed. . . BRADNER: . . . To bind to and inhibit BRD4. RAZ: A molecule like that could basically make cancer cells forget they were cancer. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BRADNER: And so we started to work on this problem. We developed libraries of compounds and eventually arrived at a molecule developed at my lab at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute called JQ1, which we affectionately named for Jun Qi, the chemist that made this molecule. Now, not being a drug company, we could do certain things. We had certain flexibilities that our respective pharmaceutical industry does not have. We just started mailing it to our friends. (LAUGHTER)BRADNER: I have a small lab. We thought we'd just send it to people and see how the molecule behaves. And we sent it to Oxford, England, where a group of talented crystallographers provided this picture, which helped us understand exactly how this molecule is so potent for this protein target. It's what we call a perfect fit of shape complementarity or hand-in-glove. Now, this is a very rare cancer, this BRD4-addicted cancer. And as we treated these cells with this molecule, we observed something really striking. The cancer cells - small, round and rapidly dividing - grew these arms and extensions. They were changing shape. In effect, the cancer cell was forgetting it was cancer and becoming a normal cell. RAZ: So what Jay and his team did next was to turn this molecule into a drug. And they began testing it on a group of mice. BRADNER: About 14 mice. RAZ: Mice with cancerous tumors. BRADNER: Seven mice would receive the drug and seven would not. Over the next 14 days, we observed something very striking. All of the mice that received the drug were thriving, and the tumors were no longer even palpable. RAZ: Wow. BRADNER: The mice that did not receive the drug, unfortunately, had progressed disease and did not survive. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BRADNER: So we started to wonder - what would a drug company do at this point? Well, they probably would keep this a secret until they turned a prototype drug into an active pharmaceutical substance. And so we did just the opposite. We published a paper that described this finding at the earliest prototype stage. We gave the world the chemical identity of this molecule, typically a secret in our discipline. We told people exactly how to make it. We gave them our email address suggesting that if they write us, we'll send them free molecule. (LAUGHTER)BRADNER: We basically tried to create the most competitive environment for our lab as possible. And this was, unfortunately, successful because now we have shared this molecule, just since December of last year, with 40 laboratories in the United States and 30 more in Europe. RAZ: And by sharing this molecule far and wide, Jay Bradner gave scientists all over the world a chance to invent drugs based on his original JQ1 molecule. And already, he says, six other molecules have reached human clinical trials. BRADNER: One of these molecules that looks just like JQ1 and acts just like JQ1 has shown remarkable activity in patients with advanced blood cancers. At least one patient had a complete response to this medication, meaning that where 100 percent of their bone marrow was occupied by leukemia cells, after about 90 days of therapy, there was no evidence of leukemia at all. RAZ: That's incredible. BRADNER: It's amazing. RAZ: Do we - I mean, we often hear, like, oh, we're at the brink of this or that, but, like, are we - like, do you think we're at an inflection point, like, we are at the brink of something really big changing in cancer treatment? BRADNER: I do believe that we're at an inflection point. I think, again, about the software industry, where source code is freely available on GitHub. But one of the best applications of source code are for computer scientists to bring it back to their garage, to innovate around it, to do something that changes the way that we access the Internet on our telephone or wake up in the morning to your favorite song. But I go to bed at night, I'm very comfortable that there's $1 billion out there for someone who cures cancer because open-source drug discovery will bring many people to this historic challenge. RAZ: Jay Bradner works at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and teaches at Harvard Medical School. You can get your hands on his molecules at bradnerlab. com.

We told people exactly how to make it. We gave them our email address suggesting that if they write us, we'll send them free molecule. (LAUGHTER) BRADNER: We basically tried to create the most competitive environment for our lab as possible. And this was, unfortunately, successful because now we have shared this molecule, just since December of last year, with 40 laboratories in the United States and 30 more in Europe. RAZ: And by sharing this molecule far and wide, Jay Bradner gave scientists all over the world a chance to invent drugs based on his original JQ1 molecule. And already, he says, six other molecules have reached human clinical trials. BRADNER: One of these molecules that looks just like JQ1 and acts just like JQ1 has shown remarkable activity in patients with advanced blood cancers. At least one patient had a complete response to this medication, meaning that where 100 percent of their bone marrow was occupied by leukemia cells, after about 90 days of therapy, there was no evidence of leukemia at all. RAZ: That's incredible. BRADNER: It's amazing. RAZ: Do we - I mean, we often hear, like, oh, we're at the brink of this or that, but, like, are we - like, do you think we're at an inflection point, like, we are at the brink of something really big changing in cancer treatment? BRADNER: I do believe that we're at an inflection point. I think, again, about the software industry, where source code is freely available on GitHub. But one of the best applications of source code are for computer scientists to bring it back to their garage, to innovate around it, to do something that changes the way that we access the Internet on our telephone or wake up in the morning to your favorite song. But I go to bed at night, I'm very comfortable that there's $1 billion out there for someone who cures cancer because open-source drug discovery will bring many people to this historic challenge. RAZ: Jay Bradner works at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and teaches at Harvard Medical School.

It's a pilot project in the same patch of water where Cape Wind failed. Rhode Island's project has so far sailed through in comparison. Ambar Espinoza of Rhode Island Public Radio has the story. AMBAR ESPINOZA, BYLINE: It's been seven years since Rhode Island set out to do this, and now it's actually happening. (CHEERING, FOG HORN)ESPINOZA: Aboard a ferry, state and federal officials took a close look at a steel structure poking out of the ocean. It's the first foundation affixed to the sea floor for a five-turbine wind farm off the state's coast. (CHEERING)ESPINOZA: It's a contrast to what's happening off the coast of Massachusetts. Developer Cape Wind has spent more than 10 years and millions of dollars on a massive wind farm that it may never build. Jeff Grybowski is a CEO of Deepwater Wind, the company building the offshore wind farm in Rhode Island. He explains why this project is moving forward. JEFF GRYBOWSKI: One, we've got a great location. ESPINOZA: The wind farm will sit 3 miles off the coast of Block Island, about 12 miles away from the mainland. GRYBOWSKI: The location off of the southeast corner of Block Island has incredibly strong wind, and it is quite far from the mainland. ESPINOZA: Far enough from the mainland that most people won't see the turbines nearly 600 feet tall. As Grybowski points out, the state of Rhode Island wanted to pioneer this project and chose where to build it. GRYBOWSKI: That was based on many years of research and public discussion. ESPINOZA: Deepwater Wind underwent far more extensive impact studies than Cape Wind, and the company spent more time engaging important stakeholders. Not everyone in Rhode Island loved the project from the start, but unlike Cape Cod, Block Island is eager to replace its expensive source of energy. DAVID MILNER: We are one of the highest rates in the country. ESPINOZA: David Milner is a general manager for the Block Island Power Company, which supplies all of the island's electricity by importing a million gallons of diesel oil every year. MILNER: We get up over 50 cents a kilowatt-hour, which is a huge burden on the businesses out here and the individuals. ESPINOZA: In New England, the average rate is 16 cents per kilowatt-hour. Year-round Block Island resident Peter Baute is standing on the iconic Mohegan Bluffs, which boasts panoramic views of the Atlantic Ocean. PETER BAUTE: That's interesting. There's two platforms out there. Let's just take a look. ESPINOZA: Buate narrows his eyes as he lifts up binoculars to check out the construction of the offshore wind farm. It promises to reduce electricity costs by 40 percent. He says that'll go a long way for an island who's economy relies on summer tourists because it's home to only about a thousand people for the rest of the year. BAUTE: You've got to work hard to make a living in, you know, June, July, August and maybe part of September. You've got four months max to break even. ESPINOZA: When the turbines aren't spinning, the island will draw energy from the mainland through an underwater transmission cable that's part of the wind project. That cable could also bring high-speed Internet to the island, another selling point. Still, a vocal minority of island residents are skeptical about the anticipated benefits of the offshore wind farm. Edith Blane doesn't think it's worth trading in ocean views. EDITH BLANE: So that the beauty and the calm and the stillness and the loveliness of a summer night, it's never going to be the same again. ESPINOZA: With construction underway, Deepwater Wind is on track to build the nation's first offshore wind farm.

It could lead to solar and wind energy becoming more widespread. But for many utility companies, that storage is still way out of reach. It's expensive, sometimes more expensive than building out old-fashioned infrastructure like power lines and power plants. Wyoming Public Radio's Leigh Paterson reports on the point at which energy storage becomes worth it. LEIGH PATERSON, BYLINE: For people like Jim and Lyn Schneider, their decision to invest in battery storage came four years ago when they moved to central Wyoming. JIM SCHNEIDER: Well, like right now, you sit and listen, and it's so quiet. PATERSON: We walked through sagebrush in the backyard. It's ringed by red rocks on one side and wide-open prairie on another. They love it. But when the Schneiders bought this land four years ago, it was missing one thing. LYN SCHNEIDER: Electricity (laughter). It's like wow, we're going to have to be really primitive. PATERSON: That's because the utility company was going to charge them around $80,000 to bring electricity to the property. Installing solar panels and batteries was also expensive but a little bit cheaper. J. SCHNEIDER: This is our battery box. PATERSON: It's filled with 12 red batteries, each about the size of a brown paper grocery bag. The system functions, but it's work. J. SCHNEIDER: I didn't know there'd be as much maintenance to it, you know? L. SCHNEIDER: He's got a clipboard with a bunch of sheets on it that I don't know anything about, so. . . J. SCHNEIDER: (Laughter). PATERSON: Batteries can also be toxic, and they die. The Schneiders have to replace three of theirs this summer. L. SCHNEIDER: Which batteries are bad? J. SCHNEIDER: I don't know. I'd have to look at the sheet. PATERSON: Their experience illustrates the problems with energy storage, problems that are a big disincentive for large utility companies. BRIAN WARSHAY: Typical grid infrastructure, what utilities tend to invest in, are equipment and projects that last decades - 10, 20, 30, 40 years. PATERSON: That's Brian Warshay, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. WARSHAY: Energy storage has a big question mark on whether it can meet some of those rigorous lifetime operational requirements. PATERSON: And then there's the price tag. The Department of Energy predicts that in order for battery storage to become economically viable, costs would need to be cut in more than half. And it's something that big companies all are working on. Tesla Motors, the electric car manufacturer, recently unveiled its Powerwall, a home battery that it's also marketing to utilities. Other companies are banking away electricity in compressed air, molten salt, in the spinning wheels of a train and in gigantic blocks of ice. WARSHAY: Right now we're at 50. 5 volts, 6 volts. PATERSON: All day, Jim and Lyn Schneider keep an eye on a digital power gauge in their kitchen because for them, energy storage is not a developing technology or a useful add-on to the grid. The Schneiders rely on solar during the day and conserve battery power for nighttime use. Lyn was reminded of how unusual this is on a recent trip to visit her daughter in Iowa. L. SCHNEIDER: I got up in the morning and go, oh, look, the sun's up; I can have toast. And she goes, Mom, you're in Iowa; you can have toast anytime you want (laughter).

They are continually changing those songs. (SOUNDBITE OF HUMPBACK WHALE VOCALIZATIONS)GREENE: Scientists discovered this through close listening, decoding nature through sound. That's MORNING EDITION's latest project with NPR correspondent Christopher Joyce and audio producer Bill McQuay from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Today, they tell the story of how whale biologist Katy Payne discovered whale song. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: The first scientist to realize that whales sing songs were Katy and Roger Payne. In fact, it was this recording they heard. (SOUNDBITE OF HUMPBACK WHALE VOCALIZATIONS)BILL MCQUAY: Katy's now in her late 70s. We asked her to come to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology to listen again and describe that moment. KATY PAYNE: It's the voice of a male humpback whale in the offshore banks off of Bermuda in 1964. It was recorded by a Navy engineer. JOYCE: The Navy engineer was Frank Watlington. The Paynes met him on a trip to Bermuda. He shared their passion for whales. He invited the Paynes aboard his ship. PAYNE: We had no idea we were going to hear anything. He said I don't suppose you've ever heard the sounds that these animals make. JOYCE: And then he played the song of the humpback whale. (SOUNDBITE OF HUMPBACK WHALE VOCALIZATIONS)PAYNE: I had never heard anything like it, oh my God. Tears flowed from our cheeks. You know, we were just completely transfixed and amazed because the sounds were so beautiful, so powerful, so variable. And as we eventually learned, they were all the products of one singing animal - one animal. MCQUAY: Watlington had been recording with underwater microphones - hydrophones. The Navy used hydrophones to listen for enemy ships. PAYNE: I don't think anybody knew what he was picking up except himself, and he kept it a secret. MCQUAY: Watlington said he was afraid whalers would use the songs to find and kill whales. He gave the tapes to the Paynes, and said go save the whales. JOYCE: These tapes were a revelation. And there was something peculiar about the sounds - something the Paynes didn't realize at first. It took Katy's special skill to discover it. PAYNE: I majored in music with biology as a secondary - whatever, major - but I was sort of my own person, really. I was always watching and listening to animals. JOYCE: Payne took the tapes home. She was taking care of her four young children at the time. When she could find time, she listened and lost herself in another world. PAYNE: OK, we call this the beginning sound. (SOUNDBITE OF HUMPBACK WHALE VOCALIZATIONS)PAYNE: Do you hear echoes - from the bottom of the sea, the underside of the wave? Every sound, all the whales are listening. They're listening. They've memorized this song. MCQUAY: Katy wanted to see the sounds, so she got spectrograms of them - visual representations of sound with peaks and valleys and gaps. She traced them with a pencil and paper. JOYCE: She began to see structure, what looked like melodies and rhythms. It was pattern recognition, seeing what she initially heard. PAYNE: It's a crazy sort of arrhythmic portion of the song. But it's coming into another rhythmic portion. JOYCE: It's going up in pitch. PAYNE: Yes, not random. (SOUNDBITE OF HUMPBACK WHALE VOCALIZATIONS)MCQUAY: Not random is a key concept here. Lots of animals have calls or vocalization. JOYCE: Right, but these vocalizations were changing, evolving. At any one time, all the humpbacks in the population sing the song in the same way. As time passes, though, all parts of the song change - in rhythm, in pitch, in duration - and all the whales repeat the changes. They were creating new songs - composing. And Katy has actually memorized many of these songs. She can sing them note for note. MCQUAY: She sang one for us to show how the whale changes its song. PAYNE: Here's a comparison of just single phrases in different years. MCQUAY: You hear Katy first, then the whale just behind her. PAYNE: (Imitating whale vocalizations). (SOUNDBITE OF HUMPBACK WHALE VOCALIZATIONS)PAYNE: (Imitating whale vocalizations). (SOUNDBITE OF HUMPBACK WHALE VOCALIZATIONS)PAYNE: (Imitating whale vocalizations). (SOUNDBITE OF HUMPBACK WHALE VOCALIZATION)JOYCE: Two years later, that phrase went from six elements to 14. All the added sounds come at the end, like a musical coda. PAYNE: (Imitating whale vocalizations). (SOUNDBITE OF HUMPBACK WHALE VOCALIZATIONS)PAYNE: It turned out that only males do the singing, mostly at breeding time, and they gradually modify their songs. We asked Katy why they did that. PAYNE: We don't know. Ask the whale. But we can say that it seems to be attractive to be an innovative male. Perhaps it's what we call sexual selection. The female is selecting the innovative male - sort of like jazz players, right? JOYCE: (Laughter). PAYNE: Right? This is a fascinating thing. There is a methodical repetition. But at the same time, there's innovation. JOYCE: At first, other biologists didn't believe whales collectively composed new songs. Even Payne's husband was skeptical. Vocalizing animals were not supposed to make up new stuff. MCQUAY: So the Paynes got their own hydrophones and boats. They went back to Bermuda, and then to Hawaii and South America. They spent years recording whales. JOYCE: They showed scientists a way to illuminate life in the deep ocean - not with a flashlight, but with the ear. (SOUNDBITE OF CRASHING WAVES)JOYCE: And many young scientists followed the Paynes' lead. One of those scientists was Christopher Clark. He first joined the Paynes in Patagonia, Argentina, in 1972, to help record southern right whales. CHRISTOPHER CLARK: And you'd sit there, and you'd listen to the whales blowing and the sea elephants snorting on the beach. JOYCE: At night, the Paynes made their own music on a violin and cello. PAYNE: We gave Chris a guitar. CLARK: And I taught myself how to play the guitar under the Southern Cross. PAYNE: It was a free and playful time. God, it was wonderful. JOYCE: Chris was hooked. And soon, he would hear things in the ocean that even the Paynes ever imagined. JOYCE: I'm Christopher Joyce, NPR News. MCQUAY: And I'm Bill McQuay.

Seventy years ago today, the U. S. dropped an atomic bomb on a Japanese city. NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has the story of why that city was chosen as a target. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: The name Hiroshima is so tied to the atomic bomb that it's hard to imagine there were other options. But in early 1945, the U. S. was still months away from building its first bomb. And they certainly didn't know where they'd drop it. ALEX WELLERSTEIN: Should it be a city? Should it be a military installation? Should you be just displaying the bomb without killing anybody? These all had to be worked out very specifically. BRUMFIEL: Alex Wellerstein is a historian at the Stevens Institute of Technology. He's devoted his career to studying nuclear weapons and the decision to use them. He says that spring, the military convened a target committee, a mix of officers and scientists. The minutes of this committee were declassified years ago. And they show it considered some far less deadly options. Their list included a remote military installation and Tokyo Bay, where it would have been detonated as a demonstration. But the target committee decided those options wouldn't show the world the power of this new bomb. WELLERSTEIN: They want people to understand that this is something different. And so picking a place that will showcase how different this is is very important. BRUMFIEL: One reason was the committee wanted to scare the Japanese into unconditional surrender. But Wellerstein says the researchers choosing the target had an added motivation. The atomic bomb was top secret. But they were working on an even more frightening secret, a super bomb just a few years away, the hydrogen bomb. They feared H-bombs could destroy the world. Physicist Edward Teller wasn't on the committee, but a letter he wrote sums up the anxiety of the bomb builders. WELLERSTEIN: (Reading) Our only hope is in getting the facts of our results before the people. This might help to convince everybody that the next war would be fatal. For this purpose, actual combat use might even be the best thing. BRUMFIEL: The target committee decided the A-bomb had to kill - and not just kill. It had to do something biblical. One bomb from one plane would wipe an entire city off the map. It would be horrible. But they wanted it to be horrible, to end the war and to try and stop the future use of nuclear bombs. WELLERSTEIN: If you thought that you could make it so that war was impossible, how far would you go? What would you do to get that result? BRUMFIEL: They chose Hiroshima. WELLERSTEIN: It's just about the right size for the size of the bombs they're expecting to use. And there's also these nearby mountains that might help focus the blast wave in on the city. And as they put it, a large fraction of the city may be destroyed. BRUMFIEL: Seventy years ago today, President Harry Truman made the announcement. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HARRY TRUMAN: A short time ago, an American airplane dropped one bomb on Hiroshima and destroyed its usefulness to the enemy. BRUMFIEL: The Army estimated at the time it killed 70 to 80,000 people. That war ended. And did it make nuclear war unthinkable? Well, after the bombing of Nagasaki three days later, nuclear weapons haven't been used again. But they haven't gone away either. Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News.

They can regrow lost arms, change the color of their skin. They can unleash a cloud of ink and zip away using jet propulsion, and they're smart. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports that scientists are starting to understand the secrets of their powers. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: As DNA sequencing technology has gotten faster and cheaper, scientists have unraveled the genes of all kinds of creatures, from humans to honeybees. But until now, no one had done the octopus. CARRIE ALBERTIN: The octopus has a very large genome. It's nearly the size of the human genome, so this is - this is not trivial. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Carrie Albertin is a biologist at the University of Chicago. Her team collaborated with a group of researchers in Japan. And today, in the journal Nature, they report on the genetic code of the California two-spot octopus, a hearty creature that doesn't mind living in the lab. ALBERTIN: They're not very large. They can squish down to about the size of a tennis ball. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And looking at their genes is starting to reveal some octopus secrets. Albertin says scientists thought the octopus genome got so big because the whole genome had just copied itself at some point - but no. ALBERTIN: As we started to dig into the data, we were seeing more and more signs that there was no duplication. GREENFIELDBOYCE: What they did see was a massive expansion in a family of genes that helped set up brain circuits, even though researchers previously thought these genes were only numerous in animals with backbones. ALBERTIN: We were really surprised, as we were poking through the octopus genome, to see that there were just 150, 160 of these genes. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The researchers also examined a dozen octopus body parts to see what genes were turned on there. In the arms' suckers, they saw active genes that resemble ones normally involved in signaling between neurons. ALBERTIN: So they might be doing something related to sucker function. For example, suckers are chemosensory, so they can taste. Maybe, possibly these are involved in that. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says all this is just the beginning. The goal is to take this genetic toolkit and figure out how it's used to make such a strange and novel creature. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

They can unleash a cloud of ink and zip away using jet propulsion, and they're smart. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports that scientists are starting to understand the secrets of their powers. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: As DNA sequencing technology has gotten faster and cheaper, scientists have unraveled the genes of all kinds of creatures, from humans to honeybees. But until now, no one had done the octopus. CARRIE ALBERTIN: The octopus has a very large genome. It's nearly the size of the human genome, so this is - this is not trivial. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Carrie Albertin is a biologist at the University of Chicago. Her team collaborated with a group of researchers in Japan. And today, in the journal Nature, they report on the genetic code of the California two-spot octopus, a hearty creature that doesn't mind living in the lab. ALBERTIN: They're not very large. They can squish down to about the size of a tennis ball. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And looking at their genes is starting to reveal some octopus secrets. Albertin says scientists thought the octopus genome got so big because the whole genome had just copied itself at some point - but no. ALBERTIN: As we started to dig into the data, we were seeing more and more signs that there was no duplication. GREENFIELDBOYCE: What they did see was a massive expansion in a family of genes that helped set up brain circuits, even though researchers previously thought these genes were only numerous in animals with backbones. ALBERTIN: We were really surprised, as we were poking through the octopus genome, to see that there were just 150, 160 of these genes. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The researchers also examined a dozen octopus body parts to see what genes were turned on there. In the arms' suckers, they saw active genes that resemble ones normally involved in signaling between neurons. ALBERTIN: So they might be doing something related to sucker function. For example, suckers are chemosensory, so they can taste. Maybe, possibly these are involved in that. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says all this is just the beginning. The goal is to take this genetic toolkit and figure out how it's used to make such a strange and novel creature.

Today, NPR's Christopher Joyce and audio producer Bill McQuay of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology bring us this story of Christopher Clark. Clark revealed how human-made noise is blanketing the ocean and making it harder for marine animals to hear their own world. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: In 1972, Christopher Clark was an engineering student in college. He met Roger Payne. Payne and his wife, Katy, were the first biologists to discover that whales sang. The Paynes needed someone with engineering skills to record whales in Patagonia, Argentina. Chris said, sure, sounds like fun. CHRISTOPHER CLARK: We were living in tents, getting blown around in Patagonia on a beach. To me, it was like, someone pays this guy to do this? I had Magellanic penguins in my tent stealing things. (SOUNDBITE OF PENGUINS)JOYCE: They'd go to the beach every day and drop a hydrophone, an underwater microphone, into the ocean. They could hear the whales calling, and they could see them on the surface. But they had a frustrating problem. CLARK: But you don't know who's making the sound. It's like dropping a microphone into Central Park. So the question was, hey, Chris, can you figure out a way that you can tell which whale is making the sound? BILL MCQUAY: Clark had an idea. What if he put three hydrophones in the water, spaced them maybe a half a mile apart? The order in which the hydrophones picked up the sound would indicate the location of the whale they were listening to. It's the same way your two ears work. The lag time in reaching one ear to the next gives you a sense of where the sound comes from. CLARK: So suddenly, it was like, oh, now I can start putting the picture together of who's saying what when and what's going on. And so you're eavesdropping. What's going on in this society here? JOYCE: Clark became a pioneer in the emerging field of bioacoustics, studying the sounds of animals. He says he'd been a good listener since he was a choir boy singing at St. John the Divine Cathedral in New York City. MCQUAY: But instead of human voices, now he wanted to hear what the whales could do. There were lots in the Arctic, so he went to Point Barrow, the northern tip of Alaska. CLARK: It's minus 30 degrees out. You're bundled up. You have complete sensory deprivation. Your nose is frozen. Your eyes are covered, right? It's all gray-white, bleached out, right? You're bundled up, and you lower the hydrophone into the ocean. And you hear this. It's just like - it's a complete cacophony of voices and singers. And you're going, oh, my God, it's like I just went into a complete twilight zone or something. I'm in a completely different world. (SOUNDBITE OF WHALES)CLARK: Belugas and bowheads and beardeds and you're going, oh, my God, it's a jungle underneath the ice. And I'm getting all excited about this. JOYCE: Although he soon realized that he wasn't the first person to hear all this. When he gave his earphones to a local Eskimo to listen, the Eskimo already knew those sounds. CLARK: In their culture, they put the end of the oar up against their jaw, put the paddle into the water, and they listen. JOYCE: But hydrophones gave much more clarity, and he could record the sounds. MCQUAY: So he compiled an archive of whale sounds that biologists were eager to analyze. Then, a chance encounter made him realize that he'd only had a tiny glimpse of what was going on in the oceans. JOYCE: On a plane flight back from Alaska, he met a Navy captain who knew all about hydrophones. MCQUAY: Small world, Clark thought. So they had lots to talk about. JOYCE: But that was it, right? MCQUAY: Yeah, they didn't talk again for years. JOYCE: Then one day, Clark got a phone call. Would he like to spend a day at a Naval office in Virginia listening to their hydrophones - not recordings, but live audio straight from the ocean? CLARK: Something I'd heard about as sort of a whisper of a whisper of whisper, and the next thing I was going, oh, my gosh. MCQUAY: The Navy had hydrophones spread across the north Atlantic and Pacific oceans. They'd been listening mostly for submarines. Other sounds were dismissed as just biologics. CLARK: In my world, their noise was my data. MCQUAY: The Navy let Clark record some of the sounds they were picking up. Then he built a device to shift the frequency so he could hear the deep sounds of whales better. And he heard voices he had never heard before, even thousands of miles away. CLARK: I'm going, oh, I see. This is a telescope. Wow, I can do this over an ocean scale, not a little tiny bay. My life has never been the same. MCQUAY: One thing Clark realized was that whales vocalize as they migrate. That meant that by listening, biologists could track those migrations, find out where they went, when and how far, something that was almost impossible to do by watching. JOYCE: Chris was learning to think like a whale. CLARK: I have dreams about being a blue whale. I simply want to bathe myself in that experience. JOYCE: And he did. He kept hearing other sounds, noise, loud noise everywhere, the sound of ships' propellers. CLARK: The noises that we're generating from our shipping traffic, from modern vessel, is clouding, is polluting the ocean. To me, it was like going to a restaurant where it's noisy, and you and I can barely have a conversation across the table. JOYCE: Clark found that whales sometimes stop singing when they heard human-made sound and sometimes avoided the sources of that sound. MCQUAY: Clark argued that ship sound was hazardous to whales. And in 2013, the International Maritime Organization set guidelines to make ships quieter, with new designs for propellers, for example. JOYCE: A lot of people now study whale song, but it's still a mystery exactly why they do it. Clark says that's not surprising. They're not like us. CLARK: I'm a blue whale. My heart beats once every minute, and my metronome is completely different than yours. And yet, I'm, as a human observer, am expecting their communication system to be somehow synchronized with mine. God forbid. You think we're supposed to understand what they're saying and doing just by listening to them in our mode? No. MCQUAY: Whales, he says, have their own listening culture. JOYCE: And they're not alone as we find out in our next story about the conversations of elephants in the African rain forest. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEPHANTS)JOYCE: I'm Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

All triangles can tile the plane, all quadrangles, too. But only 14 pentagons - five-sided shapes - could do it. Or so we thought, to the extent that we thought about this at all. Researchers have now discovered a 15th, and here to tell us about this new pentagon to tile the plane is Julie Rehmeyer. She's a math and science journalist and contributing editor to Discover Magazine. Welcome back to the program. JULIE REHMEYER: It's my pleasure, Robert, happy to talk to you. SIEGEL: How big a deal this is? REHMEYER: It's exciting. It's been 30 years since we've found one of these in the past. And now we've found another. SIEGEL: Who found this new pentagon? REHMEYER: Three mathematicians at the University of Washington - Casey Mann, Jennifer McLoud and David Von Derau. And David Von Derau is actually an undergraduate. SIEGEL: And there have been many searches for these geometric shapes over the decades? REHMEYER: There have. The first pentagonal tiling was found back in 1918. A German mathematician, Karl Reinhardt, found the first five types of pentagons that will tile the plane, and the search has been on ever since. SIEGEL: I'm looking at a representation of a plane that's been filled with this particular pentagon with identical copies of it, and it's odd to describe. It looks a bit to me the way home plate might appear to a drunken pitcher who's staring at it from 60 feet away. REHMEYER: That's a great description. When they're all put together into a tiling of the full plane, to me it looks kind of like the back of a snake. It's quite a beautiful pattern. SIEGEL: And is this just a piece of pure - not that it's a small thing - pure mathematics, or are there likely to be applications of a new pentagon with which you can tile a plane? REHMEYER: Well, it's always hard to predict exactly what the applications will be, though I think one prediction is safe, which is that artists are likely to make use of this pattern. There's a very rich field of mathematical art. There are also likely to be more practical applications. Crystals form in these patterns. They make use of the patterns that are forced by geometry. Viruses also form - the structure of viruses are formed in similar ways. There may well be uses of it in engineering, in creating materials with novel properties that have molecular building blocks along these lines. But we will just have to wait and find out what clever scientists do with it. SIEGEL: This particular pentagon was - well, I don't know whether we say, were they discovered, or created or derived by computer? REHMEYER: That's right. This team did mathematical work to find a way of searching methodically through all the possibilities, and they're continuing to work on it. SIEGEL: I'm thinking ahead to hexagons. Regular hexagons fit together as is. They tile the. . . REHMEYER: That's right. SIEGEL: . . . But regular pentagons - that is, a pentagon with five equal sides - they don't tile the plane.

SIEGEL: It's a project for this evening. REHMEYER: So to make them all fit together, somehow you've got to squish them around. SIEGEL: OK, well, it's something to think about.

I'm Guy Raz, and our show today, \"Amateur Hour,\" ideas about jumping into the unknown and just kind of figuring it out. TAYLOR WILSON: My name is Taylor Wilson. I am 21 years old and I am an applied nuclear physicist. RAZ: OK, that's weird. WILSON: Sure, sure. But you know, I've been doing it half my life now, so it doesn't seem that weird to me. RAZ: Fifty percent of your life, since you were. . . WILSON: Ten years old, yeah. RAZ: Wow. You've been a nuclear physicist since you were 10? WILSON: Well, that's when the spark hit me, so I've been working on it since. RAZ: OK, just a quick pause here to explain that Taylor never got a college degree. He's never published a peer-reviewed journal article. He is completely self-taught. And, at least when he first got into this stuff, a complete amateur. WILSON: You know, I realized that, you know, there was this field where people were basically manipulating atoms, you know, smashing them apart, combining them, using them for all these different things, and I thought, well, that sounds like fun. And then I realized I could do it, and that was the best part of all. You know, it's something I could kind of play around with in my garage. RAZ: To be precise, in his parents' garage. WILSON: Somewhere along that road I decided I wanted to build a nuclear reactor, and so I was the youngest person to produce nuclear fusion when I turned 14 and then. . . RAZ: OK so in case you just missed that, Taylor, at age 14, became the youngest person in history to produce nuclear fusion. WILSON: Fusion is the process that goes on inside the sun, inside all the stars in the universe around us, and it's basically taking very light, fundamental atoms - things like hydrogen, helium - and fusing them together into bigger elements. RAZ: And Taylor achieved this by building his own nuclear reactor, which he described on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WILSON: And I assembled this in my garage, and it now lives in the physics department at the University of Nevada, Reno. And it slams together deuterium, which is just hydrogen with an extra neutron in it. So this is the - similar to the reaction, the proton chain that's going on inside the sun. And I'm slamming it together so hard that that hydrogen fuses together. And the mass difference in those reactions is the energy produced. RAZ: At this point you might be asking, how'd he do that in his parents' garage? And the answer - as you might have guessed - began by searching the Internet. WILSON: You know, I was an email away from basically any physicist, professor throughout the world, you know, that if I had a question, I could shoot off an email to one of those contacts. RAZ: In the meantime, Taylor started gathering anything radioactive he could get his hands on. WILSON: All kinds of things. You know, your smoke detector has americium in it - an artificial element that doesn't occur naturally on Earth - and it uses the radiation to detect smoke. RAZ: He picked up some old radium alarm clocks because - who knew - they have small amounts of radioactive material on the dial faces, which is what makes them glow. And he even found what he needed in dishes. WILSON: Fiestaware plates - the old orange, red Fiestaware plates that have uranium on them. RAZ: Really? WILSON: Oh, yeah. You know, the collection slowly got more and more advanced as I got things like, you know, nuclear fuel pellets. And at some point what I started doing was I'd go out in the desert and I would dig up a bunch of uranium ore and bring it in the garage process yellowcake out of it. RAZ: I thought you could only get that from Saddam Hussein. WILSON: (Laughter). I mean, not really, but, you know. But, you know, at some point I wasn't satisfied with that. I wasn't satisfied with, you know, collecting and building up things that were already radioactive, or, you know, naturally going through these nuclear reactions, you know? I wanted to make my own nuclear reactions. And to do that, I realized the easiest way to do it would be to produce nuclear fusion, build a nuclear fusion reactor. RAZ: Slowly, Taylor started to get some vacuum chambers, pumps, parts he'd pick up from Home Depot. WILSON: From industry, from government labs, all these different places. I remember one Christmas, I got the fuel for the reactor under the Christmas tree, which was the deuterium, the heavy hydrogen fuel. RAZ: Wow. That was under the Christmas tree? WILSON: I asked for that for Christmas one year. RAZ: Like, wrapped with a ribbon? WILSON: Yeah, yup, yup. RAZ: Here you go, some nuclear fuel. WILSON: There you go. RAZ: So by around early 2009, Taylor finally finished building his reactor. And don't picture, like, Three Mile Island. It actually looks like a Xerox machine from the '70s with a bunch of wires and pumps and tubes coming out of it. WILSON: What's called an inertial electrostatic confinement device, which basically means I was just using electricity, electrostatic potential, to confine ions. And you take in a little bit of fusion fuel, and you ionize it, you strip off the electrons. RAZ: OK so fusion is basically what happens when a hydrogen bomb explodes. The scientists who worked on the Manhattan Project were the first ones to achieve it back in 1951. But since then what no one has figured out is how to turn nuclear fusion into power like electricity. WILSON: The holy grail for power production is fusion because fusion does not produce long-lived radioactive waste and the fuel is just abundant. Now, I think it's possible, and I think it'll be very economically competitive once we do it. It's just all the challenges to get there. And it may be something where we need a moonshot, or we may get the lucky donkey who's doing it in his small startup. We have to see what'll work, but I'm convinced we'll get there. RAZ: So a world powered by nuclear fusion? For the moment, too challenging. So Taylor's decided to focus on something far easier, far simpler, and that would be nuclear fission. And just in case you overslept the day it was explained in high school, here is a quick primer. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WILSON: Let's talk a little bit about how nuclear fission works. In nuclear power plant, you have a big pot of water that's under high-pressure and you have some fuel rods. And a fission reaction heats up water. The water turns to steam. Steam turns the turbine and you produce electricity from it. This is the same way we've been producing electricity, the steam turbine idea, for a hundred years. And nuclear was a really big advancement and a way to heat the water, but you still boil water and that turns the steam and turns the turbine. And I thought, you know, is this the best way to do it? Is fission kind of played out, or is there something left to innovate here? And I realized that I'd hit upon something that, I think, has this huge potential to change the world. This is what it is. This is a small modular reactor, so it's not as big as the reactor you see in the diagram here. This is between 50 and 100 megawatts. But that's a ton of power. RAZ: What Taylor's explaining here is that fission is basically what happens in a nuclear power plant. And about 20 percent of electricity in the U. S. is generated by nuclear power. But those power plants are inefficient and they create a whole bunch of nuclear waste. So Taylor's working on a new kind of fission reactor. It's small, it's twice as efficient, it could power up to 100,000 homes all without the pollution of fossil fuels. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WILSON: That in the, say, 20 years it's going to take us to get fusion and make fusion a reality, this could be the source of energy that provides carbon-free electricity. RAZ: Do you think that in some ways, like, not exactly knowing what you were doing when you started the process - like, definitely at first, I would imagine - do you think that in some ways, that was like - gave you an advantage, that you were almost so naive that you were, like, yeah, I could build a nuclear reactor? WILSON: (Laughter) I think that, you know, people who have, you know, spent their professional careers in a field sometimes get bent to those preconceptions or the way things are done. And I think that young people don't necessarily develop those preconceptions, and so they just go out and do. And, you know, I didn't really know that, you know, this wasn't the way things were done, or, I wasn't convinced this is the way they should be done. And I think that's my personality. I try to fight against every obstacle that comes into my way and I've never let someone telling me no stop me, so to speak. RAZ: I wonder if, like, now with all you know if there are things that you don't try anymore because - or you, like, limit yourself because you're just not an amateur anymore? WILSON: Yeah, well, I mean I'll certainly say that I look back and sometimes I'm awestruck at how little I knew or, you know, things like that. But with that said, you know, one thing that, you know, I hope I never lose is that lack of preconceptions, right? I think that one - you know, that's the nice thing about physics. Physics tells you what you can and can't do. And, you know, if you know the physics, anything else is possible, whether it's, you know, physical concerns, engineering, materials - all these things are within the realm of possibility if you know what physics tells you can and can't do. And that's how I try to live my life and hopefully will continue to do so. RAZ: Taylor Wilson, nuclear physicist. You can see both of his talks at ted. com. GUY RAZ, HOST:   It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz, and our show today, \"Amateur Hour,\" ideas about jumping into the unknown and just kind of figuring it out. TAYLOR WILSON: My name is Taylor Wilson. I am 21 years old and I am an applied nuclear physicist. RAZ: OK, that's weird. WILSON: Sure, sure. But you know, I've been doing it half my life now, so it doesn't seem that weird to me. RAZ: Fifty percent of your life, since you were. . . WILSON: Ten years old, yeah. RAZ: Wow. You've been a nuclear physicist since you were 10? WILSON: Well, that's when the spark hit me, so I've been working on it since. RAZ: OK, just a quick pause here to explain that Taylor never got a college degree. He's never published a peer-reviewed journal article. He is completely self-taught. And, at least when he first got into this stuff, a complete amateur. WILSON: You know, I realized that, you know, there was this field where people were basically manipulating atoms, you know, smashing them apart, combining them, using them for all these different things, and I thought, well, that sounds like fun. And then I realized I could do it, and that was the best part of all. You know, it's something I could kind of play around with in my garage. RAZ: To be precise, in his parents' garage. WILSON: Somewhere along that road I decided I wanted to build a nuclear reactor, and so I was the youngest person to produce nuclear fusion when I turned 14 and then. . . RAZ: OK so in case you just missed that, Taylor, at age 14, became the youngest person in history to produce nuclear fusion. WILSON: Fusion is the process that goes on inside the sun, inside all the stars in the universe around us, and it's basically taking very light, fundamental atoms - things like hydrogen, helium - and fusing them together into bigger elements. RAZ: And Taylor achieved this by building his own nuclear reactor, which he described on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) WILSON: And I assembled this in my garage, and it now lives in the physics department at the University of Nevada, Reno. And it slams together deuterium, which is just hydrogen with an extra neutron in it. So this is the - similar to the reaction, the proton chain that's going on inside the sun. And I'm slamming it together so hard that that hydrogen fuses together. And the mass difference in those reactions is the energy produced. RAZ: At this point you might be asking, how'd he do that in his parents' garage? And the answer - as you might have guessed - began by searching the Internet. WILSON: You know, I was an email away from basically any physicist, professor throughout the world, you know, that if I had a question, I could shoot off an email to one of those contacts. RAZ: In the meantime, Taylor started gathering anything radioactive he could get his hands on. WILSON: All kinds of things. You know, your smoke detector has americium in it - an artificial element that doesn't occur naturally on Earth - and it uses the radiation to detect smoke. RAZ: He picked up some old radium alarm clocks because - who knew - they have small amounts of radioactive material on the dial faces, which is what makes them glow. And he even found what he needed in dishes. WILSON: Fiestaware plates - the old orange, red Fiestaware plates that have uranium on them. RAZ: Really? WILSON: Oh, yeah. You know, the collection slowly got more and more advanced as I got things like, you know, nuclear fuel pellets. And at some point what I started doing was I'd go out in the desert and I would dig up a bunch of uranium ore and bring it in the garage process yellowcake out of it. RAZ: I thought you could only get that from Saddam Hussein. WILSON: (Laughter). I mean, not really, but, you know. But, you know, at some point I wasn't satisfied with that. I wasn't satisfied with, you know, collecting and building up things that were already radioactive, or, you know, naturally going through these nuclear reactions, you know? I wanted to make my own nuclear reactions. And to do that, I realized the easiest way to do it would be to produce nuclear fusion, build a nuclear fusion reactor. RAZ: Slowly, Taylor started to get some vacuum chambers, pumps, parts he'd pick up from Home Depot. WILSON: From industry, from government labs, all these different places. I remember one Christmas, I got the fuel for the reactor under the Christmas tree, which was the deuterium, the heavy hydrogen fuel. RAZ: Wow. That was under the Christmas tree? WILSON: I asked for that for Christmas one year. RAZ: Like, wrapped with a ribbon? WILSON: Yeah, yup, yup. RAZ: Here you go, some nuclear fuel. WILSON: There you go. RAZ: So by around early 2009, Taylor finally finished building his reactor. And don't picture, like, Three Mile Island. It actually looks like a Xerox machine from the '70s with a bunch of wires and pumps and tubes coming out of it. WILSON: What's called an inertial electrostatic confinement device, which basically means I was just using electricity, electrostatic potential, to confine ions. And you take in a little bit of fusion fuel, and you ionize it, you strip off the electrons. RAZ: OK so fusion is basically what happens when a hydrogen bomb explodes. The scientists who worked on the Manhattan Project were the first ones to achieve it back in 1951. But since then what no one has figured out is how to turn nuclear fusion into power like electricity. WILSON: The holy grail for power production is fusion because fusion does not produce long-lived radioactive waste and the fuel is just abundant. Now, I think it's possible, and I think it'll be very economically competitive once we do it. It's just all the challenges to get there. And it may be something where we need a moonshot, or we may get the lucky donkey who's doing it in his small startup. We have to see what'll work, but I'm convinced we'll get there.

Georgia Public Broadcasting's Grant Blankenship takes us to a swamp in the middle of Georgia where researchers are working to find answers. GRANT BLANKENSHIP, BYLINE: The sun sets on a large wetland as two women string a huge net, 27 feet wide, across a fast-moving creek. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: How's that look? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: It looks right from over here. Is it real tight? I think it looks all right. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: It looks great. It looks better. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Awesome. BLANKENSHIP: This is a bat trap in the first-ever bat survey in the middle of Georgia. State Department of Natural Resources researchers are trying to do here what others are starting to do across North America - get a good look at what bats we have left and in what numbers. Georgia researchers began paying more attention to bats when a disease called white-nose syndrome started wiping out whole caves of them in the Northeast. JACLYN BECK: You know, we knew that white-nose was coming, like, for a couple of years. It's sad. You could just watch it spread south. BLANKENSHIP: That's Jaclyn Beck, coordinator of this survey at the Ocmulgee National Monument. Beck says the fungal disease did hit southern caves. Since then. . . BECK: Our populations have gone down 82 percent since we found white-nose in Georgia. BLANKENSHIP: It's not just in Georgia where bat numbers are declining, and it's not just due to white-nose syndrome. LAURA ELLISON: Or there's been a sense that they've been declining for decades. BLANKENSHIP: Laura Ellison is a bat expert with the U. S. Geological Survey. ELLISON: Back in the '70s, bat biologists were concerned about places that they were going to that they had been to for long periods of time. BLANKENSHIP: Ellison says that gut feeling that something has been wrong with bats for a while has never been fully explored. ELLISON: In the past, they haven't really been on people's radar unless you were a bad researcher or had them roosting in your house or saw them outside during the daytime. But now they're more in the public eye. BLANKENSHIP: That might be the only upshot to white-nose syndrome. Taking advantage of the new visibility, Ellison's coordinating the North American Bat Monitoring Program. Ellison and others have authored guidelines for scientists and wildlife agencies to collect data uniformly. ELLISON: And now we're trying to figure out a way to quantify that and make it so that we can actually say something about bat populations across a large scale like the continent. BLANKENSHIP: So that going forward, numbers from, say, Kentucky make sense in Canada. This has never been attempted before. This summer is the pilot project. This Georgia survey takes a three-pronged approach. Researchers are catching bats in nets, inspecting areas where they roost during the day and recording their calls in the evening. Tonight, it looks like an owl has scared the bats off the nest site. After a couple trips to the creek, Jaclyn Beck and her team are successful. They've caught an evening bat. Clad in waders despite the heat, wildlife techs Sarah Sherburne and Rebekah Tuck jump in the creek to free the bat. SARAH SHERBURNE: I mean, it's going to take me a little bit. He's pretty bad. BLANKENSHIP: Sherburne doesn't mean the bat is injured, just really wrapped up in the net. Catching bats is tricky. Hoping they fly into a well-placed net is about the only way to do it. Rebekah Tuck explains what's at stake as they untangle the animal. REBEKAH TUCK: Their little toes are so tiny that you can dislocate them. BLANKENSHIP: Later at their workstation, they look the bat over, all joints intact. TUCK: So you can hear him chirping away. SHERBURNE: She's lactating right now. BLANKENSHIP: Which means there's a pup in a tree somewhere. Overall, this evening bat is in good health. BECK: Her wings are lovely. BLANKENSHIP: After a month of netting and searching, the researchers caught just three bats. They didn't find any in daytime inspections of hollow trees either. While bats are hard to catch, their calls are easier to record. Analyzing the sounds of bats they never captured might change the survey bottom line, but that will take months. Jaclyn Beck says many everyday people are noticing something is wrong even without hard numbers. BECK: They're like, you know, I used to always see bats by my pond, or, I used to always see them around the light outside my house; I don't see them anymore. BLANKENSHIP: By next year, Georgia is expected to be among the states adding numbers to the larger North American bat database to help researchers sort out what's happening and why.

MORNING EDITION is exploring that world in our project, Close Listening: Decoding Nature Through Sound. Today, NPR's Christopher Joyce and audio producer Bill McQuay from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology have this story on the secret signals of African elephants. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEPHANTS TRUMPETING)BILL MCQUAY: In 2002, I went to the Central African Republic to visit Katy Payne, a biologist who created the Elephant Listening Project. I was there to record these elephants for NPR's Radio Expeditions program. Katy's team was living in shacks in the dense jungle inhabited by hundreds of rare forest elephants. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: And as I recall, Bill, you got an earful of elephant right off the bat. MCQUAY: Yeah, I was walking through this rainforest to an observation platform built up in a tree, out of reach of the elephants. I climbed onto a platform with my gear and I set up my recording equipment. I put my headphones on and then sat there, listening. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEPHANTS TRUMPETING)MCQUAY: That first roar sounded close to me. But I was so focused on the settings of my recorder that I didn't bother to look around. JOYCE: Truth is, Bill goes into a kind of trance when he records. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEPHANTS TRUMPETING)MCQUAY: That second roar sounded a lot closer. I thought, this is so cool. But what I didn't realize was there was this huge bull elephant standing right underneath me, pointing his trunk up at me, just a few feet away. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEPHANT TRUMPETING)MCQUAY: Apparently he was making a dominance display. JOYCE: Well, maybe he didn't like being ignored. MCQUAY: I was so busy listening, I never looked up. I never saw him. The scientists on the other platform saw the whole thing. JOYCE: Those scientists were part of a listening culture that's evolved over the past 60 years. Payne was a listening pioneer. She had shocked the scientific world 33 years before when she discovered whale song. But listening to elephants in Africa was an altogether different thing. You had to get close to them, live with them, and, as Bill discovered, that could be scary. MCQUAY: Katy told me about her own close encounter, during a walk in the forest. KATY PAYNE: We suddenly heard a tremendous roar and rumble really, really close to us. And there was this elephant, huger and bigger than life, with her ears flared, rumbling and roaring at us. And we climbed a tree quite quickly. MCQUAY: Katy was studying a mysterious kind of elephant sound. It was different from the sounds we can all hear. This was infrasound, at very low frequencies. It's more like seismic waves. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEPHANT RUMBLING)JOYCE: Payne had first discovered that elephants make these sounds while she was at a zoo in Portland, Ore. in 1984. She'd gone there to talk about whales. But she took time off to hang out at the elephant enclosure at the zoo. PAYNE: And I began to realize that, every now and then, I was feeling a throbbing in the air. JOYCE: It reminded her of an experience she'd had singing the music of Bach with a large chorus and a pipe organ. PAYNE: I realized that that was the same feeling I'd gotten when I used to sing in the choir at Cornell in the Sage Chapel choir. (SOUNDBITE OF ORGAN MUSIC)PAYNE: And the organ would go low, low, low, low. (SOUNDBITE OF ORGAN MUSIC)PAYNE: When the pipes go down. (SOUNDBITE OF ORGAN MUSIC)PAYNE: You begin to lose pitch. Pitch is replaced by feeling. And I thought, maybe the elephants are making sounds too low for me to hear, but powerful enough for me to feel. MCQUAY: Payne asked engineers at Cornell University if they had equipment that could record that low-frequency sound. They said yes. But to actually hear it, you'd have to speed it up when you play it back. JOYCE: Payne went back to the zoo and recorded that throbbing sound. MCQUAY: When she played it back, this is what she heard. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEPHANT RUMBLING)JOYCE: And that rumble occurred just as the old bull elephant was facing a female in the next enclosure. PAYNE: And that they were calling back and forth to each other. JOYCE: But at a frequency below what humans can hear. MCQUAY: Infrasound is below 20 Hertz frequency, which is the lower limit of human hearing. JOYCE: Payne wanted to decode these infrasound signals of elephants, and that's why she went to Africa. She learned that the audible calls. . . MCQUAY: . . . Like the one that blasted me in the tree. JOYCE: Those are just a fraction of the elephant vocabulary. There's a whole infrasound conversation going on as well. Payne wanted to build a dictionary of that conversation. To do that, she needed to record both the elephant sounds and their behavior at the same time. So her team wired up the forest with microphones, next to a clearing where elephants often congregate. MCQUAY: I walked through the forest with Christopher Clark. He was an engineer at Cornell University. The elephants had a habit of smashing the recording units, so Clark strung them up in the trees. CHRISTOPHER CLARK: I'm looking for a tree that has a bifurcation, or crotch, about 25 feet up so we can throw line over it and hoist it up. MCQUAY: Clark said being in the forest made him realize how useful infrasound was for elephants. The forest is a kind of blanket. CLARK: What happens as the sound propagates through this dense forest, the higher frequencies are lost. And it's the very low part of the rumble that propagates. MCQUAY: It's like feeling a pulsing bass at a rock concert. JOYCE: Chris wrote a computer program that could sift through days worth of recordings to find the infrasound call. Then Payne could listen to them and try to match the sound with field notes on the elephant's behavior. PAYNE: Sometimes you'll see one elephant come in and listen and listen and listen with their ears flared and stiffened. Moving their head from side to side. And you know she's listening for a relative. MCQUAY: Eventually she could connect the sounds with specific behaviors. PAYNE: You watch them together, and then you get more rumbles and certain behaviors - great flapping of ears, and that's a greeting. And then you can say, those rumbles are greeting rumbles. JOYCE: Scientists suggest that the bones and membranes in the human ear are tuned to detect the frequencies of human speech. Elephants clearly can detect much lower frequencies than we can. The structure of their ear is better at detecting low frequencies. MCQUAY: The infrasound dictionary continues to grow. Males ready to mate have a particular rumble. A nursing female looking for its baby has a different one. PAYNE: We realized they may be coordinating the behavior of elephant populations over large areas - that they were being used over long distances.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:  The natural world is abuzz with the sound of animals communicating - crickets, birds, even grunting fish. MORNING EDITION is exploring that world in our project, Close Listening: Decoding Nature Through Sound. Today, NPR's Christopher Joyce and audio producer Bill McQuay from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology have this story on the secret signals of African elephants. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEPHANTS TRUMPETING) BILL MCQUAY: In 2002, I went to the Central African Republic to visit Katy Payne, a biologist who created the Elephant Listening Project. I was there to record these elephants for NPR's Radio Expeditions program. Katy's team was living in shacks in the dense jungle inhabited by hundreds of rare forest elephants. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: And as I recall, Bill, you got an earful of elephant right off the bat. MCQUAY: Yeah, I was walking through this rainforest to an observation platform built up in a tree, out of reach of the elephants. I climbed onto a platform with my gear and I set up my recording equipment. I put my headphones on and then sat there, listening. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEPHANTS TRUMPETING) MCQUAY: That first roar sounded close to me. But I was so focused on the settings of my recorder that I didn't bother to look around. JOYCE: Truth is, Bill goes into a kind of trance when he records. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEPHANTS TRUMPETING) MCQUAY: That second roar sounded a lot closer. I thought, this is so cool. But what I didn't realize was there was this huge bull elephant standing right underneath me, pointing his trunk up at me, just a few feet away. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEPHANT TRUMPETING) MCQUAY: Apparently he was making a dominance display. JOYCE: Well, maybe he didn't like being ignored. MCQUAY: I was so busy listening, I never looked up. I never saw him. The scientists on the other platform saw the whole thing. JOYCE: Those scientists were part of a listening culture that's evolved over the past 60 years. Payne was a listening pioneer. She had shocked the scientific world 33 years before when she discovered whale song. But listening to elephants in Africa was an altogether different thing. You had to get close to them, live with them, and, as Bill discovered, that could be scary. MCQUAY: Katy told me about her own close encounter, during a walk in the forest. KATY PAYNE: We suddenly heard a tremendous roar and rumble really, really close to us. And there was this elephant, huger and bigger than life, with her ears flared, rumbling and roaring at us. And we climbed a tree quite quickly. MCQUAY: Katy was studying a mysterious kind of elephant sound. It was different from the sounds we can all hear. This was infrasound, at very low frequencies. It's more like seismic waves. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEPHANT RUMBLING) JOYCE: Payne had first discovered that elephants make these sounds while she was at a zoo in Portland, Ore. in 1984. She'd gone there to talk about whales. But she took time off to hang out at the elephant enclosure at the zoo. PAYNE: And I began to realize that, every now and then, I was feeling a throbbing in the air. JOYCE: It reminded her of an experience she'd had singing the music of Bach with a large chorus and a pipe organ. PAYNE: I realized that that was the same feeling I'd gotten when I used to sing in the choir at Cornell in the Sage Chapel choir.

The radiation is too harsh. NPR's Geoff Brumfiel reports that physicists are trying to help, using particles from the edge of space. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: When a massive tsunami struck the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant in Japan, three reactors overheated and the uranium fuel inside melted. But what happened to the fuel after that is anyone's guess. CHRISTOPHER MORRIS: Right now we don't know where the fuel is. BRUMFIEL: Christopher Morris is a fellow at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. A lot of the fuel is probably still in the bottom of the reactors, but some of it may have fallen down into the concrete buildings that house them. It's important to know exactly what's happened, but there's just no way to look inside and see. MORRIS: The radiation levels are so extraordinarily high that cameras break rather quickly after they get near the reactor. BRUMFIEL: Morris is a physicist and he and some other researchers think they have a solution. It's called. . . MORRIS: Muons. BRUMFIEL: Muons are subatomic particles. They're actually related to electrons except they're 200 times heavier. Muons come from the sky. They're made when particles from deep space collide with the upper atmosphere. From there, the muons shoot down to Earth. They're part of the natural radiation we're exposed to every day. To learn why muons might be useful at Fukushima, I met another physicist at a Metro station outside Washington, D. C. I'm guessing by that large case that you're Kara. KARA HOFFMAN: You must be Geoff. BRUMFIEL: I am - perfect timing. HOFFMAN: Yeah, excellent, OK. BRUMFIEL: Kara Hoffman works at the University of Maryland. The large case she's carrying is a portable muon detector. She had it shipped out from the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in California just for this story. It's about the size of a carry-on. Inside are painted green circuit boards and a display with big red numbers on the front. It's totally harmless, but it does look a little suspicious. Whatever you do (laughter) when we pass the metro guys, don't say the word radiation, given that we're holding something that looks kind of. . . HOFFMAN: Like a bomb. BRUMFIEL: A little bit like a bomb. HOFFMAN: (Laughter) Yeah. BRUMFIEL: We get into the elevator and travel down 196 feet, about 20 stories beneath the ground. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Train level - thank you for using the Metro Rail. BRUMFIEL: This depth is nothing for Hoffman. Her day job is to work on a particle detector in Antarctica that's buried two miles beneath the surface. HOFFMAN: One of the backgrounds we deal with are muons hitting the atmosphere. BRUMFIEL: So they get through two miles of Antarctic ice? HOFFMAN: They do, yes. BRUMFIEL: Muons are the freight trains of the subatomic world. Almost nothing can stop them. Hold out your hand and a muon will fly through it every second like it's not even there. Even here on the platform of the deepest Metro station in the D. C. area. . . (SOUNDBITE OF BEEPING)BRUMFIEL: Well, that didn't take very long. HOFFMAN: (Laughter) No, 196 feet is not very much for a muon. BRUMFIEL: If muons can penetrate a subway tunnel, they can certainly pass through a nuclear reactor, which is why Christopher Morris thinks they can help at Fukushima. MORRIS: You can make something that looks like an X-ray, so you can make a picture of what's inside the reactor. BRUMFIEL: Uranium is super-dense, so it shows up as a shadow in a muon photograph, just like bones show up as shadows in an X-ray. Some Japanese laboratories have already taken fuzzy muon pictures of two of Fukushima's reactors. MORRIS: They don't see much of a shadow. That means that a lot of the core must be missing from the region where the core was. BRUMFIEL: The fuel is definitely gone. To figure out where it went, Morris is working with the Japanese firm Toshiba on more powerful muon detectors. They're already built. The next step is to put them near the reactors, though that's proving more difficult to do than the team thought. If they can get it to work, though, it might finally be possible to learn what's happened inside Fukushima. Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News.

Humans aren't the only ones. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports that frogs seem to make irrational romantic decisions. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: These little frogs live in Central America, and they're called tungara frogs. AMANDA LEA: And that's because the call they make sounds very much like that it's kind of a tungara. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Amanda Lea is biologist at the University of Texas, Austin. She says only the males make these calls to woo the females, and scientists have a pretty good idea of what the females like. LEA: They tend to like longer calls. They also like lower frequency calls. And then the other thing that's a really big - a big one for these gals is the call rate. So they love faster call rates. The faster a male can call, the better. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But in real life, love is complicated. Female frogs face countless suitors, and the researchers wondered, did a female always pick the male that scored highest on the froggy love-call meter? So to find out, they put female frogs in a room with some loudspeakers. From one came a voice that had a very fast call rate. (SOUNDBITE OF TUNGARA FROG CALL)GREENFIELDBOYCE: Fast is good, but other features in this voice were less attractive. Then the females heard a second call. (SOUNDBITE OF TUNGARA FROG CALL)GREENFIELDBOYCE: This voice was attractive, but it was slower. The ladies had to make a choice. LEA: They have two traits to evaluate. They have the call rate, and they have the attractiveness of the call. GREENFIELDBOYCE: They picked speed. They liked the fast guy best. The researchers then repeated the experiment, but this time, they added a third option - a frog with an attractive voice that was very, very, very slow. The females didn't pick him. Still, his mere presence had a profound affect. When he was around, the superfast guy did not win. Instead, females picked the frog they had rejected the first time around. LEA: They actually switched their preferences, so now call rate is no longer the most important thing. GREENFIELDBOYCE: This finding is reported in the journal Science, and it seems to make no sense. David Stephens is a behavioral ecologist at the University of Minnesota. He says this is an example of something called the decoy effect. That's when adding a third inferior option inexplicably result in the rejection of the best choice. Scientists see it in all sorts of decision making in humans and other animals too. DAVID STEPHENS: In humming birds and bees, and the most stunning example is actually in a - not an animal at all, but in a slime mold. GREENFIELDBOYCE: I'm sorry - a slime mold. STEPHENS: A slime mold, yeah. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The slime mold was trying to pick the best place to grow and to eat. Stephens says what's interesting about this frog study is that it found the decoy effect in something as crucial as picking a mate. STEPHENS: Mate choice is, like, for many people, the gold-standard decision. GREENFIELDBOYCE: So science doesn't yet know.

I'm Steve Inskeep. DAVID GREENE, HOST: And I'm David Greene. Good morning. (SOUNDBITE OF TREEHOPPERS CHIRPING)GREENE: What you're hearing are treehoppers. These are insects that communicate with each other by making leaf stems vibrate. (SOUNDBITE OF CRICKETS CHIRPING)GREENE: And what you're hearing now are crickets, whose chirps contain encoded messages that convey life or death information. Scientists discovered this vibrational world of insects through close listening. That's what we're calling our project on decoding nature through sound. Today, NPR's Christopher Joyce and audio producer Bill McQuay of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology profile two scientists who reveal how these insects manage their complex social lives with sound. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Lots of animals, including ourselves, can feel sound as well as hear it. Elephants, for example, can communicate by rumbling at low frequencies we can't hear - whales too. BILL MCQUAY, BYLINE: But you don't have to weigh a ton to rumble. JOYCE: No, in fact, you don't have to be bigger than a pea, like a treehopper, a curious little sap-sucking insect that lives on the stems of leaves. Biologist Rex Cocroft is a researcher at the University of Missouri who studies treehoppers. In 1999, a team from NPR's Radio Expeditions program rendezvoused with him at a locust tree in a backyard in Virginia. MCQUAY: He was pressing a phonograph needle up against the stem of a leaf. REX COCROFT: I'm just trying to get a good contact here between the stylus on the phono cartridge and part of the plant. Mind you, this is not in the manufacturer's instructions for these phono cartridges. MCQUAY: There's no guidebook for listening to treehoppers. Cocroft created his own. He knew that needles in those cartridges are exquisitely sensitive to vibration. So he connected a wire from the cartridge through an amplifier and to his headphone. JOYCE: And this is what he heard. (SOUNDBITE OF TREEHOPPERS CHIRPING)COCROFT: All the signals you're hearing are signals produced by males. JOYCE: They're vibrating their abdomens at incredibly high-speed to make an assortment of bizarre sounds. Some are for attracting females. And some are aimed at other males. (SOUNDBITE OF TREEHOPPERS CHIRPING)COCROFT: We're hearing that kind of purring (imitating treehopper sounds) sound - are sounds that males give either when two males meet each other or when they're mate-searching on a branch. MCQUAY: Normally, we can't hear any of this. The sound travels inside the stem. JOYCE: So how did such a weird insect telegraph evolve? Well, Rex says treehoppers, like many insects, have very sensitive legs. And they stand around on stems, which are good at transmitting vibrations. So they used what nature gave them. It gave them a way to communicate. And as a social animals, that's what they need to thrive. COCROFT: They have so many different forms of social behavior and grouping. And once you have animals living in groups, then you have all sorts of interesting possibilities for communication. (SOUNDBITE OF TREEHOPPERS CHIRPING)JOYCE: Such as scouts tapping out a signal to others that there's a predator nearby. MCQUAY: Technology revealed this hidden vibrational world, things like phonograph needles and devices called accelerometers that measure vibration. And that ushered in a new generation of insect eavesdroppers. LAUREL SYMES: So I'm here tonight in Fort Worth, Texas. JOYCE: Like Laurel Symes, a biologist at Dartmouth College. Symes tunes into vibrations we can hear made by crickets. SYMES: So now we're looking at a male tree cricket. So the way that the cricket makes sound is to use its wings. And if you look closely at one of the wings, it has a whole bunch of little tiny teeth on it. And that rubs against a vein on the other wing and it causes the whole wing to vibrate sort of like a drum head would. JOYCE: Crickets don't have a big vocabulary like treehoppers. What they do have is a remarkable ability to discriminate tiny differences in sound frequency, a skill worthy of a concert violinist. It's the females that can do this. And the reason - Bill, you want to explain that? MCQUAY: So you go out in the woods and you hear crickets chirping. They're males of several species all saying come and get me. To us, they sound pretty much the same, but they aren't. The speed at which they rub their wings together, the pulse rate, varies from species to species. And Laurel discovered that females know that. SYMES: And they've evolved to be very, very good at recognizing the exact thing that they're looking for. JOYCE: Which is the pulse rate of a potential mate from their own species. And there's a good reason to be very picky. SYMES: If you don't get it right, you lose. JOYCE: You lose if you pick the wrong species of male to mate with. You won't make little crickets. MCQUAY: Laurel actually rigged up a clever experiment to test how good the females were. She synthesized the chirps of various male crickets on a computer. They were identical to the real sound and she played them for two species of females through a speaker. Here's one chirp, a male at 43 pulses per second. (SOUNDBITE OF CRICKET CHIRPING)MCQUAY: The females of one species immediately hustled over to the loudspeaker. The other females - not interested. Then Laurel used this chirp at 51 pulses per second. JOYCE: Just eight pulses a second faster than the first one. (SOUNDBITE OF CRICKET CHIRPING)JOYCE: And the females of the other species, the one that ignored the first sound, they got all romantic with the speaker. So what's happening is that each species of cricket, there are about 140 in North America, has divided up the sound spectrum into sonic niches. Each species identifies with its own frequency like a radio station. And they do it with a brain the size of a pin head. SYMES: And that's one of the things that makes them cool is they have really simple sensory systems and still they parse this really complex world. JOYCE: Symes spent years recording crickets to figure all this out. She goes wherever they are like up a tree on the Mexican border where border patrol agents wondered just what the heck she was doing. SYMES: You're part way up a tree and, you know, the vehicle pulls up and stops and they flip on their light, you know - what are you doing out here tonight, ma'am? Oh, I'm just collecting crickets. They believed me; that's what amazed me. JOYCE: Now she's so tuned into the cricket world she thinks and sounds like them. SYMES: (Imitating cricket) That's about 60. MCQUAY: Yes, Laurel can do 60 pulses a second herself. She says it's a lot like a humming refrigerator. JOYCE: In fact, she's always listening to vibrations, crickets, fans, air-conditioners. SYMES: We think that we really know what's going on out there and we're getting this tiny slice of all of the sound in the world. JOYCE: As for Rex Cocroft, he says most of this sonic world still remains to be discovered. COCROFT: It's a very intense world and so little of it really still has ever been listened to that it's very possible for anyone to go out into a weedy field or roadside and tap into those plants and hear very interesting sounds that no one has ever heard before. JOYCE: Sounds shaped by millions of years of evolution and the struggle to survive. I'm Christopher Joyce, NPR News. MCQUAY: And I'm Bill McQuay. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  And I'm David Greene. Good morning. (SOUNDBITE OF TREEHOPPERS CHIRPING) GREENE: What you're hearing are treehoppers. These are insects that communicate with each other by making leaf stems vibrate. (SOUNDBITE OF CRICKETS CHIRPING) GREENE: And what you're hearing now are crickets, whose chirps contain encoded messages that convey life or death information. Scientists discovered this vibrational world of insects through close listening. That's what we're calling our project on decoding nature through sound. Today, NPR's Christopher Joyce and audio producer Bill McQuay of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology profile two scientists who reveal how these insects manage their complex social lives with sound. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Lots of animals, including ourselves, can feel sound as well as hear it. Elephants, for example, can communicate by rumbling at low frequencies we can't hear - whales too. BILL MCQUAY, BYLINE: But you don't have to weigh a ton to rumble. JOYCE: No, in fact, you don't have to be bigger than a pea, like a treehopper, a curious little sap-sucking insect that lives on the stems of leaves. Biologist Rex Cocroft is a researcher at the University of Missouri who studies treehoppers. In 1999, a team from NPR's Radio Expeditions program rendezvoused with him at a locust tree in a backyard in Virginia. MCQUAY: He was pressing a phonograph needle up against the stem of a leaf. REX COCROFT: I'm just trying to get a good contact here between the stylus on the phono cartridge and part of the plant. Mind you, this is not in the manufacturer's instructions for these phono cartridges. MCQUAY: There's no guidebook for listening to treehoppers. Cocroft created his own. He knew that needles in those cartridges are exquisitely sensitive to vibration. So he connected a wire from the cartridge through an amplifier and to his headphone. JOYCE: And this is what he heard. (SOUNDBITE OF TREEHOPPERS CHIRPING) COCROFT: All the signals you're hearing are signals produced by males. JOYCE: They're vibrating their abdomens at incredibly high-speed to make an assortment of bizarre sounds. Some are for attracting females. And some are aimed at other males. (SOUNDBITE OF TREEHOPPERS CHIRPING) COCROFT: We're hearing that kind of purring (imitating treehopper sounds) sound - are sounds that males give either when two males meet each other or when they're mate-searching on a branch. MCQUAY: Normally, we can't hear any of this. The sound travels inside the stem. JOYCE: So how did such a weird insect telegraph evolve? Well, Rex says treehoppers, like many insects, have very sensitive legs. And they stand around on stems, which are good at transmitting vibrations. So they used what nature gave them. It gave them a way to communicate. And as a social animals, that's what they need to thrive. COCROFT: They have so many different forms of social behavior and grouping. And once you have animals living in groups, then you have all sorts of interesting possibilities for communication. (SOUNDBITE OF TREEHOPPERS CHIRPING) JOYCE: Such as scouts tapping out a signal to others that there's a predator nearby. MCQUAY: Technology revealed this hidden vibrational world, things like phonograph needles and devices called accelerometers that measure vibration. And that ushered in a new generation of insect eavesdroppers. LAUREL SYMES: So I'm here tonight in Fort Worth, Texas. JOYCE: Like Laurel Symes, a biologist at Dartmouth College. Symes tunes into vibrations we can hear made by crickets. SYMES: So now we're looking at a male tree cricket. So the way that the cricket makes sound is to use its wings. And if you look closely at one of the wings, it has a whole bunch of little tiny teeth on it. And that rubs against a vein on the other wing and it causes the whole wing to vibrate sort of like a drum head would. JOYCE: Crickets don't have a big vocabulary like treehoppers. What they do have is a remarkable ability to discriminate tiny differences in sound frequency, a skill worthy of a concert violinist. It's the females that can do this.

RATH: Michael Mace is the curator of birds at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. MACE: So in the bird world, it is like the 747 compared to a Cessna if you look at it proportionally with other species like eagles and turkey vultures. RATH: But the king of the birds is in a knockdown, drag-out fight with a formidable adversary, a foe it never saw coming - power lines. MACE: When they're flying, there is no reason for them to look forward because they're scanning the earth, looking for carrion that they feed on or other items on the - on the surface. And so when they develop, they had a reason to look forward, and so they would fly into power lines, for example, on ridgelines of mountains. Or - condors like to roost, and when they would go to roost, they would land on these power poles and power structures and would become electrocuted because they're such a big bird. It's very easy for them to touch wires. RATH: So how to do you go against 10,000 years of evolution that told the birds not to be worried about this kind of thing? MACE: So when we started to realize what was occurring, we wanted to look at a way that we could modify their behavior - change their behavior so that we could keep them out of harm's way. So we developed a technique working with our local utility companies to use their power poles that they have and install those within the enclosures here at the Safari Park. And then we wired those poles to deliver a very mild electric charge - nothing harmful, but something that a bird would realize that it was not comfortable place to be. RATH: Now, will you have to be doing this aversion training with the birds indefinitely, or will there be a point at which they figure it out? MACE: That's a really good question. So one of the goals of the condor program is to have a sustainable population in the wild. And so as those birds that we're releasing then are of age to where they're sexually mature and starting to produce their own offspring, the fact that those parents are teaching their chicks for a couple years how to survive in the wild - if the parents are no longer visiting the power structures to roost on, what we're seeing is the chicks follow the parents' lead and don't do it, either. RATH: So when is the group of condors going to be released? When is your next graduating class? MACE: Well, we're actually getting ready this next month in September here at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park to send three birds that were raised here to the field site in California and the field site in Arizona to be prepared for release months from now. So the next generation is ready to go out. So when we started this program, you know, we were challenged with a species that's almost went extinct. The condor, in 1982, only had 22 birds left in the world. There are now more than 420 condors in the world, of which more than 230 of those are now flying free in California, Arizona and Baja, Mexico.

Forecasters said they expected the storm would intensify into a hurricane with a possible U. S. landfall. Over the weekend, Erika defied those forecasts and dissipated, still bringing heavy rain and flooding to parts of Florida and South Carolina. NPR's Greg Allen reports on the push to improve hurricane forecasting, a push that began after Hurricane Katrina. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Ten years ago, as Hurricane Katrina approached the Gulf Coast, the biggest question was where would it come ashore? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Here's the path. This is what we're forecasting. ALLEN: Two days before Katrina hit land, a Weather Channel meteorologist gave the forecast. A huge area, some 500 miles of the Gulf Coast, was potentially in the storm's path. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: We're talking about from Eastern Louisiana eastward, including you in the New Orleans area, across the coast of Mississippi and Alabama. ALLEN: Ten years later, new technology has improved the accuracy of tracking by 40 percent, reducing errors shrinking the area put on alert and potentially evacuated because of an approaching hurricane. And now, instead of three-day forecasts, the National Hurricane Center in Miami is issuing five-day forecasts. Louis Uccellini, the head of the National Weather Service, says improved tracking has helped coastal communities and emergency managers prepare for storms. LOUIS UCCELLINI: If we can give them a smaller area with increased confidence, they can really reduce the cost of that evacuation and make the evacuation more effective. So these track improvements have been extremely important. ALLEN: After the active hurricane seasons of 2004 and 2005, the National Weather Service decided it needed to improve hurricane forecasting. It launched a project that led to the adoption of new technology like drones, upgraded weather satellites and better data gathering instruments on the aircraft that fly into hurricanes. Ten years ago, Katrina highlighted another challenge for meteorologists - the difficulty of forecasting a hurricane's strength. Here's a Weather Channel report on Katrina the day before it made landfall. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Hurricane Katrina is a Category 5 hurricane. That means catastrophic damage to any city in its wake. ALLEN: By the next day, Katrina surprised forecasters by weakening and making landfall as a Category 3. Even so, because of its massive size and storm surge, it still was the most destructive hurricane ever. One year earlier, Uccellini says, Hurricane Charley was another example of a storm that showed the difficulty of forecasting intensity, building from a Category 2 to a Category 4 storm very quickly just off the Florida coast. UCCELLINI: People who were expecting to deal with a 2 found themselves engulfed in a landfalling hurricane. That was a wake-up call. ALLEN: Chris Ruf, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Michigan, says one of the challenges in forecasting intensity is gathering the data from a hurricane as it develops. CHRIS RUF: The things that cause intensity to change happen in the inner core of the hurricane, right near the eye and in the surrounding intense part of the storm. ALLEN: Ruf is working with NASA on a project that he says will improve the ability of forecasters to get that information and predict rapid changes in intensity. By next year, they'll launch a group of microsatellites that will use GPS signals to measure wind speeds in a hurricane's inner core. Just three years ago, Hurricane Sandy was what Uccellini describes as another watershed moment for the National Weather Service. Several days out, a European computer model correctly protected the storm's East Coast landfall while U. S. models still had it turning out to sea. Since then, the National Weather Service has been playing catch-up. After Sandy, it scrambled to upgrade its models and data crunching. Better models have now improved intensity forecasts by 20 percent. More progress is expected by the end of the year when the National Weather Service says it will quadruple its current computing capacity. Greg Allen, NPR News, Miami.

UCCELLINI: People who were expecting to deal with a 2 found themselves engulfed in a landfalling hurricane. That was a wake-up call. ALLEN: Chris Ruf, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Michigan, says one of the challenges in forecasting intensity is gathering the data from a hurricane as it develops. CHRIS RUF: The things that cause intensity to change happen in the inner core of the hurricane, right near the eye and in the surrounding intense part of the storm. ALLEN: Ruf is working with NASA on a project that he says will improve the ability of forecasters to get that information and predict rapid changes in intensity. By next year, they'll launch a group of microsatellites that will use GPS signals to measure wind speeds in a hurricane's inner core. Just three years ago, Hurricane Sandy was what Uccellini describes as another watershed moment for the National Weather Service. Several days out, a European computer model correctly protected the storm's East Coast landfall while U. S. models still had it turning out to sea. Since then, the National Weather Service has been playing catch-up. After Sandy, it scrambled to upgrade its models and data crunching. Better models have now improved intensity forecasts by 20 percent. More progress is expected by the end of the year when the National Weather Service says it will quadruple its current computing capacity.

NPR health correspondent Rob Stein reports that the findings could be an important advance for many brain disorders, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. ROB STEIN, BYLINE: Fifty years ago, scientists made a stunning discovery. Bizarre, deformed proteins called prions could spread sort of like viruses and bacteria and cause awful brain diseases. Thankfully, these diseases are pretty rare and hard to get, like kuru, which cannibals in Papua New Guinea got from eating human brains and mad cow disease, which people can get from eating infected cow brains. But Kurt Giles says scientists thought there could be more of these diseases. KURT GILES: There's been, the past 10 years now, but really, more so maybe the past five years, the understanding that many neurodegenerative diseases may be prion diseases. STEIN: Diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, so Giles and his colleagues at the University of California, San Francisco took a look at a disease called multiple-system atrophy or MSA. GILES: Initially, it looks like Parkinson's disease. People have the tremors and the loads of problems of Parkinson's disease. STEIN: But MSA destroys the brain even faster than Parkinson's. Giles and his colleagues suspected MSA might be caused by a misshapen version of a protein called alpha-synuclein. So they created mice that have the human form of that protein in their brains and injected the mice with alpha-synuclein from the brains of 14 people who had died from MSA. GILES: And in every case, the mice died about four months later of the disease. STEIN: Under a microscope, their brains looked exactly like the brains of people who died from MSA. And tissue taken from the brains of the dead mice could do the same thing to the brains of other mice. GILES: So that really shows that this is a transmissible disease and that the protein involved in it is acting as a prion. STEIN: That has all kinds of implications. For starters, Giles says it raises the disturbing possibility that MSA could spread from one person to another by surgical instruments that have been used on the brains of MSA patients. GILES: Protein sticks very tightly to the stainless steel. And when you clean it afterwards, you could potentially still have misfolded clumps of protein on the surgical instruments that, if you then do surgery on a second person, could potentially induce that in the other person. STEIN: And the new research, which is being published in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, could be really important for other reasons. CORINNE LASMEZAS: The fact that these proteins behave like prions - it has tremendous implications. STEIN: Corinne Lasmezas is a neuroscientist at the Scripps Research Institute in Florida. If a prion can cause MSA, Lasmezas says that's a big boost for the idea that prions could cause other much more common diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Lou Gehrig's disease. LASMEZAS: It's one more stone in our garden of knowledge now about what these toxic proteins are doing. And we know that this is where we have to intervene in order to be able to treat these diseases. STEIN: Scientists are already trying to find drugs that block these mutant proteins in the hopes of finally finding something that could treat people suffering from MSA, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other terrible brain diseases.

They're to resume negotiations on a new global agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions. It's part of the run-up to a major summit in Paris later this year. And a key element - a very noticeable element - of the gathering is groups. The countries negotiate in groups, some of which are a little puzzling. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce has put together this handy field guide. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: When the United Nations get together to duke it out over climate change, diplomats typically sit behind little placards that show the name of their home country. But when these people speak, they're often representing not just their own country, but a group. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, Nauru has the honor to speak on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Excellencies, presidente (ph), I have the honor to speak on behalf of the Environmental Integrity Group. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Speaking for a group is always an honor. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: I have the honor to speak on behalf of the Least Developed Countries group, which represents the 48 poorest countries in the world. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And there are a lot of different groups to speak for. ELLIOT DIRINGER: At last count, I believe there are now 14 groups. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Elliot Diringer is with the nonprofit Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. DIRINGER: It might take you back to junior high school and cliques, which can be very powerful forces, actually. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Junior high had the popular kids, the jocks, the nerds, the outcasts. Similar kids sort of gravitate towards each other. It's the same in climate change negotiations. By the end of this year, the U. N. hopes to have forged a new global agreement that will affect everything from energy production to agriculture to transportation. We're talking the future of the planet here. Diringer says it makes sense for countries with shared interests to negotiate in packs. DIRINGER: Members of groups coordinate their positions because there's strength in numbers. They also serve as a bit of a support system, particularly for smaller countries. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Diringer has been watching U. N. climate negotiations for two decades. He says in the early days, there were just a few groups. For example, the European Union has always negotiated as one block. DIRINGER: You then saw the emergence of the Umbrella Group, which is basically the developed countries that are not within the European Union - the United States, Japan, Canada, Russia, Australia and a few others. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Thank you very much, Mr. President. On behalf of the Umbrella Group of countries. . . GREENFIELDBOYCE: The Umbrella Group - where did that name come from? No one could tell me. But one diplomat jokingly told me it was because an umbrella is a good hiding place. NOZIPHO MXAKATO-DISEKO: These are guys who wanted to do as little as possible. And so they found a shade for themselves. Canada's got its oil from tar sands, you know. Where better do you go? You go to the Umbrella Group to hide. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That's Ambassador Nozipho Mxakato-Diseko from South Africa. But she says now that the U. S. has started talking big on climate change action. . . MXAKATO-DISEKO: I think there's a curiosity as to what's going to happen to the Umbrella Group. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Diseko is spokesperson for another group, the largest one in the negotiations. It's called the Group of 77 Plus China. You might think it has 77 countries plus China. You would be wrong. MXAKATO-DISEKO: It's 134 in all, 134. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The name is left over from when this huge group first formed. Its members are developing countries. There's everybody from Afghanistan to Botswana to Vietnam. MXAKATO-DISEKO: Countries that come to this process with an understanding of what climate change is because they feel the impact most immediately and have been feeling the impact for quite a while now. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But that doesn't mean everybody in that group sees things exactly the same way. DIRINGER: The most significant change we've seen in groups over the years is the emergence of smaller groups of developing countries. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Diringer says think about it - if you're a tiny island state and feel that your very existence is threatened by melting ice and rising seas. . . DIRINGER: At a certain point, you realize that your interests may not be the same as those of a major emitting country like China or India. GREENFIELDBOYCE: It's now common for a member of the Group of 77 to also belong to another group, like maybe the Coalition for Rainforest Nations or the Mountainous Landlocked Developing Countries, or this one. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: I take the floor on behalf of the Like-Minded Developing Countries. GREENFIELDBOYCE: What are they like-minded about? This group includes Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, Venezuela. Diringer says they're seen as the hardliners. DIRINGER: They, generally speaking, hew very closely to the traditional developing country view that there should be very stark differentiation between the obligations of developed and developing countries. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Meanwhile, other developing nations say they'll take action on their own without waiting around for richer countries. Some of them formed a group called the Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean. DIRINGER: So you've seen, to some degree, a splintering of the developing countries. And on the whole, I actually think that's healthy because if everyone sticks to group positions and feels constrained by those group positions, it can be hard to make progress. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And then there's the group that was founded by Switzerland. Franz Perrez is Switzerland's chief climate change negotiator. He says about 15 years ago, famously neutral Switzerland wasn't part of any group. That became a problem when at one point in the climate talks, the leaders of key groups went to a private room to negotiate. Perrez says his predecessor tried to join the discussion. FRANZ PERREZ: But was escorted out of the room by security because he was not representing a group. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The very next day, Switzerland announced it was forming its own group. PERREZ: And that any country who doesn't have a home is welcome to join that group. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Switzerland ended up banding together with Mexico, South Korea, Liechtenstein and Monaco. This unlikely team is called of the Environmental Integrity Group. Roberto Dondisch is Mexico's lead climate change negotiator. He says their group is really influential because its members are so different from each other and cross so many divides. Both developed and developing countries seem to think, well, if those guys can agree on something, maybe we should take a look. ROBERTO DONDISCH: You know if we can get Mexico and Switzerland and Korea to share the same points, you have a pretty good shot that that document could be adopted by almost everybody in the world. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And that is the ultimate goal here - to get a plan forward on battling climate change that virtually every nation in the world can sign onto. For that to happen, all of these different groups will have to somehow come together and turn into one. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

SALINAS: UC Berkeley psychologist Lucia Jacobs published a study proving that people can create a map in their heads using different scents as location markers.

On average, the subjects were able to find their way from the start to the endpoint in less than 90 seconds.

Yeah, anyway, Carl Rothfels is at the University of British Columbia. He's devoted his entire career to studying ferns and he's heard all the bad fern puns before. CARL ROTHFELS: Frond-ly persuasion, things like that. Anything that uses frond-ly or friendly. BRUMFIEL: But it's been worth it because Rothfels and his fellow researchers have made a remarkable discovery about a very odd fern. ROTHFELS: It's something called Cystocarpium roskamianum. BRUMFIEL: It's found in France and it's fairly common. You can even buy it at some European garden centers. But to fern researchers, it looks weird. ROTHFELS: Yes, it looks really weird. I mean, on one level it looks like a fern. BRUMFIEL: Quick aside, to me it looks like a normal fern. But Rothfels says this fern appears to have come from two parents that you wouldn't expect to be a couple - one lives on rocky outcrops, the other is found on the floors of forests. The two are different species from different places and yet, somehow, they get together to make this hybrid. ROTHFELS: It is pretty much exactly in-between the two parents. BRUMFIEL: The team's DNA analysis confirmed it. This crazy hybrid has fern researchers talking but the reason I'm talking about it on NPR is even crazier. The genetics show the parent species are really far apart. ROTHFELS: These two ferns had been evolving independently for about 60 million years before they got back together again and were able to form this hybrid. BRUMFIEL: 60 million years and they could still make a baby fern. That's a record. And to put it in perspective, humans and lemurs have been evolving separately for 60 million years. We definitely cannot make little baby lee-mans. ROTHFELS: Another, at least approximately, comparable example would be an elephant mating with a manatee. BRUMFIEL: Which would be an elephanatee? ROTHFELS: Yeah, right. I don't know what would happen. That's well done though, that was almost as good as the fern puns. BRUMFIEL: How is it even possible that ferns can do this? Truth is, Rothfels isn't sure. All ferns do share a similar reproductive process, so it could be that a rock-fern sperm can't tell the difference between the egg of a rock-fern and one of a forest-fern. Which he says it raises an interesting possibility - perhaps more distant hybrids would be possible with other species, if they just gave it a try. BRUMFIEL: Are you saying that if we did get an elephant and  a manatee together. . . ROTHFELS: . . . We'd get an elephanatee? I think most people would say that's impossible.

We call it Close Listening: Decoding Nature Through Sound. Some scientists find they need to do more than just listen. NPR's Christopher Joyce and audio producer Bill McQuay of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology introduce us to scientists who learned to capture what animals are saying and even talk back to them. BILL MCQUAY: The invention of the phonograph record was a big deal for bird scientists. They could record birdsong and then sit down and really listen - figure out how they communicate - sometimes, anyway. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ARTHUR ALLEN: This is March 1, 1946. MCQUAY: That's Arthur Allen from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Allen was the lab's founder and one of the nation's leading birders. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ALLEN: We're set up on a shore of Mattamuskeet Lake, N. C. , recording the whistling swans. Another cold, windy morning, and the recorder is apparently not working quite right. And the needle is jumping, perhaps on account of the cold. MCQUAY: He was trying to actually cut an acetate record of singing birds. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Fortunately, the technology got better and a bit more portable. Let's fast-forward 45 years. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)TED PARKER: Up here in the canopy, there's another flock. These are the hardest birds to detect. JOYCE: It's 1991, and that's Ted Parker from a field recording of an NPR radio expedition story in the Bolivian rainforest. Parker was an ornithologist with Conservation International. He spent months at a time in the tropics lugging around a portable tape recorder. He had a legendary skill for using his ears. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)PARKER: My parents bought me records of bird recordings that were made by people at Cornell. I can remember hours and hours, you know, just putting the needle back and forth, back and forth. And my mother would say, you know, you're going to destroy the record player. JOYCE: Parker memorized the sounds of over 4,000 bird species. He used his tape recorder to do some of the most extensive bird surveys in the tropics. PARKER: These birds would spend all their time in that foliage that's 130, 140 feet above the ground. If you don't know their voices, you - there's no way you could come up with a good list on the canopy species. JOYCE: But Parker wanted more than lists. He wanted know how birds divide up their territory. How do you do that when you can't see them? MCQUAY: Here's how - mating pairs of birds each have their own territory. Parker hit on the idea of provoking mating pairs to reveal themselves and their patch in the forest. He would record a mating pair. Then, he'd play their song back to them. The birds were confused. They thought it was a threatening outsider. PARKER: The other thing is if you're outside the territory and you play back the songs, the birds will come up to the edge of their territory. JOYCE: And they'd vocalize, in essence shouting, hey, get out of here. (SOUNDBITE OF BIRDSONG)PARKER: It's antiphonal duet, where the male and female singing different songs. It's the territorial display. What I do is try to rouse them all. So that I'll actually get a pair here, a pair there, a pair behind me, and you can map all the territories in the forest eventually. MCQUAY: Parker was doing just such a bird census in Ecuador when he died in a plane crash in 1993. He was just 40 years old. JOYCE: Years later, a biologist using a similar technique discovered something no one had imagined - how these bird warnings are adopted and passed on by completely different kinds of animals. At his lab at the University of Montana, biologist Erick Greene explains how it works. A small bird sees danger - let's say a hawk or an owl flying around. It warns other birds by making a seet call. ERICK GREENE: Because it sounds like this. (Imitating seet call). JOYCE: Then there's a mobbing call. Greene demonstrates by pressing his lips to the back of his hand. GREENE: (Imitating mobbing call). JOYCE: Birds make that call when they see a perched predator. It brings other birds out of the trees to mob the predator and chase it away. Now, Greene had watched birds do this for years. Then one day, he noticed something, well, squirrelly. MCQUAY: We mean that literally. JOYCE: He realized that squirrels seemed to be mimicking these warning calls from birds as soon as they heard them, almost exactly, even with a totally different vocal apparatus, and chipmunks did it, too. Greene was astonished that mammals and birds would share this early warning system. GREENE: We've got these complex - what we call communication networks, and it's not just one species yakking to members of its own kind. It's all these different species - not only of birds, but mammals, as well - and they're all sharing information. JOYCE: Being a scientist, Greene had to observe this happening to be sure of it. At his lab, he shows me how he does that. GREENE: Let me take you down the hall, and I'll show you some more of our robo-raptors. JOYCE: Robo-raptors - mechanical birds of prey. GREENE: And so this is going to be a robo-pygmy owl. JOYCE: Greene holds a dead owl. It's stuffed with small motors and a computer board that make it move. These are Greene's villains. He takes them into the forest to set off this alarm system. MCQUAY: I went with Greene to the woods near Ithaca, N. Y. , to see how he uses those robo-raptors. He has to hide them at first, inside a fake trunk three feet high. He can then raise and lower the trunk with a remote control. GREENE: So this is neat, see? We've walked out with this fake tree trunk. Underneath it is hidden a robotic owl, so we're going to be able to lower the tree trunk down with the garage door opener when we're back here, exposing this little robotic owl. And so then then we'll be really interested to see how these birds respond to a predator. MCQUAY: A few days later, Greene's team had everything in place. They exposed the robo-raptor. It didn't take long before a tufted tit mouse spotted it and started the mobbing call. (SOUNDBITE OF MOBBING CALL)MCQUAY: Then, a white breasted nut hatch joined in, then, house sparrows. And if that wasn't enough, the jays chimed in. And just as Greene has now observed numerous times, the squirrels got into the act. It's a madhouse. JOYCE: Birds, squirrels, chipmunks - and they all propel these warnings through the forest at, says Greene, 100 miles an hour. GREENE: It's almost as if there's a bow wave preceding the raptor. So in many ways, I've come to appreciate that it's hard to be a hawk. MCQUAY: Close listeners like Greene are, in a way, hearing the world as other animals do. . . JOYCE: . . . And finding that it's a world in a constant state of negotiation, across species, everywhere there's life. I'm Christopher Joyce, NPR News. MCQUAY: And I'm Bill McQuay.

And the neighbors on the mainland like it that way. From member station WSHU, Charles Lane reports how the government will go about auctioning a unique property. CHARLES LANE, BYLINE: Foot-and-mouth disease is harmless to humans, but it's highly contagious among hoofed animals and could potentially decimate the country's $60 billion cattle industry. Officials were so worried about outbreak, the only place you could legally research the disease was here on Plum Island, not one mile from the tip of Long Island. JASON GOLDEN: You can see the animal intake right here. You can see the ramps up there, the - all the animals were upstairs. LANE: Jason Golden is the official tour guide for Plum Island. He says developments in lab safety means better research can safely be done on the mainland. So the program will be moving to Kansas, which means if you're in the market for a high-security biolab, now's your chance. But, Golden says, there's so much more to the island. GOLDEN: Moving all the way around, you see the South Fork of Long Island out here. This all the Hamptons. Basically everything from about right there to about right there is all open Atlantic, and depending on which way your vector is, you're either going to hit Morocco, Spain or Portugal. LANE: As if selling an island weren't enough, this one also boasts a 19th century lighthouse on top of a grassy hill. There's an old army base, there's a power plant, even fresh water. But perhaps Plum Island's biggest selling point is its pristine wetlands and forests - an area the size of Central Park and just a helicopter ride away from Central Park.

PATRICK SCLAFANI: We've conducted many of these competitive sales, but there's no comparison to it. LANE: Usually GSA just posts online surplus army trailers and rusty barges. Sclafani says for Plum Island, they're planning focus groups to figure out who might want sandy beaches and a biolab. The best guess right now is either a preservationist, a research company or a developer. Jonathan Miller is a real estate appraiser and researcher who specializes in luxury properties. He says the potential of Plum Island is huge because it's right next door to one of the wealthiest communities in the country. JONATHAN MILLER: Actually, the most expensive real estate transaction was in the Hamptons, and it was $147 million. LANE: Acre by acre, Miller says Plum Island could be worth as much as a billion dollars, but it's not that simple. Zoning and litigation could affect the value, but contagious animal diseases, not so much.

And then you gut it, strip it, remediate and then create, you know, high-end real estate product that breaks records in the neighborhood.

Well, exactly how sweet is it? Scientists at Cornell University wanted to know. More precisely, they wanted to know if an exciting and positive experience actually improved how things taste and vice versa. So being at Cornell, they naturally turned to thoughts of hockey. And they asked the school's hockey fans to taste various things after their team won or lost. Now, Robin Dando is an assistant professor in the Department of Food Science at Cornell. He was a co-author of the study, and he joins us on the line from Ithaca, N. Y. Welcome to the program. ROBIN DANDO: Thank you. WERTHEIMER: So is victory sweet? What did you find? DANDO: Well, what we found was that in a situation when a team won, samples would taste sweeter and less sour. In the losing condition, people didn't like the sample so much. We were giving them samples of different flavors of ice cream. Now, from game to game, they assumed that the flavors were changing very slightly, but in fact we were giving them the exact same flavors and rating how they perceived the tastes with different emotional state. WERTHEIMER: So they were saying, I like the one you had last week better? DANDO: (Laughter) Absolutely. WERTHEIMER: (Laughter) Well, now, why is there a difference, do you think? DANDO: Well, this work arose from some earlier work I did as a postdoc where we looked into the taste buds and saw a high concentration of serotonin receptors. Serotonin is linked with happiness and mood. And around about the same time, a researcher in England had published that patients that they gave SSRIs - so these are antidepressants that work on the serotonin system - started to perceive taste differently. So what we thought was how about in a natural situation, where instead of antidepressants improving your mood, your mood is elevated from a day-to-day condition. What I thought was a really nice model of this is a sporting arena, where we can be incredibly happy and incredibly sad just from one day to the next. WERTHEIMER: (Laughter) From one period to the next. DANDO: (Laughter) Absolutely. WERTHEIMER: Do you think you've developed some new kind of research here doing research at games? DANDO: This wasn't an ideal environment. It was a little fanatic. . . WERTHEIMER: (Laughter). DANDO: . . . To run the data collection. You have people who've maybe had a few drinks. You have small children that just want samples of ice cream (laughter) of course, and who can blame them for that? So we ended up having to exclude quite a few people who didn't fill out their surveys completely. So it wasn't an ideal place to run a study, but it certainly was an interesting place to run a study. WERTHEIMER: So in the field of food science, do think there's any sort of possible application of this? Could you figure out something to do with this information that you've just gathered? DANDO: Well, we think that this information, rather than speaking to food science, might speak to the concept of emotional eating. The sample that people liked the most, they didn't penalize it so badly when the team lost. Whereas, the sample that they weren't so keen on, they really didn't like it as soon as the team had lost the game. So in a situation where you're really unhappy, you have to go for the thing that you know is tasting great, despite how unhealthy it might be. WERTHEIMER: Robin Dando is an assistant professor in the Department of Food Science at Cornell University. The results of the study have been published in the journal Appetite. Robin Dando, thank you very much. DANDO: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF CORNELL MARCHING BAND)WERTHEIMER: That's Cornell's Big Red Marching Band, but you probably knew that. LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST:  The sweet taste of victory, how sweet it is. Well, exactly how sweet is it? Scientists at Cornell University wanted to know. More precisely, they wanted to know if an exciting and positive experience actually improved how things taste and vice versa. So being at Cornell, they naturally turned to thoughts of hockey. And they asked the school's hockey fans to taste various things after their team won or lost. Now, Robin Dando is an assistant professor in the Department of Food Science at Cornell. He was a co-author of the study, and he joins us on the line from Ithaca, N. Y. Welcome to the program. ROBIN DANDO: Thank you. WERTHEIMER: So is victory sweet? What did you find? DANDO: Well, what we found was that in a situation when a team won, samples would taste sweeter and less sour. In the losing condition, people didn't like the sample so much. We were giving them samples of different flavors of ice cream. Now, from game to game, they assumed that the flavors were changing very slightly, but in fact we were giving them the exact same flavors and rating how they perceived the tastes with different emotional state.

LAUREN SOMMER, BYLINE: Diver Dan Abbott is unloading his scuba gear on a beach in Monterey, his tank, flippers and a waterproof clipboard. It's covered in tally marks because he just spent the morning counting fish. DAN ABBOTT: One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish, yeah, kind of (laughter). SOMMER: Or, in all seriousness. . . ABBOTT: Pile perch, black perch, blue rockfish, kelp rockfish. SOMMER: One-hundred-fifty fish in all. Abbott's diving with a team from Reef Check California, a group of volunteers out here doing underwater surveys, counting everything in the kelp forest. ABBOTT: It gets a little challenging because you're floating. You're swimming. You're looking. You're counting. SOMMER: He's trying to answer a question. Are there more fish here now than there were eight years ago? That's when this kelp forest became part of a huge experiment to restore marine life. It was set aside as a marine protected area where there's little or no fishing allowed. ABBOTT: You know, to give the fish and the invertebrates a chance to come back. SOMMER: There are more than 100 protected areas off California, covering 16 percent of state waters. And the only way to know if they're working, if marine life is coming back, is for Abbott and others to keep checking year after year. That's expensive, and, for a while, the state was funding the work. ABBOTT: But the monitoring efforts that have gone on have been cut back in the recent years. SOMMER: What would really help is a way to count marine life without all the fieldwork. That might actually be possible. JESSE PORT: Let me just show you - I can show you - our bottles are over here. SOMMER: Jesse Port is showing me around his lab in a basement on the Stanford University campus, where he works. PORT: Maybe I'm an environmental genomicist.

PORT: These are, like, Nalgene one-liter bottles. SOMMER: Port fills these bottles with seawater, which he says is all he needs to know exactly what's been swimming through it. PORT: So all organisms shed their DNA. SOMMER: Whales, fish, seals, they all leave cells behind. PORT: Their skin, their scales, their waste, all of this gets into the water. SOMMER: It's like a soup of genetic information. Port collects the cells and sequences the DNA, all the DNA. PORT: And we get 150 million sequence rates. And that's a lot of information. SOMMER: He ends up with a spreadsheet that tells him what DNA is there - humpback whale, check, rockfish, check. Port can do this because DNA sequencing has gotten so much cheaper. PORT: This was just not possible five, 10 years ago. SOMMER: He first ran DNA tests in a large tank at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, a good test case because he knew exactly what's swimming in there. But he got back results he didn't quite believe. PORT: Things like turkey. We picked up chicken DNA in these tanks. SOMMER: Turns out the poultry was in the feed some of the fish were getting.

Well, Fred Mogul of member station WNYC has always wondered if what he's heard about his dog is true. For years, he's wanted to conduct an experiment to find out, and this summer, he finally did. FRED MOGUL, BYLINE: Looks like this is the place. Take a look, Lily. What do you think? Lily and I have driven two hours west of Brooklyn to get here. CAROLYN WILKI: You're at Raspberry Ridge Sheep Farm. We're in beautiful Bangor, Pa. MOGUL: That's Carolyn Wilki. WILKI: I am the resident chief shepherd and chief dog trainer. We have 67 acres, 100 sheep, 100 ducks, 1 camel, 13 dogs and two cats. MOGUL: And, for a little while today, there is one more dog - Lily, my family's faithful mutt. I'm here at Raspberry Ridge to give Lily a herding instinct test. I got her years ago at a place called Herding Dog Rescue, and I've always wondered if she really has herding dog in her. Wilki is going to help me figure that out. WILKI: I'm looking for sustained interest. I'm looking to see if the dog barks. MOGUL: Dog and sheep start out kind of as enemies. The dogs are the wolves, the predators, and the sheep are the prey. WILKI: We don't want the dog to have lamb sushi or take down a sheep, but what we want them to do is take their predatory actions and control the livestock. MOGUL: All right, enough talk. Let's see what Lily can do. WILKI: So what I want you to do is start walking around on the outside of the pen, and when I yell good, you yell good also. MOGUL: This is to praise Lily just for looking at the sheep. She's eyeballing and sniffing the sheep through the fence. Good. WILKI: Oh, this is good though. This is good. MOGUL: They start moving to the other side of the pen. Lily follows. WILKI: See how she's going back and forth like that? She's doing a little bit of what we call wearing, which is a pendulum-like motion where they go from one side of the sheep to the other. MOGUL: So far so good. Now it's time for the main test. We open the gate and enter the pen. WILKI: We're going to get her in here with a 20-foot line. MOGUL: Which Wilki warns me I'll need to tap dance around as it whips across the ground. WILKI: It's there just so we can catch her if things get too crazy, that's all. MOGUL: Wilki tells Lily and me to walk together toward the sheep. WILKI: A mental image - you're two wolves going out for lunch. That's your lunch, so start chasing after them. Go to your left. Go to your left. Go to your left. Go running after the sheep. MOGUL: OK. I'm trying, but I'm not moving that fast. I've got sound equipment and a camera, and I'm dodging that 20-foot rope that's zipping back and forth in the grass. At least Lily's on top of things. WILKI: She's putting them together. She got two together. Where's the other one? Yeah, go get him. Yes, good. All right. She's keeping them together. MOGUL: Lily's having the time of her life. WILKI: That's it. You did it. MOGUL: At some point, though, Lily starts to hit overload. She sits on her haunches, looks around and tries to figure out what just happened. We gather outside the pen. While Lily drinks from a water bucket, Wilki writes up a report card. So if we were scoring her, what do you think? WILKI: It's always guys that ask that question, and honestly - this is a pass-fail. She's showing, clearly, much more than 50 percent of what she needs to do at this stage to do a herding. MOGUL: In other words, Lily's like a promising minor-league prospect. So now what? WILKI: The dog will tell you, with further training, whether it really likes it and wants to do this or not. But right now, she's saying all systems go; let's do it. MOGUL: Well now that we figured something out about Lily's nature and her DNA, we've just got to figure out the nurture part and whether there's going to be any more herding in Lily's future - tough to say. I mean, how are you going to keep them down in the big city once they've been to the sheep farm? For NPR News, I'm Fred Mogul.

That's likely to mean reduced coal production. In states like Montana, that could affect the lives and livelihoods of many people. The state's attorney general says he may join others in suing the EPA over the new rules. Amy Martin of Montana Public Radio reports. AMY MARTIN, BYLINE: Colstrip, Mont. , is true to its name. It exists because of coal. Kevin Murphy has worked in the Rosebud Mine for 15 years, running a bulldozer in the open pits. KEVIN MURPHY: This is our biggest trucks here. MARTIN: This is like a railroad car going down the road almost. K. MURPHY: They ride super smooth. MARTIN: Everything about the mine is enormous, especially the dragline, a machine as big as a ship with a giant boom that extends 300 feet up into the air. The dragline perches on the lip of the pit, scraping away hundreds of feet of rocky soil to reveal the black seam of cold below. K. MURPHY: Our coal's getting deeper, like everywhere else, because everybody's mining, and they're getting into the deeper stuff. MARTIN: The coal goes directly to the power plant across the highway where it's pulverized and burned. This mine-to-mouth option is the second largest coal-fired power plant west of the Mississippi. But Kevin's wife, Marti Murphy, says if you're picturing blackened skies and sooty streets, you haven't actually been to Colstrip. MARTI MURPHY: I feel like that is how we're perceived, as a dirty coal mining town. It's just not true. MARTIN: Marti works in the accounts payable office at the mine. She points out the money generated from coal has given her community amenities you wouldn't normally find in a town of just over 2,000 people. M. MURPHY: We have free golf if you live in the city limits, free gym membership if you live in the city limits, walking paths all around town, a park in every single neighborhood that you could think of. MARTIN: The goal of the EPA's Clean Power Plan is to reduce carbon emissions from the power sector by 30 percent nationwide from 2005 levels. Marti says she wants a healthy environment, but talk of shutting down coal-fired power plants feels threatening in Colstrip. M. MURPHY: It's pretty scary because you think about it, and then you have to think, well, where would we go if something happened? MARK HAGGERTY: I would be worried. MARTIN: That's economist Mark Haggerty of Headwaters Economics, an independent research group in Bozeman, Mont. His organization studies energy issues across the West, and he says the real threat to Colstrip may not be the Clean Power Plan. HAGGERTY: There are larger market trends that are already forcing a big transition away from coal towards natural gas. MARTIN: Those trends could be good for Montana. The state does produce some natural gas, and it's also rich in renewable resources like wind. The American Wind Energy Association ranks Montana third among states with potential land-based wind power generation, but it's currently 21st in the nation for actual wind production. Haggerty says the infrastructure to move wind energy toward population centers is one of the primary things holding it back. HAGGERTY: Those issues I think will be resolved, and I would expect that we could see renewables being a significant competitor with both coal and natural gas over the next decade. MARTIN: That transition is well underway for Jenni Bryce, who lives near the town of Belt in Central Montana. In the pasture behind her house, cattle are grazing, solar panels are collecting sunlight and several turbines are whirling in the wind. JENNI BRYCE: Well, we have a Bergey 10-kilowatt wind turbine, which is probably the standard size for residential. MARTIN: Bryce founded Pine Ridge Products 16 years ago. It's a small-scale solar and wind installation company that she runs from her home. Bryce didn't plan to become a renewable energy entrepreneur. BRYCE: No. I'm actually a speech therapist (laughter). MARTIN: But after she and her husband put up solar panels and a wind turbine for their own use, other families start asking them for advice. That led them to start consulting, manufacturing parts and designing new turbine models. Climate change was not what motivated Bryce to start her business. She points out that families like hers have been using windmills for a long time. BRYCE: I mean, they've been using them for water pumping. And you look back at our history of rural electrification, and before that, you know, they used windmills connected to batteries, you know, for their power in their houses. MARTIN: In true Montana fashion, Bryce's commitment to renewable energy grows out of her rural roots and her passion for self-sufficiency. That passion will be needed to bring Montana into compliance with the new EPA rules and to help ease the transition away from coal in coming decades. For NPR News, I'm Amy Martin in Missoula, Mont.

Marti says she wants a healthy environment, but talk of shutting down coal-fired power plants feels threatening in Colstrip. M. MURPHY: It's pretty scary because you think about it, and then you have to think, well, where would we go if something happened? MARK HAGGERTY: I would be worried. MARTIN: That's economist Mark Haggerty of Headwaters Economics, an independent research group in Bozeman, Mont. His organization studies energy issues across the West, and he says the real threat to Colstrip may not be the Clean Power Plan. HAGGERTY: There are larger market trends that are already forcing a big transition away from coal towards natural gas. MARTIN: Those trends could be good for Montana. The state does produce some natural gas, and it's also rich in renewable resources like wind. The American Wind Energy Association ranks Montana third among states with potential land-based wind power generation, but it's currently 21st in the nation for actual wind production. Haggerty says the infrastructure to move wind energy toward population centers is one of the primary things holding it back. HAGGERTY: Those issues I think will be resolved, and I would expect that we could see renewables being a significant competitor with both coal and natural gas over the next decade. MARTIN: That transition is well underway for Jenni Bryce, who lives near the town of Belt in Central Montana. In the pasture behind her house, cattle are grazing, solar panels are collecting sunlight and several turbines are whirling in the wind. JENNI BRYCE: Well, we have a Bergey 10-kilowatt wind turbine, which is probably the standard size for residential. MARTIN: Bryce founded Pine Ridge Products 16 years ago. It's a small-scale solar and wind installation company that she runs from her home. Bryce didn't plan to become a renewable energy entrepreneur. BRYCE: No. I'm actually a speech therapist (laughter). MARTIN: But after she and her husband put up solar panels and a wind turbine for their own use, other families start asking them for advice. That led them to start consulting, manufacturing parts and designing new turbine models. Climate change was not what motivated Bryce to start her business. She points out that families like hers have been using windmills for a long time. BRYCE: I mean, they've been using them for water pumping. And you look back at our history of rural electrification, and before that, you know, they used windmills connected to batteries, you know, for their power in their houses. MARTIN: In true Montana fashion, Bryce's commitment to renewable energy grows out of her rural roots and her passion for self-sufficiency. That passion will be needed to bring Montana into compliance with the new EPA rules and to help ease the transition away from coal in coming decades.

I'm Guy Raz. Over the past few years, corporations wanting to stage manage an announcement. . . . (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE CALL)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Thank you, good afternoon and welcome to the call. RAZ: . . . Have turned to the corporate conference call. This is where reporters can dial in, grab some quotes and write a story. And normally, they are pretty boring. But anyone listening to this call - this is a call convened by Facebook in 2014. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE CALL)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Joining me on the call today are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook. . . RAZ: Anyone listening heard a pretty pretty amazing prediction. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE CALL)MARK ZUCKERBERG: Thanks Deborah, and thanks everyone for joining us today. RAZ: A prediction about the future of screens. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE CALL)ZUCKERBERG: I'm excited to announce that Facebook has reached an agreement to acquire Oculus VR, the leader in virtual reality technology. RAZ: So this is Mark Zuckerberg on this conference call with reporters, announcing that Facebook had bought for $2 billion a company that makes virtual reality headsets. Now, at this point, a lot of Facebook investors were questioning that acquisition. They were asking questions like isn't virtual reality that thing that was supposed to happen back in the '80s that never took off? And so Zuckerberg, on this call, was trying to justify to those investors why his company just spent $2 billion on a technology most people have never seen. And this is what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE CALL)ZUCKERBERG: The history of our industry is that every 10 or 15 years, there's a new major computing platform, whether it's the PC, the web or now mobile. History suggests that there will be more platforms to come, and that whoever builds and defines these will not only shape all the experiences that our industry built, but also benefit financially and strategically. RAZ: OK, just a pause and translate that. In the past, he's saying, anyone able to get in on the ground floor of new technology platforms like the PC, or the Internet or mobile devices changed the way we live and made their investors a boat-load of money. OK, let's keep listening. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE CALL)ZUCKERBERG: Mobile is the platform of today. And now we're starting to also get ready for the platforms of tomorrow. To me, by far the most exciting future platform is our own vision or modifying what you see to create augmented and immersive experiences. I believe Oculus can be one of the platforms of the future. RAZ: So basically, this is Mark Zuckerberg in March, 2014 predicting that virtual reality goggles are the next smartphone, the next Internet, the next thing that's going to transform our lives. And quietly over the past few years, a lot of other tech companies - Microsoft, Google, Sony - they've also been betting a lot of money on that same idea. CHRIS MILK: People are looking at this technology, I think, as some people think it's a novelty. Some people think it's a videogame. People are beginning to see it as a possible next step to cinema. I think what we're ultimately talking about is an alternate version of human consciousness. RAZ: This is Chris Milk. He's a filmmaker, whose new company Verse makes virtual reality films. These are films designed to be watched using those virtual reality goggles. Chris has already put out a few early visions of those films which you can watch. . . . MILK: Turn. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Turn what? MILK: Turn your body. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Oh! RAZ: On a simple smartphone app. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Oh, look at that. RAZ: We showed some of those films. . . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Oh that's pretty [expletive] cool. RAZ: To people around the NPR office. MILK: Look up, look up. Tilt it up. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: That's cool. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: This is neatUNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Wow. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: Whoa, where did you guys get this? RAZ: Now, it's not what they're looking at that's important, it's. . . . MILK: How. . . . RAZ: How they're seeing it. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: What is this? RAZ: Because the image you see changes. . . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: This is so cool. RAZ: Depending on the direction you point the phone. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: It's totally convincing. RAZ: And it starts to feel as if you're not just watching the screen. . . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Whoa. RAZ: You're actually inside it. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE CALL)ZUCKERBERG: The incredible thing about the technology is that you feel like you're actually present in another place with other people. It's different from anything I've ever experienced in my life, and many people who try it also say the same thing. RAZ: As we're going to hear on this episode, the technology behind our screens is moving really fast. So fast, in fact, that we sometimes spend more time imagining how our screens will change in the future, than really understanding how our screens are changing us right now. MILK: You are always there. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #6: And it keeps us there. MILK: Even if you're not actually there. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #6: Because it's so good at distracting us. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #7: You can click a button and get a dopamine hit and get some information. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #6: Something is blinking, pay attention. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #7: But it's not satisfying information, most of the time. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #6: Yeah, I try to be healthy about it - I don't want it to dictate my life. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: But I think if things continue to go the way that they're going, it's just going to get too much for people. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #6: You know, I spend a lot of time in airports and I look around and everybody, literally - to a person is glued to their. . . . RAZ: There's your phone, right now. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #6: There it is even. . . . RAZ: Right now. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #6: You can hear it. . . RAZ: I can hear it - I can hear it buzzing right now. Today on the show, Screen Time - part one of a two-part TED RADIO HOUR looking at this moment in history when we're starting to interact with our screens almost as much or sometimes even more than we do with other humans. Next week, we're going to go inside the screen, a place where a whole other version of you lives like a digital doppelganger which may be more real than the real you. But this week, we're staying mainly outside the screen, and we're going to start to ask what all this screen interaction is doing to us and how we're living more and more of our lives through it. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE CALL)ZUCKERBERG: Imagine enjoying a courtside seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world, consulting with a doctor face-to-face or going shopping in a virtual store where you can touch and explore the product you're interested in, just by putting on goggles your own home. This is really a new social platform. MILK: Often we talk about - are we creating our eventual dystopian future? And if that is the case, and you are listening to this in the future I. . . . RAZ: We're really sorry. MILK: I'm really sorry about that. RAZ: We'll hear more from Chris Milk later on about how virtual reality technology could change how we experience the world around us. But first - what everyday screen technology is changing about us right now. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED RADIO HOUR from NPR. I'm Guy Raz.

PETER WARREN SINGER: The experience for a large number of the players, so to speak, in war is happening on screen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: It's level, actually, and here comes power. RAZ: This is Peter Warren Singer. He wrote a best-selling book about this called \"Wired For War. \"SINGER: When you're talking about an airstrike in a place like Pakistan or alike. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: I got a guy running, throwing a weapon. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Roger that. SINGER: . . . It involves multiple people in multiple locations. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: He threw it off in the field. He's running back to the vehicle. SINGER: It's not the human eye that's typically seeing it. They're seeing it through some kind of surveillance device. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: He's at the vehicle. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Roger. SINGER: That camera might be beaming back to folks in a command and control center. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Go auto-range on it. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: Yeah. SINGER: To commanders. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: What range do you have? SINGER: . . . Who might be back in the United States. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: I'm engaging. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Yep, engage. SINGER: You as a general, you as a president didn't used to be able to watch the battle live. Now you can do that. RAZ: Yeah. I mean, there's that iconic image of, like, the president and his National Security cabinet sitting in the Situation Room, watching that operation to eventually kill Bin Laden. Like, to watch - they're watching that in real time through a screen. SINGER: The things that we once imagined only in science fiction, whether it's the Internet itself, cyberspace, to drones, hybrid warfare, to universal surveillance and observation, the inability to keep secrets - all of these things were imagined in science fiction and have become real. But things don't play out exactly the way that we planned. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: So you just heard Peter mention drones. Long before most of us even knew what they were, before we heard about the U. S. military using them to bomb targets in Pakistan or Yemen, Peter was raising questions about how they're changing war back in 2009 in this TED talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SINGER: Something big is going on in war today and maybe even the history of humanity itself. The U. S. military went into Iraq with a handful of drones in the air. We now have 5,300. One of the people that I recently met with was an Air Force three-star general, and he said, basically, where we're headed very soon is tens of thousands of robots operating in our conflicts. A robots revolution is upon us. Another way of putting this is that mankind's 5,000-year-old monopoly on the fighting of war is breaking down in our very lifetime. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: So Peter, you gave this talk about six years ago, and obviously, a lot of things have changed. Who - I mean, who else is fighting wars like this now? SINGER: So 82 different countries have drone programs today of some way, shape or form. But one of the interesting challenges that maybe looms in the future is, if we were in a conflict with a major state power, each of those sides would look at the dependence that the other has on these technologies, from communications to command-and-control to intelligence - you name it - and they would try and take that away. They would, in essence, notice our dependence on the screen and try and jam or block or warp everything from traffic lights to the engine rooms of Navy ships. RAZ: I wonder if, like, for the people who are actually doing the killing, you know, from far away, like, the drone pilots - I mean, you would think that war would be cleaner, you know, for them somehow. SINGER: But I would argue that it's not clean and easy on the operators, even if they're operating from afar. Drone operators or analysts who are watching this video - even though they're not physically there, we're still seeing them suffer from PTSD or burnout or the like. When you take life, that is a psychological toll. When you see horrible things, whether you see them up close or from afar, it can take a toll. Another part of the explanation may be the disconnect of making these kind of decisions, seeing these sorts of things and, an hour later, standing in line at the Burger King or getting in an argument with your wife about, you know, forgetting to pick up milk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SINGER: The future of war is also going to be a YouTube war. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #6: They're still firing the 203s. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #7: Who is? UNIDENTIFIED MAN #6: These guys right here are firing. . . SINGER: There're several thousand video clips of combat footage from Iraq on YouTube right now. Now, this could be a good thing. It could be building connections between the home front and the warfront as never before. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #8: OK. We're still taking fire from our western flank - RPGs and small arms. SINGER: But inevitably, the ability to download these video clips gives you the ability to turn it into entertainment. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #8: Get across. Go, go, go, go, go. SINGER: This ability to watch war but experience less creates a wrinkle in the public's relationship with war. I think about this with a sports parallel. It's like the difference between watching a NBA game - a professional basketball game on TV where the athletes are tiny figures on the screen and being at that basketball game in person and realizing what somebody 7 feet really does look like. But we have to remember. These are just the clips. They lose the context. They lose the humanity. War just becomes slam dunks and smart bombs. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: You know, Peter, I mean, the thing that's interesting is - and I know this is not, you know, a new question that you've sort of thought about, but it is, to me, a big question, which is, when a country has a capacity to send an unmanned aircraft somewhere to attack something or a person and control that through a screen, it means that making that choice to do that is arguably somewhat easier 'cause you're not risking your own people. You're not risking their lives. SINGER: It used to be that the barriers to war were high. You know, you had to build castles or aircraft carriers. Not anyone could do it. And they were also high in terms of the political decisions that it - was required to take your nation into war - you know, Congress itself voting. What we're seeing now is a lowering of the barriers. RAZ: Yeah. SINGER: We can see this, for example, in the drone war, so to speak, that we've been fighting in Pakistan and Yemen. We've carried out more than 500 airstrikes. These are operations that, if we were talking about man systems, we'd be treating very differently. These are operations that have never been formally voted on by Congress. So the barriers to war have been lowered both through the broader availability of the technologies of war, but also the way that we view war or, even more so, things that are war that we're not willing to call war. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Peter Warren Singer - he's got a new novel out that touches on a lot of this stuff. It's called \"Ghost Fleet: A Novel Of The Next World War. \" You can see his entire talk at ted. com. GUY RAZ, HOST:  Most of what we've been hearing about so far is how all of this technology is affecting us personally.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: You know, Peter, I mean, the thing that's interesting is - and I know this is not, you know, a new question that you've sort of thought about, but it is, to me, a big question, which is, when a country has a capacity to send an unmanned aircraft somewhere to attack something or a person and control that through a screen, it means that making that choice to do that is arguably somewhat easier 'cause you're not risking your own people. You're not risking their lives. SINGER: It used to be that the barriers to war were high. You know, you had to build castles or aircraft carriers. Not anyone could do it. And they were also high in terms of the political decisions that it - was required to take your nation into war - you know, Congress itself voting. What we're seeing now is a lowering of the barriers. RAZ: Yeah. SINGER: We can see this, for example, in the drone war, so to speak, that we've been fighting in Pakistan and Yemen. We've carried out more than 500 airstrikes. These are operations that, if we were talking about man systems, we'd be treating very differently. These are operations that have never been formally voted on by Congress. So the barriers to war have been lowered both through the broader availability of the technologies of war, but also the way that we view war or, even more so, things that are war that we're not willing to call war. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: Peter Warren Singer - he's got a new novel out that touches on a lot of this stuff. It's called \"Ghost Fleet: A Novel Of The Next World War. \" You can see his entire talk at ted. com.", "section": "TED Radio Hour", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2015 NPR.  All rights reserved.

You can write a Facebook post about a bad day or you can put an Instagram photo of a great day, smiling. But the thing is your screen can't really understand how you feel - at least not yet. RANA EL KALIOUBY: I think building machines and devices that can sense your emotions, I think, with that type of technology instead of people, like, emoting these social signals and then they disappear into cyberspace, we have an opportunity to capture them. RAZ: This is Rana el Kaliouby. She's a computer scientist who spent the past few years at MIT's Media Lab. And the idea that our devices could be built to detect our emotions - it came to Rana when she moved from Cairo to Cambridge in the U. K. back in the late 1990s to work on her Ph. D. KALIOUBY: That was the first time I was basically away from home. RAZ: Rana was in England by herself, thousands of miles away from anyone she knew. KALIOUBY: And I was pretty lonely. There were a lot of these days. RAZ: And because she was in a new place where she didn't know anyone, Rana was actually spending most of her time with her laptop, which wasn't much of a friend at all. KALIOUBY: It had absolutely no idea what my emotional state was. And I could be happy or I could be stressed or frustrated, and it would be completely oblivious. RAZ: So Rana's sitting there in England, and she's wondering, how could I fix this? (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KALIOUBY: What if our devices could sense how we felt and reacted accordingly, just the way an emotionally intelligent friend would? RAZ: Today, more than 15 years after she first asked this question, Rana explained how she's getting closer to the answer. Here she is on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KALIOUBY: Those questions led me and my team to create technologies that can read and respond to our emotions, and our starting point was the human face. So our human face happens to be one of the most powerful channels that we all use to communicate social and emotional state, everything from enjoyment, surprise, empathy and curiosity. In emotion science, we call each facial muscle movement an action unit. So for example, action unit 12, it is a lip corner pull, which is the main component of a smile. Another example is action unit 4. It's the brow furrow. It's when you draw your eyebrows together and you create all these textures and wrinkles. We don't like them, but it's a strong indicator of a negative emotion. So we have about 45 of these action units, and they combine to express hundreds of emotions. Teaching a computer to read these facial emotions is hard because these action units - they can be fast, they're subtle, and they combine in many different ways. RAZ: So initially, Rana and her team fed tens of thousands of photos of people smiling or frowning into a computer program, so it could learn all these tiny little micro expressions. Today, they have 12 billion examples of those expressions, which makes the technology even better at detecting all the subtleties in our faces. And so what they've done is combine the program with a tiny camera, kind of like the one already built into your smartphone. And during her TED talk, Rana brought up a volunteer. Her name is Chloe (ph). And Ranaa gave Chloe an iPad to hold up in front of her face. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KALIOUBY: As you can see, the algorithm has essentially found Chloe's face - so it's this white bounding box. And then it identifies the main feature points on your face. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KALIOUBY: Her eyebrows, her eyes, her mouth and her nose. And it starts tracking how these facial muscles move over time. So, for example, when you smile. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KALIOUBY: And then, as she smiles - this is a genuine smile, that's great. So you can see the green bar go up as she smiles. Your lip corners move upwards and outwards, and they create these wrinkles around your eyes and your cheeks. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KALIOUBY: Can you try, like, a subtle smile to see if the computer  can recognize - it does recognize subtle smiles, as well. We've worked really hard to make that happen. And it identifies these things and it says, oh, OK. You're smiling here. And it maps it to an emotional state. RAZ: Once Rana and her team perfect this technology, she imagines all kinds of ways other scientists and engineers could build it into our lives. For example, you could send an email, one day, embedded with data about how you are feeling as you wrote it or what if your phone or your laptop or maybe even the mirror in your bathroom read your face every day? KALIOUBY: And imagine if all these devices talk to each other and they can capture various aspects of your day and your emotions of the day, and we have a baseline for you. So we know what's your norm, and then we also know when you deviate from that norm. So your phone can say, hey, you know, I've noticed that you haven't laughed for the past four days. What's going on? Is there something I can do to help? You know, if it knows your humor profile, for example. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)AZIZ ANSARI: And then I realize, oh, my God, 50 Cent has no idea what a grapefruit is. KALIOUBY: . . . Can find content that is really funny. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)STEVE JOBS: Stay hungry. Stay foolish. KALIOUBY: . . . Or inspiring. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOBS: As you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you. KALIOUBY: And it can suggest five minutes of meditation. RAZ: Or dance music. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KALIOUBY: Or dance music (laughter). RAZ: Yeah. KALIOUBY: Or that, too. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KALIOUBY: So it can do a lot of things once it understands what your patterns are and what your emotions are over time. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KALIOUBY: I think in five years down the line, all our devices are going to have an emotion chip. And we won't remember what it was like when we couldn't just frown at our device and our device would say, you didn't like that, did you? Imagine if your learning app sensed that you're confused and slowed down or that you're bored so it sped up, just like a great teacher would in a classroom. Emotion-enabled wearable glasses can help individuals who are visually impaired read the faces of others, and it can help individuals on the autism spectrum interpret emotion, something that they really struggle with. What if your wristwatch tracked your mood or your car sensed that you're tired, or perhaps your fridge knows that you're stressed, so it auto-locks to prevent you from binge eating (laughter). I would like that, yeah. (LAUGHTER)KALIOUBY: What if when I was in Cambridge I had access to my real-time emotion stream and I could share that with my family back home in a very natural way, just like I would have if we were all in the same room together? RAZ: How do you imagine all this could, like, change us - right? - because, I mean, I don't know, part of this makes me a little uncomfortable. KALIOUBY: So we're very social animals and social beings. And the only thing we're changing is this paradigm in which we interact with technology, right? We are becoming more and more digital. We're surrounded by a lot more highly-connected, intelligent devices. And I don't think that that's going to change anytime soon. Like, I don't see my daughter suddenly stopping texting. Like, that's going to be very hard (laughter). So I think the solution is not to curb our use of technology but instead embrace it and build empathy into that technology. Like, I think it's important that we learn, as humans, that our emotions continue to matter, even in a digital world. RAZ: That's Rana el Kaliouby. Her company is called Affectiva.

And next week on our second episode about Screen Time, we're going to step inside the screen. And we're going to ask a lot more questions about what it means for our lives, more and more to be lived there. So to end this first episode, someone to lead us in. Do you think it's conceivable that we're heading towards a future where most of our lives will be lived digitally? CHRIS MILK: It's certainly not my goal. Although it might look like that sometimes. RAZ: Chris Milk, he's the guy who made those virtual reality films we showed around the office at the beginning of the show. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Wow. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Whoa. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Oh, that's pretty [expletive] cool. RAZ: You remember all that, right? So Chris started his career making music videos for people like Arcade Fire and Kanye West. He did the video for this track. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TOUCH THE SKY\")KANYE WEST: (Singing) I got to testify. RAZ: But after doing this kind of work for a while, he was looking to try something different, something more meaningful. So Chris started to design these interactive video installations, these films that he would mount in art museums. And he started to notice something. MILK: I would sit there all day just, like, watching it from a dark corner. RAZ: By it, he means this film he designed. And the way it worked was that a camera would project your shadow onto a bright white wall. But if you moved your arms, your shadow - your actual shadow would grow wings. MILK: And if you flapped them, you actually start flying up into the air and off the screen. RAZ: And Chris would notice that people changed when the screen was more than just a frame on the wall. MILK: What I saw was this very visceral human reaction. People would just lose themselves inside of it. RAZ: So this sparked an idea for him, but also a problem. MILK: The problem was there's just no way to scale something like that. RAZ: Yeah. MILK: Yeah I can fit six people in it at a time. I can build it in another museum simultaneously. And then I've got 12 people in it at a time. I want a million people in it at a time. RAZ: Chris started to think more and more about the limits of the screen and how film hasn't really changed all that much since he was a kid growing up in the 80s. Here's Chris' \"TED Talk\". (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MILK: The film, it's an incredible medium. But essentially, it's the same now as it was then. It's a group of rectangles that are played in a sequence. And we've done incredible things with those rectangles. But I started thinking about - is there a way that I could use modern and developing technologies to tell stories in different ways and tell different kinds of stories that maybe I couldn't tell using the traditional tools of filmmaking that we've been using for a hundred years? But then I started thinking about frames, and what do they represent. And a frame is just a window. I mean, all the media that we watch - television, cinema - they're these windows into these other worlds. And I thought well great, I got you in a frame but I don't want you in the frame, I don't want you in the window, I want you through the window. I want you on the other side in the world, inhabiting the world. So that leads me back to virtual reality. RAZ: OK, so before we talk about Chris' specific role in virtual reality, here's what's going on in that world, generally. This holiday season, and early into next year, a bunch of companies like Sony and Microsoft, Google, HTC and Oculus - that's the company now owned by Facebook - they will all release virtual reality headsets. Basically it's a big pair of goggles with a 3-D screen inside. And along with some hand controllers, you'll be able to play all kinds of video games in a completely new way. That's where most of the focus is - video games. But Chris Milk isn't interested in videogames, he makes movies. And he wants to make movies designed to be watched using these new headsets. And that means changing everything about the way movies are made, starting with the cameras. MILK: The current technology that we're working with and most people are working with is sort of a ball of cameras with a lot of lenses that look in a lot of different directions simultaneously. Then, we go into a postproduction process, and we stitch all those different directions together so that we have one singular sphere where you can look in every direction. RAZ: Which means if, say, the Rolling Stones put one of those cameras on stage with them, you could put on a VR headset and be there with them, too. And from your vantage point on stage, you could turn your head in any direction, and you would see a different part of it. MILK: And when that happens, you get this feeling of what's called presence. RAZ: Yeah. MILK: The way the world moves around you as your physical body moves through it is different than the way that you see a movie or you see a television show which is this thing that's a rectangle and it's on a wall. But virtual reality actually mirrors the way that you see the world in real life. RAZ: So in Chris Milk's TED Talk, he describes how the better this technology gets at making you feel like you're really there, the more powerful and emotional these films will become. And one of those films is already pretty powerful. It's an eight-minute movie Chris described on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MILK: So this film is called \"Clouds Over Sidra\". And it was made in conjunction with our virtual reality company called VRSE and the United Nations and a co-collaborator called Gabo Arora. And we went to a Syrian refugee camp in Jordan and shot the story of a 12-year-old girl there named Sidra. And her and her family fled Syria through the desert into Jordan. And she's been living in this camp for the last year and a half. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"CLOUDS OVER SIDRA\")SIDRA: (Through interpreter) My name is Sidra. I am 12 years old. I am in the fifth grade. I am from Syria. RAZ: So Chris, in this clip, which I guess we should explain that if you watch this in a VR headset, you're basically seeing this girl - she's right in front of you. She's talking to you. She's, like, sitting on the rug on the floor of a - in this dusty, hot building in this refugee camp. MILK: Yeah, and the thing that happens in virtual reality that does not happen in a rectangle on your wall, is you find yourself in the same room as this girl. When you look down, you're sitting on the same earth that she's sitting on. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"CLOUDS OVER SIDRA\")SIDRA: (Through interpreter)I have a big family, three brothers, one is a baby. He cries a lot. MILK: And something changes when that happens. And I can't tell you from a biological level, or a cognitive level what that exactly is, but something definitely changes. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"CLOUDS OVER SIDRA\")SIDRA: (Through interpreter) I like cloudy days, I feel like I am under a cover. RAZ: In this film, you can watch Sidra's friends walking right past you on their way to a temporary school. And when you look at them, they look back at you and smile and wave. Seeing this film in a virtual reality headset is so powerful because it's as if you are there. And Chris knows it, he's already shown the film at places like the World Economic Forum in Davos, to some of the world's most powerful people. And when they watch it, he's seen tears literally stream down their faces as they experience that refugee camp. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MILK: We're working with the United Nations right now to shoot a whole series of these films. We just finished shooting a story in Liberia. And now, we're going to shoot a story in India. And we're taking these films and we're showing them at the United Nations to people that work there and people that are visiting their. And we're showing them to the people that can actually change the lives of the people inside of the films. And that's where I think we just start to scratch the surface of the true power of virtual reality. It's not a videogame peripheral, it connects humans to other humans in a profound way that I've never seen before in any other form of media. And it can change people's perception of each other. RAZ: I mean, it is all those things, right? Like, it is so exciting. And it's also so terrifying because you can imagine that it can change the truth. I mean, people's perceptions can be so affected and moved by an experience in this world that seems so real, that it becomes real, right? Like, you can imagine a - you know, somebody could take this technology and create what seems real, a real version of an idea and convince minds - change minds, and actually create real hatred. MILK: Yeah, you can use film and you can use radio and you can use literature to change minds for the purpose of evil. And you will be able to do it in virtual reality as well. I mean, you can't - would you - let me ask you, let me turn it back on you. Would you say that we shouldn't have literature or we shouldn't have cinema because it can be used for those sort of purposes? RAZ: No, of course not. Right? No, of course not, that's a thing. It's like you can't really fool-proof this stuff. You can't make it impossible for evil people to use. It's just not. . . . MILK: You can't. RAZ: Right? MILK: No, you can't. RAZ: Yeah. MILK: So what I'd say, though - my hope would be that allowing people to have experiences that are impossible in the physical world can be an enlightening, life-changing, transformative experience. I was in Sicily last week, and we were in this little village, in this town square. And there was an elderly Italian couple there. And I had a headset in my backpack. And we asked them if they wanted to try it. They were friendly and smiling and talking to us and we asked them if they wanted to try it. And the man tried it on and came out on the other side with his eyes wide open. And in his broken English, he said that there is lots of very bad things in the world, but this was a good thing. And I hope he's right. RAZ: That's Chris Milk. You can download his company's app VRSE - it's VRSE - to see some of the films we talked about with or without a virtual-reality headset. Now that we've stepped inside the screen, join us next week as we ask what it means for our lives increasingly to be lived there. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALKS)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: I predict that years from now, we'll regard taking away your access to virtual worlds as completely inappropriate. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: What does this really mean? Are we going to be creatures that are going to live differently, breathe differently, love differently? UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: We're creating hundreds of thousands, in not millions of pieces of content that are going to live online long after we're gone. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: The way we are defined on the internet, on Google, has become more and more important than who we actually are as people. RAZ: That's next week on the show. Don't miss it. GUY RAZ, HOST:  OK so all this episode, we've been talking about what's happening to us on the real-world side of our screens, like how we interact with them from the outside, but this is a two-parter. And next week on our second episode about Screen Time, we're going to step inside the screen.

And then I've got 12 people in it at a time. I want a million people in it at a time. RAZ: Chris started to think more and more about the limits of the screen and how film hasn't really changed all that much since he was a kid growing up in the 80s. Here's Chris' \"TED Talk\". (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) MILK: The film, it's an incredible medium. But essentially, it's the same now as it was then. It's a group of rectangles that are played in a sequence. And we've done incredible things with those rectangles. But I started thinking about - is there a way that I could use modern and developing technologies to tell stories in different ways and tell different kinds of stories that maybe I couldn't tell using the traditional tools of filmmaking that we've been using for a hundred years? But then I started thinking about frames, and what do they represent. And a frame is just a window. I mean, all the media that we watch - television, cinema - they're these windows into these other worlds. And I thought well great, I got you in a frame but I don't want you in the frame, I don't want you in the window, I want you through the window. I want you on the other side in the world, inhabiting the world. So that leads me back to virtual reality. RAZ: OK, so before we talk about Chris' specific role in virtual reality, here's what's going on in that world, generally. This holiday season, and early into next year, a bunch of companies like Sony and Microsoft, Google, HTC and Oculus - that's the company now owned by Facebook - they will all release virtual reality headsets. Basically it's a big pair of goggles with a 3-D screen inside. And along with some hand controllers, you'll be able to play all kinds of video games in a completely new way. That's where most of the focus is - video games. But Chris Milk isn't interested in videogames, he makes movies. And he wants to make movies designed to be watched using these new headsets. And that means changing everything about the way movies are made, starting with the cameras. MILK: The current technology that we're working with and most people are working with is sort of a ball of cameras with a lot of lenses that look in a lot of different directions simultaneously. Then, we go into a postproduction process, and we stitch all those different directions together so that we have one singular sphere where you can look in every direction. RAZ: Which means if, say, the Rolling Stones put one of those cameras on stage with them, you could put on a VR headset and be there with them, too. And from your vantage point on stage, you could turn your head in any direction, and you would see a different part of it. MILK: And when that happens, you get this feeling of what's called presence. RAZ: Yeah. MILK: The way the world moves around you as your physical body moves through it is different than the way that you see a movie or you see a television show which is this thing that's a rectangle and it's on a wall. But virtual reality actually mirrors the way that you see the world in real life. RAZ: So in Chris Milk's TED Talk, he describes how the better this technology gets at making you feel like you're really there, the more powerful and emotional these films will become. And one of those films is already pretty powerful. It's an eight-minute movie Chris described on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) MILK: So this film is called \"Clouds Over Sidra\". And it was made in conjunction with our virtual reality company called VRSE and the United Nations and a co-collaborator called Gabo Arora. And we went to a Syrian refugee camp in Jordan and shot the story of a 12-year-old girl there named Sidra. And her and her family fled Syria through the desert into Jordan. And she's been living in this camp for the last year and a half. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"CLOUDS OVER SIDRA\") SIDRA: (Through interpreter) My name is Sidra. I am 12 years old. I am in the fifth grade. I am from Syria. RAZ: So Chris, in this clip, which I guess we should explain that if you watch this in a VR headset, you're basically seeing this girl - she's right in front of you. She's talking to you. She's, like, sitting on the rug on the floor of a - in this dusty, hot building in this refugee camp. MILK: Yeah, and the thing that happens in virtual reality that does not happen in a rectangle on your wall, is you find yourself in the same room as this girl. When you look down, you're sitting on the same earth that she's sitting on. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"CLOUDS OVER SIDRA\") SIDRA: (Through interpreter)I have a big family, three brothers, one is a baby. He cries a lot. MILK: And something changes when that happens. And I can't tell you from a biological level, or a cognitive level what that exactly is, but something definitely changes. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"CLOUDS OVER SIDRA\") SIDRA: (Through interpreter) I like cloudy days, I feel like I am under a cover. RAZ: In this film, you can watch Sidra's friends walking right past you on their way to a temporary school. And when you look at them, they look back at you and smile and wave. Seeing this film in a virtual reality headset is so powerful because it's as if you are there. And Chris knows it, he's already shown the film at places like the World Economic Forum in Davos, to some of the world's most powerful people. And when they watch it, he's seen tears literally stream down their faces as they experience that refugee camp. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) MILK: We're working with the United Nations right now to shoot a whole series of these films. We just finished shooting a story in Liberia. And now, we're going to shoot a story in India. And we're taking these films and we're showing them at the United Nations to people that work there and people that are visiting their. And we're showing them to the people that can actually change the lives of the people inside of the films. And that's where I think we just start to scratch the surface of the true power of virtual reality. It's not a videogame peripheral, it connects humans to other humans in a profound way that I've never seen before in any other form of media. And it can change people's perception of each other. RAZ: I mean, it is all those things, right? Like, it is so exciting. And it's also so terrifying because you can imagine that it can change the truth. I mean, people's perceptions can be so affected and moved by an experience in this world that seems so real, that it becomes real, right? Like, you can imagine a - you know, somebody could take this technology and create what seems real, a real version of an idea and convince minds - change minds, and actually create real hatred. MILK: Yeah, you can use film and you can use radio and you can use literature to change minds for the purpose of evil. And you will be able to do it in virtual reality as well. I mean, you can't - would you - let me ask you, let me turn it back on you. Would you say that we shouldn't have literature or we shouldn't have cinema because it can be used for those sort of purposes? RAZ: No, of course not. Right? No, of course not, that's a thing. It's like you can't really fool-proof this stuff. You can't make it impossible for evil people to use. It's just not. . . . MILK: You can't. RAZ: Right? MILK: No, you can't. RAZ: Yeah. MILK: So what I'd say, though - my hope would be that allowing people to have experiences that are impossible in the physical world can be an enlightening, life-changing, transformative experience. I was in Sicily last week, and we were in this little village, in this town square. And there was an elderly Italian couple there. And I had a headset in my backpack. And we asked them if they wanted to try it. They were friendly and smiling and talking to us and we asked them if they wanted to try it. And the man tried it on and came out on the other side with his eyes wide open. And in his broken English, he said that there is lots of very bad things in the world, but this was a good thing. And I hope he's right. RAZ: That's Chris Milk. You can download his company's app VRSE - it's VRSE - to see some of the films we talked about with or without a virtual-reality headset. Now that we've stepped inside the screen, join us next week as we ask what it means for our lives increasingly to be lived there. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALKS) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: I predict that years from now, we'll regard taking away your access to virtual worlds as completely inappropriate. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: What does this really mean? Are we going to be creatures that are going to live differently, breathe differently, love differently? UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: We're creating hundreds of thousands, in not millions of pieces of content that are going to live online long after we're gone. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: The way we are defined on the internet, on Google, has become more and more important than who we actually are as people. RAZ: That's next week on the show.

This episode, we're looking at the way we interact with our screens and how those interactions might be changing us. So think about the human brain. From a very early age, our brain responds to and is shaped by what we see and what we hear. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: This idea has been studied by a lot of scientists, including this one. DIMITRI CHRISTAKIS: My name's Dimitri Christakis. I'm a pediatrician and epidemiologist and a parent of two teenagers. RAZ: And a few years ago, Dimitri did a study on newborn babies just a day old. And he played them music like this, Mozart. And then he would analyze their breathing. CHRISTAKIS: What we've learned is that babies, even at one day of age, will have discernible changes in the respiratory rate and their breathing depending on what they're hearing. RAZ: So a baby listening to this. . . CHRISTAKIS: You actually will see that their breathing pattern is slow and steady. RAZ: So, like, if you're listening to Mozart, it's like (breathing). CHRISTAKIS: That's about right. RAZ: But in contrast, he says. CHRISTAKIS: If you put on something that has a different - say, Stravinsky. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHRISTAKIS: . . . With more minor chords. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHRISTAKIS: Their breathing pattern became more irregular and slightly faster. And then the very interesting thing was at the end of that segment of Stravinsky, we put Mozart back on. Then you see a return to the original breathing pattern. RAZ: They're like, that's more like it. CHRISTAKIS: (Laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHRISTAKIS: Now, that isn't to say that one source of music or another is preferable to the baby. RAZ: Yeah. CHRISTAKIS: But what we can say is that they are so attuned to their environment early on that they make such subtle distinctions, even on their very first day of life. RAZ: Now, the idea here is that the way our brains are stimulated matters, especially when we're young and our brains are being shaped by that stimulation. But for most kids, that stimulation is not Mozart. It's not Stravinsky. It's screen time - lots and lots of screen time. Here in the U. S. , for example, the typical preschool child spends about four and a half hours a day in front of the screen. And Dimitri has been researching what that means for those kids and for their future. Here's his TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CHRISTAKIS: Now, we know from decades of research that too little stimulation early on is bad for brain development. But the question we've had at our lab for some time is, what about too much? Is it actually possible to over-stimulate the developing brain or, more appropriately, to inappropriately stimulate the developing brain in ways that are actually not beneficial but harmful? And this is important because we're technologizing childhood today in a way that's unprecedented. In 1970, the average age in which children began to watch television regularly was 4 years. And today, based on research that we've done, it's 4 months. It's not just how early they watch but how much they watch. The typical child before the age of 5 is watching about four and half hours of TV a day. That represents as much as 40 percent of their waking hours. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: I mean, all that screen time, presumably, is cutting down on how often kids are interacting, you know, in the real world. CHRISTAKIS: The simple truth is that we're all what they call digital immigrants. I mean, the incredible thing to me is our children who, if they were born five years ago, didn't know a world where an iPhone didn't exist. And they are digital natives. They don't know of a world that these things didn't exist in, and they're incredibly tethered to them. RAZ: I mean, they're kind of like guinea pigs because most of the way they communicate and see the world will happen through a screen. CHRISTAKIS: You're absolutely right. And, in fact, because I'm asked a lot by parents about the effects of all of these new technologies, what I have to share with them is the fact that science quite literally cannot keep up with the pace of technological advances. So we started studying the iPad and touch screen media about three years ago. We were probably among the first in the country to do it. And it takes a long time to get funding for research, and that's increasingly difficult. And then you have to conduct the experiment themselves and that takes time. And you have to analyze the data and so. . . RAZ: I mean, basically, we don't know. CHRISTAKIS: We know some things. I mean, I don't want to be entirely neolistic. We do know some things. But you're right. In many other ways, we're in the midst of a large uncontrolled experiment on the next generation of children. RAZ: One of those things scientists do know is that not all screens are created equal and not all content is either. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MISTER ROGERS' NEIGHBORHOOD\")FRED ROGERS: Hi, Aud (ph). AUD: Oh, hi, Fred. ROGERS: (Laughter) How are you? AUD: I'm fine, how are you. ROGERS: Good, thanks. I brought my television neighbor to see what a restaurant was like. AUD: Oh, I'm so glad. Can I show you to a table? ROGERS: Certainly. AUD: I'm awfully busy today. One of the waitresses is ill. ROGERS: I see. AUD: So I'm sort of doing double duty. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CHRISTAKIS: Fred Rogers invented reality TV. (LAUGHTER)CHRISTAKIS: He's not credited with it. Actually, it's not reality, right? It's even slower-paced than reality. (LAUGHTER)CHRISTAKIS: The waitress says I'm awfully busy, but she doesn't seem the least bit hurried. (LAUGHTER)CHRISTAKIS: Now, I want to contrast that with \"The Powerpuff Girls Movie,\" the right mix of sugar and spice for a satisfying rush. I don't know how many of you have seen that, but here's a scene from that. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE POWERPUFF GIRLS MOVIE\")CHRISTAKIS: Again, you can see a lot of rapid sequencing. In fact, this was the first movie that was ever rated PG for nonstop, frenetic, animated action. (LAUGHTER)CHRISTAKIS: So you can see that there are very, very real differences in pacing. RAZ: Dimitri says we're just starting to understand how pacing in TV shows could affect the human brain but not just by studying humans. CHRISTAKIS: There are limits to the kinds of experiments that we can even do ethically, which is one of the reasons we started working with mice in the lab, if you can believe it, to try to develop models of media usage that can be studied more robustly. RAZ: You basically - you turn mice cages into TV lounges? CHRISTAKIS: TV lounges, yeah, that's right. That's a very nice way of putting it. RAZ: What it looks like and sounds like to spend your entire mousy childhood watching a big screen TV and what it could mean for us. That's coming up in just a minute. I'm Guy Raz. Stay with us, you're listening to the TED RADIO HOUR from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: One the show today, Screen Time, a look at how all the screens in our lives are changing us. And just a minute ago, pediatrician and researcher Dimitri Christakis who studies screen time in kids was about to describe an experiment he did with mice. And these were young mice, about 10 days old. And for a month, what ends up being their entire childhood, Dimitri gives them free, unlimited TV. CHRISTAKIS: By having them listen to the cartoon channel and have photo rhythmically activated lights provide visual stimulation to go along with it. (SOUNDBITE OF UNIDENTIFIED TV SHOW)UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) And then that trio went to. . . RAZ: And this is what it's like - bright, multicolored, flashing lights six hours a day. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: This sounds like torture. CHRISTAKIS: It's interesting; when we look at their cortisol levels, there's no physiological signs that this is actually stressful to them. RAZ: Oh. CHRISTAKIS: But it is over stimulating their senses in much the same way television and other screen media do for young children's brains. RAZ: What Dimitri's mouse studies revealed is that the more the mice watched TV, the harder it became for those mice to learn and to stay attentive. So for example, they'd get confused by objects they'd actually seen before, objects they should've learned to recognize already. So when researchers followed up these mouse studies with similar studies in children, comparing kids who, say, watch a lot of \"Mister Rogers\" with kids who watch a lot of \"Powerpuff Girls\" - you can probably guess where this is going - they found pretty similar patterns. CHRISTAKIS: What you see is that educational programs like \"Mister Rogers\" pose no increased risk of attentional problems. Entertainment programs like \"The Powerpuff Girls\" increase the chances by about 60 percent. And violent programming, which I didn't show you, increases it even by more than 100 percent. And violent programs are typically even more rapidly sequenced. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Do you find that your attention span has been affected since you've been a screen user? CHRISTAKIS: I do think that my attentional capacity has become somewhat diminished. Of course, maybe that has as much to do with aging as anything else. But I worry much more about my children that they are able to stay focused on a task. Many people believe that multitasking and fast-paced world is what we live in and children might as well learn to adapt to it early on. And I don't think that that's true. I certainly don't want people, whether they're CEOs of companies in the future, presidents of industry or even artists or writers, to not be able to stay focused on something. RAZ: Yeah. I remember when my younger son was 2 and we had a PBS program on TV. It was \"Sesame Street. \" And he walked up to the TV and he started swiping right. He just, like, took his finger across the TV. And he - it was just - he couldn't understand why it wasn't reacting to him because to him, like, a screen was this thing that you can just touch and make it do what you want it to do. CHRISTAKIS: That really has been a game changer in the last five years, these interactive screens. And it has given those of us that have researched children and screens real pause. But, you know, the one thing that a child never says - or never thinks if they're preverbal - when they interact with the typical passive media, is I did it. And even the best quality children's shows that tried to engage children, recognizing how important that was to their cognitive and social development, would ask rhetorical questions. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MISTER ROGERS' NEIGHBORHOOD\")ROGERS: It is a beautiful day in this neighborhood. Is it in yours? Have you ever been to a circus? You like to swing? Do you have any idea what might be in this bag? RAZ: Now, as a kid, you could answer Mr. Rogers. You could talk back to him. But you could never affect what happened on the screen. And Dimitri says this is an area where modern screen technology, like touch screens or kids' apps, could actually do something that Mr. Rogers couldn't because by interacting with those screens, kids can say I did it. I made that happen. CHRISTAKIS: Any parent of any child who's had the experience of putting them in a high chair and, let's say, giving them something, either a toy or a piece of fruit or whatever, knows what that child is going to do. They're going to take it and drop it, much to their delight. And they'll be even more delighted when the parent comes and picks it up and puts it back, thus creating kind of an infinite feedback loop. RAZ: Yeah. CHRISTAKIS: Children love - love the fact that they make something happen in the real world. So what do I think? I think that touch screens and particularly high-quality apps are very, very different than passive media. But the challenge is it's not just not all screens are the same. Not all content on screens is the same. RAZ: Dimitri Christakis - he's a pediatrician and researcher at Seattle Children's Hospital. You can check out his talk at ted. npr. org.

Do you have any idea what might be in this bag? RAZ: Now, as a kid, you could answer Mr. Rogers. You could talk back to him. But you could never affect what happened on the screen. And Dimitri says this is an area where modern screen technology, like touch screens or kids' apps, could actually do something that Mr. Rogers couldn't because by interacting with those screens, kids can say I did it. I made that happen. CHRISTAKIS: Any parent of any child who's had the experience of putting them in a high chair and, let's say, giving them something, either a toy or a piece of fruit or whatever, knows what that child is going to do. They're going to take it and drop it, much to their delight. And they'll be even more delighted when the parent comes and picks it up and puts it back, thus creating kind of an infinite feedback loop. RAZ: Yeah. CHRISTAKIS: Children love - love the fact that they make something happen in the real world. So what do I think? I think that touch screens and particularly high-quality apps are very, very different than passive media. But the challenge is it's not just not all screens are the same. Not all content on screens is the same. RAZ: Dimitri Christakis - he's a pediatrician and researcher at Seattle Children's Hospital.

AMBER CASE: Sounds good. So then you can't pick up all the buzzes and I can't get distracted by my own screen while talking about screens. RAZ: Yeah, exactly. This is Amber Case. She's an anthropologist. Actually, to be precise - and this sounds a little weird, but just bear with me - Amber is a cyborg anthropologist. CASE: That's correct. There is a subfield of the anthropology of science which is the anthropology of cyborgs, and it looks at the relation between humans and technology - how technology affects culture and how things change over time. RAZ: And how technology is such a big part of our lives now. Because Amber says, to a certain extent, we are all becoming cyborgs. She explained that idea from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CASE: You're not Robocop and you're not Terminator, but you're cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen or use one of your cell phone devices. So what's a good definition for cyborg? Well, traditional definition is an organism to which endogenous components have been added for the purpose of adapting to new environments. That came from a 1960 paper on space travel. Because if you think about it, space is pretty awkward. People aren't supposed to be there. But humans are curious and they like to add things to their body so that they can go to the Alps one day and become a fish in the sea the next. So let's look at the concept of traditional anthropology. Somebody goes to another country, says, how fascinating these people are, how interesting their tools are, how curious their culture is. And then they write a paper and maybe a few other anthropologists read it. And we think it's very exotic. Well, what's happening is that we've suddenly found a new species. I, as a cyborg anthropologist, have suddenly said, oh wow, now suddenly now we're a new form of Homo sapiens, and look at these fascinating cultures and look at these curious rituals that everybody's doing around this technology. They're clicking on things and staring at screens. RAZ: In other words, our screens are just another tool in the long line of human inventions that have changed the way we live. So think of stone tools or bronze arrows or the knife. Those tools became so useful they were almost like extensions of our physical selves, almost like another limb. CASE: I mean, a hammer's really an extension of your fist. A knife is really an extension of your tooth. And you can actually make that device, so to speak, outside of yourself. And if it breaks you can just make a new one, whereas, say, if you're a saber-toothed tiger and your tooth breaks, you might not be able to eat something again, right? So having our devices outside of ourselves and being able to kind of switch them out depending on what we needed to do makes us incredibly versatile creatures. RAZ: And not that long after we invented physical tools to extend what our bodies could do, humans came up with mental tools to extend what our brains could. CASE: So we were able to paint on the side of a cave wall, and then that stores mental information outside of ourselves and that allows somebody else in the future to look at that and reabsorb the information back into their brain. RAZ: Yeah. CASE: Then we had papyrus, we had scrolls, paper, the printing press and it allowed for us to have an increase in the ability to take information outside of ourselves and allow somebody to download it back into their brain. But now you have Facebook and Twitter and all of these different social networks, and so we're just information, information, information. But I think that the phones and a lot of these social interfaces are becoming so personal because it's not just a phone - it's kind of a mental exoskeleton. It's an external part of your brain. RAZ: I mean, that's the thing, right? I mean, it isn't just a phone. I mean, through it you have access to an infinite set of ideas. CASE: Yeah, it's really a magic portal that allows you to go into another dimension of space and time. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE MESSAGE ALERT)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Alert. Your FedEx package was delivered. Saturday, 2 p. m. CASE: I mean, literally you're going to different time zones. . . (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE MESSAGE ALERT)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Reminder. CASE: . . . With the click of a button.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: Hey, have you left yet? CASE: . . . The people who've left you voicemail. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: It's just Grammy. I just wanted to talk to you about something. CASE: . . . That you can't listen to because it's too noisy out. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: Nothing important or anything. CASE: You're on the side of the street and there's a truck driving by. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: Hope I get to see you then. CASE: I mean, really it's a mobile desktop, and one of the problems is that it really demands all of your attention instead of lets you be human. Like, your primary task as a human should be being human, but when this device demands all of your attention, it can interrupt other primary tasks. For instance, driving or just walking down the street. I mean, we saw the video of the guy who was walking down the street texting and ran into a bear. RAZ: That is, like, right there, the clash of the human dual reality, the imagined reality and the objective reality, right there on his iPhone and crashing into the bear. CASE: Right because walking down the street is often kind of a boring place, and so you can escape from it by going into a different type of place. This virtual reality that we have in our pockets has become often more real, or at least, attracting our attention more. So even though it makes you temporarily superhuman, it actually gets rid of a lot of the other sensory perception that you might need to rely on as an individual in society. RAZ: So if we've outsourced a part of our brain to the device in our pocket, now what? Cyborg anthropologist Amber Case returns in just a minute. Stay with us. I'm Guy Raz. This episode, \"Screen Time. \" You're listening to the TED RADIO HOUR from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: It's the TED RADIO HOUR from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. Our show today, \"Screen Time: Part One. \" We're looking at how our interaction with screens is changing us, and we were just hearing from anthropologist Amber Case, who studies how our screens increasingly are extensions of ourselves. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CASE: And because of that, you have a second self. RAZ: Here's more from her TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CASE: Whether you like it or not, you're starting to show up online and people are interacting with your second self when you're not there. And suddenly, we have to start to maintain our second self. You have to present yourself in digital life in a similar way that you would in your analog life. So in the same way that you wake up, take a shower and get dressed, you have to learn to do that for your digital self. And the problem is that a lot of people now, especially adolescents, have to go through two adolescences. They have to go through their primary one that's already awkward, and then they have to go through their second self's adolescence. And that's even more awkward because there's an actual kind of history of what they've gone through online. And so what happens is, when we bring all of that into the social space, we end up checking our phones all the time. So we have this sort of thing called ambient intimacy. It's not that we're always connected to everybody, but at any time, we can connect to anyone we want. And so there are some psychological effects that happen with this. What I'm really worried about is that people aren't taking time for mental reflection anymore and that they aren't slowing down and stopping, being around all those people in the room all the time that are trying to compete for their attention. They're not just sitting there. And really, when you have no external input, that is the time when there's a creation of self, when you can try and figure out who you really are. And then once you do that, you can figure out how to present your second self in a legitimate way instead of just dealing with everything as it comes in and, oh, I have to do this, I have to do this and I have to do this. RAZ: Yeah, I mean, I feel like it's also affecting - like, I lose my mind if I'm in a line and for some reason I don't have my smartphone with me. You know what I mean? Have you experienced that? CASE: I experience that all the time. Now, the issue is that a lot of people are using their phone in a supermarket checkout line because as a human in an industrial society, they're put on pause. And the thing that reconnects them to some sort of humanity is to take out their phone. You see people using phones a lot in non-places - something that you don't have any relation or history or identity in. And the phone itself has more relation, history and identity to you than an airport, for instance, or a highway. So you often find people using their phones in these kind of inhuman places in order to get back some of that humanity that's been put on pause. RAZ: So what do you do? I mean, how do you get away from all that? CASE: I like to go on road trips because it's - I like to go on road trips and bring paper maps and turn off my phone because I am forced to be with myself, forced to talk to the person next to me and look outside. It feels really nice afterwards, like when you're a kid and you have to experience real time. Like, you feel like you're a little bit more real again. RAZ: Amber Case, she's a cyborg anthropologist.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. You may know me as NPR's social science correspondent or the author of \"The Hidden Brain,\" a book about unconscious bias. I love making connections between the things I see every day and the worlds of psychology, sociology and economics. This podcast is going to be a conversation about the unseen patterns in our lives. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Today, I'm going to tell you about a communication problem in many relationships. It's not obvious, but it's so common that as you hear about it, you're going to think of half a dozen examples where this has happened in your own life. I'm also going to play a rapid-fire game with a friend to tell you four ways you can become a better communicator. Then I'm going to talk with comedian Meshelle about the importance of incorporating rituals into our busy lives. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: We're going to talk about human behavior in lots of different ways on this podcast. We're going to have stories, conversations, and we're also going to play lots and lots of games. Today, we're going to play a music game. I've asked a colleague on NPR's Science Desk to join me. He's Adam Cole. Hi, Adam. ADAM COLE, BYLINE: Hi, Shankar, great to be here. VEDANTAM: Adam runs a science YouTube channel called Skunk Bear. He's a musician, artist, all-around renaissance guy. COLE: What an intro. VEDANTAM: Adam, for today's music game, I'm going to give you a challenge. COLE: All right. VEDANTAM: I want you to listen to all the segments in today's episode and come up with a song that stitches all of the science together. Are you ready, Adam? COLE: I am uncapping my pen. VEDANTAM: All right, let's get started. First up, author Sheila Heen. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Along with Douglas Stone, Sheila recently wrote a book called \"Thanks For The Feedback: The Science And Art Of Receiving Feedback Well. \" One concept in the book focuses on something called switch-tracking. SHEILA HEEN: So switch-tracking is a pattern in feedback conversations that is so common that it's instantly recognizable, which is that someone gives you feedback. And your reaction to that feedback changes the subject. VEDANTAM: That's Sheila. HEEN: So a switch-track is that place where the track is going along, and then there is a switch. And depending on which way the switch is turned, the train will glide smoothly onto a second track or stay on the first track. VEDANTAM: She uses a scene from the 2006 TV series \"Lucky Louie\" to illustrate how switch-tracking works. Louie and his wife, Kim, are getting ready for a child-free romantic weekend. And Louie has just bought Kim some red roses. HEEN: So what's happening is a conversation starts. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LUCKY LOUIE\")PAMELA ADLON: (As Kim) Listen, try not to take this the wrong way, OK? But if we're going to be married for the next 30 years, I need you to know that red roses are not my thing. HEEN: The first person stays on their own track. The second person actually smoothly switches to a different topic, which is their own reaction to the feedback and often the feedback that they have themselves for the first person. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LUCKY LOUIE\")LOUIS C. K. : (As Louie) OK, well, can I critique how you just told me that? (LAUGHTER)HEEN: And they just get further and further apart, right? And they don't even realize that they're going in different directions. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LUCKY LOUIE\")ADLON: (As Kim) I've told you before that I don't like red roses, remember? C. K. : (As Louie) I just think that you should have thanked me for the flowers first and then said the thing about the roses. HEEN: There are really two topics on the table, right? Kim's topic is, you don't listen to me. And Louie's topic is, you don't appreciate me. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LUCKY LOUIE\")C. K. : (As Louie) Still, it's a gift. So I guess I don't think it matters what it is. You should still thank me, right? ADLON: (As Kim) Yeah, but you see, I don't necessarily think I should thank you for giving me something that I've specifically told you that I don't like. That's all. (LAUGHTER)HEEN: And each of them is hearing the whole conversation through the lens of their own topic. So in this case, they're not even really realizing that there are two topics on the table, I think. VEDANTAM: What I find fascinating, Sheila, is that the person who is receiving the feedback initially doesn't realize that they are switching tracks, that they don't actually - it's not a conscious decision to say, I recognize this person is giving me feedback; I'm uncomfortable with this topic; I am strategically going to change the conversation to something else. It's not happening at that level, is it? HEEN: It's not happening at that level at all. And what's interesting is - so for the person doing the switch-tracking, you're just thinking, well, that's actually not the most important thing that we need to talk about. What we need to talk about is your problem. The person who started the conversation sometimes actually does realize that the other person is changing the topic. And they view it as making excuses or distracting or trying to take us off on a tangent. And to the second person, it's not a tangent at all. It's the most important thing going on. So that's what the fight then becomes about. So we're both aware we're having an argument. And the real argument is about what's the most important topic here between us. VEDANTAM: What happens when both people feel their topic is so much more important than the other person's topic that neither is willing to give way? HEEN: You're sunk. (LAUGHTER)HEEN: But that dilemma, in and of itself, then is the topic of the conversation, which is, I'm so frustrated or upset or whatever that I can't actually engage with your topic. VEDANTAM: Yeah, I think this happens so often in conversations. And one of the things you point out in your chapter which I found really intriguing is sometimes the switch-tracking happens inside one person's head and not actually saying it aloud. Can you talk about that for a second? HEEN: Yeah, and I think that that's even more common in hierarchy, when it's the person lower in the hierarchy, right? So your boss is chewing you out. And you're not saying anything out loud because you're, you know, actually smarter than that in that moment. But what you're thinking, of course, is, OK, first of all, this is not my fault. And second of all, you're even worse at this than I am. And third of all, I can't believe that you're doing this in front of everyone and you're this unprofessional. VEDANTAM: Right. HEEN: You know, and everybody, by the way, hates you. VEDANTAM: Right. HEEN: Right? So you are switch-tracking to about four other topics of your feedback for him or her. VEDANTAM: Right, right. HEEN: But it's a silent switch-track. So your boss isn't necessarily aware that you're not paying any attention at all. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LUCKY LOUIE\")C. K. : (As Louie) Hang on. All I'm asking for here is a tiny bit of gratitude. ADLON: (As Kim) I said thank you. C. K. : (As Louie) No, you didn't. I was standing there with the flowers, and you didn't. . . ADLON: (As Kim) I said thank you the first time you gave me red roses, remember? It was my birthday. I said, thank you. And then I said very politely that I would prefer it in the future if you never again gave me red roses. So either you didn't listen or you don't care. Which is it? (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: When you think about it, hearing feedback like this from a loved one or a close colleague can be really difficult. I asked Sheila why it seems easier to receive feedback from strangers than from the people who are close to us. HEEN: I think it's because it removes the tension of that wanting to be accepted and respected and loved. You know, I've had my husband come home and say, gosh, this new colleague had such an insightful comment; I think it's really going to change the way I teach. And, you know, he tells me what it is. And I think, uh-huh. And he says, what? I say, nothing. He says, what? I'm like, OK, I've only been telling you that for 10 years. VEDANTAM: Right. HEEN: You know, now you've known this guy for 10 minutes, and he's, like, the voice of God about what's true about you. And I think that the fact that it's coming from someone who is a stranger or an acquaintance makes it less threatening in a way that enables us to hear it sometimes. VEDANTAM: There's a sadness to that - isn't there, Sheila? - which is that we actually don't listen to the people who know us the best when, in fact, they're the people who could help us the most. HEEN: Yeah. You know, they're the people who know us the best and love us the most. But they're also the people who want us to change the most (laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LUCKY LOUIE\")ADLON: (As Kim) When I tell you things and you don't listen, it's a huge insult to me. It makes me feel like I don't matter. C. K. : (As Louie) Believe me, I totally get this. You want me to listen to you and then later remember the things that you say. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: Well, this has been wonderful. Sheila Heen, thank you for joining me today on the HIDDEN BRAIN. HEEN: It was such a pleasure. VEDANTAM: Sheila Heen and Douglas Stone teach negotiation at the Harvard Law School. They're also the authors of the best-selling book, \"Thanks For The Feedback. \"(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Sheila, that was awesome. I have to say that if you write a book about how you should be better at receiving feedback, there is a real peril here, which is that people are going to start giving you feedback and expect that you're going to be good at receiving it. Has that happened to you? HEEN: Oh, my goodness. If you want an extra helping of criticism in your life, write a book on receiving feedback. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). HEEN: Holy cow. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: OK, Adam Cole has been furiously taking notes so he can come up with a song about all the ideas in this podcast episode. Of course, being a typical artist, Adam neglected to bring in paper. So he's writing on his own hands. Are you getting some ideas, Adam? COLE: I think I'm about to run out of hand space, got to roll up my sleeves, use my arms. VEDANTAM: All right, I'm afraid you're going to have to take off your shirt and start writing on your biceps soon. Anyway, we'll be back in a moment for the next segment. We're going to play a game called Stopwatch Science, rapid-fire ideas about human behavior with my friend, Daniel Pink.

STEPHEN THOMPSON, BYLINE: Thank you, Shankar. By way of introduction, I am Stephen Thompson. LINDA HOLMES, BYLINE: And I'm Linda Holmes. And we are the co-hosts of Pop Culture Happy Hour. THOMPSON: So every week on the show, for those of you who haven't heard it, we'll talk about the latest in movies and music and books and whatever's on our minds. Each episode is stuffed with recommendations. HOLMES: That's right. And we have all kinds of wonderful guests who come and join us on the show. So give it a listen, and we really very much appreciate it. Shankar, where can they find our show? VEDANTAM: You can find Pop Culture Happy Hour at npr. org/podcasts and on the NPR One app. Back now for a new segment we'd like to introduce to you, we are calling it Stopwatch Science. I'm joined by Daniel Pink, whom we have anointed our senior Stopwatch Science correspondent. Hello, Dan. DANIEL PINK, BYLINE: Hey, Shankar, great to be here. VEDANTAM: Dan is going to be a regular on the HIDDEN BRAIN podcast. He's the author of \"Drive,\" \"To Sell Is Human,\" and other books. And like me, he has a passion for social science research. PINK: Totally. VEDANTAM: Let's explain to the listeners how this is going to work. Dan and I are going to share some interesting ideas from social science research. But we each get only 60 seconds to do it. PINK: Can it be done? VEDANTAM: We found a way to keep each other honest. Dan's going to give me a warning. . . (SOUNDBITE OF BELL)VEDANTAM: If I bump up against my time. And I'm going to play this sound. . . (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE)VEDANTAM: If he hits one minute. OK, as we've heard, giving and receiving feedback can be difficult. Dan and I are going to tell you four ways you can become a better listener and a better giver of advice. Dan, your 60 seconds starts now. PINK: Well, Shankar, as you said, we're always trying to get people to pay attention - at school, in the office, at home. But there's some research showing that we have a powerful weapon at our disposal, one of, in my view, the greatest inventions in American technological history. And that is the Post-it Note. VEDANTAM: The what? PINK: The Post-it Note, the sticky note. Randy Garner at Sam Houston State University did this amazing experiment a few years ago. And here's what he did. He was dealing with a really recalcitrant group of people, faculty members. And he wanted them to fill out a survey. And he did a study where he gave some people just the survey. He gave some people with the surveys - and a cover letter saying, please fill out the survey. And he gave others the survey with a little Post-it Note - handwritten - saying, would you please fill out the survey? Well, in the first two groups, fewer than half of the faculty members returned the survey, completed the survey. But when he put the Post-it Note on there, the personalized Post-it Note, nearly 70 percent of people completed the survey. VEDANTAM: Wow. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE)PINK: And I think the reason is simple. It's personal. And it's a little bit reciprocal. So if you want someone to do something, put a Post-it Note. VEDANTAM: I really like that, Dan. So the next time I know when you bump up against your 60 seconds, instead of playing an ineffectual buzzer, I'm just going to hold up a Post-it Note. PINK: That's actually probably a pretty good idea. So I don't have a Post-it Note right now, but I do have a timer. And Shankar, your one minute starts right now. VEDANTAM: All right, when someone gives you feedback, there's two ways to think about it, Dan. You can say, OK, I'll take this advice. Or you can say, why is this person telling me this? You can question the motives of the adviser. A few years ago, Max Gunther at Vanderbilt University and his colleagues, they analyzed the brains of men. They stuck them in a brain scanner and piped in the voices of their wives. . . PINK: Oh, boy. VEDANTAM: Giving them advice about some issue. And he found that when the advice was in a subject where the man thought of himself as being an expert, advice from the wives activated a part of the brain that is observed when we try to guess what's happening in another person's mind. So Gunther and his colleagues are speculating that when these men received advice on a subject that was close to home, their reaction - their first reaction - was to question the motives of their wives. PINK: Oh. VEDANTAM: So instead of evaluating the advice on its own terms, these men are asking, why is my wife giving me that kind of advice? So here's the take-home message. Be really careful about offering advice. If you're given advice, listen to the advice. . . (SOUNDBITE OF BELL)VEDANTAM: Instead of questioning the motives of the person who's giving it to you. PINK: That is actually great advice - truly, truly, and - because again, when I hear something that I disagree with, I basically want to question the motives of the person who's giving me the advice or telling me what I want to think. VEDANTAM: I do it all the time too. PINK: That's very, very good, yeah. I think there's a great guidance out there, simply to navigate life, to assume positive intent. And let people disprove that rather than do what I do, which is assume negative, insidious intent. VEDANTAM: Yeah. PINK: And wait for people to be shown to be good people - great advice. VEDANTAM: Well, I completely agree with you, Dan. But that doesn't relieve you of the opportunity to actually deliver your next piece of social science research in under 60 seconds. If you're ready, your time starts now. PINK: So many decades ago, there was a famous commercial that said, if you want to get someone's attention, (whispering) whisper. Now, that might be true. But here's a other question. If you're going to whisper, (shouting) into which ear should you whisper? VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: Well, it turns out that two Italian cognitive scientists. . . VEDANTAM: Oh, boy (laughter). PINK: Luca Tommasi and Daniele Marzoli have analyzed this question. They went to a nightclub. And they wanted to see, in this crowded, noisy nightclub, are people talking to each other into their right ear, into their left ear? And an overwhelming number, 72 percent, they were favoring the right ear. Then it gets even more interesting. They conduct an experiment in that nightclub asking people for cigarettes. Were people more likely to give a cigarette if you asked them in the right ear or if you asked them in the left ear? And lo and behold, big numbers, you got a cigarette if you asked people in their right ear. Now, there's a brain reason for that. Our brains are contralateral. . . (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE)PINK: Left hemisphere controls the right side of the body; left hemisphere controls verbal communication. So if you want to get someone's attention, whisper into their right ear. VEDANTAM: I've got to remember this. I don't know what my editor is going to think when I sidle up next to her and whisper in her ear. I suspect HR might get called in at some point. PINK: Yeah, I don't - I want you to avoid - I want you to avoid that. Just, you know, bias yourself toward the right. But more important, bias yourself toward doing your assignment here, Shankar. Your next one minute starts right now. VEDANTAM: All right, as we know, it's hard to get people to listen to the things you have to say. But besides whispering in their right ear, researchers have also found another technique that shows some promise. Basically, it's self-flattery. PINK: Self-flattery. VEDANTAM: Here's what I mean. The reason people resist threatening information is that it's painful. If you can boost the person's self-esteem before he or she is given threatening information, that might make them more receptive to this kind of information. Tracy Epton at the University of Manchester and her colleagues recently analyzed 144 experiments into the effects of self-affirmation. They find a pattern. When you ask people to reflect on some value they hold dear or when you ask them to write a short essay about their personal positive qualities, they're more likely to accept information that is threatening or unpleasant. So in other words, the next time, before you tell me what I'm doing wrong, Dan, please make sure you compliment me. . . (SOUNDBITE OF BELL)VEDANTAM: On my courage in the face of adversity and the kindness that I display towards soft, furry animals. PINK: Well, that's great. You are a wonderful human being, a great father, a wonderful husband, a brilliant journalist. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: But you blew your time by 10 seconds. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) I'm going to take that to heart. That was Stopwatch Science. I'm Shankar Vedantam. PINK: And I'm Daniel Pink. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: (Whispering) Adam, can you hear me? COLE: Well, you have my attention, but unfortunately I'm wearing stereo headphones. So. . . VEDANTAM: Oh, drat, I forgot about that. OK, I was trying to whisper in your right ear. COLE: But I will say that is probably the most Italian study I've ever heard of, the, you know, cigarettes and nightclub study. VEDANTAM: Yeah, I suspect that if we polled people in Italy about it, they would say, those are tax dollars well spent. COLE: Very much so, yeah. VEDANTAM: All right, when we come back, I'm going to play Adam one final segment. I decided to sit down with a friend at a nice tea shop and talk about the importance of quiet rituals in our lives. But that conversation got switch-tracked by an unexpected visitor. MESHELLE FOREMAN SHIELDS: Is that a rat? VEDANTAM: Stick around. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Support for this episode of HIDDEN BRAIN comes from Casper. They're an online retailer for mattresses. Casper mattresses are American made and obsessively engineered for comfort. They use two technologies, latex foam and memory foam, to give just the right amount of sink and balance. And they have a risk-free trial.

And they have a special offer for listeners of this podcast. Use the promo code, hidden brain to redeem $50 towards a Casper mattress that works for you. VEDANTAM: OK, I know you're eagerly awaiting our last segment so Adam can sing you his song. We're going to be using music, art, books, movies, to talk about science on this podcast. And that made me think about all the recommendations you can find on a Pop Culture Happy Hour. Let's let the hosts tell you more about what's on tap this week. THOMPSON: Thank you, Shankar. I'm Stephen Thompson. HOLMES: And I'm Linda Holmes. And on this week's podcast, we are talking about the Toronto International Film Festival, from which I have just returned with NPR's movie critic, Bob Mondello. THOMPSON: You can hear all about the movies that everyone will be talking about months from now. You will get to be first. HOLMES: That's right. We are here to give you an edge in your Oscar pool, which will not happen for months and months. OK, Shankar, where can they find our show? VEDANTAM: You can find Pop Culture Happy Hour at npr. org/podcasts and on the NPR One app. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Welcome back to HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. I want to introduce you to a friend of, Meshelle, the indie mom of comedy. What's an indie mom? I'll let Meshelle explain. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SHIELDS: An indie mom is a woman who believes that it's OK and great to be a mom and it's awesome to be a wife, but you've got to hold onto yourself as well. You got to have some balance in your life. And my mantra is in order to be a good indie mom, you still have to be innovative and independent in a lot of ways. And what has helped me stay innovative is leaving a Ph. D. program and becoming a stand-up comic. That was a very innovative idea. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: If anyone knows how to slow things down a little bit and to manage a very busy lifestyle, that would be Meshelle. Now in addition to being the mother of three, she's also a comic, an actress, a public speaker. And despite leaving that Ph. D. program, Meshelle is still very much interested in psychology, which is why I thought she would be the perfect friend to talk about the importance of ritual in our daily lives. I caught up with her at a delightful tea shop in Washington, D. C. , called Capital Teas. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SHIELDS: Let's go get tea. VEDANTAM: Oh, my God, look at these choices. SHIELDS: You see all the choices? VEDANTAM: There's, like - how many teas are here? It's like. . . NADA: So the trick is to open the jars and smell the teas. VEDANTAM: May I smell that? NADA: It's roasted almond. VEDANTAM: Oh, so good. SHIELDS: Like, it's a bucket of awesome. VEDANTAM: Our host, Nada (ph), began to make our tea, first scooping out delicate mounds of tea into glass pots and drowning the leaves in steaming, hot water. SHIELDS: See all these little nuances that we learned from being in an authentic teahouse? VEDANTAM: I would just pay to watch this, let alone drink this. I would just pay to watch. SHIELDS: This is a culture. VEDANTAM: You know there's a researcher at Harvard Business School called Francesca Gino, and she's done a lot of work looking at the effects that rituals have on our enjoyment of things, that if you actually build ritual into the process of enjoying something, which is exactly what we're doing here. . . SHIELDS: This is what we're doing. VEDANTAM: I suspect it's going to greatly increase our satisfaction with this cup of tea. SHIELDS: I concur, and I'm not a scientist. What I do know for sure is that I'm very excited in this very moment. VEDANTAM: I am, too. SHIELDS: And I think the ritual has, you know, really added to the excitement 'cause typically when you think tea, you think hot water and a tea bag, typically. Isn't that what you think? VEDANTAM: That's why I do, and a micro. . . SHIELDS: I like the cushy chair. VEDANTAM: Would you like the cushy chair? Please sit on the cushy chair. SHIELDS: But, you know, here's a cultural thing for me, though. I've been raised to never allow the man to sit with his back to the door. VEDANTAM: Really? SHIELDS: Yes, because I was taught that if anything unforeseen were to happen, the man should be ready to protect you. VEDANTAM: Yes. SHIELDS: So if I sit in that chair, I'm breaking culture. VEDANTAM: So there's two problems with that theory. SHIELDS: OK, what's the theory? VEDANTAM: The first thing is that we're sitting in this very peaceful tea shop. . . SHIELDS: This is true. VEDANTAM: . . . Where it's very unlikely anything were to happen. But the second problem - and the bigger problem - is if something were to happen, I am not the kind of guy. . . SHIELDS: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . Who would actually be able to save you, Meshelle. That is very, very unlikely. Now explain to me, are you allowed to clink mugs before you drink tea? SHIELDS: I think we can. VEDANTAM: All right. (SOUNDBITE OF MUGS CLINKING)VEDANTAM: Sublime. Sublime. SHIELDS: Sublime is a great word. VEDANTAM: Absolutely wonderful. Thank you so much. NADA: You're welcome. VEDANTAM: That's a great cup of tea. SHIELDS: Oh, mine turned out great. VEDANTAM: But I have to say it's the whole ritual of it that really, I think, is doing it for me because it's made me slow down. It made me watch. It made me observe as the tea was being made. I never do those things. I never slow down. I'm always - I pop the tea into the microwave and then I. . . SHIELDS: You don't even boil the water anymore? VEDANTAM: Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? SHIELDS: Yeah, my daughter pops hers, and I need the water. For me - it's what you said earlier about the research about ritual because as a stand-up, you have to be very quick. You have to be on your feet. You have to be very improvisational if you're going to have any level of success, right? VEDANTAM: Yes. Yes. SHIELDS: And yet I believe the reason why I have any level of success at stand-up is because I have employed so many rituals into my daily life. VEDANTAM: So let me ask you a question. When I leap out of bed in the morning, every morning, saying, oh, my God, I'm late. Oh, my God, there's six things that I have to do and I have time for only three. But if I do this every single morning, does that count as a ritual? SHIELDS: No, that's pandemonium. I don't know what the ham sandwich that is. That sounds a bit like. . . VEDANTAM: Meshelle tried to convince me of the benefits of slowing down. SHIELDS: This right here. . . VEDANTAM: Yes. SHIELDS: . . . Gives me an immense amount of pleasure - this, this right here. Listen. (SOUNDBITE OF MUG CLINKING)VEDANTAM: I can see that, and I'm so happy for you. SHIELDS: Like, I'm very happy in this very moment. VEDANTAM: Yeah. SHIELDS: I just don't - and then I have the - is that - what is that walking in there? What was that? VEDANTAM: Much to our surprise, a rat from the patio outside decided to join us. It stood up on its hind legs and poked its head through the doorway. SHIELDS: O-M-G, Shankar, he's out there. Close the door. (SOUNDBITE OF DOOR SHUTTING)SHIELDS: Do you see him? VEDANTAM: I will note that in this instance even though I said I would be unable. . . SHIELDS: You would not protect me? VEDANTAM: . . . And unequal to the situation. . . SHIELDS: You certainly did. VEDANTAM: Meshelle did not leap up to close the door. SHIELDS: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: Meshelle, who turned her face to the wall and said O-M-G - that was her response. . . SHIELDS: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . To the coming catastrophe. And she turned to me, the person who is not widely advertised as being the leading man, you left it to me to close the door. SHIELDS: But look what you did. You rose to the occasion. VEDANTAM: I did, indeed. So maybe there's something to these traditions and rituals after all. From now on, I'm going to make sure I sit facing the door so I can always deal with incoming rodents. After my heroic gesture, we finished our tea almost 90 minutes after entering the tea house. It was a rare pleasure to slow down to discover the ritual of tea-making and to see how much it enhanced our experience. SHIELDS: She has to make the tea that way in order for it to turn out this way. If not - if she breaks that ritual - it's a different taste. VEDANTAM: Yeah. If she microwaves it and sticks it in, that's not. . . SHIELDS: Yeah, like if she does the Shankar method. . . VEDANTAM: The Shankar method, yes. SHIELDS: . . . We won't have this experience. VEDANTAM: We wouldn't have this experience. It would be much more efficient, though, I would add, but we wouldn't have the experience. SHIELDS: Efficiency doesn't always equal happiness. VEDANTAM: So people have been telling me for many years. SHIELDS: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: Meshelle, I want to thank you for talking with me today. This has been a pleasure. SHIELDS: It's been a pleasure, too, Shankar. Thank you. VEDANTAM: OK, Adam, I'm relaxed after that cup of tea, the ritual of the tea-making. But what do you think? Do you have enough material to come up with an original song? COLE: Well, I'm not relaxed 'cause I'm going to have to put this all together. But I'm going to go back into the old Skunk Bear cave and see what I can come up with. VEDANTAM: All right, let's see what you do. See you in a bit. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Through the magic of audio, Adam has gone away for several days and now has re-emerged from his Skunk Bear cave. How did it go, Adam? COLE: Well, it went OK. I sort of was going off this sort of back-and-forth nature of this whole episode. So imagine a less talented Gershwin brother. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). COLE: . . . Writing a musical probably called something like, \"All Aboard,\" with a train theme. VEDANTAM: OK. COLE: Ginger Rogers, Fred Astaire have a little back-and-forth here. . . VEDANTAM: And you did this all by yourself? COLE: Well, I got a friend Amanda McQueen to help me out, so yeah. Here we go. VEDANTAM: All right. Let's hear what you came up with. COLE: (Singing). I think you'll find I've got a one track mind with just one train of thought. It's you my love, I'm thinking of, for you a gift I bought. I'm just a romantic, I suppose. So without further ado, here's my present for you - one red rose. AMANDA MCQUEEN: (Singing). You should know this. I don't like roses especially when they're red. COLE: (Singing) Hey, show some restraint, save the complaint and maybe start with banks instead. MCQUEEN: (Singing) You just don't listen. I already said it. COLE: (Singing) But when a gift is given, I mean - come on. You just don't get it. Now we're switchtracking, I'm this close to sending you packing. You don't exude much gratitude. MCQUEEN: You're not hearing. You're just reacting. COLE: But I love you, and you love me. So let's slow down and share a cup of tea. Well, I won't fear the things I hear if you prime my mind with praise. MCQUEEN: Whisper dear in my right ear, and I'll accept the whispered phrase. COLE: And if something irks you just like that rose did. This might work you just put your problems on a Post-it. Now we're switchtracking I'm this close to sending you packing. You don't exude much gratitude. MCQUEEN: You're not hearing. You're just reacting. COLE: But I love you and you love me. So let's slow down and share a cup of - I just cannot get enough of - let's slow down and share a cup of tea. VEDANTAM: Adam, that was fantastic. COLE: Aw, thank you so much. VEDANTAM: You don't exude much gratitude - I love that. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Adam Cole, thank you so much for playing our game. COLE: Well, thanks so much for having me on. VEDANTAM: Will you be back again? COLE: I definitely will. VEDANTAM: Great. Let's give this game a name. Here's what I'm thinking. How about \"Coleplay\"? COLE: Well, let's keep thinking on it. MCQUEEN: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: Since this is our very first episode, there are a lot of people we have to thank. The Embrey Family Foundation, specifically Lauren Embrey and Diane Hosey helped us get off the ground. And so did Heather and Paul Haaga, Paul and Marcia Ginsberg, Anne and John Herrmann, Antoine and Emily van Agtmael, John R. and Tawna B. Farmer, the Mosaic Foundation of R & P Heydon, Howard and Barbara Wollner and Patricia Papper. We couldn't have gotten off the ground without you. Special thanks today to Adam Cole and Amanda McQueen. You can see more about Adam's work on Tumblr and YouTube at Skunk Bear. This episode of the Hidden Brain podcast is produced by Kara McGuirk-Alison and Maggie Penman. Join us next week when we talk about the consequences of near misses and the surprising way losses can motivate us. I'm Shankar Vedantam, and this is NPR. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST:   Welcome to the first episode of the HIDDEN BRAIN podcast. I'm Shankar Vedantam. You may know me as NPR's social science correspondent or the author of \"The Hidden Brain,\" a book about unconscious bias. I love making connections between the things I see every day and the worlds of psychology, sociology and economics. This podcast is going to be a conversation about the unseen patterns in our lives. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Today, I'm going to tell you about a communication problem in many relationships. It's not obvious, but it's so common that as you hear about it, you're going to think of half a dozen examples where this has happened in your own life. I'm also going to play a rapid-fire game with a friend to tell you four ways you can become a better communicator. Then I'm going to talk with comedian Meshelle about the importance of incorporating rituals into our busy lives. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: We're going to talk about human behavior in lots of different ways on this podcast. We're going to have stories, conversations, and we're also going to play lots and lots of games. Today, we're going to play a music game. I've asked a colleague on NPR's Science Desk to join me. He's Adam Cole. Hi, Adam. ADAM COLE, BYLINE: Hi, Shankar, great to be here. VEDANTAM: Adam runs a science YouTube channel called Skunk Bear. He's a musician, artist, all-around renaissance guy. COLE: What an intro. VEDANTAM: Adam, for today's music game, I'm going to give you a challenge. COLE: All right. VEDANTAM: I want you to listen to all the segments in today's episode and come up with a song that stitches all of the science together. Are you ready, Adam? COLE: I am uncapping my pen. VEDANTAM: All right, let's get started. First up, author Sheila Heen. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Along with Douglas Stone, Sheila recently wrote a book called \"Thanks For The Feedback: The Science And Art Of Receiving Feedback Well. \" One concept in the book focuses on something called switch-tracking. SHEILA HEEN: So switch-tracking is a pattern in feedback conversations that is so common that it's instantly recognizable, which is that someone gives you feedback. And your reaction to that feedback changes the subject. VEDANTAM: That's Sheila. HEEN: So a switch-track is that place where the track is going along, and then there is a switch. And depending on which way the switch is turned, the train will glide smoothly onto a second track or stay on the first track. VEDANTAM: She uses a scene from the 2006 TV series \"Lucky Louie\" to illustrate how switch-tracking works. Louie and his wife, Kim, are getting ready for a child-free romantic weekend. And Louie has just bought Kim some red roses. HEEN: So what's happening is a conversation starts. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LUCKY LOUIE\") PAMELA ADLON: (As Kim) Listen, try not to take this the wrong way, OK? But if we're going to be married for the next 30 years, I need you to know that red roses are not my thing. HEEN: The first person stays on their own track. The second person actually smoothly switches to a different topic, which is their own reaction to the feedback and often the feedback that they have themselves for the first person. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LUCKY LOUIE\") LOUIS C. K. : (As Louie) OK, well, can I critique how you just told me that? (LAUGHTER) HEEN: And they just get further and further apart, right? And they don't even realize that they're going in different directions. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LUCKY LOUIE\") ADLON: (As Kim) I've told you before that I don't like red roses, remember? C. K. : (As Louie) I just think that you should have thanked me for the flowers first and then said the thing about the roses. HEEN: There are really two topics on the table, right? Kim's topic is, you don't listen to me. And Louie's topic is, you don't appreciate me. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LUCKY LOUIE\") C. K. : (As Louie) Still, it's a gift. So I guess I don't think it matters what it is. You should still thank me, right? ADLON: (As Kim) Yeah, but you see, I don't necessarily think I should thank you for giving me something that I've specifically told you that I don't like. That's all. (LAUGHTER) HEEN: And each of them is hearing the whole conversation through the lens of their own topic. So in this case, they're not even really realizing that there are two topics on the table, I think. VEDANTAM: What I find fascinating, Sheila, is that the person who is receiving the feedback initially doesn't realize that they are switching tracks, that they don't actually - it's not a conscious decision to say, I recognize this person is giving me feedback; I'm uncomfortable with this topic; I am strategically going to change the conversation to something else. It's not happening at that level, is it? HEEN: It's not happening at that level at all. And what's interesting is - so for the person doing the switch-tracking, you're just thinking, well, that's actually not the most important thing that we need to talk about. What we need to talk about is your problem. The person who started the conversation sometimes actually does realize that the other person is changing the topic. And they view it as making excuses or distracting or trying to take us off on a tangent. And to the second person, it's not a tangent at all. It's the most important thing going on. So that's what the fight then becomes about. So we're both aware we're having an argument. And the real argument is about what's the most important topic here between us. VEDANTAM: What happens when both people feel their topic is so much more important than the other person's topic that neither is willing to give way? HEEN: You're sunk. (LAUGHTER) HEEN: But that dilemma, in and of itself, then is the topic of the conversation, which is, I'm so frustrated or upset or whatever that I can't actually engage with your topic. VEDANTAM: Yeah, I think this happens so often in conversations. And one of the things you point out in your chapter which I found really intriguing is sometimes the switch-tracking happens inside one person's head and not actually saying it aloud. Can you talk about that for a second? HEEN: Yeah, and I think that that's even more common in hierarchy, when it's the person lower in the hierarchy, right? So your boss is chewing you out. And you're not saying anything out loud because you're, you know, actually smarter than that in that moment. But what you're thinking, of course, is, OK, first of all, this is not my fault. And second of all, you're even worse at this than I am. And third of all, I can't believe that you're doing this in front of everyone and you're this unprofessional. VEDANTAM: Right. HEEN: You know, and everybody, by the way, hates you. VEDANTAM: Right. HEEN: Right? So you are switch-tracking to about four other topics of your feedback for him or her. VEDANTAM: Right, right. HEEN: But it's a silent switch-track. So your boss isn't necessarily aware that you're not paying any attention at all. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LUCKY LOUIE\") C. K. : (As Louie) Hang on. All I'm asking for here is a tiny bit of gratitude. ADLON: (As Kim) I said thank you. C. K. : (As Louie) No, you didn't. I was standing there with the flowers, and you didn't. . . ADLON: (As Kim) I said thank you the first time you gave me red roses, remember? It was my birthday. I said, thank you. And then I said very politely that I would prefer it in the future if you never again gave me red roses. So either you didn't listen or you don't care. Which is it? (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: When you think about it, hearing feedback like this from a loved one or a close colleague can be really difficult. I asked Sheila why it seems easier to receive feedback from strangers than from the people who are close to us. HEEN: I think it's because it removes the tension of that wanting to be accepted and respected and loved. You know, I've had my husband come home and say, gosh, this new colleague had such an insightful comment; I think it's really going to change the way I teach. And, you know, he tells me what it is. And I think, uh-huh. And he says, what? I say, nothing. He says, what? I'm like, OK, I've only been telling you that for 10 years. VEDANTAM: Right. HEEN: You know, now you've known this guy for 10 minutes, and he's, like, the voice of God about what's true about you. And I think that the fact that it's coming from someone who is a stranger or an acquaintance makes it less threatening in a way that enables us to hear it sometimes. VEDANTAM: There's a sadness to that - isn't there, Sheila? - which is that we actually don't listen to the people who know us the best when, in fact, they're the people who could help us the most. HEEN: Yeah. You know, they're the people who know us the best and love us the most. But they're also the people who want us to change the most (laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LUCKY LOUIE\") ADLON: (As Kim) When I tell you things and you don't listen, it's a huge insult to me. It makes me feel like I don't matter. C. K. : (As Louie) Believe me, I totally get this. You want me to listen to you and then later remember the things that you say. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: Well, this has been wonderful. Sheila Heen, thank you for joining me today on the HIDDEN BRAIN. HEEN: It was such a pleasure. VEDANTAM: Sheila Heen and Douglas Stone teach negotiation at the Harvard Law School. They're also the authors of the best-selling book, \"Thanks For The Feedback. \" (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Sheila, that was awesome. I have to say that if you write a book about how you should be better at receiving feedback, there is a real peril here, which is that people are going to start giving you feedback and expect that you're going to be good at receiving it. Has that happened to you? HEEN: Oh, my goodness. If you want an extra helping of criticism in your life, write a book on receiving feedback. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). HEEN: Holy cow. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: OK, Adam Cole has been furiously taking notes so he can come up with a song about all the ideas in this podcast episode. Of course, being a typical artist, Adam neglected to bring in paper. So he's writing on his own hands. Are you getting some ideas, Adam? COLE: I think I'm about to run out of hand space, got to roll up my sleeves, use my arms. VEDANTAM: All right, I'm afraid you're going to have to take off your shirt and start writing on your biceps soon. Anyway, we'll be back in a moment for the next segment. We're going to play a game called Stopwatch Science, rapid-fire ideas about human behavior with my friend, Daniel Pink.

STEPHEN THOMPSON, BYLINE: Thank you, Shankar. By way of introduction, I am Stephen Thompson. LINDA HOLMES, BYLINE: And I'm Linda Holmes. And we are the co-hosts of Pop Culture Happy Hour. THOMPSON: So every week on the show, for those of you who haven't heard it, we'll talk about the latest in movies and music and books and whatever's on our minds. Each episode is stuffed with recommendations. HOLMES: That's right. And we have all kinds of wonderful guests who come and join us on the show. So give it a listen, and we really very much appreciate it. Shankar, where can they find our show? VEDANTAM: You can find Pop Culture Happy Hour at npr. org/podcasts and on the NPR One app. Back now for a new segment we'd like to introduce to you, we are calling it Stopwatch Science. I'm joined by Daniel Pink, whom we have anointed our senior Stopwatch Science correspondent. Hello, Dan. DANIEL PINK, BYLINE: Hey, Shankar, great to be here. VEDANTAM: Dan is going to be a regular on the HIDDEN BRAIN podcast. He's the author of \"Drive,\" \"To Sell Is Human,\" and other books. And like me, he has a passion for social science research. PINK: Totally. VEDANTAM: Let's explain to the listeners how this is going to work. Dan and I are going to share some interesting ideas from social science research. But we each get only 60 seconds to do it. PINK: Can it be done? VEDANTAM: We found a way to keep each other honest. Dan's going to give me a warning. . . (SOUNDBITE OF BELL) VEDANTAM: If I bump up against my time. And I'm going to play this sound. . . (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) VEDANTAM: If he hits one minute. OK, as we've heard, giving and receiving feedback can be difficult. Dan and I are going to tell you four ways you can become a better listener and a better giver of advice. Dan, your 60 seconds starts now. PINK: Well, Shankar, as you said, we're always trying to get people to pay attention - at school, in the office, at home. But there's some research showing that we have a powerful weapon at our disposal, one of, in my view, the greatest inventions in American technological history. And that is the Post-it Note. VEDANTAM: The what? PINK: The Post-it Note, the sticky note. Randy Garner at Sam Houston State University did this amazing experiment a few years ago. And here's what he did. He was dealing with a really recalcitrant group of people, faculty members. And he wanted them to fill out a survey. And he did a study where he gave some people just the survey. He gave some people with the surveys - and a cover letter saying, please fill out the survey. And he gave others the survey with a little Post-it Note - handwritten - saying, would you please fill out the survey? Well, in the first two groups, fewer than half of the faculty members returned the survey, completed the survey. But when he put the Post-it Note on there, the personalized Post-it Note, nearly 70 percent of people completed the survey. VEDANTAM: Wow. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) PINK: And I think the reason is simple. It's personal. And it's a little bit reciprocal. So if you want someone to do something, put a Post-it Note. VEDANTAM: I really like that, Dan. So the next time I know when you bump up against your 60 seconds, instead of playing an ineffectual buzzer, I'm just going to hold up a Post-it Note. PINK: That's actually probably a pretty good idea. So I don't have a Post-it Note right now, but I do have a timer. And Shankar, your one minute starts right now. VEDANTAM: All right, when someone gives you feedback, there's two ways to think about it, Dan. You can say, OK, I'll take this advice. Or you can say, why is this person telling me this? You can question the motives of the adviser. A few years ago, Max Gunther at Vanderbilt University and his colleagues, they analyzed the brains of men. They stuck them in a brain scanner and piped in the voices of their wives. . . PINK: Oh, boy. VEDANTAM: Giving them advice about some issue. And he found that when the advice was in a subject where the man thought of himself as being an expert, advice from the wives activated a part of the brain that is observed when we try to guess what's happening in another person's mind. So Gunther and his colleagues are speculating that when these men received advice on a subject that was close to home, their reaction - their first reaction - was to question the motives of their wives. PINK: Oh. VEDANTAM: So instead of evaluating the advice on its own terms, these men are asking, why is my wife giving me that kind of advice? So here's the take-home message. Be really careful about offering advice. If you're given advice, listen to the advice. . . (SOUNDBITE OF BELL) VEDANTAM: Instead of questioning the motives of the person who's giving it to you. PINK: That is actually great advice - truly, truly, and - because again, when I hear something that I disagree with, I basically want to question the motives of the person who's giving me the advice or telling me what I want to think. VEDANTAM: I do it all the time too. PINK: That's very, very good, yeah. I think there's a great guidance out there, simply to navigate life, to assume positive intent. And let people disprove that rather than do what I do, which is assume negative, insidious intent. VEDANTAM: Yeah. PINK: And wait for people to be shown to be good people - great advice. VEDANTAM: Well, I completely agree with you, Dan. But that doesn't relieve you of the opportunity to actually deliver your next piece of social science research in under 60 seconds. If you're ready, your time starts now. PINK: So many decades ago, there was a famous commercial that said, if you want to get someone's attention, (whispering) whisper. Now, that might be true. But here's a other question. If you're going to whisper, (shouting) into which ear should you whisper? VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: Well, it turns out that two Italian cognitive scientists. . . VEDANTAM: Oh, boy (laughter). PINK: Luca Tommasi and Daniele Marzoli have analyzed this question. They went to a nightclub. And they wanted to see, in this crowded, noisy nightclub, are people talking to each other into their right ear, into their left ear? And an overwhelming number, 72 percent, they were favoring the right ear. Then it gets even more interesting. They conduct an experiment in that nightclub asking people for cigarettes. Were people more likely to give a cigarette if you asked them in the right ear or if you asked them in the left ear? And lo and behold, big numbers, you got a cigarette if you asked people in their right ear. Now, there's a brain reason for that. Our brains are contralateral. . . (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) PINK: Left hemisphere controls the right side of the body; left hemisphere controls verbal communication. So if you want to get someone's attention, whisper into their right ear. VEDANTAM: I've got to remember this. I don't know what my editor is going to think when I sidle up next to her and whisper in her ear. I suspect HR might get called in at some point. PINK: Yeah, I don't - I want you to avoid - I want you to avoid that. Just, you know, bias yourself toward the right. But more important, bias yourself toward doing your assignment here, Shankar. Your next one minute starts right now. VEDANTAM: All right, as we know, it's hard to get people to listen to the things you have to say. But besides whispering in their right ear, researchers have also found another technique that shows some promise. Basically, it's self-flattery. PINK: Self-flattery. VEDANTAM: Here's what I mean. The reason people resist threatening information is that it's painful. If you can boost the person's self-esteem before he or she is given threatening information, that might make them more receptive to this kind of information. Tracy Epton at the University of Manchester and her colleagues recently analyzed 144 experiments into the effects of self-affirmation. They find a pattern. When you ask people to reflect on some value they hold dear or when you ask them to write a short essay about their personal positive qualities, they're more likely to accept information that is threatening or unpleasant. So in other words, the next time, before you tell me what I'm doing wrong, Dan, please make sure you compliment me. . . (SOUNDBITE OF BELL) VEDANTAM: On my courage in the face of adversity and the kindness that I display towards soft, furry animals. PINK: Well, that's great. You are a wonderful human being, a great father, a wonderful husband, a brilliant journalist. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: But you blew your time by 10 seconds. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) I'm going to take that to heart. That was Stopwatch Science. I'm Shankar Vedantam. PINK: And I'm Daniel Pink. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: (Whispering) Adam, can you hear me? COLE: Well, you have my attention, but unfortunately I'm wearing stereo headphones. So. . . VEDANTAM: Oh, drat, I forgot about that. OK, I was trying to whisper in your right ear. COLE: But I will say that is probably the most Italian study I've ever heard of, the, you know, cigarettes and nightclub study. VEDANTAM: Yeah, I suspect that if we polled people in Italy about it, they would say, those are tax dollars well spent. COLE: Very much so, yeah. VEDANTAM: All right, when we come back, I'm going to play Adam one final segment. I decided to sit down with a friend at a nice tea shop and talk about the importance of quiet rituals in our lives. But that conversation got switch-tracked by an unexpected visitor. MESHELLE FOREMAN SHIELDS: Is that a rat? VEDANTAM: Stick around. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Support for this episode of HIDDEN BRAIN comes from Casper. They're an online retailer for mattresses. Casper mattresses are American made and obsessively engineered for comfort.

And they have a special offer for listeners of this podcast. Use the promo code, hidden brain to redeem $50 towards a Casper mattress that works for you. VEDANTAM: OK, I know you're eagerly awaiting our last segment so Adam can sing you his song. We're going to be using music, art, books, movies, to talk about science on this podcast. And that made me think about all the recommendations you can find on a Pop Culture Happy Hour. Let's let the hosts tell you more about what's on tap this week. THOMPSON: Thank you, Shankar. I'm Stephen Thompson. HOLMES: And I'm Linda Holmes. And on this week's podcast, we are talking about the Toronto International Film Festival, from which I have just returned with NPR's movie critic, Bob Mondello. THOMPSON: You can hear all about the movies that everyone will be talking about months from now. You will get to be first. HOLMES: That's right. We are here to give you an edge in your Oscar pool, which will not happen for months and months. OK, Shankar, where can they find our show? VEDANTAM: You can find Pop Culture Happy Hour at npr. org/podcasts and on the NPR One app. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Welcome back to HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. I want to introduce you to a friend of, Meshelle, the indie mom of comedy. What's an indie mom? I'll let Meshelle explain. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SHIELDS: An indie mom is a woman who believes that it's OK and great to be a mom and it's awesome to be a wife, but you've got to hold onto yourself as well. You got to have some balance in your life. And my mantra is in order to be a good indie mom, you still have to be innovative and independent in a lot of ways. And what has helped me stay innovative is leaving a Ph. D. program and becoming a stand-up comic. That was a very innovative idea. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: If anyone knows how to slow things down a little bit and to manage a very busy lifestyle, that would be Meshelle. Now in addition to being the mother of three, she's also a comic, an actress, a public speaker. And despite leaving that Ph. D. program, Meshelle is still very much interested in psychology, which is why I thought she would be the perfect friend to talk about the importance of ritual in our daily lives. I caught up with her at a delightful tea shop in Washington, D. C. , called Capital Teas. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SHIELDS: Let's go get tea. VEDANTAM: Oh, my God, look at these choices. SHIELDS: You see all the choices? VEDANTAM: There's, like - how many teas are here? It's like. . . NADA: So the trick is to open the jars and smell the teas. VEDANTAM: May I smell that? NADA: It's roasted almond. VEDANTAM: Oh, so good. SHIELDS: Like, it's a bucket of awesome. VEDANTAM: Our host, Nada (ph), began to make our tea, first scooping out delicate mounds of tea into glass pots and drowning the leaves in steaming, hot water. SHIELDS: See all these little nuances that we learned from being in an authentic teahouse? VEDANTAM: I would just pay to watch this, let alone drink this. I would just pay to watch. SHIELDS: This is a culture. VEDANTAM: You know there's a researcher at Harvard Business School called Francesca Gino, and she's done a lot of work looking at the effects that rituals have on our enjoyment of things, that if you actually build ritual into the process of enjoying something, which is exactly what we're doing here. . . SHIELDS: This is what we're doing. VEDANTAM: I suspect it's going to greatly increase our satisfaction with this cup of tea. SHIELDS: I concur, and I'm not a scientist. What I do know for sure is that I'm very excited in this very moment. VEDANTAM: I am, too. SHIELDS: And I think the ritual has, you know, really added to the excitement 'cause typically when you think tea, you think hot water and a tea bag, typically. Isn't that what you think? VEDANTAM: That's why I do, and a micro. . . SHIELDS: I like the cushy chair. VEDANTAM: Would you like the cushy chair? Please sit on the cushy chair. SHIELDS: But, you know, here's a cultural thing for me, though. I've been raised to never allow the man to sit with his back to the door. VEDANTAM: Really? SHIELDS: Yes, because I was taught that if anything unforeseen were to happen, the man should be ready to protect you. VEDANTAM: Yes. SHIELDS: So if I sit in that chair, I'm breaking culture. VEDANTAM: So there's two problems with that theory. SHIELDS: OK, what's the theory? VEDANTAM: The first thing is that we're sitting in this very peaceful tea shop. . . SHIELDS: This is true. VEDANTAM: . . . Where it's very unlikely anything were to happen. But the second problem - and the bigger problem - is if something were to happen, I am not the kind of guy. . . SHIELDS: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . Who would actually be able to save you, Meshelle. That is very, very unlikely. Now explain to me, are you allowed to clink mugs before you drink tea? SHIELDS: I think we can. VEDANTAM: All right. (SOUNDBITE OF MUGS CLINKING) VEDANTAM: Sublime. Sublime. SHIELDS: Sublime is a great word. VEDANTAM: Absolutely wonderful. Thank you so much. NADA: You're welcome. VEDANTAM: That's a great cup of tea. SHIELDS: Oh, mine turned out great. VEDANTAM: But I have to say it's the whole ritual of it that really, I think, is doing it for me because it's made me slow down. It made me watch. It made me observe as the tea was being made. I never do those things. I never slow down. I'm always - I pop the tea into the microwave and then I. . . SHIELDS: You don't even boil the water anymore? VEDANTAM: Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? SHIELDS: Yeah, my daughter pops hers, and I need the water. For me - it's what you said earlier about the research about ritual because as a stand-up, you have to be very quick. You have to be on your feet. You have to be very improvisational if you're going to have any level of success, right? VEDANTAM: Yes. Yes. SHIELDS: And yet I believe the reason why I have any level of success at stand-up is because I have employed so many rituals into my daily life. VEDANTAM: So let me ask you a question. When I leap out of bed in the morning, every morning, saying, oh, my God, I'm late. Oh, my God, there's six things that I have to do and I have time for only three. But if I do this every single morning, does that count as a ritual? SHIELDS: No, that's pandemonium. I don't know what the ham sandwich that is. That sounds a bit like. . . VEDANTAM: Meshelle tried to convince me of the benefits of slowing down. SHIELDS: This right here. . . VEDANTAM: Yes. SHIELDS: . . . Gives me an immense amount of pleasure - this, this right here. Listen. (SOUNDBITE OF MUG CLINKING) VEDANTAM: I can see that, and I'm so happy for you. SHIELDS: Like, I'm very happy in this very moment. VEDANTAM: Yeah. SHIELDS: I just don't - and then I have the - is that - what is that walking in there? What was that? VEDANTAM: Much to our surprise, a rat from the patio outside decided to join us. It stood up on its hind legs and poked its head through the doorway. SHIELDS: O-M-G, Shankar, he's out there. Close the door. (SOUNDBITE OF DOOR SHUTTING) SHIELDS: Do you see him? VEDANTAM: I will note that in this instance even though I said I would be unable. . . SHIELDS: You would not protect me? VEDANTAM: . . . And unequal to the situation. . . SHIELDS: You certainly did. VEDANTAM: Meshelle did not leap up to close the door. SHIELDS: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: Meshelle, who turned her face to the wall and said O-M-G - that was her response. . . SHIELDS: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . To the coming catastrophe. And she turned to me, the person who is not widely advertised as being the leading man, you left it to me to close the door. SHIELDS: But look what you did. You rose to the occasion. VEDANTAM: I did, indeed. So maybe there's something to these traditions and rituals after all. From now on, I'm going to make sure I sit facing the door so I can always deal with incoming rodents. After my heroic gesture, we finished our tea almost 90 minutes after entering the tea house. It was a rare pleasure to slow down to discover the ritual of tea-making and to see how much it enhanced our experience. SHIELDS: She has to make the tea that way in order for it to turn out this way. If not - if she breaks that ritual - it's a different taste. VEDANTAM: Yeah. If she microwaves it and sticks it in, that's not. . . SHIELDS: Yeah, like if she does the Shankar method. . . VEDANTAM: The Shankar method, yes. SHIELDS: . . . We won't have this experience. VEDANTAM: We wouldn't have this experience. It would be much more efficient, though, I would add, but we wouldn't have the experience. SHIELDS: Efficiency doesn't always equal happiness. VEDANTAM: So people have been telling me for many years. SHIELDS: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: Meshelle, I want to thank you for talking with me today. This has been a pleasure. SHIELDS: It's been a pleasure, too, Shankar. Thank you. VEDANTAM: OK, Adam, I'm relaxed after that cup of tea, the ritual of the tea-making. But what do you think? Do you have enough material to come up with an original song? COLE: Well, I'm not relaxed 'cause I'm going to have to put this all together. But I'm going to go back into the old Skunk Bear cave and see what I can come up with. VEDANTAM: All right, let's see what you do. See you in a bit. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Through the magic of audio, Adam has gone away for several days and now has re-emerged from his Skunk Bear cave. How did it go, Adam? COLE: Well, it went OK. I sort of was going off this sort of back-and-forth nature of this whole episode. So imagine a less talented Gershwin brother. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). COLE: . . . Writing a musical probably called something like, \"All Aboard,\" with a train theme. VEDANTAM: OK. COLE: Ginger Rogers, Fred Astaire have a little back-and-forth here. . . VEDANTAM: And you did this all by yourself? COLE: Well, I got a friend Amanda McQueen to help me out, so yeah. Here we go. VEDANTAM: All right. Let's hear what you came up with. COLE: (Singing). I think you'll find I've got a one track mind with just one train of thought. It's you my love, I'm thinking of, for you a gift I bought. I'm just a romantic, I suppose. So without further ado, here's my present for you - one red rose. AMANDA MCQUEEN: (Singing). You should know this. I don't like roses especially when they're red. COLE: (Singing) Hey, show some restraint, save the complaint and maybe start with banks instead. MCQUEEN: (Singing) You just don't listen. I already said it. COLE: (Singing) But when a gift is given, I mean - come on. You just don't get it. Now we're switchtracking, I'm this close to sending you packing. You don't exude much gratitude. MCQUEEN: You're not hearing. You're just reacting. COLE: But I love you, and you love me. So let's slow down and share a cup of tea. Well, I won't fear the things I hear if you prime my mind with praise. MCQUEEN: Whisper dear in my right ear, and I'll accept the whispered phrase. COLE: And if something irks you just like that rose did. This might work you just put your problems on a Post-it. Now we're switchtracking I'm this close to sending you packing. You don't exude much gratitude. MCQUEEN: You're not hearing. You're just reacting. COLE: But I love you and you love me. So let's slow down and share a cup of - I just cannot get enough of - let's slow down and share a cup of tea. VEDANTAM: Adam, that was fantastic. COLE: Aw, thank you so much. VEDANTAM: You don't exude much gratitude - I love that. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Adam Cole, thank you so much for playing our game. COLE: Well, thanks so much for having me on. VEDANTAM: Will you be back again? COLE: I definitely will. VEDANTAM: Great. Let's give this game a name. Here's what I'm thinking. How about \"Coleplay\"? COLE: Well, let's keep thinking on it. MCQUEEN: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: Since this is our very first episode, there are a lot of people we have to thank. The Embrey Family Foundation, specifically Lauren Embrey and Diane Hosey helped us get off the ground. And so did Heather and Paul Haaga, Paul and Marcia Ginsberg, Anne and John Herrmann, Antoine and Emily van Agtmael, John R. and Tawna B. Farmer, the Mosaic Foundation of R & P Heydon, Howard and Barbara Wollner and Patricia Papper. We couldn't have gotten off the ground without you. Special thanks today to Adam Cole and Amanda McQueen. You can see more about Adam's work on Tumblr and YouTube at Skunk Bear. This episode of the Hidden Brain podcast is produced by Kara McGuirk-Alison and Maggie Penman. Join us next week when we talk about the consequences of near misses and the surprising way losses can motivate us.

Science reporter Flora Lichtman envisions what that would be like as host of a podcast on climate change called The Adaptors. FLORA LICHTMAN, BYLINE: Paleobiologist Jan Zalasiewicz has this thought experiment. It's dark. Humans go extinct and the question is, what comes next? Jan's point is less about our impending doom and more about providing prospective on how we're transforming the earth in this unprecedented way, and how that could be threatening, even to us. JAN ZALASIEWICZ: We're changing climate. We're changing the chemistry of the earth. We're changing biology of the earth. We're also quite aggressive amongst ourselves. So, you know, as people have speculated, there are all kinds of dangers ahead, you know, what have been called existential threats for humanity. So I think for many reasons it's good to stand back and say, OK, let us see what the world would do like without us. LICHTMAN: Jan writes about this in a book called \"The Earth After Us. \" And in it, he tosses out this idea that the animals best suited to take over after we're gone are rats. ZALASIEWICZ: Some will become big, some will become small, some will become fat, some will become thin, then taking over to fill those niches that we have vacated and the elephants have vacated and the rhinoceri have vacated. LICHTMAN: So we can visualize, actually, like, an elephant-sized rat grazing somewhere on the savannah? ZALASIEWICZ: Yes, of course. The whale rat, the seal rat, the walrus rat would be a very nice one. They're already pretty smart, so some might become really quite smart. And, you know, we may have the rat civilization. KATHERINE WELLS, BYLINE: So I love this as a thought experiment. . . LICHTMAN: This is producer Katherine Wells. WELLS: . . . Obviously. LICHTMAN: (Laughter). WELLS: But I do have a question. How real is this? ZALASIEWICZ: Well, one real thing is whether we will survive or not, you know, for any significant geological length of time. And that is really completely up for grabs. WELLS: OK, so when I first heard about this research, I was kind of blown away. First of all, the idea that we might actually go extinct - I had never heard this before. But second of all, the creature best positioned to take our place is a rat. If this is even remotely a real possibility, why are we not all talking about it all day long? LICHTMAN: Right, and then it's like what makes rats better positioned than us? KEN APLIN: I like rats. I really like them. LICHTMAN: This is biologist Ken Aplin. He's researched rats at the Smithsonian and museums in Australia. And he says that rats are super-adapters. APLIN: Rats and mice have hit on a really great - they have this combination of relatively fast lives, short reproductive periods, and high potential to increase their populations in response to resources becoming available in the environment. They're ideally positioned to take over the world. LICHTMAN: This is an advantage that rats have over, say, non-human primates, which have longer generation times and so can't increase their populations as quickly. Others have suggested that cockroaches, crows, snakes might also be good candidates for world domination. But rats have other useful traits. ZALASIEWICZ: They're quite adventurous in what they eat. So I guess there's a lesson for us there. You know, we tend to be fussy. LICHTMAN: We might take a cue from rats, here. The U. N. , in fact, has suggested that we might eat more insects as a climate change mitigation strategy. ZALASIEWICZ: They can live in hot climates and pretty cold climates without, you know, anything but their own fur coats. LICHTMAN: After rats, or whatever creature takes over the earth, they would likely evolve and change. Biologist Ken Aplin imagines how a social animal like this might build a civilization. APLIN: If rats, for example, were to start to try and farm resources the way people have farmed resources, it would need to be something on a different timescale. LICHTMAN: Because their livestock would outlive them. APLIN: Maybe resources like algae and seaweeds, maybe some kinds of insects. LICHTMAN: They could farm cockroaches or something. APLIN: Termites, why not? They've got great dexterity. Do they have the intellectual capacity to do it? It's hard to say because they're a bit impenetrable to us. It's very hard to know what's really going on in a rat's mind. LICHTMAN: From what we do know about the rat psyche, though, a future Ratocene may face similar problems to the problems that we face. APLIN: In situations where food starts to get a bit tight or where there are just too many individuals, then the system can start to break down a little bit. And instead of aggression, just being a deterrent, it can progress to murder most foul. We see many parallels in those brown rat colonies when they're placed under environmental stress, so a lot of the same kind of dysfunction that we might see in human society. LICHTMAN: That's depressing. You know, if this is what happens to a species under stress, does this seem like a creepy foreshadowing of what's to come for us? APLIN: (Laughter) Gloomy thoughts, yeah. LICHTMAN: The fact that this future rat society is oddly reminiscent of our own, that's part of Jan's point. ZALASIEWICZ: Zooming forward to the far future, and maybe it'll even be one species of hyper-intelligent rat asking this question, they'll look back at humans. One take-home message that they will immediately say is that humans did all this and wiped themselves out extremely quickly. I mean, geologically, you know, we've been around for much less than a million years. Humans that have made complicated industrial things, you know, using coal and oil and gas - they've only been around for about 200, 300 years. And let us say, we blow ourselves up very quickly. We will look like some very rapid, highly interesting but highly unstable creature. So they may think that it's better to have a society dominated by many kinds of slightly less damaging rats. You know, maybe they will learn to live - what's the word - more sustainably than humans have managed to do yet. LICHTMAN: They can learn from our mistakes. ZALASIEWICZ: Yes, that's right. They can learn from our mistakes, yes. LICHTMAN: For NPR News, I'm Flora Lichtman.

We walked around Tomorrowland or rode on the WEDWay PeopleMover. Little electric cars pulled us around the park on overhead tracks. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: A real-life transit concept proposes to take that idea and make it so that individual riders can go wherever they want. It's our subject as we make transportation the focus of a new round of the NPR Cities Project. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Becoming a world-class city. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: We have to find a way to move people a lot more efficiently. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Come. Take a ride of the future. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Want to go for another ride? MONTAGNE: We have a vision for a revolutionary form of public transportation. It's under discussion in Greenville, S. C. , Austin, Texas and Santa Cruz, Calif. The only place in the U. S. that you can ride it now is on the campus of West Virginia University. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Come. Take a ride of the future. But this is not the future. This is the '70s. And you are riding PRT - PRT, personal rapid transit. INSKEEP: This is the '70s. That is a 38-year-old promotional video for the personal rapid transit system in Morgantown, W. V. Cars on a track make nonstop trips to their destinations. Just tell it where you're going, and you're off. PRT is a big idea. And since NPR's Joe Palca is all about big ideas, we asked him to investigate. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: I decided a good way to learn more about PRT was to go to Minneapolis. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: (Over loudspeaker) Green line train to downtown Minneapolis is due in two minutes. PALCA: Where I could meet up with Mike Lester, CEO of Taxi 2000, a company that designs PRT systems. To get to my downtown meeting I took light rail, and my trip turned into an unexpected lesson in why PRT might be a good idea. Things went smoothly at first. But when we got to the West Bank Station, the train stopped and sat. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: (Over loudspeaker) Once again, I apologize for the delay. We are continuing to hold here at this station until further notice. PALCA: Apparently, a train up ahead had struck a car at an intersection. I'm running late for my appointment with Mike Lester. So I abandon the train and get in a cab. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)PALCA: Hello? It's Lester, asking if I'm OK. Hi, I'm fine. But (laughter) there was an accident on the green line. And I had to jump in a taxi to get over to you. The irony here is that one of the advantages of the PRT system Lester wants to build is that it runs on an elevated guideway. So it wouldn't run the risk of hitting cars or pedestrians. And there's the station. I asked Lester to meet me downtown so he could show me some of the advantages of PRT in a crowded urban setting. MIKE LESTER: One of the things I wanted to point out to you is - see the buses? PALCA: Yeah, a lot of buses. LESTER: Empty - but they still need to circulate. PALCA: Lester says in a PRT system, the pods only run when they have passengers. LESTER: One of the benefits of having an elevated system that only moves when somebody's paying is you're not in traffic. And you're not running empty buses. PALCA: Another advantage is the elevated guideway doesn't take up much space. He points to a lamp post. LESTER: That's the post we need, right? And then you come up with a 90 feet piece of guideway. And you set it on the post. PALCA: So you only need a post every 90 feet. And Lester says you can install a PRT system for about a quarter of the cost per mile of a light-rail system. Now, there are a multitude of studies, reports, assessments and reviews of the PRT concept. And many say PRT will relieve traffic congestion and move people efficiently. There have even been a few small systems built. There's one at Heathrow Airport Terminal 5, and there's one at Masdar City in Abu Dhabi. But these are the exceptions. For the most part, PRT has gone nowhere. This hasn't fazed Mike Lester. And he's eager to have me visit Taxi 2000's headquarters so I can see a concrete example of his vision for the future. Headquarters is off a busy road in a small industrial park in the Minneapolis suburb of Fridley. LESTER: This is where we have our full-size operating prototype. PALCA: And Lester wants me to go for a ride on it. To start, Lester hands me a laminated fare card. LESTER: You go up the stairs. There's a station platform when you get into the second level. PALCA: Waiting at the platform is a bright red, tiny pod-like car. LESTER: Walk up. Swipe your card. PALCA: OK. LESTER: And the door will open. PALCA: To the roof and the side just sort of slid back. And what I see is a three-passenger bench. I step in and sit down on the bench. A button over the front window says, go. So I'm going to press go. LESTER: Yes. PALCA: The door slides shut and latches. I'm moving. It's pretty smooth. It's not going very fast, but we're only going about 60 feet I think. And we've arrived. The door glides back, and I step out onto another platform. That's pretty cool. LESTER: There you are, 10 seconds into the future. PALCA: To be honest, I think riding in one of these automated pod cars to work would be kind of fun. So why has PRT failed to catch on? Ken Halverson is chief financial officer for Taxi 2000. He says the company has been getting a lot of inquiries lately. KEN HALVERSON: We've had 40 or 50 cities tell us they would love to be second. But you can't be second until someone steps up to be first. PALCA: Halverson says Greenville, S. C. is seriously considering going first. But they haven't yet figured out who's going to pay for it. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: (Over loudspeaker) Green line train to downtown Saint Paul is due in two minutes. PALCA: To find out why Minnesota never built a PRT system, I jumped back on the green line and headed over to Saint Paul to speak with Tom Sorel. He was formerly the state's commissioner of transportation. He says the state did consider PRT, but there was stiff opposition from backers of buses and light rail. And nothing was ever built. TOM SOREL: I think one of the challenges we've always had with PRT is there's no pot of money where this fits well. And that's just not in Minnesota. It's nationally as well. PALCA: There already are pots of tax money for things like buses and light rail. Sorel says the other problem facing PRT is that the picture of urban transit is changing. Uber and similar services are already here. Driverless cars aren't far off. Sorel wonders if PRT's time has come and gone. SOREL: Because the last thing you want to do is put up some track all over the place and then have it sit there. PALCA: The PRT system in West Virginia is still running. But it didn't kick start the revolution in rapid transit people had hoped for back in 1975. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Personal rapid transit, a ride of the future.

It's about an astronaut who gets marooned on Mars. Space experts say it is Hollywood's most realistic depiction ever of the challenges of surviving on Mars. NPR science correspondent Geoff Brumfiel found out why. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: If you watch \"The Martian,\" you'll see plenty of Hollywood explosions and special effects, but you're also going to hear actor Matt Damon, who plays the astronaut, sit down and calculate how much food he has left. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE MARTIAN\")MATT DAMON: (As Mark Watney) For redundancy, they sent 68 soles worth of food. That's for six people. So for just me, that's going to last 300 soles, which I figure I can stretch to 400 if I ration. So I've got to figure out a way to grow three years' worth of food here on a planet where nothing grows. BRUMFIEL: The numbers are a matter of life and death for Damon's astronaut, and the estimates for food and water rations are all for real. ANDY WEIR: If you care to double-check the results from what you see in the film, then you'll find out it's accurate. BRUMFIEL: That's Andy Weir, the author of the book \"The Martian\" which the film is based on. After figuring out how long everything would last, the stranded astronaut realizes he will have to grow potatoes by planting some the crew brought along. But how many potatoes can grow in his enclosed habitat? Here's Weir reading from the book. WEIR: (Reading) In 62 square meters, I could grow maybe 150 kilograms of potatoes in 400 days. That's a grand total of 115,500 calories, a sustainable average of 288 calories per day. BRUMFIEL: There are no quick Hollywood fixes to the challenges faced by Weir's astronaut. Weir himself is a longtime computer programmer who got the idea for the book while thinking about what a mission to Mars might actually be like and what could go wrong. WEIR: What happens if this thing breaks? What happens if that breaks? What's the backup plan for this? How do you make sure the crew doesn't die at the first sign of trouble? And I finally thought, huh, this is actually - might make for a pretty interesting story. BRUMFIEL: Weir put the first draft of his novel up on his personal website.

BRUMFIEL: These were the kinds of readers who love to detail. WEIR: These are nerds like me. These are my people. And so I was writing something for them. I was writing a story where I show my work. BRUMFIEL: Watching Weir's astronauts solve life or death problems without sci-fi teleporters or magical aliens is what drives \"The Martian\" forward. And it takes the plot in some unexpected directions. For example, those potatoes - when Weir worked out the details, he realized they would cause a water shortage. That's because the mission brought along enough to drink but not enough to grow crops. The astronaut has to start making water by burning rocket fuel, a chemistry trick that is scientifically accurate and, as the astronaut finds out, really dangerous. WEIR: It's, like, one of the best parts of the book, in my opinion. And so all of that plot - that cool plot thing that just came about because I did the math on potato growth. I wouldn't have thought of it on my own. BRUMFIEL: Weir's super-nerd readers pushed his realism even further. Whenever he made a mistake, they let him know. WEIR: There is nothing a nerd likes more than finding a math error. I speak from experience. When I see it, I'm like, oh. BRUMFIEL: And because the book was initially posted online, he just rewrote it to make it right. WEIR: I fixed it. I corrected it (laughter). BRUMFIEL: The result was a novel - and now a film - that even real Mars experts can enjoy. SUZANNE SMREKAR: To be honest, at times, it felt a little bit like I was at work. BRUMFIEL: Suzanne Smrekar is a planetary scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory who's helping put together a real mission to the red planet, though it's robotic. She read the book and says it gets tons of things right - one of the big ones - all that problem-solving. That's the way real scientists see the world. SMREKAR: Every scientist and engineer has sort of had that buzz of figuring something out. And the way I read it, it's really about the thrill of trying to figure things out on your own. BRUMFIEL: Of course, being a scientist, it didn't take long for her to find a hole in the plot. Right at the start, the astronaut is stranded on Mars by a powerful dust storm that separates him from his crew. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE MARTIAN\")DAMON: (As Mark Watney) Commander, are you OK? JESSICA CHASTAIN: (As Melissa Lewis) I'm OK. BRUMFIEL: (Imitating buzzer). Wrong. SMREKAR: The atmosphere of Mars is one-one-hundredth the density of our own atmosphere, so it really cannot provide much of a force. That's the one big artistic license in the whole book. BRUMFIEL: Actually, Andy Weir knew dust storms on Mars wouldn't be that fierce. But he wanted a thrilling way to start his novel, so he allowed himself some literary leeway. Another problem is that the science keeps changing. Earlier this week, researchers announced the discovery of small quantities of saltwater in some regions of Mars. Maybe the astronaut could've used that water to grow potatoes. Obviously it's too late to update the plot now that the story is a blockbuster film. But you know what? Experts like Smrekar are willing to go easy on \"The Martian\" when it's time to give the final grade for accuracy. SMREKAR: I would give it an A-minus, B-plus. BRUMFIEL: After all, it is science fiction. Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  On Friday, the movie \"The Martian\" opens in theaters across the country. It's about an astronaut who gets marooned on Mars. Space experts say it is Hollywood's most realistic depiction ever of the challenges of surviving on Mars. NPR science correspondent Geoff Brumfiel found out why. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: If you watch \"The Martian,\" you'll see plenty of Hollywood explosions and special effects, but you're also going to hear actor Matt Damon, who plays the astronaut, sit down and calculate how much food he has left. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE MARTIAN\") MATT DAMON: (As Mark Watney) For redundancy, they sent 68 soles worth of food. That's for six people. So for just me, that's going to last 300 soles, which I figure I can stretch to 400 if I ration. So I've got to figure out a way to grow three years' worth of food here on a planet where nothing grows. BRUMFIEL: The numbers are a matter of life and death for Damon's astronaut, and the estimates for food and water rations are all for real. ANDY WEIR: If you care to double-check the results from what you see in the film, then you'll find out it's accurate. BRUMFIEL: That's Andy Weir, the author of the book \"The Martian\" which the film is based on. After figuring out how long everything would last, the stranded astronaut realizes he will have to grow potatoes by planting some the crew brought along. But how many potatoes can grow in his enclosed habitat? Here's Weir reading from the book. WEIR: (Reading) In 62 square meters, I could grow maybe 150 kilograms of potatoes in 400 days. That's a grand total of 115,500 calories, a sustainable average of 288 calories per day. BRUMFIEL: There are no quick Hollywood fixes to the challenges faced by Weir's astronaut. Weir himself is a longtime computer programmer who got the idea for the book while thinking about what a mission to Mars might actually be like and what could go wrong. WEIR: What happens if this thing breaks? What happens if that breaks? What's the backup plan for this? How do you make sure the crew doesn't die at the first sign of trouble? And I finally thought, huh, this is actually - might make for a pretty interesting story. BRUMFIEL: Weir put the first draft of his novel up on his personal website. He guesses it was read by about 3,000 or so hardcore fans, readers who really knew the science. WEIR: Chemistry professor, physicists and science and space enthusiasts. BRUMFIEL: These were the kinds of readers who love to detail. WEIR: These are nerds like me. These are my people. And so I was writing something for them. I was writing a story where I show my work.

S. coastline over the next four days or maybe not. The models forecasting this hurricane's path diverge widely. They point to landfall in Georgia, in the mid-Atlantic, around the District of Columbia or not at all. Jeff Halverson is a meteorologist who teaches at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and he joins me now to explain why Hurricane Joaquin is proving so difficult to analyze. Welcome to the program. JEFF HALVERSON: It's great to be here. SIEGEL: First, I mean, roughly how many big models are there, and how divergent are they? HALVERSON: There's quite a few models that the Hurricane Center uses. There are two heavy players - what we call the Global Forecast System, which is the American model, and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast, or the ECMWF. Those are the two big players. SIEGEL: And they have quite different forecasts of where the storm is heading, those two big ones. HALVERSON: They've had different forecasts for several days. However, today, they're actually starting to come in to some agreement. SIEGEL: Really? What's the consensus? HALVERSON: Well, the consensus seems to be shifting the track of the storm - the most likely track - further and further east away from the DC-Baltimore region and perhaps more to a concern, let's say, from New Jersey, from New York City up through Boston. SIEGEL: Now, would that mean that the Europeans have had this one a bit more right than the American model to date? HALVERSON: Well, the European model has had some remarkable consistency on this. It has basically maintained all along that the storm is going to stay further to the east than many of the other models. SIEGEL: But isn't everyone who's forecasting this and has a model for it - aren't they all using the same data provided by the U. S. government? HALVERSON: The data is very similar, but the way that these models are formulating it is - or constructed - very, very different. There are different scientific teams that put these models together. There are different assumptions that are made about what physics to keep in, what physics to keep out. And you know, it's a trade-off. The more physics you put in, the more accurate the model, but it would take much, much longer to run. So you trade accuracy of the physics versus the efficiency of computation. SIEGEL: Hurricane Sandy, I guess, where it hit the East Coast of the U. S. - that was much more in keeping with the European model - wasn't it? - than with the American model? HALVERSON: Well, the European - that was a dead ringer for five, six, even seven days before that storm made that infamous left hook. The European never wavered from that solution, and that's why it gained such a reputation. SIEGEL: After the American model did not gain that - quite that reputation, there was talk of really beefing up weather tracking and forecasting. Did that happen? HALVERSON: That's in the progress. There's a - Congress has released what's called Sandy Stimulus Funding, a lot of the money went to NOAA, the weather service, to beef up the computational speed and efficiency of the American models. But you know, in all fairness, the ECMWF has had its share of flaws. It has missed some significant storm events. It's not the silver bullet. It's not the perfect model. And that's the challenge to meteorologists. That's the art of interpreting all this guidance in front of you. You have to really know what are the strengths and weaknesses of each individual model. Some models do better in winter. Some do better in summer. And that is where the human interpretation is so vital. SIEGEL: OK, thanks.

Exhibitors like to make sure they are anatomically correct, but what usually is not real are the bones. They're synthetic casts. This week, the Smithsonian Institution is finishing a rare mounting of a Tyrannosaurus rex with real bones. NPR's Christopher Joyce has been following the dinosaur on its journey to the museum and reports on its first days on its feet. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: The National Museum of Natural History in Washington has coveted a real T-rex for decades. It's never had one. Last year, it got one from Montana's Museum of the Rockies. Technicians repaired and digitally scanned the bones and then sent them to Canada to be mounted. And now the T-rex is at last standing up in the Canadian workshop. That's where Smithsonian dino curator Matthew Carrano got his first look at the assembled 38-foot beast. MATTHEW CARRANO: It's pretty spectacular. First of all, it's an actual real Tyrannosaurus rex fully mounted and standing in front of me. JOYCE: Second because of what the carnivore is doing. At its feet is a fossilized Triceratops. That's the plant-eating horned dinosaur known for a bony fringe around the back of its neck that looks like some kind of frilly Elizabethan collar. CARRANO: And the T-rex is biting that, and it's in the process of levering off the skull from the rest of the body of the Triceratops. So it has one foot on the ribcage and one foot on the ground offering a little bit of leverage for that. JOYCE: The Smithsonian knows its audience. CARRANO: It's got high drama. I think it's got the kinds of things that, you know, every kid dreams about when they think about T-rex. JOYCE: That said, Carrano points out that the pose is also a nod to the scientific debate over whether T-rex was primarily a scavenger of dead animals or a full-time predator. It's not clear from this bloody tableaux whether the Triceratops is already dead or is being killed. Carrano's own opinion on the T-rex's preference. . . CARRANO: Carnivores don't turn down meals. JOYCE: Whether they're alive and kicking or already dead. Getting these fossilized bones into an anatomically correct position while creating an exciting pose was tricky. Peter May, the head of Research Casting International, says his team spent months working with Smithsonian scientists to do that. One obstacle was, most of these are real bones, not synthetic casts, so technicians could not drill into them and screw them together. Instead, they built a tall metal frame festooned with form-fitting metal cradles to hold the bones. PETER MAY: It looks sort of like antlers. We had blacksmiths on staff, and they're hand-forged to fit the bone perfectly. JOYCE: The cradles hold more than 150 major bones of the skeleton in their proper place suspended on the frame. May says his company has mounted several T-rexs before. Each has its own story and character, and this one is no exception. A Montana ranching family found it in 1988. Scientists recovered 85 percent of its original bones. It was one of the most complete T-rexs ever found at the time, and May says one part of the skeleton was a real revelation. MAY: It was the first T-rex discovered with a forelimb. And before that, it was all speculation on how big the forelimb was. JOYCE: Turned out those forelimbs - the animal's arms - were only about three feet long. Scientists are still puzzled by what the dinosaur did with them.

People love good cloud formations, especially scientists. They're fascinated by the inner workings of even the most mundane clouds. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce tells us about one team that has just made a cloud breakthrough. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: A life studying clouds is not what you would have predicted for Raymond Shaw. He remembers being a Cub Scout and trying to get the weather badge. RAYMOND SHAW: And we had to memorize the types of clouds, and I really hated it. I actually didn't like all these Latin - you know cumulus, stratocumulus - all of these special names for clouds. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But later he got interested in snowflakes, which, of course, come from clouds. And he ended up working at Michigan Technological University where he studies clouds secrets. Lately, he's been looking at the most boring clouds you can imagine. SHAW: If you ask a child to draw a cloud, they would draw a little, white, puffy cloud floating in the air all by itself, and that's the kind of cloud we were looking at. GREENFIELDBOYCE: What he wants to understand, at a very fine level of detail, is how the cloud interacts with the surrounding air. So Shaw's team recently flew through clouds in an airplane equipped with a new instrument. SHAW: The instrument creates a small, three-dimensional picture of everything that's inside of a volume. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The volume isn't a big amount of space. It's like a cigar-sized section of the cloud, but it's big enough to be revealing. SHAW: So we can not only see how many droplets there are and how big they are. We can also see how they're distributed in space. GREENFIELDBOYCE: What they focused on were the cloud's edges where dry air is mixing in. You might think all the droplets at the edge of a cloud would evaporate a little bit - that they would all shrink. But that's not what happens. Shaw says dry air seems to creep in and evaporate some droplets completely. Others survive in wispy cloud filaments surrounded by clear air. SHAW: The droplets that are remaining are just as big as the droplets that are in the center, kind of the protected core of the cloud were no evaporation has taken place. That was a surprise to us. GREENFIELDBOYCE: They report on their work in the journal Science. Shaw says getting this kind of intimate look at clouds is just neat. SHAW: But the amazing thing is that it really does have consequences. Those little details in the cloud eventually form a link in a chain that leads to a weather forecast or an understanding of how climate will change. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The findings amazed Marcia Baker. She's a retired cloud physicist from the University of Washington in Seattle. Back in the 1980s, she and a colleague first proposed that this is how dry air would mix with a cloud. MARCIA BAKER: This new instrument seems like a real tour de force. It's quite astonishing we were able to make measurements down to this level, and it's, of course, very gratifying. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says other kinds of clouds might behave differently, like colder clouds with ice crystals. And Shaw says he's really interested in understanding those clouds, too.

MARCIA BAKER: This new instrument seems like a real tour de force. It's quite astonishing we were able to make measurements down to this level, and it's, of course, very gratifying. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says other kinds of clouds might behave differently, like colder clouds with ice crystals. And Shaw says he's really interested in understanding those clouds, too.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, we're exploring ideas about the meaning of work and whether work is something we do because we love it or because we have no choice. BARRY SCHWARTZ: There's a kind of attitude you sometimes see - a kind of us and them attitude. RAZ: This is psychologist Barry Schwartz. SCHWARTZ: There is the elite, who want all this fulfillment from work, and then there's everybody else that just wants a paycheck. And we should organize work on the assumption that most people don't care what they do as long as they're paid for it. And I think this is a completely false picture. It matters to people doing these jobs, too. RAZ: And it matters, Barry Schwartz says, because humans have this innate need to feel valued, to feel like what they do means something, even when those jobs might not be the ones people necessarily want. Here's Barry Schwartz on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SCHWARTZ: Why do we work? Now, I know, of course, we have to make a living, but nobody in this room thinks that that's the answer to the question why do we work? So we wouldn't work if we didn't get paid, but that's not why we do what we do. And in general, I think we think that material rewards are a pretty bad reason for doing the work that we do. When we say of somebody that he's in it for the money, we are not just being descriptive. (LAUGHTER)SCHWARTZ: Now, I think this is totally obvious. But the very obviousness of it raises what is, for me, an incredibly profound question. If this is so obvious, why is it that for the overwhelming majority of people on the planet, the work they do has none of the characteristics that get us up and out of bed and off toward the office every morning? How is it that we allow the majority of people on the planet to do work that is monotonous, meaningless and soul-deadening? RAZ: Now, the thing about work, says Barry, is that it wasn't always like this. SCHWARTZ: People didn't think, in antiquity, about whether work was fulfilling. People were craftsmen or farmers. The work they did was simply a part of their life and not divorced from it psychologically, not divorced from it physically. RAZ: No one was wondering if their work was meaningful. They were just busy living their lives, functioning in the role that they played in the community. SCHWARTZ: It was varied from one day to the next. It presented challenges that you couldn't anticipate. You needed to use your ingenuity. You needed to be flexible. You needed to learn from your experience. That was sort of intrinsic to the character of the work that people did. RAZ: But for most people, work became something different when factories started to become the places where most of them earned a living, places where they were given a very specific task. SCHWARTZ: And did the same mindless thing over and over again, hour after hour, day after day. The kind of engagement and challenge and opportunity to learn was eliminated. And then, when the only reason you have to work is for a livelihood, now people start yearning for something more. So I think the reason people want fulfillment in work now is that the factory system did such a good job of taking fulfillment out of work for 200 years. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SCHWARTZ: One of the fathers of the Industrial Revolution, Adam Smith, was convinced that human beings were, by their very natures, lazy and wouldn't do anything unless you made it worth it their while. And the way you made it worth their while was by incentivizing, by giving them rewards. That was the only reason anyone ever did anything. So we created a factory system consistent with that false view of human nature. But once that system of production was in place, there was really no other way for people to operate except in a way that was consistent with Adam Smith's vision. False ideas can create a circumstance that ends up making them true. RAZ: I mean, so Adam Smith was wrong. I mean, people don't just work for money. SCHWARTZ: That's correct, and he knew it. He says, in the classic \"The Wealth Of Nations,\" he says the man whose life is spent in a few simple operations naturally loses the habit of mental exertion and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to be. Now, the words I want you to pay attention to here is generally becomes. That is - this is not the way people are before they enter the assembly line. It's what the assembly line turns them into. So in this passage, he's essentially contradicting what he said in other places in the book. which is that people are basically lazy and they don't want to think and they don't want to expend effort. No, no, no, you put them in a factory and that's what they become. RAZ: Enjoying your work, in other words, is about context, even if you have a job that could seem boring or meaningless because how you think about that job and how that work is valued, that could be the thing that really matters. So take, for example, janitors. There was a group of researchers at Yale who interviewed janitors at a hospital about their work - you know, vacuuming carpets and cleaning toilets and waxing floors and emptying trash cans. And what the researchers found was that these hospital janitors were doing much, much more than what was expected of them. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SCHWARTZ: They encountered Mike (ph), who told them about how we stopped mopping the floor because Mr. Jones (ph) was out of his bed, getting a little exercise, trying to build up his strength, walking slowly up and down the hall. And Charlene (ph) told them about how she ignored her supervisor's admonition and didn't vacuum the visitors' lounge because there were some family members who were there all day, every day, who, at this moment, happened to be taking a nap. And then there was Luke (ph), who washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twice because the man's father, who had been keeping a vigil for six months, didn't see Luke do it the first time and his father was angry. And behavior like this from janitors, from technicians, from nurses, and if we're lucky every now and then, from doctors, doesn't just make people feel a little better. It actually improves the quality of patient care and enables hospitals to run well. RAZ: So they were doing things that made them feel valued. SCHWARTZ: Well, it's a feeling that you're valued and it's - more than that, it's a kind of objective awareness that you actually are doing something that is valuable. The hospital janitors who got real fulfillment out of their work, what they thought they were doing was not just mopping floors and emptying trash baskets. They thought they were making an essential contribution to the functioning of a deeply meaningful and significant social institution. The people in the hospital are there to cure disease and ease suffering. And their job was to play an absolutely essential role in that project. And so they were as much committed to the, what Aristotle would've called the telos of the organization, the proper purpose of the organization, as the heart surgeons were. RAZ: But not every janitor can choose to work in a hospital. SCHWARTZ: Yes, yes, yes, absolutely. But I think you can create work environments where it takes a sort of a Herculean effort for people to construe their work as meaningful and important. And you can create workplaces where it's easy. People need discretion in what they do. They need autonomy in what they do. They need to feel respected by their coworkers and respected by their supervisors. People need to feel like they can learn. All those things gets them engaged in the task. And most important, people want meaning in what they do. And the meaning comes, often, from the role that their work or their organization's work plays in improving the lives of members of their society, of their community. Now, surely there are some enterprises that are not noble, but I think if you really see yourself as serving the community in any retail store you're operating in, in any call center you're operating in, I think you can find nobility in what you do.

How do you find the motivation to try anyway? So maybe you've heard about the very low numbers of women employed by big tech companies - 16 percent of tech jobs at Microsoft held by women, at Twitter, it's 10 percent, at Google, 17. But when Steve Shirley started a tech company, 100 percent of her employees. . . STEVE SHIRLEY: Oh, yes, indeed. RAZ: . . . Were women. SHIRLEY: It was a very exciting period. RAZ: In fact, Steve Shirley will explain her name in a moment. Steve had vowed from the beginning. . . SHIRLEY: It was a crusade for women. RAZ: . . . That her company would only hire women. SHIRLEY: It was a burning mission to keep it on the road. RAZ: OK, so her name? SHIRLEY: Well, my name is Dame Stephanie Shirley, which sounds very grand. But way back in my past, I shortened my name from that. So really, I'm Steve Shirley. That's how I'm known. RAZ: Everybody calls you Steve? SHIRLEY: Everybody calls me Steve. RAZ: Signing your name Steve instead of Stephanie turned out to be an easier way to get your letters answered in the 1960s because that's when Steve Shirley, as she is still known today, brought work to thousands of women in the U. K. SHIRLEY: We were a very different sort of workplace. RAZ: OK, first, what Steve's company did. SHIRLEY: We would work with pencil and paper. RAZ: It was basically a software company. . . SHIRLEY: And then we would convert it into code. RAZ: . . . Before there were personal computers. SHIRLEY: Which would then be punched onto cards or paper tape. And then it would be re-punched in order to verify it. RAZ: The company would use math and statistics to model things like freight train schedules and bus routes and stock markets. SHIRLEY: So intellectually demanding that you got this wonderful sense of achievement. RAZ: And what Steve introduced back in the 1960s, aside from the idea that women could actually write code, was that it didn't necessarily matter where you did that work because Steve let the women who worked for her do it from home. SHIRLEY: We used to ask job applicants, do you have access to a telephone? RAZ: In those days, not everyone did. SHIRLEY: I had a party line, which is - sounds rather fun, but it meant that I shared my home telephone with some other poor soul. It was a different world. RAZ: And you were doing this before email, before fax machines, before Skype. SHIRLEY: Well, we did have the simple telephone, and we had the enthusiasm of women being offered something really exciting - not particularly well paid, to be honest, because we were living on a shoestring. But I think it made a lot of other organizations consider whether there were different models of getting work done. RAZ: Steve Shirley managed to build this company at a time when women in the U. K. couldn't even open a bank account without their husband's permission. Here's more of Steve Shirley's story from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SHIRLEY: Let me take you back to the early 1960s. Although women were then coming out of the universities with decent degrees, there was a glass ceiling to our progress. And I'd hit that glass ceiling too often and so started to challenge the conventions of the time, even to the extent of changing my name from Stephanie to Steve in my business development letters so as to get through the door before anyone realized that he was a she. (LAUGHTER)SHIRLEY: I recruited professionally qualified women who'd left the industry on marriage or when their first child was expected and structured them into a home-working organization. And we pioneered the concept of women going back into the workforce after a career break. We disguised the domestic and part-time nature of this stuff by offering fixed prices - one of the very first to do so. We pioneered all sorts of new flexible work methods - job shares, profit sharing - and eventually, the work came in. RAZ: So think of the drive - the chutzpah - this took, right, to have started a business on her dining room table. SHIRLEY: Well, I was described as aggressive and, you know, sort of, a man might be assertive or they'll have gravitas, but I was - I suppose I've always been a bit aggressive. RAZ: And yet, year after year, her company grew. SHIRLEY: So once it was known that I was hiring women to decent, part-time, flexible work opportunities, I had a flood of people coming in. RAZ: And Steve's team of women programmers were able to keep up with the growing demand through the '60s and '70s as more and more companies in the U. K. started to automate their work through computers. SHIRLEY: And it gradually got much more into systems work, business design, choosing equipments, contracts. I did work seven days a week. I did sleep occasionally. I did very little else. So the business began to take off. I love business, really. I mean, because most of my contemporaries are playing bridge or golf, and that's not me. RAZ: It just seems boring to you? SHIRLEY: Irrelevant. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SHIRLEY: When I started my company of women, the men sort of said, how interesting - because it only works because it's small. And later, as it became sizable, they sort of accepted, yes, it is sizable now, but of no strategic interest. And later, when it was a company valued at over $3 billion and I'd made 70 of the staff into millionaires, they sort of said, well-done, Steve. (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)SHIRLEY: You can always tell ambitious women by the shape of our heads. They're flat on top for being patted patronizingly. (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)RAZ: When you were at the company and sort of really building that business, what motivated you, what propelled you? SHIRLEY: Again, I think it was a lot of the sort of feminine thing that in having started a company, in no way was I going to fail. So even in the 1970s recession, where we nearly went out of business, I was so proud that women could do this, that in - somehow or other, we stuck in there. I mean, I feel I'm so lucky because I have done what is in me to do. RAZ: But sometimes the will to work hard grows from our hardest experiences, and, in Steve Shirley's case, from her childhood. She wasn't actually born in the U. K. And when she was just 5 years old, as a little girl in Austria, in 1934, the Nazis marched in to occupy her country. And suddenly, Jews like her were in danger. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SHIRLEY: All that I am stems from when I got onto a train in Vienna, part of the kinder transport that saved nearly 10,000 Jewish children from Nazi Europe. I was 5 years old, clutching the hand of my 9-year-old sister, and had very little idea as to what was going on. What is England and why am I going there? I was lucky, and doubly lucky, to be later reunited with my birth parents. But, sadly, I never bonded with them again. But I've done more in the seven decades since that miserable day when my mother put me on the train than I would ever have dreamed possible. I loved England, my adopted country, with a passion that perhaps only someone who has lost their human rights can feel. I decided to make mine a life that was worth saving, and then I just got on with it. RAZ: I mean, this idea that you went through life thinking, I need to make my life a life that was worth saving - that's a huge burden to carry. SHIRLEY: But other people have equal drive as, you know, the musician who is determined to finish up in Wigmore Hall, or the artist who starves in the garage because he's determined to make some wonderful sculpture that nobody else wants. But there's a passion involved in doing a really good, quality piece of work that's better than you've done ever before. This really gives a drive to the individual. It's what makes us human. Animals don't work. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SHIRLEY: It's one thing to have an idea for an enterprise, but as many people in this room will know, making it happen is a very difficult thing. And it demands, really, extraordinary energy, self-belief and determination, the courage to risk family and home, in a 24-by-seven commitment that borders on the obsessive. So it's just as well that I'm a workaholic. I believe in the beauty of work when we do it properly and in humility. Work is not just something I do when I'd rather be doing something else. So what has all that taught me? I learned that tomorrow's never going to be like today and certainly nothing like yesterday. And that made me able to cope with change - indeed, eventually, to welcome change. Though I'm told I'm still very difficult. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Dame Stephanie Shirley, or, as everyone calls her today, Steve Shirley. She did all these things, by the way, and raised a child with autism. Steve now spends her time and her considerable wealth on autism-related philanthropy. You can find out more about her and see her full talk at ted. com. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WHISTLE WHILE YOU WORK\")LOUIS ARMSTRONG: (Singing) Whistle while you work. (WHISTLING)ARMSTRONG: (Singing) Put on that grin and start right in to whistle loud and long.

K. started to automate their work through computers. SHIRLEY: And it gradually got much more into systems work, business design, choosing equipments, contracts. I did work seven days a week. I did sleep occasionally. I did very little else. So the business began to take off. I love business, really. I mean, because most of my contemporaries are playing bridge or golf, and that's not me. RAZ: It just seems boring to you? SHIRLEY: Irrelevant. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SHIRLEY: When I started my company of women, the men sort of said, how interesting - because it only works because it's small. And later, as it became sizable, they sort of accepted, yes, it is sizable now, but of no strategic interest. And later, when it was a company valued at over $3 billion and I'd made 70 of the staff into millionaires, they sort of said, well-done, Steve. (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE) SHIRLEY: You can always tell ambitious women by the shape of our heads. They're flat on top for being patted patronizingly. (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE) RAZ: When you were at the company and sort of really building that business, what motivated you, what propelled you? SHIRLEY: Again, I think it was a lot of the sort of feminine thing that in having started a company, in no way was I going to fail. So even in the 1970s recession, where we nearly went out of business, I was so proud that women could do this, that in - somehow or other, we stuck in there. I mean, I feel I'm so lucky because I have done what is in me to do. RAZ: But sometimes the will to work hard grows from our hardest experiences, and, in Steve Shirley's case, from her childhood. She wasn't actually born in the U. K. And when she was just 5 years old, as a little girl in Austria, in 1934, the Nazis marched in to occupy her country. And suddenly, Jews like her were in danger. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SHIRLEY: All that I am stems from when I got onto a train in Vienna, part of the kinder transport that saved nearly 10,000 Jewish children from Nazi Europe. I was 5 years old, clutching the hand of my 9-year-old sister, and had very little idea as to what was going on. What is England and why am I going there? I was lucky, and doubly lucky, to be later reunited with my birth parents. But, sadly, I never bonded with them again. But I've done more in the seven decades since that miserable day when my mother put me on the train than I would ever have dreamed possible. I loved England, my adopted country, with a passion that perhaps only someone who has lost their human rights can feel. I decided to make mine a life that was worth saving, and then I just got on with it. RAZ: I mean, this idea that you went through life thinking, I need to make my life a life that was worth saving - that's a huge burden to carry. SHIRLEY: But other people have equal drive as, you know, the musician who is determined to finish up in Wigmore Hall, or the artist who starves in the garage because he's determined to make some wonderful sculpture that nobody else wants. But there's a passion involved in doing a really good, quality piece of work that's better than you've done ever before. This really gives a drive to the individual. It's what makes us human. Animals don't work. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SHIRLEY: It's one thing to have an idea for an enterprise, but as many people in this room will know, making it happen is a very difficult thing. And it demands, really, extraordinary energy, self-belief and determination, the courage to risk family and home, in a 24-by-seven commitment that borders on the obsessive. So it's just as well that I'm a workaholic. I believe in the beauty of work when we do it properly and in humility. Work is not just something I do when I'd rather be doing something else. So what has all that taught me? I learned that tomorrow's never going to be like today and certainly nothing like yesterday. And that made me able to cope with change - indeed, eventually, to welcome change. Though I'm told I'm still very difficult. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE) RAZ: Dame Stephanie Shirley, or, as everyone calls her today, Steve Shirley. She did all these things, by the way, and raised a child with autism.

I mean, why do people work? DAN ARIELY: People work for a ton of reasons. RAZ: This is Dan Ariely. He teaches psychology and economics at Duke. ARIELY: We work for identity and fulfillment and a sense of connection with other people. There's just many, many things, many factors that get us to work. Money is one of them and maybe not even the most important one. RAZ: Dan studies motivation, and like Barry Schwartz, he's interested in what it is besides money that gets people to care about the work they do and to work hard, even when the incentives aren't obvious. Here's how Dan explained it on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ARIELY: If you think about it, there's all kinds of strange behaviors in the world around us. Think about something like mountaineering and mountain climbing. If you read books of people who climb mountains - difficult mountains - do you think that those books are full of moments of joy and happiness? No, they are full of misery. In fact, it's all about frostbite and difficulty to walk and the difficulty of breathing, cold, challenging circumstances. And if people were just trying to be happy, the moment they would get to the top, they would say this was a terrible mistake. I'll never do it again. (LAUGHTER)ARIELY: Instead, let me sit on the beach somewhere drinking mojitos. But instead, people go down, and after they recover, they go up again. And if you think about mountain climbing as an example, it suggests all kinds of things. It suggests that we care about reaching the end, a peak. It suggests that we care about the fight, about the challenge. It suggests that there's all kinds of other things that motivate us to work or behave in all kinds of ways. And for me personally, I started thinking about this after a student came to visit me. This was a student that was one of my students a few years earlier. And he came one day back to campus, and he told me the following story. He said that for more than two weeks, he was working on a PowerPoint presentation. He was working in a big bank, and this was in preparation for merger and acquisition. And he was working very hard on this presentation - graphs, tables, information - he stayed late at night every day. And the day before it was due, he sent his PowerPoint presentation to his boss, and his boss wrote him back and said, nice presentation, but the merger is canceled. And the guy was deeply depressed. Now, at the moment when he was working, he was actually quite happy. Every night, he was enjoying his work. He was staying late. He was perfecting this PowerPoint presentation. But knowing that nobody would ever watch that made him quite depressed. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: I mean, was that the thing, like, this idea that it was all for not that made him feel so deflated, even though the process seemed to be incredibly exciting? ARIELY: Yeah, and there are really kind of a couple of things here. One is that sometimes something happens after the fact and it reframes our whole experience. But the other thing is that it basically got him to be very demotivated moving forward. And I was thinking, you know, from a functional perspective, everything was good, just that his work was never going to see the light of day. Nobody was going to ever see that. Imagine you were condemned to write Facebook and Twitter notes that nobody would ever see. It is just incredibly demotivating. And from that point, we started looking at small acts of meaning and how small acts of meaning can actually change how people evaluate things. RAZ: So Dan took this idea, and he created an experiment to tease out how these small acts of meaning could affect someone's motivation to work. ARIELY: So the first experiment we did was with Bionicles. RAZ: Bionicles are kids' toys. ARIELY: These are kind of little Lego robots. RAZ: Think, you know, Transformers. ARIELY: And they're made from about 40 pieces. So it takes a couple of minutes to build them. RAZ: And Dan and his team asked the participants in this experiment to build Bionicles in exchange for a diminishing pay wage. ARIELY: What does that mean? They came, and we said, for the first one, would you like to build this for $3? If they said yes, we gave it to them and they built it for $3. And then we said, do you want to build the next one for $2. 70? And when they finished that, the next one for $2. 40 and so on. RAZ: And they did this to see whether there was, like, a magic number, you know, a number at which point each person would decide to stop building Bionicles. ARIELY: At what point is the pleasure of building a Bionicle and the money that they're getting from it not enough to compensate for their time? RAZ: OK, so that was one group, just building Bionicles for less and less money. But then, Dan took a second group, a different group, and he gave them the same challenge - to build Bionicles for a diminishing pay wage. ARIELY: For $3 and then we said, do you want to build the next one for $2. 70? And when they finished that, the next one for $2. 40 and so on. RAZ: But this time, there was a catch because as they were building the second Bionicle. . . ARIELY: We were taking the first one apart and putting the pieces back into the original box. RAZ: Like, right in front of them? That's cruel. ARIELY: Yes, I know (laughter). And when they finished the second one, we said, hey, would you like to build a third one? And if they said yes, we gave them the first one, the one that they built and we took apart. So it was kind of back and forth on the same two Bionicles until they basically had enough. And what we wanted to contrast was really the notion that what you're building is going to be temporary and destroyed soon compared to destroyed in front of your eyes. RAZ: At the end of the experiment, Dan found that on average, the people in the first group built 11 Bionicles. But the second group - the group who watched their Bionicles being destroyed - they built just seven. They did about half as much work. I mean, that's statistically significant - very significant. ARIELY: It's not just statistically significant. It's a big difference, right? All of a sudden, you have you ask yourself, how much meaning helps motivate people to a higher degree? RAZ: And the answer from Dan's Bionicle study - people tend to be motivated to do more work if the work they put in gets results - results they can see. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ARIELY: Soon after I finished running this experiment, I went to talk to a big software company in Seattle - can't tell you who they were, but they were a big company in Seattle. And this was a group within the software company that was put in a different building. And they asked them to innovate and create the next big product for this company. And a week before I showed up, the CEO of this big software company went to that group, 200 engineers, and canceled the project. And I stood there in front of 200 of the most depressed people I've ever talked to. And I described to them some of these Lego experiments, and they said they felt like they've just been through this experiment. And I asked them - I said, how many of you now show up to work later than you used to? And everybody raised their hand. I said, how many of you go home earlier than you used to? Everybody raised their hand. I asked them, how many of you now add not so kosher thing to your expense reports? And they didn't really raise their hand, but they took me out to dinner and showed me what they could do with expense reports. And then I asked them - I said, what could the CEO have done to make you not as depressed? And they came up with all kinds of ideas. They said the CEO could've asked them to present to the whole company about their journey over the last two years and why they decide to do. He could have asked them to think about which aspect of their technology could fit with other parts of the organization. He could've asked them to build some prototypes, some next-generation prototype, and see how they would work. But the thing is that any one of those would require some effort and motivation. And I think the CEO basically did not understand the importance of meaning. But if you understood how important meaning is, then you would figure out that it's actually important to spend some time, energy and effort in getting people to care more about what they're doing. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: And how would you start to do that, say, in your own work? Well, Dan's research suggests you might have already experienced it if you've ever built a piece of furniture from IKEA. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ARIELY: I can't say I enjoy the process, but when I finish it, I seem to like those IKEA pieces of furniture more than I like other ones. RAZ: The IKEA effect and what it can teach us about work in just a moment. Our show today - ideas about why we work. I'm Guy Raz, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz, and on the show today, why we work and ideas behind the meaning of work. And just before the break, we were hearing from behavioral economist Dan Ariely about something he calls the IKEA effect. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ARIELY: And IKEA is a store with kind of OK furniture that takes a long time to assemble. And. . . (LAUGHTER)ARIELY: . . . I don't know about you, but every time I assemble one of those, it takes me much longer, it's much more effortful, it's much more confusing. RAZ: So Dan argues precisely because you worked hard putting together that furniture, you actually enjoy the results more. You feel a sense of pride and ownership in what you created. So to study that idea, Dan set up an experiment. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ARIELY: We asked people to build some origami. We gave them instructions to - how to create origami and we gave them a sheet of paper. And they build something that was really quite ugly. But then we told them - we said, look, this origami really belongs to us. You worked for us, but I'll tell you what - we'll sell it to you. How much do you want to pay for it? And we had two types of people. We had the people who build it, and we had the people who did not build it and just looked at it as external observers. And what we found were - that the builders thought that these were beautiful pieces of origami. . . . (LAUGHTER)ARIELY: . . . And they were willing to pay for them five times more than the people who just evaluated them externally. Now, you could say if you were a builder, do you think that, oh, I love this origami, but I know that nobody else would love it? Or do you think I love this origami and everybody else would love it as well? Turns out, the builders not only love the origami more, they thought that everybody else would love it more as well. In the next version, we try to do the IKEA effect. We tried to make it more difficult by hiding the instructions, so now this was tougher. What happened? Well, in an objective way, the origami now was uglier, was more difficult. Now, when we looked at the easier origami, we saw the same thing - builder loved it more, evaluators loved it less. When you looked at the hard instructions, the effect was larger. Why? Because now, the builders loved it even more. They put all this extra effort into it and evaluators - they loved it even less because, in reality, it was even uglier than the first version. Of course, this tells you about something about how we evaluate things. RAZ: OK, but when it comes to work, you know, and finding meaning and ownership in that work, I mean, how much of it has to do with the work environment and how much of that is, you know, how a person is wired? ARIELY: Yeah, so think about motivation. If you take somebody who is, you know, working at this start-up and they breathe and live and enjoy everything they do, and then you take somebody who is basically on an assembly line doing something incredibly boring all the time, is this a personality difference? Was one of them born like this and the other one born the other way? Or could we have designed the environment and would switch them? And I think, yes, there are some individual differences. But a lot of it has to do with the kind of environments we create, the kind of work environment we create and how much we allow motivation to come forward. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ARIELY: If you think about Adam Smith versus Karl Marx, Adam Smith had the very important notion of efficiency. He gave an example of a pin factory. He said pins have 12 different steps, and if one person does all 12 steps, production is very low. But if you get one person to do step one and one person to do step two and step three and so on, production can increase tremendously. And indeed, this is a great example and the reason for the Industrial Revolution and efficiency. Karl Marx, on the other hand, said that the alienation of labor is incredibly important and how people think about the connection to what they're doing. And if you make all 12 steps, you care about the pin. But if you make one step every time, maybe you don't care as much. And I think that in the Industrial Revolution, Adam Smith was more correct than Karl Marx. But the reality - that we've switched, and now we're in the knowledge economy. And you can ask yourself, what happens in a knowledge economy? Is efficiency still more important than meaning? I think the answer is no. I think that as we move through situations in which people have to decide on their own about how much effort, attention, caring, how connected they feel to it - are they thinking about labor on their way to work and in the shower and so on? All of a sudden, Marx has more things to say to us. So when we think about labor, we usually think about motivation and payment as the same thing. But the reality is that we should probably add all kinds of things to it - meaning, creation, challenges, ownership, identity, pride, etcetera. And the good news is that if we added all of those components and thought about them, how do we create our own meaning, pride, motivation, and how do we do it in our workplace and for the employees, I think we could get people to both be more productive and happier. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Psychologist and behavioral economist Dan Ariely. You should definitely check out all of his talks. You can find them at TED. com.

And indeed, this is a great example and the reason for the Industrial Revolution and efficiency. Karl Marx, on the other hand, said that the alienation of labor is incredibly important and how people think about the connection to what they're doing. And if you make all 12 steps, you care about the pin. But if you make one step every time, maybe you don't care as much. And I think that in the Industrial Revolution, Adam Smith was more correct than Karl Marx. But the reality - that we've switched, and now we're in the knowledge economy. And you can ask yourself, what happens in a knowledge economy? Is efficiency still more important than meaning? I think the answer is no. I think that as we move through situations in which people have to decide on their own about how much effort, attention, caring, how connected they feel to it - are they thinking about labor on their way to work and in the shower and so on? All of a sudden, Marx has more things to say to us. So when we think about labor, we usually think about motivation and payment as the same thing. But the reality is that we should probably add all kinds of things to it - meaning, creation, challenges, ownership, identity, pride, etcetera. And the good news is that if we added all of those components and thought about them, how do we create our own meaning, pride, motivation, and how do we do it in our workplace and for the employees, I think we could get people to both be more productive and happier.

The three researchers won for discovering drugs used to treat parasitic diseases that affect millions of people each year. NPR's health correspondent Rob Stein joins us now with the details. Good morning. ROB STEIN, BYLINE: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: All right, so names and countries please. Who are the winners? STEIN: Yes, this year's winners are William C. Campbell - he's at Drew University in Madison, N. J. - Satoshi Omura at the Kitasato University in Japan and Youyou Tu at the China Academy of Traditional Medicine in Beijing. MONTAGNE: And what exactly were the drugs that they discovered? And these drugs do what? STEIN: Right. So Campbell and Omura, the American and the Japanese scientist, won for a drug called Avermectin. Now, extracts of this drug are used to treat a variety of parasitic diseases, including something called river blindness, as well as another disease called lymphatic filariasis, which is also known as elephantiasis. Youyou Tu, the Chinese scientist, won for discovering a drug called Artemisinin. That's a drug used to treat a disease a lot more people are probably familiar with - malaria. MONTAGNE: Well, yes, we are familiar with it, although malaria and those other two diseases don't really affect people here in the U. S. , but horribly common in many parts of the world. STEIN: Oh, yeah, absolutely. The malaria parasite, it's spread by mosquitoes. And the Nobel committee says more than 3. 4 billion people around the world are at risk for malaria. And it's still killing about 450,000 people every year. A lot of them are kids. The other diseases, you know, such as river blindness and elephantiasis, are caused by parasitic worms. And they're estimated to afflict one third of the world's population, mostly in southern sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Central and South America. Now, river blindness - the parasitic worms infect the cornea of the eye, which is why victims often go blind. In elephantiasis, the parasitic worm infects the lymphatic system, and that causes this chronic swelling that is disabling and terribly disfiguring. MONTAGNE: And Rob, the Nobels are given often long after - at least sometime after things - drugs are discovered. What about in these cases? STEIN: Yeah, these are really interesting stories. The discovery of Avermectin started with the Japanese scientist, Satoshi Omura, in the 1970s. He's a microbiologist and an expert in isolating natural products. And he was studying bacteria that live in dirt, actually, that produce natural antibacterial agents. And he was sifting through these bacteria to try to isolate new strains that might produce compounds that might be useful in medicine. And he sent about 50 of the most promising ones to Campbell, the American researcher. He analyzed them and showed that a component of one of them was amazingly effective against this parasite in animals. He purified it and it turned out to be Avermectin, which was then chemically modified to a more effective compound known as Ivermectin, which is the one that's used in people. And the Nobel committee noted that the drug is so effective against both of these diseases that they're on the verge of being eradicated. And the Chinese scientist Youyou Tu won for discovering the drug for malaria, Artemisinin. Now, she did this as part of a program that Chairman Mao started in the 1960s to find a better way to treat malaria. He was worried about how it was affecting soldiers. So Youyou Tu sifted through traditional Chinese herbal remedies until she found an extract that Chinese herbalists had been using for more than 2,000 years. It's from a plant called Artemisia annua, which is more commonly known as sweet wormwood. She went on to show that it was highly effective at killing the malaria parasite in animals and in humans. MONTAGNE: Just one last thing - of course, that particular drug has not wiped out malaria. STEIN: No, not at all. Malaria's still a huge problem in many parts of the world. And there's large international efforts underway to try to eventually - people hope - will eliminate malaria. But still, it's affecting millions of people every year.

Takaaki Kajita, of Japan, and Arthur McDonald, of Canada, won for showing that particles called neutrinos have mass. NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has more on the win. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: When Arthur McDonald got the call from Stockholm, he gave his wife a hug. He spoke to his mom and texted his kids. The only person he couldn't tell was his dad. ARTHUR MCDONALD: My father unfortunately passed away a couple of years ago. I'm actually wearing a sweater that was his, which is my way of dealing with that. He would love to be here today. BRUMFIEL: That's very sweet. Was he a physicist? MCDONALD: No, he was an accountant, but a very good one. BRUMFIEL: McDonald has devoted his career to studying neutrinos. Neutrinos are fundamental particles. Billions, even trillions of them are streaming through your body right now. They pass right through you like you're not even there. Neutrinos are so hard to see. . . MCDONALD: You have to build a detector the size of a 10-story building in order to observe one an hour. BRUMFIEL: You heard that right - a building-sized detector will see just one little neutrino in an hour. McDonald and the other winner made a big discovery in separate detectors on opposite sides of the planet. These detectors are isolated deep underground in abandoned mines. Joe Lykken, who's deputy director of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, says these are some of the oddest labs in the world. JOE LYKKEN: You walk down a tunnel and then all of a sudden there's a door. You walk through the door, and you're in a modern science lab where the walls are clean and there's electronics and there's an espresso machine and there's Wi-Fi. It's really surreal. It's a strange feeling. BRUMFIEL: What's even stranger is what today's prize winners found 15 years ago. There are different kinds of neutrinos, and the scientists were counting them by type. They knew how many of each type they should find, but the numbers just didn't add up. The only possible explanation was the neutrinos were changing from one type to another. LYKKEN: And this is really quite remarkable when you think about it because we do believe neutrinos are elementary particles, and it almost seems like a contradiction to say that one elementary particle can turn into a different elementary particle. It's very mysterious that that can happen all, and it wasn't believed until we had definitive evidence of it. BRUMFIEL: There's another reason nobody believed it. For neutrinos to change type, the laws of physics say they have to have mass. But the best theories at the time predicted neutrinos were weightless. In other words, these experiments showed the best theories were wrong. Even today, the U. S. and other countries are still conducting experiments to figure out what's going on. LYKKEN: We're close to breaking through, I think, to the next level. BRUMFIEL: As for Nobel winner Arthur McDonald, now that he's told his family, he's got a few more phone calls to make - to the other physicists who he worked with. MCDONALD: The total number of people who were authors on the physics papers that we published were 277.

UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: And with that top pair, Phil Hellmuth going all in with his 450,000 chips. Annie Duke put the pressure on Phi when she check raised him. . . VEDANTAM: This was the final hand of the World Series of Poker: Tournament of Champions. ANNIE DUKE: They had these incredible Hall of Fame players, like Doyle Brunson, who was a Hall of Famer; Johnny Chan, who was a Hall of Famer; and then Phil Hellmuth, who has the most championships of anyone in the history of the World Series of Poker. And then there was me. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Annie calls the all-in. And Phil sees what he's up against. VEDANTAM: Annie and this guy, Phil, were the last two at the table. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: And Annie is overcome with emotion seeing how close she is to winning this championship. VEDANTAM: Annie's crying. Phil's standing up, pacing back and forth. The dealer's laying out the cards that will determine who wins. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Annie has control of this hand. Now here comes the turn. It's a seven. No help for Phil. VEDANTAM: Annie was the only woman in this competition. She had knocked out eight guys, eight of the best players in the world to get to this point. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: Annie Duke is now one card away from $2 million. DUKE: But I didn't really feel like I deserved to be at that table. VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. Today, we are going to take the whole podcast to tell you the story about being an outsider. It's why Annie Duke didn't feel she deserved to be at that table, and it's a perfect illustration of a very powerful idea in psychology called stereotype threat. It's an insidious thing. Here's how it works. Let's say that you think people have a certain stereotype about you. There's a part of you that's afraid that your actions and behavior will prove the stereotype true. DUKE: I'm sort of thinking about, well, if I fold and I'm wrong, everybody's going to be like, see, she plays like a girl. Like, look how he pushed her around. VEDANTAM: But Annie's story is also about a second idea, and this idea often has a positive outcome. This idea is called stereotype tax. That's when a stereotype that others have about you works to your advantage. DUKE: If somebody was at the table who was so emotionally invested in the fact that I was a woman, given that they're treating me that way, how can I come up with the best strategy to take their money, 'cause I guess in the end, isn't that the best revenge? VEDANTAM: Annie had started playing poker in 1994. And by the time she got to that championship game 10 years later, she had basically figured out how to make stereotypes about women in poker work for her. DUKE: So I can tell you that the first year that I played in the World Series of Poker main event, which was in 1994, 3 percent of the entrants were women, and last year that number would have been the same. VEDANTAM: Wow. So this is an extraordinarily male-dominated sport. DUKE: Completely. I was generally the only woman at the table. I had to really love that game in order to be willing to expose myself to a lot of the behavior that I was experiencing. VEDANTAM: Tell me what you heard. What did people say? DUKE: There were people who were incredibly welcoming. There were other people - you know, there was one guy who I lost a pot to, and he said, don't cry, I'll give you your money back if we go across the street to the Northern. And the Northern was a hotel. VEDANTAM: Wow. DUKE: You know, and I got called a lot of bad things. But to think about it as, OK, given that this person is viewing me in a way that I find disrespectful, try to separate yourself from your emotional reaction to that and think about how you can use that to your advantage. VEDANTAM: Annie had learned to make her opponents pay, literally, for the stereotypes they held about women. DUKE: Right. At the poker table, for example, I sort of in my head divided people into three categories. One was the flirting chauvinist, and that person was really viewing me in a way that was sexual. VEDANTAM: And not as overtly as the guy who invited her back to the Great Northern Hotel. These were just guys who sometimes seemed more concerned about getting Annie to like them than they were about winning. DUKE: Like they'd show me their whole cards when they were done with their hand to show me whether it was a good fold or not. They'd kind of tell me during the hand, if I was alone with them in the hand, you know, what they had. VEDANTAM: They were trying to make nice with you? DUKE: They were trying to make nice with me. Exactly. I never did go out on a date with any of them, but, you know, it was kind of flirtatious at the table and I could use that to my advantage. VEDANTAM: Then there's a second kind of guy. DUKE: What I would call the disrespecting chauvinist who mainly just thought that women weren't creative, that they could only think one level deep. So they didn't believe that you knew how to bluff, for example, 'cause that's a level deep in your thinking. They didn't think that you really had creativity. They thought that you were very straightforward in the way that you play because, you know, you're a girl. VEDANTAM: Right. So they assume that you're naive, basically. DUKE: Exactly. So there are strategies that you can use against them. Mainly you can bluff those people a lot. VEDANTAM: And then there's a third kind of guy, perhaps the most reckless. DUKE: The angry chauvinist. VEDANTAM: This is a guy who would do anything to avoid being beaten by a woman. DUKE: You couldn't bluff them because they would call you all the time for fear that you might be bluffing them, and then they would also try to push you around a lot. So they would play extremely aggressively against you. They'd be trying to bluff you all the time because the best thing that could happen to them was that they bluffed you and then they could show you that they had a terrible hand and be like, ha ha little girl, look what happened to you. VEDANTAM: Right, because that would confirm that everything that they believed about you was true. DUKE: Right. So you can just sort of wait until they - what I say is until they would impale themselves on your chips. VEDANTAM: I have to ask you though - so it's clear that thinking about this mathematically and in a very detached and unemotional way gave you an edge at the poker table. And I can clearly see how that's very smart. But you're not a robot. You're not a computer. At some level you also are processing how people actually are behaving toward you. And I'm wondering if you could talk a minute about how this felt. DUKE: Most of the time I would compartmentalize while I was at the table. I would sort of say I have emotions about this. I'm going to set them aside and deal with them later. And then I would leave the table and drive home in tears. VEDANTAM: Coming up, feeling like an imposter. DUKE: It was always in the back of my mind, like, do they really respect me? Why are they talking to me? Is just because I'm a girl, or do they actually respect my play? VEDANTAM: More from Annie Duke after this. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Support for this episode of HIDDEN BRAIN comes from Casper. They're an online retailer for mattresses.

We're talking with poker champion Annie Duke about stereotypes, how they affected her and how she learned to turn them to her own advantage. In her first 10 years at the poker table, Annie was able to compartmentalize her emotions, and she won a lot of money doing this, using stereotype tax to her advantage. That was until 2004 at the Tournament of Champions. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Intimidation is such a big part of being a successful player. Is that going to come into play at this table, you think? UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Oh, not really. In fact, these players know each other so well, if one of them sneezes, somebody else has already handed them a handkerchief. VEDANTAM: Actually, at least for Annie, that wasn't true. She had never played poker on TV before, and she was pretty sure she had been invited as the token woman, that she was way out of her league. She thought that ESPN, televising the game in this way for the first time, just thought it was good optics to have her there. DUKE: And I went in there with this incredible fear that my play, which was now in front of lipstick cameras - so my mistakes were no longer going to be private to me - that that was going to expose that everybody was right and I was actually a terrible player. And despite the fact that I had spent the last 10 years making my living playing poker at the highest levels of the game, that I didn't really deserve to have ever won anything. I was bad and I had just gotten lucky and now everybody was going to know it and what they were saying was true. VEDANTAM: You felt like an imposter. DUKE: Completely. VEDANTAM: You were facing a very difficult situation here, which is you're not just juggling with what's happening at the poker table, but you're juggling with all this other psychological crap, in a way, that just makes it hard to focus on what it is that you're actually doing. And in so many ways, that to me is a perfect illustration of stereotype threat. It shows that when there's a stereotype that's in the air, when there's a stereotype that multiple people believe, even if you don't believe it yourself - if you are the person who is potentially at the receiving end of that stereotype, it affects your behavior in such a way that you become more likely to make the stereotype come true. DUKE: I think that that's completely true. It was always in the back of my mind, like, do they really respect me? Why are they talking to me? Is it just because they are thinking about me in a different way, like, they want to be friends with me because I'm a girl? Or do they actually respect my play? VEDANTAM: There was a particular hand, Annie says, when stereotype threat got the better of her. DUKE: So in this particular hand where I had two 10s. . . VEDANTAM: This was early in the game. There were nine people still at the table, and for Annie. . . DUKE: Certainly in the beginning of that tournament, I just kept thinking to myself, like, oh, please don't let me be the first one out 'cause then everybody will be right. VEDANTAM: Because of course, she wasn't good enough, she didn't belong at the table, she couldn't hang with the guys. DUKE: That discourse was kind of running in the back of my head the whole time. VEDANTAM: And then Annie winds up in a head-to-head matchup with one other player. Her hand was a pair of 10s, which is a pretty good hand. It was good enough that there wasn't a huge chance that her opponent, this guy Greg Raymer, had a better hand. But there was still a chance. As a professional poker player, this is the kind of hand that you evaluate in a matter of seconds. DUKE: So I really needed to eliminate that hand as a possibility, and I was having a lot of trouble doing that because I was so afraid of making this really bad, big decision on television and having everyone say, I told you so. VEDANTAM: This was a pivotal hand, but a lot of the significance was really just in Annie's head. If she folded but really had the best hand. . . DUKE: Everybody's going to be like, see, she plays like a girl. Like, look how he pushed her around. And if I called and I was wrong, then I could come up with a whole other thing, like, look how bad she is. Didn't she know that he had the best hand? Like, any idiot would have known that, you know? And that was running in my head as I was trying to make this decision. VEDANTAM: So you're damned if you do, and you're damned if you don't. DUKE: Absolutely. Absolutely. And it was incredibly difficult, and it wasn't until I kind of snapped to and saw this tell that he had. VEDANTAM: And when you say a tell, you mean what? DUKE: So a tell is a physical - well, it could be something verbal that somebody says that gives a clue - but generally when we talk about tells, we are talking about something physical that somebody does that telegraphs the quality of their hand, or at least what they think what the quality of their hand is. So Greg Raymer did something, which I haven't actually said what he actually did because I think that's unfair to him - but he did something that gave away the fact that his hand was very, very strong, which allowed me to then fold. And at that moment, I was actually quite confident in it. VEDANTAM: But Annie's confidence in her decision was short-lived. Another player came up to her during a break in the game and what he said kicked the stereotype threat in Annie's head into overdrive. DUKE: Phil Hellmuth, right after that hand occurred, came up and just told me, like, what an idiot I was because clearly Greg Raymer had ace-king. And I thought, oh, my gosh. This is a guy who's like - now I think he's a 12-time world champion - but at the time he probably had, you know, seven world championships or something. And he seemed pretty confident that he had ace-king and - oh, no. And it was just - and then I had an hour in my room having a panic attack while we were on break from the tournament. It was pretty awful. VEDANTAM: Annie's stereotype threat had produced what poker players call tilt. DUKE: Tilt - when you allow kind of bad things that happen to you that very often are out of your control to cause you to be a poor decision-maker going forward. VEDANTAM: You know, Annie, social science researchers have figured out one way to beat stereotype threat. There was an interesting experiment conducted at Stanford University by Greg Walton and others where he was concerned that black students at Stanford might feel that they were imposters on campus. And when negative things happened to them - they get a bad grade or a bad interaction with a professor - they'll interpret that in the light of thinking I don't really belong here. And so he had the students come in. And he had them describe negative things that happened to them during their freshman year, but he also had them describe how those negative things were transient events. You get a bad grade or you have a bad interaction, but two weeks later, that's not a big deal anymore. And he was using this as a way to get students to understand that everyone experiences setbacks. It's only when you see local setbacks as global problems that the risk of stereotype threat comes in, and you start to feel like an imposter. DUKE: Exactly. And it's something that I've used a lot at the table. You know, when I lose a big pot and it feels like the end of the world, I try to think about how will that really affect my bottom line in the long run. So an example would be you get a flat tire, you're standing by the side of the road. It feels like the worst thing that's ever happened to you. And then, if you stop for a second and you say to yourself, well, if it's a year from now, will that flat tire have affected my happiness for the year in any way? And the answer to that is of course no. It wouldn't tick it up or down. So in that same sense, you know, when you have something really bad happen, to stop for a second and think about, well, I've had stuff like this to happen to me before. When it was a few weeks later, did it really affect my overall level of happiness? And the answer is generally no. VEDANTAM: In just a moment, the conclusion of the poker championship. . .

(SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Annie has picked up a heart draw here. . . VEDANTAM: So after she nearly lost it in her hotel room, Annie comes back to the table and she has a stroke of luck. She wins a pretty nice hand. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: And the river card. It's a six of spades. No help for Greg Raymer. He loses that hand. Annie Duke lives to tell the tale yet again. . . VEDANTAM: And you can actually hear at this point in the game, Annie begins to loosen up. It's a sign that she's finally gotten the stereotype threat under control. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)DUKE: The flop was just - wow. GREG RAYMER: It doesn't matter what order they come in, right? DUKE: It doesn't matter - well, it kind of does in that situation, you know? VEDANTAM: Annie had turned on the charm with Greg Raymer. And the next time they faced each other in a hand, Raymer got cocky. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Now Raymer needs to call or get out of the way. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: I don't know what he's thinking about here. It's one thing when he called with nine-eight suited before when he was chip leader and it was a small cost. But he has a lot fewer chips and not as good of a hand. RAYMER: I call. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Oh, the world champion is going to call. . . VEDANTAM: Just to be clear, this was not the right thing to do. Raymer had a pretty weak hand. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: And now the river card. It's a three. No good for Raymer. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: Well, calling that all-in with a nine-eight off-suit line, that's a meltdown of sorts for Greg Raymer. VEDANTAM: On the next hand, Annie would knock out Raymer, whose nickname was Fossilman. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: It is an ace. It's no help to Fossilman. And he goes down. DUKE: You played really well. VEDANTAM: Just like that, Annie was back in the zone. DUKE: And that actually sort of brought me out of this very bad headspace. VEDANTAM: Soon the table dwindled to four players. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Hellmuth knocking out Johnny Chan in fourth place. VEDANTAM: Then there were three. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: It's a three, and that's the end of the line for Howard (ph). . . VEDANTAM: Until finally, Annie and Phil Hellmuth, the guy who nearly destroyed her confidence earlier in the game, these are the only two left. And Annie says to him. . . (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)DUKE: This is all right, you know? I'm just happy to be in the final two. I mean, seriously I donked (ph) my money off in the first two hours. . . VEDANTAM: You could argue that this little-old-me act. . . (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)DUKE: Somehow. . . VEDANTAM: . . . Really did a number on Phil Hellmuth. . . (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)DUKE: . . . Someway. . . VEDANTAM: . . . Because for the next half a dozen hands, he just did not know what to make of Annie. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Well, Annie Duke will shy away from this hand. HELLMUTH: God dang it. I should have moved in before the flop. VEDANTAM: Annie keeps the charm turned up. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)DUKE: Are you saying you had a good hand, Phil? HELLMUTH: I had a pocket pair. DUKE: Sorry I couldn't accommodate you. HELLMUTH: Well, you gave me the raise. DUKE: Yeah. HELLMUTH: I just. . . VEDANTAM: And they go back and forth like this all the way to the final hand. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Annie's got Phil second-guessing every move he makes and every move he doesn't make. VEDANTAM: Phil Hellmuth was holding a 10-eight. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: Phil, ready to act, high pair, and he will bet 45,000. VEDANTAM: But Annie's hand was much better, a king-10. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)DUKE: I raise. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Annie Duke is going to raise Phil Hellmuth. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: And she's going to raise 200,000, as she has set her trap. VEDANTAM: Phil thought Annie was bluffing. In fact, he thought that she had been bluffing a lot. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)HELLMUTH: I'm all in. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: And with that top pair, Phil Hellmuth going all-in with his 450,000 chips. Annie Duke put the pressure on Phil when she check-raised him, and now with Phil's all-in call, the pressure is back on Annie. HELLMUTH: Four-hundred-and-fifty more. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: She set the trap, but Phil has come back very strong. VEDANTAM: At this point, it's obvious to both Annie and Phil the other person has a strong hand. The question is, how strong? That's a judgment call. It's based on probability, instinct and all the undercurrents, expectations and stereotypes that have been running through the game the entire time, but now there is only one question. If Annie thinks that Phil has misjudged her, she knows she should call his bet. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)DUKE: I call. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: Annie calls the all-in. HELLMUTH: [Expletive]. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: And Phil sees what he's up against. VEDANTAM: What he's up against here meaning the dealer's cards. That's going to determine who wins. And if there was any moment that perfectly revealed how much of an outsider Annie was in this situation, it's this next one. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: Annie Duke is now one card away from $2 million. HELLMUTH: An eight, please. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Phil Hellmuth needs an eight to win this pot. Both players on their feet anticipating the river card. It's a three. Annie Duke has defeated nine of the strongest poker players in the world and wins the first ever World Series of Poker: Tournament of Champions. HELLMUTH: She won every [expletive] raise for [expletive]. . . VEDANTAM: In classic reality-television style, cameras follow Phil as he storms away from the table, out a door, just pacing around, talking to himself. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)HELLMUTH: She check-raised me six times. I know she didn't have it all six times. DUKE: Oh, my God. I won. VEDANTAM: It was the reaction of a man who just got beat. . . (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)HELLMUTH: She had to be [expletive] 30-1 to win this. VEDANTAM: . . . By someone who wasn't supposed to win. . . (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)HELLMUTH: I love Annie, but [expletive]. VEDANTAM: And maybe even wasn't supposed to be at the table in the first place. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)HELLMUTH: Who the [expletive] [expletive] [expletive]. VEDANTAM: But precisely because Annie Duke knew how stereotypes can be both threat and advantage, well. . . (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Well, you heard Phil, and he was right. Annie was definitely a long shot to win this all. But as the only female at the table, she is now the last man standing. HELLMUTH: Another [expletive] second - second, third, second third. VEDANTAM: I have to say, Annie Duke, you're not just a good poker player, but you're clearly a very wise person. DUKE: (Laughter) Well, so are you. Thank you. VEDANTAM: Thank you so much for talking with us today, Annie. I really, really appreciate it. DUKE: Thank you for having me. It was a lot of fun. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER)HELLMUTH: I see it, but I don't [expletive] believe it. I just don't believe it. VEDANTAM: For more HIDDEN BRAIN, find us on FaceBook and Twitter.

UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: And with that top pair, Phil Hellmuth going all in with his 450,000 chips. Annie Duke put the pressure on Phi when she check raised him. . . VEDANTAM: This was the final hand of the World Series of Poker: Tournament of Champions. ANNIE DUKE: They had these incredible Hall of Fame players, like Doyle Brunson, who was a Hall of Famer; Johnny Chan, who was a Hall of Famer; and then Phil Hellmuth, who has the most championships of anyone in the history of the World Series of Poker. And then there was me. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Annie calls the all-in. And Phil sees what he's up against. VEDANTAM: Annie and this guy, Phil, were the last two at the table. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: And Annie is overcome with emotion seeing how close she is to winning this championship. VEDANTAM: Annie's crying. Phil's standing up, pacing back and forth. The dealer's laying out the cards that will determine who wins. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Annie has control of this hand. Now here comes the turn. It's a seven. No help for Phil. VEDANTAM: Annie was the only woman in this competition. She had knocked out eight guys, eight of the best players in the world to get to this point. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: Annie Duke is now one card away from $2 million. DUKE: But I didn't really feel like I deserved to be at that table. VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. Today, we are going to take the whole podcast to tell you the story about being an outsider. It's why Annie Duke didn't feel she deserved to be at that table, and it's a perfect illustration of a very powerful idea in psychology called stereotype threat. It's an insidious thing. Here's how it works. Let's say that you think people have a certain stereotype about you. There's a part of you that's afraid that your actions and behavior will prove the stereotype true. DUKE: I'm sort of thinking about, well, if I fold and I'm wrong, everybody's going to be like, see, she plays like a girl. Like, look how he pushed her around. VEDANTAM: But Annie's story is also about a second idea, and this idea often has a positive outcome. This idea is called stereotype tax. That's when a stereotype that others have about you works to your advantage. DUKE: If somebody was at the table who was so emotionally invested in the fact that I was a woman, given that they're treating me that way, how can I come up with the best strategy to take their money, 'cause I guess in the end, isn't that the best revenge? VEDANTAM: Annie had started playing poker in 1994. And by the time she got to that championship game 10 years later, she had basically figured out how to make stereotypes about women in poker work for her. DUKE: So I can tell you that the first year that I played in the World Series of Poker main event, which was in 1994, 3 percent of the entrants were women, and last year that number would have been the same. VEDANTAM: Wow. So this is an extraordinarily male-dominated sport. DUKE: Completely. I was generally the only woman at the table. I had to really love that game in order to be willing to expose myself to a lot of the behavior that I was experiencing. VEDANTAM: Tell me what you heard. What did people say? DUKE: There were people who were incredibly welcoming. There were other people - you know, there was one guy who I lost a pot to, and he said, don't cry, I'll give you your money back if we go across the street to the Northern. And the Northern was a hotel. VEDANTAM: Wow. DUKE: You know, and I got called a lot of bad things. But to think about it as, OK, given that this person is viewing me in a way that I find disrespectful, try to separate yourself from your emotional reaction to that and think about how you can use that to your advantage. VEDANTAM: Annie had learned to make her opponents pay, literally, for the stereotypes they held about women. DUKE: Right. At the poker table, for example, I sort of in my head divided people into three categories. One was the flirting chauvinist, and that person was really viewing me in a way that was sexual. VEDANTAM: And not as overtly as the guy who invited her back to the Great Northern Hotel. These were just guys who sometimes seemed more concerned about getting Annie to like them than they were about winning. DUKE: Like they'd show me their whole cards when they were done with their hand to show me whether it was a good fold or not. They'd kind of tell me during the hand, if I was alone with them in the hand, you know, what they had. VEDANTAM: They were trying to make nice with you? DUKE: They were trying to make nice with me. Exactly. I never did go out on a date with any of them, but, you know, it was kind of flirtatious at the table and I could use that to my advantage. VEDANTAM: Then there's a second kind of guy. DUKE: What I would call the disrespecting chauvinist who mainly just thought that women weren't creative, that they could only think one level deep. So they didn't believe that you knew how to bluff, for example, 'cause that's a level deep in your thinking. They didn't think that you really had creativity. They thought that you were very straightforward in the way that you play because, you know, you're a girl. VEDANTAM: Right. So they assume that you're naive, basically. DUKE: Exactly. So there are strategies that you can use against them. Mainly you can bluff those people a lot. VEDANTAM: And then there's a third kind of guy, perhaps the most reckless. DUKE: The angry chauvinist. VEDANTAM: This is a guy who would do anything to avoid being beaten by a woman. DUKE: You couldn't bluff them because they would call you all the time for fear that you might be bluffing them, and then they would also try to push you around a lot. So they would play extremely aggressively against you. They'd be trying to bluff you all the time because the best thing that could happen to them was that they bluffed you and then they could show you that they had a terrible hand and be like, ha ha little girl, look what happened to you. VEDANTAM: Right, because that would confirm that everything that they believed about you was true. DUKE: Right. So you can just sort of wait until they - what I say is until they would impale themselves on your chips. VEDANTAM: I have to ask you though - so it's clear that thinking about this mathematically and in a very detached and unemotional way gave you an edge at the poker table. And I can clearly see how that's very smart. But you're not a robot. You're not a computer. At some level you also are processing how people actually are behaving toward you. And I'm wondering if you could talk a minute about how this felt. DUKE: Most of the time I would compartmentalize while I was at the table. I would sort of say I have emotions about this. I'm going to set them aside and deal with them later. And then I would leave the table and drive home in tears. VEDANTAM: Coming up, feeling like an imposter. DUKE: It was always in the back of my mind, like, do they really respect me? Why are they talking to me? Is just because I'm a girl, or do they actually respect my play? VEDANTAM: More from Annie Duke after this. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Support for this episode of HIDDEN BRAIN comes from Casper. They're an online retailer for mattresses.

We're talking with poker champion Annie Duke about stereotypes, how they affected her and how she learned to turn them to her own advantage. In her first 10 years at the poker table, Annie was able to compartmentalize her emotions, and she won a lot of money doing this, using stereotype tax to her advantage. That was until 2004 at the Tournament of Champions. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Intimidation is such a big part of being a successful player. Is that going to come into play at this table, you think? UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Oh, not really. In fact, these players know each other so well, if one of them sneezes, somebody else has already handed them a handkerchief. VEDANTAM: Actually, at least for Annie, that wasn't true. She had never played poker on TV before, and she was pretty sure she had been invited as the token woman, that she was way out of her league. She thought that ESPN, televising the game in this way for the first time, just thought it was good optics to have her there. DUKE: And I went in there with this incredible fear that my play, which was now in front of lipstick cameras - so my mistakes were no longer going to be private to me - that that was going to expose that everybody was right and I was actually a terrible player. And despite the fact that I had spent the last 10 years making my living playing poker at the highest levels of the game, that I didn't really deserve to have ever won anything. I was bad and I had just gotten lucky and now everybody was going to know it and what they were saying was true. VEDANTAM: You felt like an imposter. DUKE: Completely. VEDANTAM: You were facing a very difficult situation here, which is you're not just juggling with what's happening at the poker table, but you're juggling with all this other psychological crap, in a way, that just makes it hard to focus on what it is that you're actually doing. And in so many ways, that to me is a perfect illustration of stereotype threat. It shows that when there's a stereotype that's in the air, when there's a stereotype that multiple people believe, even if you don't believe it yourself - if you are the person who is potentially at the receiving end of that stereotype, it affects your behavior in such a way that you become more likely to make the stereotype come true. DUKE: I think that that's completely true. It was always in the back of my mind, like, do they really respect me? Why are they talking to me? Is it just because they are thinking about me in a different way, like, they want to be friends with me because I'm a girl? Or do they actually respect my play? VEDANTAM: There was a particular hand, Annie says, when stereotype threat got the better of her. DUKE: So in this particular hand where I had two 10s. . . VEDANTAM: This was early in the game. There were nine people still at the table, and for Annie. . . DUKE: Certainly in the beginning of that tournament, I just kept thinking to myself, like, oh, please don't let me be the first one out 'cause then everybody will be right. VEDANTAM: Because of course, she wasn't good enough, she didn't belong at the table, she couldn't hang with the guys. DUKE: That discourse was kind of running in the back of my head the whole time. VEDANTAM: And then Annie winds up in a head-to-head matchup with one other player. Her hand was a pair of 10s, which is a pretty good hand. It was good enough that there wasn't a huge chance that her opponent, this guy Greg Raymer, had a better hand. But there was still a chance. As a professional poker player, this is the kind of hand that you evaluate in a matter of seconds. DUKE: So I really needed to eliminate that hand as a possibility, and I was having a lot of trouble doing that because I was so afraid of making this really bad, big decision on television and having everyone say, I told you so. VEDANTAM: This was a pivotal hand, but a lot of the significance was really just in Annie's head. If she folded but really had the best hand. . . DUKE: Everybody's going to be like, see, she plays like a girl. Like, look how he pushed her around. And if I called and I was wrong, then I could come up with a whole other thing, like, look how bad she is. Didn't she know that he had the best hand? Like, any idiot would have known that, you know? And that was running in my head as I was trying to make this decision. VEDANTAM: So you're damned if you do, and you're damned if you don't. DUKE: Absolutely. Absolutely. And it was incredibly difficult, and it wasn't until I kind of snapped to and saw this tell that he had. VEDANTAM: And when you say a tell, you mean what? DUKE: So a tell is a physical - well, it could be something verbal that somebody says that gives a clue - but generally when we talk about tells, we are talking about something physical that somebody does that telegraphs the quality of their hand, or at least what they think what the quality of their hand is. So Greg Raymer did something, which I haven't actually said what he actually did because I think that's unfair to him - but he did something that gave away the fact that his hand was very, very strong, which allowed me to then fold. And at that moment, I was actually quite confident in it. VEDANTAM: But Annie's confidence in her decision was short-lived. Another player came up to her during a break in the game and what he said kicked the stereotype threat in Annie's head into overdrive. DUKE: Phil Hellmuth, right after that hand occurred, came up and just told me, like, what an idiot I was because clearly Greg Raymer had ace-king. And I thought, oh, my gosh. This is a guy who's like - now I think he's a 12-time world champion - but at the time he probably had, you know, seven world championships or something. And he seemed pretty confident that he had ace-king and - oh, no. And it was just - and then I had an hour in my room having a panic attack while we were on break from the tournament. It was pretty awful. VEDANTAM: Annie's stereotype threat had produced what poker players call tilt. DUKE: Tilt - when you allow kind of bad things that happen to you that very often are out of your control to cause you to be a poor decision-maker going forward. VEDANTAM: You know, Annie, social science researchers have figured out one way to beat stereotype threat. There was an interesting experiment conducted at Stanford University by Greg Walton and others where he was concerned that black students at Stanford might feel that they were imposters on campus. And when negative things happened to them - they get a bad grade or a bad interaction with a professor - they'll interpret that in the light of thinking I don't really belong here. And so he had the students come in. And he had them describe negative things that happened to them during their freshman year, but he also had them describe how those negative things were transient events. You get a bad grade or you have a bad interaction, but two weeks later, that's not a big deal anymore. And he was using this as a way to get students to understand that everyone experiences setbacks. It's only when you see local setbacks as global problems that the risk of stereotype threat comes in, and you start to feel like an imposter. DUKE: Exactly. And it's something that I've used a lot at the table. You know, when I lose a big pot and it feels like the end of the world, I try to think about how will that really affect my bottom line in the long run. So an example would be you get a flat tire, you're standing by the side of the road. It feels like the worst thing that's ever happened to you. And then, if you stop for a second and you say to yourself, well, if it's a year from now, will that flat tire have affected my happiness for the year in any way? And the answer to that is of course no. It wouldn't tick it up or down. So in that same sense, you know, when you have something really bad happen, to stop for a second and think about, well, I've had stuff like this to happen to me before. When it was a few weeks later, did it really affect my overall level of happiness? And the answer is generally no. VEDANTAM: In just a moment, the conclusion of the poker championship. . .

Find it now at npr. org/podcast and on the NPR One app. This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. I'm talking with Annie Duke about the final hands in the world's biggest poker championship. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Annie has picked up a heart draw here. . . VEDANTAM: So after she nearly lost it in her hotel room, Annie comes back to the table and she has a stroke of luck. She wins a pretty nice hand. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: And the river card. It's a six of spades. No help for Greg Raymer. He loses that hand. Annie Duke lives to tell the tale yet again. . . VEDANTAM: And you can actually hear at this point in the game, Annie begins to loosen up. It's a sign that she's finally gotten the stereotype threat under control. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) DUKE: The flop was just - wow. GREG RAYMER: It doesn't matter what order they come in, right? DUKE: It doesn't matter - well, it kind of does in that situation, you know? VEDANTAM: Annie had turned on the charm with Greg Raymer. And the next time they faced each other in a hand, Raymer got cocky. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Now Raymer needs to call or get out of the way. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: I don't know what he's thinking about here. It's one thing when he called with nine-eight suited before when he was chip leader and it was a small cost. But he has a lot fewer chips and not as good of a hand. RAYMER: I call. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Oh, the world champion is going to call. . . VEDANTAM: Just to be clear, this was not the right thing to do. Raymer had a pretty weak hand. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: And now the river card. It's a three. No good for Raymer. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: Well, calling that all-in with a nine-eight off-suit line, that's a meltdown of sorts for Greg Raymer. VEDANTAM: On the next hand, Annie would knock out Raymer, whose nickname was Fossilman. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: It is an ace. It's no help to Fossilman. And he goes down. DUKE: You played really well. VEDANTAM: Just like that, Annie was back in the zone. DUKE: And that actually sort of brought me out of this very bad headspace. VEDANTAM: Soon the table dwindled to four players. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Hellmuth knocking out Johnny Chan in fourth place. VEDANTAM: Then there were three. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: It's a three, and that's the end of the line for Howard (ph). . . VEDANTAM: Until finally, Annie and Phil Hellmuth, the guy who nearly destroyed her confidence earlier in the game, these are the only two left. And Annie says to him. . . (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) DUKE: This is all right, you know? I'm just happy to be in the final two. I mean, seriously I donked (ph) my money off in the first two hours. . . VEDANTAM: You could argue that this little-old-me act. . . (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) DUKE: Somehow. . . VEDANTAM: . . . Really did a number on Phil Hellmuth. . . (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) DUKE: . . . Someway. . . VEDANTAM: . . . Because for the next half a dozen hands, he just did not know what to make of Annie. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Well, Annie Duke will shy away from this hand. HELLMUTH: God dang it. I should have moved in before the flop. VEDANTAM: Annie keeps the charm turned up. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) DUKE: Are you saying you had a good hand, Phil? HELLMUTH: I had a pocket pair. DUKE: Sorry I couldn't accommodate you. HELLMUTH: Well, you gave me the raise. DUKE: Yeah. HELLMUTH: I just. . . VEDANTAM: And they go back and forth like this all the way to the final hand. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Annie's got Phil second-guessing every move he makes and every move he doesn't make. VEDANTAM: Phil Hellmuth was holding a 10-eight. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: Phil, ready to act, high pair, and he will bet 45,000. VEDANTAM: But Annie's hand was much better, a king-10. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) DUKE: I raise. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Annie Duke is going to raise Phil Hellmuth. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: And she's going to raise 200,000, as she has set her trap. VEDANTAM: Phil thought Annie was bluffing. In fact, he thought that she had been bluffing a lot. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) HELLMUTH: I'm all in. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: And with that top pair, Phil Hellmuth going all-in with his 450,000 chips. Annie Duke put the pressure on Phil when she check-raised him, and now with Phil's all-in call, the pressure is back on Annie. HELLMUTH: Four-hundred-and-fifty more. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: She set the trap, but Phil has come back very strong. VEDANTAM: At this point, it's obvious to both Annie and Phil the other person has a strong hand. The question is, how strong? That's a judgment call. It's based on probability, instinct and all the undercurrents, expectations and stereotypes that have been running through the game the entire time, but now there is only one question. If Annie thinks that Phil has misjudged her, she knows she should call his bet. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) DUKE: I call. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: Annie calls the all-in. HELLMUTH: [Expletive]. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: And Phil sees what he's up against. VEDANTAM: What he's up against here meaning the dealer's cards. That's going to determine who wins. And if there was any moment that perfectly revealed how much of an outsider Annie was in this situation, it's this next one. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: Annie Duke is now one card away from $2 million. HELLMUTH: An eight, please. UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Phil Hellmuth needs an eight to win this pot. Both players on their feet anticipating the river card. It's a three. Annie Duke has defeated nine of the strongest poker players in the world and wins the first ever World Series of Poker: Tournament of Champions. HELLMUTH: She won every [expletive] raise for [expletive]. . . VEDANTAM: In classic reality-television style, cameras follow Phil as he storms away from the table, out a door, just pacing around, talking to himself. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) HELLMUTH: She check-raised me six times. I know she didn't have it all six times. DUKE: Oh, my God. I won. VEDANTAM: It was the reaction of a man who just got beat. . . (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) HELLMUTH: She had to be [expletive] 30-1 to win this. VEDANTAM: . . . By someone who wasn't supposed to win. . . (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) HELLMUTH: I love Annie, but [expletive]. VEDANTAM: And maybe even wasn't supposed to be at the table in the first place. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) HELLMUTH: Who the [expletive] [expletive] [expletive]. VEDANTAM: But precisely because Annie Duke knew how stereotypes can be both threat and advantage, well. . . (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Well, you heard Phil, and he was right. Annie was definitely a long shot to win this all. But as the only female at the table, she is now the last man standing. HELLMUTH: Another [expletive] second - second, third, second third. VEDANTAM: I have to say, Annie Duke, you're not just a good poker player, but you're clearly a very wise person. DUKE: (Laughter) Well, so are you. Thank you. VEDANTAM: Thank you so much for talking with us today, Annie. I really, really appreciate it. DUKE: Thank you for having me. It was a lot of fun. (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES OF POKER) HELLMUTH: I see it, but I don't [expletive] believe it. I just don't believe it. VEDANTAM: For more HIDDEN BRAIN, find us on FaceBook and Twitter.

The Nobel continues to be iconic, proof that you've reached the pinnacle of science. As part of his series, Joe's Big Idea, NPR's Joe Palca has been exploring the minds and motivations of scientists and inventors. Today he has a story about what it takes to win a Nobel Prize and what that does to your life. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: I probably picked the worst day of the year to visit chemistry Nobel laureate Harry Kroto. He and his wife, Margaret, were busy packing up their Tallahassee, Fla. , home. MARGARET KROTO: It's a bit mad in here. PALCA: Yes. I'm sorry - is it too early? I was worried about getting lost. M. KROTO: Don't worry. Harry's at his computer. PALCA: Kroto had planned to stay at Florida State University a bit longer, but health issues prompted the move back to England. How are things? HARRY KROTO: Well, we're packing. PALCA: Kroto just turned 76. In my experience, some Nobel Prize winners can be a bit full of themselves. But Kroto is very down to earth. H. KROTO: I've always felt that the Nobel Prize gives me nothing as far as science is concerned. PALCA: That's because most Nobel laureates have well-established scientific careers by the time they win the prize. Kroto won the Nobel in 1996 for a discovery he made more than a decade earlier. He and Robert Curl and Richard Smalley found a new kind of carbon molecule known as a buckyball, named for its resemblance to Buckminster Fuller's geodesic dome. The discovery of buckyballs helped kick off the field of nanotechnology. If the prize didn't do anything for his scientific career, Kroto says it did put a burden of responsibility on him. H. KROTO: Because certainly wherever you go, young people in the sciences listen to Nobel laureates, and I think I have things to say which are important to me and to them and to society. PALCA: And he makes a point of showing up at events where young people will listen, like science fairs. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)H. KROTO: I think the most important thing that young people should be taught at school is how they can decide what they're being told is true. PALCA: That's Kroto speaking to about 1,500 science fair finalists last year, reminding them how important it is to maintain a healthy skepticism. At the same meeting, he offered another life lesson. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)H. KROTO: If you're doing something second rate effort satisfies you, find something else to do where only your best sort of effort will satisfy you personally. That's basically it, and I think that's a recipe for being at least satisfied with what you do in life. PALCA: Not being satisfied with second-best certainly defines Kroto's character, and it probably played an important role in propelling him to the Nobel Prize. He was a good enough tennis player to dream of winning Wimbledon, but he realized it was a dream he'd never fulfill because as he puts it, I kept losing. Same with playing the guitar. H. KROTO: I wasn't too bad. I could play in a folk group, but then Eric Clapton came along and made me look like someone with honey stuck on their fingers. And he. . . PALCA: You set a high bar. H. KROTO: Well, you know. PALCA: And actually, I think I do know. You want to play at Wimbledon? You want to win at Wimbledon. You want to play the guitar? You want to play with the best, like Eric Clapton or Ry Cooder or Andres Segovia. Ultimately it was in science that Harry Kroto felt he was on a par with the best. There is one other field where Kroto felt he also excelled - graphic arts. Most of the books he's packing up to take back to England are art books. He says there's nothing at all incongruous about a scientist interested in art. H. KROTO: Art and science are intrinsically the same except for one thing. The universe is in control of your science whether it's right or wrong, and the public are in control of your art - if they're going to buy it - if you're making a living that way. PALCA: Whatever the public might think of Kroto's art, the universe seems to have thought well of his science. And when it comes to winning the Nobel Prize, there's one other important thing to know about Harry Kroto. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)H. KROTO: I never give up. Of course, you've got to know if there's a brick wall in front of you. But there's not often one. And never, ever give up. PALCA: Because who knows what beautiful discoveries lie ahead.

Some animals and plants are moving away from their native habitats. The reason is a warming climate. It's getting too hot where they are. But animals that can't migrate may perish, so some biologists are saying they should be moved. They admit they're rolling the dice with nature. NPR's Christopher Joyce reports on one team that is taking that risk. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Conservationists have a rule. If you want to keep the natural world natural, you don't move plants an animals around willy-nilly. Why not? Well, Europeans introduced rabbits to Australia, and they overran the place. The Great Lakes are now infested with invasive zebra mussels. But a few years ago, some biologists began to question that rule. They said the planet is warming faster than many plants and animals can handle; maybe we should move some wildlife to cooler places. BEN MINTEER: My read on it then was that it bordered on the heretical (laughter). JOYCE: Ben Minteer is an environmental ethicist at Arizona State University. He and other conservationists thought such climate translocations were like introducing invasive species. They could upset nature's ecological balance. But Minteer has changed his mind. MINTEER: The moral position, instead of hands-off, it might be hands-on. Our responsibility is actually to go in, preemptively relocate these species to give them a chance to survive. JOYCE: Some biologists still say it's too risky, but others have replanted trees and moved butterflies to cooler regions. And now a team in Montana has undertaken one of the boldest translocations yet. They're moving an iconic Western fish - the bull trout - to protect it from climate change. Logging Creek runs fast through tall forest in Glacier National Park. I'm thigh-deep and trying to keep up with biologist Clint Muhlfeld with the U. S. Geological Survey. CLINT MUHLFELD: The intention here is to save some of the last remaining bull trout populations and create new ones that will survive under a warming climate. JOYCE: Bull trout are a threatened species. They're finicky. They need very cold water. Already, another kind of trout that's not native here is eating them, and a warming climate could finish this population off. So this team is moving them from where they are to a higher lake that's less vulnerable to warming. Muhlfeld points to a spot on a map - bull trout territory. MUHLFELD: We're hiking up the six-mile trail to the foot of Logging Lake. JOYCE: There, they've got a 20-foot aluminum boat. They had to hoist it there by helicopter. We'll motor to the head of the lake and spend the night. Tomorrow, we'll capture juvenile fish, put them in special oxygenated backpacks and haul them up a mountain trail. MUHLFELD: About two-and-a-half miles to Grace Lake, which is above a waterfall where we think they're going to do really well under future climate change. JOYCE: Biologist Chris Downs from the National Park Service hands me a sidearm, a can of bear spray. CHRIS DOWNS: You want to carry it in front of you. You want to be familiar with how to use it when the bear's approaching. And this one just simply fits loosely in its container. JOYCE: I notice he says when the bear is approaching, not if. We hike for two hours - no bear, just bear scat. It's mostly uphill. I guess we're about four miles up into the backcountry, still hiking up to where we're supposed to get the boat and cross the lake. Another hour, and we reach the boat. We load our gear and motor off. I ask Downs if people think he's crazy to literally carry fish up a mountain to what they think will be a climate refuge. DOWNS: You know, it raised some eyebrows, sort of meddling in a - in nature and a wilderness perspective, but it wasn't like it was something other folks thought was completely outrageous. JOYCE: Last year was the first time they tried this. The captured 125 bull trout and moved them to the upper lake. This year, they don't know what to expect. Already, these lakes and streams are getting warmer. DOWNS: I mean, the time to act is now. I mean, we might be looking back on this in 25 or 50 years and say once again that we wished we'd done something when we had a chance. JOYCE: At dusk, we reach a cabin built in the 1930s. Grizzlies have scraped hunks out of the cabin logs with their claws. We eat dinner al fresco and collapse for the night. Next morning, we assemble our gear. We're going electro fishing in nearby streams. MUHLFELD: So we've got how many batteries over there? JOYCE: One person wears a backpack that generates electricity through a six-foot metal pole. When he pokes the pole in the water, it briefly paralyzes juvenile trout so we can scoop them up with a net. The terrain, though, is horrible. Fallen trees block the streams. Alder thickets and spiny devil's club bushes line the banks. It's sweltering in chest-high rubber waders. The electro-fishing backpack beeps annoyingly, but it works. Fish wriggle out from under rocks and tree roots. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Oh, yeah. Look at that. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: What do we got there? What do we got? Oh. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: No. That looked like a bully. JOYCE: We catch lots of fish, but they're the wrong kind - cutthroats and sculpins. MUHLFELD: There's one right there. There's one. JOYCE: Nope - another false alarm. In fact, for hours, not a single bull trout. Muhlfeld tries to be positive. MUHLFELD: This is a grand experiment, you know? We're hoping it works. We think it will. JOYCE: But it looks like the bull trout are just gone. MUHLFELD: It just goes to show you how quickly things can change. JOYCE: Then, a shout. DOWNS: Yeah, all right. JOYCE: Yeah. What'd you get? DOWNS: We got a bull trout. Look at that beauty. MUHLFELD: We got a survivor. DOWNS: Gorgeous. JOYCE: It's five inches long, blunt-headed and olive green. It swims in a plastic bag of water looking perplexed. Now the race is on to get the trout to the upper lake. Too long in the bag and it will asphyxiate, so Downs pumps oxygen into the bag from a small cylinder. Then the bag goes into a backpack, and we're off up the trail to Grace Lake, bull trout Shangri-la, a place with plenty of insects the trout can eat and relatively free of predators that would eat it. Muhlfeld bolts ahead. When he's not biologizing, he's a professional mountain biker whose nickname is The Lung. An hour later, we reach the lake - clear water, no people and isolated from everything downstream by a 40-foot waterfall. Muhlfeld eases the plastic bag from the backpack and opens it. MUHLFELD: All right. JOYCE: I say, that fish traveled first class. MUHLFELD: All this for one fish, but we're saving a species one fish at a time. Well, live long and prosper, young bully. JOYCE: The trout hangs in the lake water for a moment, then slowly swims off - success. But I have to wonder, what's the big deal about bull trout? Why this Herculean effort? Well, for one thing, it's the most threatened native trout in these waters, and Downs says every species you lose makes the whole family more vulnerable to everything from disease to temperature change. But for Muhlfeld, it's really about helping a survivor. MUHLFELD: The bull trout represents thousands of years of adapting to a changing climate - droughts, floods, wildfire, glaciation - a native fish that has survived those kind of cataclysmic occurrences throughout geologic time. JOYCE: Helping an ancient fish survive a man-made threat, he says, is worth a role of the ecological dice. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

We're going electro fishing in nearby streams. MUHLFELD: So we've got how many batteries over there? JOYCE: One person wears a backpack that generates electricity through a six-foot metal pole. When he pokes the pole in the water, it briefly paralyzes juvenile trout so we can scoop them up with a net. The terrain, though, is horrible. Fallen trees block the streams. Alder thickets and spiny devil's club bushes line the banks. It's sweltering in chest-high rubber waders. The electro-fishing backpack beeps annoyingly, but it works. Fish wriggle out from under rocks and tree roots. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Oh, yeah. Look at that. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: What do we got there? What do we got? Oh. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: No. That looked like a bully. JOYCE: We catch lots of fish, but they're the wrong kind - cutthroats and sculpins. MUHLFELD: There's one right there. There's one. JOYCE: Nope - another false alarm. In fact, for hours, not a single bull trout. Muhlfeld tries to be positive. MUHLFELD: This is a grand experiment, you know? We're hoping it works. We think it will. JOYCE: But it looks like the bull trout are just gone. MUHLFELD: It just goes to show you how quickly things can change. JOYCE: Then, a shout. DOWNS: Yeah, all right. JOYCE: Yeah. What'd you get? DOWNS: We got a bull trout. Look at that beauty. MUHLFELD: We got a survivor. DOWNS: Gorgeous. JOYCE: It's five inches long, blunt-headed and olive green. It swims in a plastic bag of water looking perplexed. Now the race is on to get the trout to the upper lake. Too long in the bag and it will asphyxiate, so Downs pumps oxygen into the bag from a small cylinder. Then the bag goes into a backpack, and we're off up the trail to Grace Lake, bull trout Shangri-la, a place with plenty of insects the trout can eat and relatively free of predators that would eat it. Muhlfeld bolts ahead. When he's not biologizing, he's a professional mountain biker whose nickname is The Lung. An hour later, we reach the lake - clear water, no people and isolated from everything downstream by a 40-foot waterfall. Muhlfeld eases the plastic bag from the backpack and opens it. MUHLFELD: All right. JOYCE: I say, that fish traveled first class. MUHLFELD: All this for one fish, but we're saving a species one fish at a time. Well, live long and prosper, young bully. JOYCE: The trout hangs in the lake water for a moment, then slowly swims off - success. But I have to wonder, what's the big deal about bull trout? Why this Herculean effort? Well, for one thing, it's the most threatened native trout in these waters, and Downs says every species you lose makes the whole family more vulnerable to everything from disease to temperature change. But for Muhlfeld, it's really about helping a survivor. MUHLFELD: The bull trout represents thousands of years of adapting to a changing climate - droughts, floods, wildfire, glaciation - a native fish that has survived those kind of cataclysmic occurrences throughout geologic time. JOYCE: Helping an ancient fish survive a man-made threat, he says, is worth a role of the ecological dice.

But Jim Beasley of the Warnell School of Forestry at the University of Georgia has just published a paper about the wildlife that now teems in and around Chernobyl, nearly 30 years after the nuclear accident there. The area's been vacant and abandoned since 31 people died in the catastrophe and cleanup. Jim Beasley joins us now. Thanks very much for being with us. JIM BEASLEY: My pleasure. SIMON: So what animals would we see? BEASLEY: So our study specifically looked at mid- to large-sized mammals so everything from hare, or rabbit-sized animals, wild boar, moose up to apex predators, like wolves. SIMON: And forgive me if this sounds flip, but do they - I mean, do they have two heads? Did they glow in the dark? BEASLEY: (Laughter) No, certainly not. Of all the animals that I've seen there, they've all looked very healthy. SIMON: Does this mean human beings could return and be healthy? BEASLEY: I think our data don't really lend themselves to addressing that specific question for a number of reasons. Humans are much more long-lived than wild animals, so I would be cautious to extrapolate those findings to humans. SIMON: How do you explain that this area, that I think most of us consider to be a wasteland, has so much wildlife? BEASLEY: It was well-established that when you create large reserves and protect wildlife from everyday human activities, wildlife, generally, tend to thrive. So our study did not look at any specific health effects of animals. I think that's important to note. But what our study does suggest is that even if there are potential, subtle genetic effects, those effects are greatly overshadowed by the impacts humans have on the environment. SIMON: So whatever lingering dangers there may or may not be, the animals in the area are thriving because we're not around - human beings. BEASLEY: Yes, exactly. SIMON: Mr. Beasley, would it be dangerous to hunt these animals for food? BEASLEY: So the European economic commission has come up with levels that they deem appropriate for human consumption. Most of the animals that I've seen do exceed that, and some greatly exceed that. So the animals there still are very contaminated, so they would not be appropriate for eating. SIMON: Could there be tourism? BEASLEY: My understanding is that there is some tourism now in the Ukraine side of the zone. So the exclusion zone, it's 30 kilometers zone, and roughly half of that is in Belarus. And roughly half is in Ukraine. And my understanding is there is some activity, or much more activity, in Ukraine, whereas there is much less in Belarus. SIMON: Would there be some concern if these animals began to migrate out of that zone? BEASLEY: I wouldn't be overly concerned about any potential effects to surrounding populations. Where there could be some potential issues would be in terms of human-wildlife conflicts. So wild boar cause agricultural damage. Anywhere you have wolves and livestock, there's the potential for conflicts. But all these are manageable conflicts, and the benefit of having large populations in an area, in general, greatly exceed the costs of those more localized incidents.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)ROB STEIN, BYLINE: A lot of people probably know this character from the cartoon \"Peanuts. \"(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"HAPPINESS IS A WARM BLANKET, CHARLIE BROWN\")CIARA BRAVO: (As Patty) Pigpen, you're a disgrace. STEIN: Pigpen's the little kid who walks around in a cloud of dirt, whose friends, like Violet, are always giving him grief. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"HAPPINESS IS A WARM BLANKET, CHARLIE BROWN\")SHANE BAUMEL: (As Pigpen) What's the matter? BLESST BOWDEN: (As Violet) What's the matter, he asks. You're a mess when you eat, a mess when you play and a mess when you're just standing still. JAMES MEADOW: Yeah, it turns out that that kid is all of us. STEIN: James Meadow led the new research at the University of Oregon. MEADOW: It's just a microscopic, invisible cloud that's really hard to see. STEIN: Because our clouds aren't dirt, they're microscopic bacteria and other organisms. You see, we all carry around millions of microorganisms - bacteria, fungi, viruses. Most of them aren't dangerous. In fact, they help us in lots of ways. Scientists call this our microbiome. MEADOW: A lot of recent work on the human microbiome has revealed that we're kind of spilling our microbiome all over our houses and our offices and the people around us. STEIN: By touching them, sharing objects, beds. But Meadow and his colleagues wanted to see if we're also spewing our microbial companions into the air around us. So they studied the air around 11 volunteers as they sat alone, one by one, in a special sealed booth for four hours. MEADOW: And the results really surprised us. STEIN: Not only could they clearly detect plumes containing thousands of different types of bacteria, they could tell all sorts of things from the clouds, like whether they came from a man or a woman. And they realized each person's cloud is sort of like a fingerprint. MEADOW: We each give off a slightly different cocktail of those bacteria. There's just really subtle differences, and you can tell that different people give off a slightly different cocktail. We could actually tell people apart. STEIN: Meadow says this raises all kinds of possibilities, like someday maybe being able to identify a murder suspect by reading the microbial cloud he or she left behind at the scene of a crime. MEADOW: You know, there's a lot of reasons why we might want to know if some nefarious character's been in the certain room in the last few hours, and maybe there's a way to use microbes for that. STEIN: Other scientists agree. Rob Knight studies the microbiome at the University of California, San Diego. ROB KNIGHT: What's exciting about this is, in addition to showing that we leave microbes behind on surfaces we touch, this also shows that we release our personal microbes into the air of the spaces that we inhabit. STEIN: The research could also explain how we get our microbes in the first place. KNIGHT: We know that if you live with people, and even if you just work with people, your microbial community has come to resemble theirs. And in the past, we mostly thought that that was due to touch. It may be just that you're releasing microbes into the air and some of those microbes are colonizing the people you're with.

Glasses can fix the problem for small children, but after a certain age, that messed-up wiring can't be reset. But there's potentially good news. Two scientists think they're on the way to a cure. And it all started when one of them, Ben Backus, a professor at SUNY College of Optometry in Manhattan, heard about an experiment with animals. BEN BACKUS: When you take an adult animal and put it into complete darkness for three to 10 days, its visual system becomes plastic. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Plastic is science speak for able to be changed. So Backus came up with an idea, to put adults with amblyopia in complete darkness. That darkness, he hoped, would act like a reset button for the adult brain, just like it had for the animals. Now, Backus knew before he could ask random volunteers to endure five days of complete darkness, he'd have to prove it was safe. So, all in the name of science, he decided that he was going to be the first subject of his experiment. He completely blacked out one room in his apartment. Then he thought, hey, I'm probably not going to want to do this alone. He needed a partner. So imagine the callout - scientist seeks same for experiment in dark room isolation. It doesn't sound like it would have a lot of takers, right? But he found one. Morgan Williams, at the time, a psychology undergrad, volunteered to give up his 2012 spring break.

We won't serve alcohol. I had a glass of wine and I ended up in a closet instead of the bathroom. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And after five days of complete darkness, they were reintroduced to the world. BACKUS: The main initial thing was we were extremely sensitive to light. And so we had to wear dark glasses. Colors were intense. Everything was like you had turned the sharp knob way up in Photoshop or something. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Their eyesight did get back to normal and now they're ready to try the experiment with real, live volunteers. They're recruiting right now. They need adults with amblyopia, brave ones. BACKUS: The best analogy we could think of was really an astronaut who has to go on a mission and maybe they're 10 days in space.

A good teacher tends to be well- trained and well-informed. Turns out, though, it might help kids just to have a teacher they like. NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam has come across some research suggesting that. He sat down with our colleague Steve Inskeep. STEVE INSKEEP, BYLINE: Hi, Shankar. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: What's the research say? VEDANTAM: Well, this is a study from Germany, Steve, and it measures how well and how quickly kindergartners solve pattern recognition problems. So things like here are a whole set of pictures, can you identify all the pairs that are clustered among the apples? Here's the catch. The researchers at the University of Vienna and the Technical University of Dresden displayed a series of pictures to some of the students. The pictures were shown very fast and in some cases, the photograph was of the kindergartner's own teacher. INSKEEP: Subliminal messaging. There's a picture of the teacher and then go on again, OK. VEDANTAM: Exactly, so the images are presented so fast, the child is actual not processing that this is a photograph of his or her teacher. But the researchers find that kindergarteners subliminally seeing pictures of teachers whom they like solve problems faster than kindergartners who don't see pictures of the teachers they like. INSKEEP: Wow, what's going on here? VEDANTAM: Well, I think the study points to the idea that, I think, the relationships between students and teachers can actually make a big difference in the performance of students. When you're confronting something difficult, a challenge, it really helps to know that you have a sympathetic figure at the back of your mind. INSKEEP: I'm thinking about why that would be in the mind of a kindergarten kid. The kid might feel more comforted, might feel more secure, might feel more focused - any number of things that would have nothing to do with actual teaching technique of the teacher. VEDANTAM: Yeah, I think that's right, Steve. And, again, I think at one level, this is sort of obvious. I think we all know that relationships between students and teachers matter. But when we talk about education policy and reform, we often start by talking about what's in the curriculum and what's in the textbook instead of focusing on the relationship between student and teacher because that's where learning might actually begin. INSKEEP: Focus on whether the teacher is really engaged with a particular student. VEDANTAM: Exactly right, Steve. INSKEEP: Shankar, thanks very much. VEDANTAM: Thank you.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Kirstie Paul and another student from England had just arrived at Logan Airport. They were about to embark on a new adventure, living in a new city, working with a very important Harvard professor. PAUL: We stepped off the plane, still a little bit jetlagged, very disorientated, going up to this prestigious academic institute that's famous all over the world. VEDANTAM: Kirstie could think of only one thing to keep her nervousness in check. She had corresponded with a graduate student, Maureen Brinkworth, and Maureen was to be her supervisor and her mentor. Maureen was also going to be Kirstie's lifeline, someone who would help her navigate not just the halls of Harvard but the streets of Boston. PAUL: So we stumble to the place where she said she was going to be. So she said she would be in Harvard Square opposite a certain restaurant. And so we find it, and then, we see her, and we're just so nervous, but she just - Maureen just had this massive big smile, and she just kind of put you at ease straightaway. And she was like, I'm so excited to meet you. You know, welcome, like - and then, she took us around. . . VEDANTAM: And with that, the ice was broken. Over the next few months, Maureen became more than a mentor to Kirstie. She became her friend. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: But there was something else that was interesting here. This kind of friendship between student and teacher was also the subject of the research that Kirstie and Maureen were conducting along with Harvard professor Hunter Gehlbach. This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. In this episode, we're going to talk about the relationships between students and mentors. The bond that Maureen and Kirstie developed made a huge difference in Kirstie's life. Now I can relate to this. I've had wonderful mentors and teachers, and I know what a difference a great teacher can make. But what about all those students and teachers who don't have that connection? Today, we're going to tell you about new research that shows that when you don't have that natural spark of chemistry, closed relationships between teachers and students can be engineered. And when you do this, it has an incredible positive effect. Stay with us to find out what Maureen, Hunter and Kirstie learned together.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)HUNTER GEHLBACH: One lovely autumn day, I was biking along with my daughter and a friend of hers in the bike trailer, and my wife and I had had these sort of ongoing conversations - my daughter's about 3 at this point - wondering, you know, what actually goes into friendship at age 3? Why has my daughter taken a particular shine to this girl as opposed to some other kid in the class? VEDANTAM: That's Hunter Gehlbach, Maureen and Kirstie's professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. GEHLBACH: And as I'm biking along, I feel like I have figured out the answer to this question because I hear the following conversation. So my daughter says, I like ice cream. The friend says. . . UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: I like ice cream. GEHLBACH: My daughter says. . . UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: I like blueberries. GEHLBACH: The friend says. . . UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: Me, too. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: I like chocolate ice cream. GEHLBACH: You can kind of see where this is going. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: I like chocolate ice cream, too. GEHLBACH: The friend at this point says. . . UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: I have a dog. I like my dog. GEHLBACH: Now it actually gets sort of interesting. So ever since age 2, my daughter's been petrified of dogs since there was this little pug that jumped up on her and knocked her over. So my daughter kind of shifts the category from dog to pets. And so she replies. . . UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: I have a pet frog. I like my frog. GEHLBACH: The friend continues. . . UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: I don't like pizza. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: I don't like pizza. GEHLBACH: So now she's just plain lying. The friend says. . . UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: I don't like blueberries. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: I don't like blueberries any more, either. GEHLBACH: So anyway, the point being, as I'm huffing and puffing on the bike, it seems like what goes into friendships or relationships - and obviously, I'm oversimplifying a little bit - is that they have stuff in common. So they go through all these crazy machinations to establish that they are similar to each other in all these, you know, what would seem like kind of superficial ways. VEDANTAM: Hunter realized that the conversation he had overheard had bigger implications than just friendships between 3-year-olds. GEHLBACH: Yeah, so let's back up a little bit. So I had had a sort of primary research interest for a long, long time in looking at social perspective taking. So how do teachers and students, in particular, kind of figure out what each other's thinking and feeling? And so I had a graduate student, who is someone I worked with very closely for a long, long time, Maureen Brinkworth, who was really interested in teacher-student relationships. And so this seemed like a really natural combination to look at this sort of how do we do this everyday mind reading and how are students and teachers doing this with each other in the classroom and how good are their relationships. VEDANTAM: For the experiment he had in mind, Hunter created a survey for students and teachers of a ninth-grade class. The questionnaire attempted to pinpoint things that teachers and students had in common. The researchers were looking for all kinds of connections. They asked a range of questions. GEHLBACH: Classroom relevant stuff to outside the classroom stuff, personal to subject matter-related sorts of things, several of them kind of speak to people's values. So it was a pretty broad cross section. VEDANTAM: The researcher selectively shared examples with the teachers and students that suggested they both had things in common. So a teacher who felt she had nothing in common with a student might discover they both had the same sense of humor. Or a student who felt like his teacher was from Mars might discover they both like football. When Hunter examined the scores of students who had been induced to see that they had things in common with their teachers, he found something astonishing. The relationships between teachers and students got stronger, and as they did, students, especially minorities, suddenly started to perform better in class. GEHLBACH: Then, when we look at academic achievement with respect to these black and Latino students, what we find is that when they're in the treatment group, their grades go up by about . 4 of a letter grade, which translates into over 60 percent plus reduction in the achievement gap at this school. VEDANTAM: That's right. This simple intervention closed 60 percent of the achievement gap. Educators had been struggling for decades to find ways to close this gap because it's one of the most persistent and disturbing disparities in American education. Now I don't want to imply that this one intervention can fix the whole problem. Hunter's experiment is going to have to be replicated at other schools with other students and other teachers. But I think the idea is really promising. It's inexpensive, it's easy, and it builds on top of a mountain of other research that finds strong relationships between students and teachers make a difference. I asked Hunter why black and Latinos might benefit the most from this kind of intervention. GEHLBACH: So it's a hugely important question. I think my best guess at this point is that when teachers - and, you know, for the most part, these are quite European-American teachers - they walk into the classroom, they may not perceive that they would necessarily have much in common with the black and Latino students. You know, that may have implications for how they then end up teaching in the classroom. But as soon as we give them this little anchor and say, hey, you know what, you guys have this in common, or you really feel similarly around this, you share these values, it gives them a hook or an entry point to connect with these students in a productive way as they might have, you know, kind of figured out or done on their own with the white and Asian students. VEDANTAM: There was one twist in the research that Hunter had not anticipated. Students clearly did better academically when their relationships with teachers was strengthened. But when Hunter asked students about whether those relationships were stronger, the students mostly shrugged. GEHLBACH: And, you know, I'll be honest. I was kind of annoyed that the students didn't feel closer to their teachers as the result of, you know, this intervention that I had put together just for them. VEDANTAM: In many ways, it was almost as if strengthening the relationships made a bigger difference to teachers than it did to students. GEHLBACH: And I think, you know, with these sort of connections between teachers and students, there's a default to thinking about how important this is for the students and what they get out of it. But for the teachers or the mentors, you know, I think there's a lot in it, too, and I think one of the biggest things I got from my relationship with Maureen. . . VEDANTAM: Remember Maureen? That's the woman we told you about earlier in this episode. She helped Hunter conceive the project, she helped design the questionnaires for the ninth-grade students, and the bond she formed with Hunter and with new research assistant, such as Kirstie Paul, informed the entire direction of the project. But as the research was wrapping up and getting ready to be published, Maureen's own relationship with the entire research team was changing because of a personal tragedy that was unfolding in her own life. GEHLBACH: I believe it was shortly after her 30th birthday that she got the initial cancer diagnosis. VEDANTAM: Hunter says that Maureen's strength in the face of this tragedy had a profound effect on him. GEHLBACH: You know, the level of optimism that she maintained was just, you know, something that I think I will forever strive to emulate and to keep in perspective, that when things are going that poorly in life, you can make a really big difference to other people through your attitude. PAUL: I sent her a letter. VEDANTAM: That's Kirstie again, the student who Maureen mentored. PAUL: I just kind of wrote down every good memory I have of her and just like everything that made me smile about her and how I was so thankful to have had her in my life. VEDANTAM: Maureen made a significant and positive impact on the research, on the students she mentored, and on her teacher. What I found very powerful is that Maureen's story and her relationship with Hunter and Kirstie and the research they conducted with the ninth-grade students all point to the same thing. The relationship between students and teachers is not incidental to how education works. It's central. We were sad to learn that Maureen died in 2014. She passed away just as the research she worked on with Hunter and Kirstie was being published. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Coming up, we're going to change gears.

DANIEL PINK, BYLINE: And I'm Daniel Pink. VEDANTAM: Dan is our Stopwatch Science correspondent. He's also the author of several books about human behavior. On Stopwatch Science, Dan and I give one another 60 seconds to summarize interesting ideas from social science research. I'll run a stopwatch as Dan speaks, and here's the buzzer Dan's going to hear if he hits up against his deadline. (APPLAUSE)PINK: OK. VEDANTAM: All right, that's the sound of applause because Dan Pink never hits up against his deadline. PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: Dan, what's the sound of my buzzer? PINK: You're going to hear a little throwback sound. It's kind of like a 1970s clock radio buzzer. Take a listen. (SOUNDBITE OF BUZZER)VEDANTAM: All right, I love it. As we've just heard, the ties between teachers and students and the beliefs that teachers and students have about one another can make a big difference in the classroom. On today's edition of Stopwatch Science, we stick with this theme with ideas related to the effects that teachers have on students. Dan, if you are ready, your first 60 seconds starts now. PINK: Well, this is a 2014 study that you actually talked about a while back on Morning Edition, Shankar. It comes from friend of the show, Katy Milkman. I - and here's what she did. She looked at 6,500 professors in 89 disciplines. She sent emails to these professors from fictitious students, asking, can I meet with you to discuss research opportunities? Now the student names were randomly assigned, so half were men, and half were women. And they also signaled ethnicity and race. So some of the students it signaled, I'm African-American, Hispanic, Indian, Chinese. Did that make a difference in whether the professor responded? And unfortunately, it did. Surprise, surprise, white males got way more responses. But here's the interesting thing. It was actually more likely to happen at private institutions than public ones and in higher-paying disciplines like engineering rather than comparative literature. And here's the other thing that I found surprising. It didn't matter whether the professor herself was a woman or a man. (APPLAUSE)PINK: It was across the board. VEDANTAM: I find this so interesting, Dan, because, of course, there's all this other work that suggests that these unconscious biases of the professors had are really held by everyone. And I think studies like this suggest that we all need to be aware of how these biases operate in our lives. PINK: Absolutely. Shankar, let's see what you have. Your one minute starts right now. VEDANTAM: There has been a lot of debate in this country about test scores. If you can get teachers who boost the test scores of students, does this really tell you anything meaningful about the long-term prospects of students, or are these merely teachers who know how to teach to the test? In a recent analysis of more than a million children in a large, urban school district, the researchers Raj Chetty and John Friedman at Harvard and Jonah Rockoff at Columbia University find the answer is yes. It makes a huge difference. Chetty and his colleagues find that teachers who have a good track record of improving student test scores have long-term effects on those students' lives. Students are significantly more likely to attend college, to earn more money as young adult, and to live in better neighborhoods. The difference between having a mediocre teacher and one of the better teachers is actually enormous. Chetty and his colleagues find that having such a teacher can change your lifetime earnings earnings by $39,000. And here's the part that's amazing about that statistic, Dan, this is the effect of having one great teacher in one grade in school, one grade, one teacher, $39,000. (SOUNDBITE OF BUZZER)VEDANTAM: Think about the effect of having several great teachers throughout your schooling years. PINK: Well, that's something we - always intuitive, but now there's some pretty good data to back that up. VEDANTAM: I agree, Dan. So let's get to your second study. Your next 60 seconds starts right now. PINK: We've talked about students and teachers. Let's bring a third party into the conversation - parents. We know that parents matter. How can we get parents to matter more? Great study out of Brown and Harvard about a summer program where kids who had failed courses were trying to get credits so they could pass. The researchers organized the parents into three groups. One group was the control group. Nothing happened to them. One group of parents got a weekly email or text message that had positive information about their student. Jon was an active participant in class all week. Good job. The other third of parents got what was called an improvement message, so Tina missed two homework assignments this week. I know she can do better. Now, of the families who got messages, those kids did dramatically better. VEDANTAM: Wow. PINK: They were 41 percent less likely to fail again. VEDANTAM: Wow. PINK: And what was really interesting is that the messages about improvement were far more effective than the messages that just conveyed positive information. VEDANTAM: Wow, that's really interesting, Dan. The idea, of course that positive affirmation can make a big difference to people has been shown in so many other fields as well. PINK: Yeah. I think the other thing that's cool about this is that this is an incredibly, incredibly cheap intervention, a text message every week. Not a parent-teacher conference, not any kind of big intervention. And I think what it shows is that if we really want to improve the education system, there are some light touch, small wings that we can get that make a huge difference. VEDANTAM: I love it, Dan. PINK: So let's go to yours, Shankar. You've got one minute. It starts now. VEDANTAM: When you think about what teachers communicate to students, Dan, in classrooms, we often think about facts and theories and explanations. We think about information. But some of the most important things that teachers communicate to students actually happens unconsciously. It's the expectations that a teacher communicates about whether a student is going to succeed. And now these expectations are enormously powerful in shaping not just how the student behaves, but how the teacher then interacts with the student. In a study of elementary school-age children in Michigan - it was published in the Merrill-Palmer Quarterly in 2014, Jacquelynne Eccles and Katja Upadyaya find that teachers beliefs about the potential of children was a very strong predictor of the children's math test scores throughout elementary school. Now, obviously, some of the teacher's beliefs are undoubtedly shaped by how these children are actually performing in the classroom, so beliefs don't just come out of thin air. But the insidious thing about this study and other studies, Dan, is that teachers' beliefs and students' behavior are a chicken-and-egg kind of thing. It isn't just the children's behavior that shapes the beliefs of their teachers. As we saw in the research by Hunter Gehlbach. . . (SOUNDBITE OF BUZZER)VEDANTAM: . . . The beliefs of the teachers also shapes the behavior of the children. PINK: Go in with high expectations, you'll probably get good results. VEDANTAM: That's exactly right, Dan. This has been another edition of Stopwatch Science. I'm Shankar Vedantam. PINK: And I'm Daniel Pink.

And so I had a graduate student, who is someone I worked with very closely for a long, long time, Maureen Brinkworth, who was really interested in teacher-student relationships. And so this seemed like a really natural combination to look at this sort of how do we do this everyday mind reading and how are students and teachers doing this with each other in the classroom and how good are their relationships. VEDANTAM: For the experiment he had in mind, Hunter created a survey for students and teachers of a ninth-grade class. The questionnaire attempted to pinpoint things that teachers and students had in common. The researchers were looking for all kinds of connections. They asked a range of questions. GEHLBACH: Classroom relevant stuff to outside the classroom stuff, personal to subject matter-related sorts of things, several of them kind of speak to people's values. So it was a pretty broad cross section. VEDANTAM: The researcher selectively shared examples with the teachers and students that suggested they both had things in common. So a teacher who felt she had nothing in common with a student might discover they both had the same sense of humor. Or a student who felt like his teacher was from Mars might discover they both like football. When Hunter examined the scores of students who had been induced to see that they had things in common with their teachers, he found something astonishing. The relationships between teachers and students got stronger, and as they did, students, especially minorities, suddenly started to perform better in class. GEHLBACH: Then, when we look at academic achievement with respect to these black and Latino students, what we find is that when they're in the treatment group, their grades go up by about . 4 of a letter grade, which translates into over 60 percent plus reduction in the achievement gap at this school. VEDANTAM: That's right. This simple intervention closed 60 percent of the achievement gap. Educators had been struggling for decades to find ways to close this gap because it's one of the most persistent and disturbing disparities in American education. Now I don't want to imply that this one intervention can fix the whole problem. Hunter's experiment is going to have to be replicated at other schools with other students and other teachers. But I think the idea is really promising. It's inexpensive, it's easy, and it builds on top of a mountain of other research that finds strong relationships between students and teachers make a difference. I asked Hunter why black and Latinos might benefit the most from this kind of intervention. GEHLBACH: So it's a hugely important question. I think my best guess at this point is that when teachers - and, you know, for the most part, these are quite European-American teachers - they walk into the classroom, they may not perceive that they would necessarily have much in common with the black and Latino students. You know, that may have implications for how they then end up teaching in the classroom. But as soon as we give them this little anchor and say, hey, you know what, you guys have this in common, or you really feel similarly around this, you share these values, it gives them a hook or an entry point to connect with these students in a productive way as they might have, you know, kind of figured out or done on their own with the white and Asian students. VEDANTAM: There was one twist in the research that Hunter had not anticipated. Students clearly did better academically when their relationships with teachers was strengthened. But when Hunter asked students about whether those relationships were stronger, the students mostly shrugged. GEHLBACH: And, you know, I'll be honest. I was kind of annoyed that the students didn't feel closer to their teachers as the result of, you know, this intervention that I had put together just for them. VEDANTAM: In many ways, it was almost as if strengthening the relationships made a bigger difference to teachers than it did to students. GEHLBACH: And I think, you know, with these sort of connections between teachers and students, there's a default to thinking about how important this is for the students and what they get out of it. But for the teachers or the mentors, you know, I think there's a lot in it, too, and I think one of the biggest things I got from my relationship with Maureen. . . VEDANTAM: Remember Maureen? That's the woman we told you about earlier in this episode. She helped Hunter conceive the project, she helped design the questionnaires for the ninth-grade students, and the bond she formed with Hunter and with new research assistant, such as Kirstie Paul, informed the entire direction of the project. But as the research was wrapping up and getting ready to be published, Maureen's own relationship with the entire research team was changing because of a personal tragedy that was unfolding in her own life. GEHLBACH: I believe it was shortly after her 30th birthday that she got the initial cancer diagnosis. VEDANTAM: Hunter says that Maureen's strength in the face of this tragedy had a profound effect on him. GEHLBACH: You know, the level of optimism that she maintained was just, you know, something that I think I will forever strive to emulate and to keep in perspective, that when things are going that poorly in life, you can make a really big difference to other people through your attitude. PAUL: I sent her a letter. VEDANTAM: That's Kirstie again, the student who Maureen mentored. PAUL: I just kind of wrote down every good memory I have of her and just like everything that made me smile about her and how I was so thankful to have had her in my life. VEDANTAM: Maureen made a significant and positive impact on the research, on the students she mentored, and on her teacher. What I found very powerful is that Maureen's story and her relationship with Hunter and Kirstie and the research they conducted with the ninth-grade students all point to the same thing. The relationship between students and teachers is not incidental to how education works. It's central. We were sad to learn that Maureen died in 2014. She passed away just as the research she worked on with Hunter and Kirstie was being published. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Coming up, we're going to change gears.

DANIEL PINK, BYLINE: And I'm Daniel Pink. VEDANTAM: Dan is our Stopwatch Science correspondent. He's also the author of several books about human behavior. On Stopwatch Science, Dan and I give one another 60 seconds to summarize interesting ideas from social science research. I'll run a stopwatch as Dan speaks, and here's the buzzer Dan's going to hear if he hits up against his deadline. (APPLAUSE) PINK: OK. VEDANTAM: All right, that's the sound of applause because Dan Pink never hits up against his deadline. PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: Dan, what's the sound of my buzzer? PINK: You're going to hear a little throwback sound. It's kind of like a 1970s clock radio buzzer. Take a listen. (SOUNDBITE OF BUZZER) VEDANTAM: All right, I love it. As we've just heard, the ties between teachers and students and the beliefs that teachers and students have about one another can make a big difference in the classroom. On today's edition of Stopwatch Science, we stick with this theme with ideas related to the effects that teachers have on students. Dan, if you are ready, your first 60 seconds starts now. PINK: Well, this is a 2014 study that you actually talked about a while back on Morning Edition, Shankar. It comes from friend of the show, Katy Milkman. I - and here's what she did. She looked at 6,500 professors in 89 disciplines. She sent emails to these professors from fictitious students, asking, can I meet with you to discuss research opportunities? Now the student names were randomly assigned, so half were men, and half were women. And they also signaled ethnicity and race. So some of the students it signaled, I'm African-American, Hispanic, Indian, Chinese. Did that make a difference in whether the professor responded? And unfortunately, it did. Surprise, surprise, white males got way more responses. But here's the interesting thing. It was actually more likely to happen at private institutions than public ones and in higher-paying disciplines like engineering rather than comparative literature. And here's the other thing that I found surprising. It didn't matter whether the professor herself was a woman or a man. (APPLAUSE) PINK: It was across the board. VEDANTAM: I find this so interesting, Dan, because, of course, there's all this other work that suggests that these unconscious biases of the professors had are really held by everyone. And I think studies like this suggest that we all need to be aware of how these biases operate in our lives. PINK: Absolutely. Shankar, let's see what you have. Your one minute starts right now. VEDANTAM: There has been a lot of debate in this country about test scores. If you can get teachers who boost the test scores of students, does this really tell you anything meaningful about the long-term prospects of students, or are these merely teachers who know how to teach to the test? In a recent analysis of more than a million children in a large, urban school district, the researchers Raj Chetty and John Friedman at Harvard and Jonah Rockoff at Columbia University find the answer is yes. It makes a huge difference. Chetty and his colleagues find that teachers who have a good track record of improving student test scores have long-term effects on those students' lives. Students are significantly more likely to attend college, to earn more money as young adult, and to live in better neighborhoods. The difference between having a mediocre teacher and one of the better teachers is actually enormous. Chetty and his colleagues find that having such a teacher can change your lifetime earnings earnings by $39,000. And here's the part that's amazing about that statistic, Dan, this is the effect of having one great teacher in one grade in school, one grade, one teacher, $39,000. (SOUNDBITE OF BUZZER) VEDANTAM: Think about the effect of having several great teachers throughout your schooling years. PINK: Well, that's something we - always intuitive, but now there's some pretty good data to back that up. VEDANTAM: I agree, Dan. So let's get to your second study. Your next 60 seconds starts right now. PINK: We've talked about students and teachers. Let's bring a third party into the conversation - parents. We know that parents matter. How can we get parents to matter more? Great study out of Brown and Harvard about a summer program where kids who had failed courses were trying to get credits so they could pass. The researchers organized the parents into three groups. One group was the control group. Nothing happened to them. One group of parents got a weekly email or text message that had positive information about their student. Jon was an active participant in class all week. Good job. The other third of parents got what was called an improvement message, so Tina missed two homework assignments this week. I know she can do better. Now, of the families who got messages, those kids did dramatically better. VEDANTAM: Wow. PINK: They were 41 percent less likely to fail again. VEDANTAM: Wow. PINK: And what was really interesting is that the messages about improvement were far more effective than the messages that just conveyed positive information. VEDANTAM: Wow, that's really interesting, Dan. The idea, of course that positive affirmation can make a big difference to people has been shown in so many other fields as well. PINK: Yeah. I think the other thing that's cool about this is that this is an incredibly, incredibly cheap intervention, a text message every week. Not a parent-teacher conference, not any kind of big intervention. And I think what it shows is that if we really want to improve the education system, there are some light touch, small wings that we can get that make a huge difference. VEDANTAM: I love it, Dan. PINK: So let's go to yours, Shankar. You've got one minute. It starts now. VEDANTAM: When you think about what teachers communicate to students, Dan, in classrooms, we often think about facts and theories and explanations. We think about information. But some of the most important things that teachers communicate to students actually happens unconsciously. It's the expectations that a teacher communicates about whether a student is going to succeed. And now these expectations are enormously powerful in shaping not just how the student behaves, but how the teacher then interacts with the student. In a study of elementary school-age children in Michigan - it was published in the Merrill-Palmer Quarterly in 2014, Jacquelynne Eccles and Katja Upadyaya find that teachers beliefs about the potential of children was a very strong predictor of the children's math test scores throughout elementary school. Now, obviously, some of the teacher's beliefs are undoubtedly shaped by how these children are actually performing in the classroom, so beliefs don't just come out of thin air. But the insidious thing about this study and other studies, Dan, is that teachers' beliefs and students' behavior are a chicken-and-egg kind of thing. It isn't just the children's behavior that shapes the beliefs of their teachers. As we saw in the research by Hunter Gehlbach. . . (SOUNDBITE OF BUZZER) VEDANTAM: . . . The beliefs of the teachers also shapes the behavior of the children. PINK: Go in with high expectations, you'll probably get good results. VEDANTAM: That's exactly right, Dan. This has been another edition of Stopwatch Science. I'm Shankar Vedantam. PINK: And I'm Daniel Pink.

Now let's talk about paleo sleep. The idea is that all of our modern devices are hurting our ability to sleep. But did people really sleep any better without these devices? NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports on what scientists found when they asked that question. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Jerry Siegel studies sleep at the University of California, Los Angeles. He and his colleagues recently decided to look at how people sleep in three pre-industrial societies. The Tsimane of Bolivia, the San of Namibia and the Hadza of Tanzania. JERRY SIEGEL: We wanted to know if the sleep amount and the sleep pattern selected by a million years of evolution has been disrupted by modern life. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says this is as close as you're going to get to seeing how our ancient ancestors slept. SIEGEL: The Hadza are maybe the purest hunter-gatherer group in the world. They have no food storage. Every day they get up and they hunt or they gather berries or fruit. GREENFIELDBOYCE: You might think that no electric lights means that sunset is bedtime, but no. In the journal Current Biology, the researchers say people stayed up for hours after the sun went down and an average night's sleep was less than seven hours. SIEGEL: If you compare the sleep duration to similar studies done on normal individuals in our society, the amounts we saw in all three groups were at the low end. So they don't sleep more than we do. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Siegel says people in these traditional communities rarely nap, they generally don't wake up in the middle of the night, but they do sleep more in winter. And it turns out that, throughout the year, what really seems to affect sleep patterns is not light but temperature. SIEGEL: So sleep is occurring during the night while temperature is falling, and awakening occurs when the temperature hits its minimum, which is usually before sunrise but sometimes after sunrise. GREENFIELDBOYCE: This has some interesting implications. Siegel says it looks that we evolved to sleep along with this natural cycle of falling and rising temperatures. But if you live in a heated house, that cycle is probably gone. SIEGEL: The loss of this strong stimulus may be as disruptive to our natural sleep as anything to do with electric lights.

It comes from an investigation at the University of California, Berkeley. That investigation found renowned astronomer Geoffrey Marcy violated sexual harassment policies over the course of a decade. Marcy resigned on Wednesday. He's famous for looking for extraterrestrial life and has been described as a possible future Nobel laureate. As NPR's Michaeleen Doucleff reports, this case has triggered a discussion of how common sexual harassment is in science and how little is done to stop it. MICHAELEEN DOUCLEFF, BYLINE: The investigation into Marcy's behavior ended in June. The university kept it private, even from its own faculty. Then Buzzfeed reported the story last week. According to the news site, officials found that Marcy engaged in inappropriate behavior, including unwanted massages, kisses and groping with at least four students from 2001 to 2010. One student was Sarah Ballard. She's now an astronomy postdoc at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but she first met Marcy a decade ago as an undergraduate. He taught her astronomy class and showed special interest in her career. SARAH BALLARD: To have a really renowned scientist praise you and praise your ability you can imagine was immeasurably encouraging to me. DOUCLEFF: Eventually, Marcy and Ballard started meeting at cafes around campus. They talked about astronomy, but sometimes he'd bring up an old girlfriend and talk about having sex with her. Then, one day, Marcy gave Ballard a ride home. He parked the car by her house. BALLARD: The fact that we were in the car together suddenly made me feel so uncomfortable (laughter). I think I kind of realized that the tenor of the mood was really wrong. DOUCLEFF: Ballard opened the car door and turned to leave. BALLARD: He reached over, and he was kind of rubbing - he was rubbing the back of my neck. DOUCLEFF: Ballard left the car. Like many women in science, she was afraid to tell anybody about what happened. KATIE HINDE: Academia has a particular climate which allows sexual harassment, sexual assault and sexual abuses to persist. DOUCLEFF: That's Katie Hinde, a biologist at Arizona State University.

Seventy percent reported experiencing sexual harassment, often from their supervisors. . . HINDE: . . . Who had power over their career, who had power over their research. DOUCLEFF: And that's the big problem. Women can either report the harassment and possibly hurt their careers or try to ignore it, like Ballard did for almost a decade. In fact, most harassment is never reported. Heather Metcalf at the Association for Women in Science says women are often told to keep hush-hush about lewd comments, touching and leering. HEATHER METCALF: And there is a bit of a norm for those behaviors to sort of be brushed off, rather than taken seriously. DOUCLEFF: Just this past summer, a young woman wrote to the prestigious Journal of Science for advice about sexual harassment. METCALF: She was really enjoying the scientific work that she was doing, but she was feeling really uncomfortable because her supervisor - she kept catching him trying to take a peek down her blouse. DOUCLEFF: The magazine column, which has since been retracted, basically advised the woman to turn a blind eye. In Marcy's case, it took years of complaints for the university to investigate him. Then it disciplined him privately. He was told to follow strict behavior guidelines or risk the possibility of dismissal. The university declined an interview with NPR. It said in a statement that this agreement was the fastest way to stop Marcy's misconduct. But then the news got out on Buzzfeed, and scientists got angry. Michael Eisen is a biology professor at Berkeley. MICHAEL EISEN: In essence, the university convicted him.

Under the terms of an international agreement, they will cut their uranium stockpile and restrict equipment to peaceful use. And watching over all of this activity will be nuclear inspectors. NPR's Geoff Brumfiel recently got a rare opportunity to meet some inspectors and learn how they do their job. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: OK, this is going to sound a little weird, but I met the people charged with making sure Iran doesn't get a nuclear weapon and a nuclear weapons lab - not in Iran, but here in America. NANCY JO NICHOLAS: We like to say it takes a weapons lab to find a weapons lab. BRUMFIEL: Nancy Jo Nicholas oversees global security at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. Los Alamos built America's first nukes, and it's a special kind of place. NICHOLAS: We used wear buttons that said, it's plutonium, stupid. That's why people come here. We have expertise in plutonium. BRUMFIEL: Plutonium and uranium exist in ordinary nuclear power reactors around the world. But when they are properly purified and enriched, they can be used to make nuclear weapons. Under this deal, Iran has pledged to keep its nuclear program peaceful, and to prove it, the nation will be put under the watchful eye of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The IAEA's nuclear inspectors will crisscross the country, visiting labs, reactors, even uranium mines. The goal will be to make sure that everything is accounted for, that nothing is being siphoned off into a secret weapons program. Past security checkpoints and barbed wire fences at Los Alamos, I arrive at a small building known only as TA 66. And here are the inspectors. They're in from Vienna, Austria for a two-week course on plutonium. They're learning everything about it, both the civilian kind and the kind used in nuclear weapons. Peter Santi is leading this training. PETER SANTI: We split them up into small groups of two students plus one instructor to really make sure they get as much information as possible. BRUMFIEL: Now, at this point, I should say it's extremely unusual for a journalist to be around active nuclear inspectors or weapons grade plutonium, for that matter. And so there are ground rules for my visit. I'm told these eight inspectors come from several different countries, but I don't know which ones. I can't ask their names. Santi says I can't even talk to them directly. SANTI: What I can do for you is demonstrate how we do a measurement. BRUMFIEL: Yeah. Yeah, let's do it. SANTI: OK. BRUMFIEL: We walk across the classroom and pick up some plutonium - well, Santi picks it up. Rule No. 2 - no touching the plutonium. This looks kind of - what? - like a paint can with a big radioactive marker on the side and a bunch of - what? - is that duct tape you're using to hold it? SANTI: (Laughter) For convenience, we've put on some handles, essentially, using tape to make sure we can hold them. It's ease-of-use and ergonomically sensible. BRUMFIEL: Plus you really don't want to drop the plutonium. SANTI: Well, it makes a loud noise. And it scares everybody when it happens. BRUMFIEL: All joking aside, just a few pounds of the stuff can be made into a powerful nuclear bomb, which is why the inspectors need to recognize it, even if it's hidden or mislabeled. We put the can of plutonium into another container about the size of an oil drum. It's designed to catch radioactive particles flying out as the plutonium decays. SANTI: Nuclear material, when it decays, produces very unique signatures. So that's kind of a unique fingerprint to the nuclear material. And it's always being emitted by these materials because they are unstable. BRUMFIEL: Inspectors use the radioactive fingerprint in two ways. First, they check to verify the kind of material, and then they measure it to figure out how much material is there. When it comes to something like plutonium, the numbers matter a lot. So just out of curiosity, I mean, what would happen if we found out right now that there were only 500 grams of plutonium in that container when we thought there were 600? Are you getting nervous there? SANTI: It would be a huge problem. BRUMFIEL: You would have to do a lot of paperwork, wouldn't you? SANTI: It wouldn't be paperwork, it would be - yeah - next question. BRUMFIEL: Fortunately, in this case, the plutonium is accounted for to within just a fraction of a percentage. SANTI: The calculated declared plutonium mass for today is 606 grams, and we measured 607 grams. BRUMFIEL: Inspectors will be bringing this kind of precision to work in Iran, though, there they will usually be measuring uranium. But it's not just Iran. David Lacey is a training officer with the IAEA and a former inspector himself. DAVID LACEY: We are inspecting all different types of facilities all over the world. BRUMFIEL: The IAEA visits civilian reactors, fuel plants and plutonium-handling facilities everywhere from Brazil to Japan to the U. S. They go in, make measurements, like the ones they're doing today, and then compare it to the official inventory to make sure it's all there. It's a challenging job even at the best of times. LACEY: You know, an inspector has to be a little bit of everything. You need to be an accountant, a little bit scientist, a little bit of diplomat. BRUMFIEL: And to keep them on top of their game, inspectors receive continuous training in courses like this. Speaking of which, it's final exam day. SANTI: Morning. How are you doing? BRUMFIEL: I'm well. How are you? Peter Santi leads me back into TA 66. The inspectors have been given a nuclear inventory from a fictional facility. Their job is to verify 12 unmarked items to see how much plutonium is inside each one. But just like what can happen in the real world, not all is what it seems. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: There is something else. There is a lot of background from something else. SANTI: We have made some of the items quite challenging, as well as several of the items we've lost the declaration for. So they're completely unknown to the inspectors. BRUMFIEL: And have you done anything really naughty? SANTI: Yes. BRUMFIEL: Santi won't tell me what tricks he's using to try and fool inspectors. But whatever it is, they'll have to figure it out. And the IAEA's trainer, David Lacey, is confident they will. LACEY: They'll be fine. They'll be fine. They get a good - they've had good teaching over the last two weeks. And I can see now, looking around, that they're perfectly capable. BRUMFIEL: The inspections in Iran will be some of the most ambitious ever attempted by the world's nuclear watchdog. I don't know if the inspectors on this particular course are involved, and I can't ask. But what is clear is that the IAEA wants to be sure all of its inspectors are ready. Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News.

And here's a bit of a surprise - tell your trouble to somebody who's had the same experience and they may sympathize less. NPR social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam is here to talk about some research that suggests that. Hi, Shankar. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: I'm a little surprised because you'd think you'd want to go to somebody who can say, I know just what you're feeling. VEDANTAM: Yeah, I would've said the same thing. But as I say it, I can think of all kinds of examples where that's not true. So if you go to David Greene, Steve, and you complain about how hard it is to wake up at 4 o'clock in the morning every day. . . INSKEEP: David would be like, tell me about it. VEDANTAM: Exactly, so he's going to be unsympathetic because he deals with it every single day. Rachel Ruttan, Loran Nordgren and Mary-Hunter McDonnell find that people who endure emotionally distressing events often show less compassion for others who are struggling with the same event compared to people who haven't been through such an event. INSKEEP: What's an example of this? VEDANTAM: Well, they use several examples. Let's say I give you a very difficult mental challenge and you solve that challenge successfully. And now you're thinking about somebody else who's confronting a challenge for the first time and finding it really hard. INSKEEP: Like some math problem or whatever, OK. VEDANTAM: Exactly. Now, do you feel sympathetic toward that person or do you actually say, I did that. I solved it. INSKEEP: Come on, you can do this. VEDANTAM: Exactly. The researchers also find something very interesting, Steve. Compared to people who've never been unemployed, those who've experienced unemployment show less compassion to people currently dealing with unemployment. It's not so much, I think, you're less likely to care. You're more likely to think, if I can get through this and I can find a job, so can you. INSKEEP: So the key here is if you need sympathy, go to somebody else who's clueless. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) I think the interesting thing is intuitively, many of us think that if we are going through something difficult, we should go to somebody else who has been through that difficult thing themselves. Obviously, there are lots of people who've been through difficult things who still can be sympathetic and empathetic. But I think what these studies suggest is that trauma often doesn't make us kinder and more compassionate. It also has the potential to make us tougher and harsher. INSKEEP: I'm also just thinking about as a listener because you're talking about the listener being less sympathetic. If I have been through this unemployment experience before and you start telling me about yours, I might just think about my own story. I might not really be listening. But if it's a new experience for me that you're relating, I am going to listen and I might really sympathize. VEDANTAM: I think that's an excellent theory. Another theory, Steve, is that once you've actually been through a difficult experience, it might be very hard to put yourself back in the mental frame of somebody who's confronting that experience for the first time because you've dealt with it. You're at the top of the mountain now. It's very hard to put yourself back at the bottom of the mountain and look up at that cliff. INSKEEP: Shankar, thanks. VEDANTAM: Thank you, Steve.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Something similar is happening right now in climate change negotiations. How do you split that bill? The United Nations is trying to get almost 200 countries to agree on a plan for how to fight global warming. MONTAGNE: This week, negotiators are in Bonn, Germany. It's their last meeting before the final summit starts next month in Paris. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce explains why this a bit like arguing over a bar tab. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: A lot of the climate negotiations at the United Nations are pretty dry and technical. But some of the dynamics would be familiar to anyone who's ever been out drinking with their buddies. Andrew Jones is with a think tank called Climate Interactive. ANDREW JONES: It's like all these countries have been at the bar drinking for the afternoon or for the day or just showed up recently. And some people showed up in the morning and some people just showed 10 minutes earlier. And then the bill comes. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The U. N. talks are not about drinking beer, of course, but burning fossil fuels. There's no literal bill, although there is a price to pay. And just like with your friends, everyone is supposed to chip in their fair share. JONES: And a few people throw down some euros. Some people throw down some coins, some in other denominations people don't even know. And then someone's got to put it all together. And as he does, it doesn't really add up. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Climate negotiators have not been throwing crumpled bills down on a bar. Instead, countries have been making pledges for what they'll do to help limit global warming to just 2 degrees Celsius. That's the goal nations agreed to years ago to prevent the worst effects of climate change. JONES: You add it all up. And then you say, hey, everybody, everyone needs to throw in 10 more. Or, John, you had a little bit more, you should throw in 20. It's like that kind of process. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The deadline for countries to make their pledges was this month. They're officially known as INDCs. DAVID WASKOW: They're called intended nationally determined contributions. GREENFIELDBOYCE: David Waskow works for a nonprofit called the World Resources Institute. WASKOW: They're intended because it's what countries are proposing. It's not their final thing. They're nationally determined. And they're contributions in the sense of what countries are going to contribute to the global effort to reduce emissions. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The plans are all up on the U. N. website. They tend to be between five and 15 pages. Countries usually set targets for how much they'll cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. And they say how they're going to do it. WASKOW: Many countries have also included information on what their renewable energy plans are going to be or what they're going to do on energy efficiency or how they're going to handle forest protection. GREENFIELDBOYCE: More than 150 countries have made these pledges. That's almost the whole world. But the bottom line is as of now, if climate change was presenting the planet with a bar tab, there's not enough on the table to cover it. JONES: Using my analogy, we have not paid the full bill. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Andrew Jones says his group calculates that if countries do just what they've pledged so far, global warming by the end of the century would be about 3. 5 degrees Celsius. So there's still a ways to go. JONES: But the way that this process is coming together for Paris makes us believe that it's actually possible to get further and get all the way down to 2 degrees. GREENFIELDBOYCE: At some point in the future, maybe, if the summit in Paris can just get the world headed down the right path. Bill Hare is head of Climate Analytics based in Berlin, Germany. BILL HARE: The big move for countries to put forward plans is actually quite impressive. The very fact they're doing it is a positive story. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And I asked Hare, what countries does he think are like drinking buddies who haven't put in enough? HARE: Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, these countries - Russia as well, actually - could afford to do a lot more than they're doing. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He thinks China and the European Union have pledged an OK amount. And the United States? HARE: Well, the U. S. is a bit like that guy who always was a bit slow to pay at the bar and then somehow got a few negative messages from their mates and turns up and then starts to say, OK, look; now's the time to catch up a bit, and I'm going to buy a round here and a round there. GREENFIELDBOYCE: These pledges are only part of the U. N. 's overall effort to get the entire world acting together against climate change. Questions about fairness lay at the heart of the whole process, as nations big and small, rich and poor, argue over how much they really owe. Hare says poorer countries that are trying to develop are saying. . . HARE: Look, actually, you guys got all the chance in the world to burn as much carbon as you wanted. And now you're telling us, hey, our time to stop. And they're going to say, what about our economic growth? GREENFIELDBOYCE: And countries especially vulnerable to climate change say they need help to cope with droughts, extreme weather, rising seas. HARE: Some countries are beginning to feel like they're standing outside a very noisy bar, looking for a taxi to get home. And some drunken people wander out into the street and get aggressive and push them around. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The final summit in Paris is just weeks away, and tension is building. At the start of this week's session in Bonn, developing nations complained bitterly that a draft agreement was unfair, that the rich nations were stiffing them. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

GREENFIELDBOYCE: At some point in the future, maybe, if the summit in Paris can just get the world headed down the right path. Bill Hare is head of Climate Analytics based in Berlin, Germany. BILL HARE: The big move for countries to put forward plans is actually quite impressive. The very fact they're doing it is a positive story. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And I asked Hare, what countries does he think are like drinking buddies who haven't put in enough? HARE: Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, these countries - Russia as well, actually - could afford to do a lot more than they're doing. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He thinks China and the European Union have pledged an OK amount. And the United States? HARE: Well, the U. S. is a bit like that guy who always was a bit slow to pay at the bar and then somehow got a few negative messages from their mates and turns up and then starts to say, OK, look; now's the time to catch up a bit, and I'm going to buy a round here and a round there. GREENFIELDBOYCE: These pledges are only part of the U. N. 's overall effort to get the entire world acting together against climate change. Questions about fairness lay at the heart of the whole process, as nations big and small, rich and poor, argue over how much they really owe. Hare says poorer countries that are trying to develop are saying. . . HARE: Look, actually, you guys got all the chance in the world to burn as much carbon as you wanted. And now you're telling us, hey, our time to stop. And they're going to say, what about our economic growth? GREENFIELDBOYCE: And countries especially vulnerable to climate change say they need help to cope with droughts, extreme weather, rising seas. HARE: Some countries are beginning to feel like they're standing outside a very noisy bar, looking for a taxi to get home. And some drunken people wander out into the street and get aggressive and push them around. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The final summit in Paris is just weeks away, and tension is building. At the start of this week's session in Bonn, developing nations complained bitterly that a draft agreement was unfair, that the rich nations were stiffing them.

DAVID LANG: I'd never been inside of a cave at all before this. And they're really, really stark. RAZ: This is David Lang. And for eight months, he and some friends had been preparing to explore this one cave. LANG: It's about six hours north of San Francisco. RAZ: And there's no, like - no one lives around there? There's just like, a - it's like, a place on the map? LANG: It's a - that's a very good way to describe it. It's a place on a map, and that's about all we had, was a map. RAZ: This was back in 2012, but what brought David to that cave, that story began years earlier. David had moved to LA from the Midwest to follow his dream of sailing around the world, even though he'd never even been on a sail boat before. LANG: But I just had this idea that this is something I wanted to do. So I drove out California, begged my way into this job with this sailing school, learned how to sail and ended up teaching sailing lessons and doing sailing trips around the world. It was an exciting four years after college. RAZ: That's cool. So you really know how to sail now? LANG: I do, I know how to sail. I've lived on a boat. . . RAZ: The point is, David was never the kind of guy who was, you know, afraid to knock on doors and say hey, you know, I don't know how to do this, but I want to. Help me out. So a couple years after that - he was still living in LA - David met a guy named Eric Stackpole, and Eric was also looking for some help. LANG: And when I met Eric, the first thing that came out of his mouth. . . RAZ: Yeah. LANG: . . . Was this story of this cave. RAZ: What do you remember about the story? LANG: So the story dated back to the Gold Rush. The story was that there was two Native American men who had robbed this gold-mining operation. And they had made off with about a hundred pounds of gold. So a lot of gold. RAZ: Wow. LANG: And that they were fleeing into the mountains, and the sheriff's posse was on the trail. And they threw the gold into this underwater cave, so it wouldn't weigh them down, so they could get away faster. They ended up getting caught, and the sheriff asked them where they put the gold. And they said they hid it in the Hall City Cave. RAZ: David was instantly in. They were going to find that gold in the Hall City Cave, but they had no idea where it was or how to get there so they just Googled it. LANG: And then we found this story from this treasure hunter online who had found this cave and had tried to get to the bottom and had almost died and had said, I'm never going back to that cave. RAZ: But Eric and David did go to that cave. LANG: And sure enough, you go to the back of this limestone cave and there's this puddle of water. And you shine a light and it just goes down, down, down, down, down and you can't see the bottom of it. RAZ: So there could be, like, a hundred pounds of gold down there underwater. And Eric is like, I want to find it. LANG: He said he's going to find it, but, more importantly, he's going to make this tool to go and find it. RAZ: David would spend the next eight months working with Eric to build that tool. And the tool was an ROV, a remote operated vehicle. These are not new. They're used by oil and gas companies for exploration and construction underwater, but those ROVs cost tens of thousands of dollars. And David and Eric were trying to build one in a garage out of hardware store parts, as David explained on the Ted stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)LANG: So Eric had an initial design idea for a robot, but we didn't have all the parts figured out. So we did what anybody would do in our situation. We asked the Internet for help. More specifically, we created this website, openrov. com and shared our intentions and our plans. For the first few months, it was just Eric and I talking back to each other on the forums. But pretty soon, we started to get feedback from makers and hobbyists and then actually professional ocean engineers who, you know, had some suggestions for what we should do. RAZ: But you knew nothing about, like, computers, or - I guess. . . LANG: Electronics and software. RAZ: . . . Electronics, software? LANG: No, I was not technical at all. RAZ: Like, soldering irons? LANG: Yeah, and I think there's a special magic to not knowing what you're doing and being honest about that. RAZ: What happened when David and his friend simply asked for help was that they didn't just hear from people with great ideas. LANG: It was people who had actually tried something out. They said hey, I just tried this out in my pool or in the ocean near where I live, and it worked. It was better than just getting ideas, it was getting solutions. RAZ: And so after eight months of tinkering on their underwater robot in a garage, prototype after prototype after prototype. . . LANG: It just reached this point where the only thing left to do was to go. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ERIC STACKPOLE: Where are we right now? LANG: Right now we're in the Hall City Cave, kind of near Redding, Calif. It's a cave way up in the Trinity Alps. RAZ: And so on their 21st prototype. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LANG: That means I've built 20 ROVs before this. I'm perfecting the design almost every time. RAZ: David and what had become a team of friends went back to the Hall City Cave and put their little underwater robot. . . LANG: Like, the size of a toaster oven I would say. RAZ: Equipped with a couple of lights and a small camera tethered to a hundred-foot cable. . . LANG: It was really this. . . RAZ: Into the water. LANG: . . . Moment of pride because it wasn't just that we were exploring the unknown, but we were going there with this tool that we had built. RAZ: In fact, that day David and his friends almost forgot about the gold and why they were there in the first place because what was even more exciting, as their robot moved through the water toward an opening that would take them successfully into the cave itself, was that because of all the people who had helped them get there, they felt like a part of something bigger. LANG: Yes. We sent it down and everyone is kind of collectively holding their breath. It's a very quiet moment where anything can happen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Slowing the ascent. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: You're going through. You're through. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Laughter) That is so cool. All right, I'm making a descent. RAZ: OK, spoiler alert here because David and his partners did not find any gold in that cave. But the open-source model they used to get there left them with a question, a question that would never have been able to ask if they hadn't had help from thousands of people all over the world. LANG: What if there were thousands of these devices and that anybody could, you know, just get online or go and meet people and get sucked into one of these adventures? (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)LANG: So about that time, our little expedition became quite a story, and it got picked up in The New York Times. And we were pretty much just overwhelmed with interest from people who wanted a kit that they could build this ROV themselves. So we decided to put the project on Kickstarter. And when we did, we raised our funding goal in about two hours and all of a sudden had this money to make these kits. But then we had to learn how to make them. I mean, we had to learn small-batch manufacturing. So we quickly learned that our garage was not big enough to hold our growing operation. But we were able to do it. We got all the kits made. Thanks a lot to TechShop, which was a big help to us. And we shipped these kits all over the world. But we're still publishing all the designs online, encouraging anyone to build these themselves. That's the only way that we could have done this. By being open-source, we've created this distributed R-and-D network, and we're moving faster than any venture-backed counterpart. But the actual robot is really only half the story. The real potential, the long-term potential is with this community of DIY ocean explorers that are forming all over the globe. What can we discover when there's thousands of these devices roaming the seas? RAZ: David Lang and his company OpenROV have sold thousands of their open-source ROVs to people all over the world. These things can dive over 300 feet. They shoot high-quality video and they only cost about 900 bucks, which is a fraction of their commercial counterparts. And David says who knows what they could find on a planet that is 70 percent water. LANG: To give you an example, there are about 200 shipwrecks in the San Francisco Bay that have not been discovered. I mean, we've gone off several times, and we go in and look at old maps, try and read old documents at historical societies and try and figure where some of these shipwrecks are. But to go out on the boat and to know that we're looking for this piece of history that no one else has been able to find, that's a feeling that's - oh, it just gets me excited. RAZ: I mean, we're almost - in some ways, we're, like, going back to that age of discovery, where, like, anybody could be a scientist or an explorer or an astronomer because they just went out and did it. And now, like, the tools are available to people, and they're pretty cheap. LANG: I like that. I think you're right. It is this new age of discovery. You have to realize though that, you know, we've been doing this now for four years. And I tell - I still tell this story once in a while of how we got started in the search for gold and Kickstarter and the whole story. And I can't help but giggle when I tell it because it still seems so unbelievable. And the best part about it is that it's not just ours. It's all of these people that are a part of it. And so I always talk about this, that we've created this dream. But it's a collective dream that we're all participating in, that we're all working on together. RAZ: David Lang runs openrov. com. They recently launched a crowdfunded campaign to build a new version of the robot. They needed about 50,000 bucks to start. They raised almost three-quarters of a million. You can see David's short talk at ted. com. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"CAN I GET SOME HELP\")JAMES BROWN: (Singing) There's a whole lot of people standing over there. I've got to prove, I've got to show - can I get some help? Can I get some help? Can I get some help? Can I get some help? RAZ: Hey, thanks for listening to our show this week, Open Source.

Hurricane Patricia was the strongest storm ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere. It made landfall in a rural part of Mexico's West coast and quickly lost strength. Let's bring in a meteorologist now. It's Kristen Corbosiero. She's a professor in the Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences at the University of Albany. Good morning. KRISTEN CORBOSIERO: Good morning, David. How are you? GREENE: I'm well. Thank you. How did this storm get so big so fast? CORBOSIERO: Well, that's a question that we're hopefully going to figure out. The intensification rate of this storm was one of the fastest we'd ever seen. So we're really, as scientists, excited to look into the problem and figure out why. GREENE: How bad would the destruction have been if this had this been a big population center? CORBOSIERO: It would have been devastating. I think it's really hard to think about what it would have been like, that if a storm like this had intensified so rapidly, say, near the coast of Florida or near the coast of Texas or even further up or down the coast in Mexico - we were very lucky that the storm didn't make landfall in a more populated area. GREENE: And tell me just a few of the big questions you're now trying to answer after you begin studying this storm. CORBOSIERO: Right. So we were really lucky in this storm that - typically, in the Eastern Pacific, we don't fly into hurricanes with the planes that we observe in the Atlantic. But for this particular storm, because there hasn't been a lot of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic this year, there were a number of aircraft that flew into the storm and sampled it. So we got a really unique data set for a storm in the Eastern Pacific and a unique data set in a storm that rapidly intensified so strongly. GREENE: And what's one big question you're trying to answer? CORBOSIERO: The biggest question that my work is trying to answer is to look at why storms rapidly intensify. It's one of the greatest forecasting challenges we have studying tropical cyclones. Clearly, these are sort of the most impactful storms. When they intensify so rapidly so close to land, they're really - the impact to life and property is maximized. GREENE: Does it really remain that much of a mystery? CORBOSIERO: It really does. We understand generally why hurricanes intensify. But understanding why this storm intensified so rapidly is a mystery to us, that we have ideas about it. But if you look at our most successful hurricane forecasting models, none of them captured this kind of rapid intensification. I mean, this is an extreme case - two or three times what we have on average. But understanding that rapid intensification, where a storm would intensify this fast overnight or in the matter of 24 hours is something we just can't grasp at this time. Our models don't resolve it. And we don't quite understand all the processes that are involved yet. GREENE: All right. Kristen Corbosiero is a tropical meteorologist at the University of Albany. Thanks so much for joining us. CORBOSIERO: Thank you. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  People in Mexico were expecting the worst over the weekend, and it did not come.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. This week for Halloween, the science of fear, we'll talk about what scares us and why sometimes anticipating being afraid can be worse than the thing itself. MAGGIE PENMAN, BYLINE: I don't know if I can do this. VEDANTAM: We're going to talk about how changing a few subtle things can make us feel disoriented. MARGEE KERR: Yeah, your body is basically just preparing itself to face whatever it's going to encounter around the next bend. VEDANTAM: And how this sense of disorientation can increase your fear. PENMAN: Oh, my God, what is that? VEDANTAM: We'll also explore the upside of fear. Sometimes, being scared can actually be a good thing. We're going to do things a little differently in this episode. We decided to recruit a very brave guinea pig. PENMAN: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. VEDANTAM: Maggie Penman is one of the producers of this podcast. Maggie, welcome. PENMAN: Hi, Shankar. I don't sound very brave in that clip, I have to say. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PENMAN: That does - not my finest hour. VEDANTAM: I think you do sound like a guinea pig there. PENMAN: Absolutely. I sound like I'm being subjected to something for sure. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) All right, you are clearly not someone who enjoys being afraid. PENMAN: No, I can't even watch previews for horror movies. VEDANTAM: So this might explain why over the last few days you have been a little annoyed with me. PENMAN: (Laughter) So I had this idea that it would be really fun to do an episode about the science of fear for Halloween, and you thought it would be really fun if I went and investigated for myself. VEDANTAM: Exactly. I mean, what use is a story about fear without somebody who's actually frightened out of their wits? PENMAN: Yeah, I can see why that would be fun for you, but. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PENMAN: . . . It was slightly less fun for me, so. . . VEDANTAM: All right, tell me what you found. PENMAN: Yeah, I drove to Pennsylvania to meet with this woman Margee Kerr. And she's a sociologist at the University of Pittsburgh, but she also has this sort of side gig where she curates a haunted house called ScareHouse and uses it to study fear. She actually has a new book out now called \"Scream: Chilling Adventures In The Science Of Fear. \" And believe it or not, the cover glows in the dark, very unnerving. VEDANTAM: All right, so she's a sociologist, she runs a haunted house, and she enjoys scaring people out of their wits. PENMAN: Yeah, so it was funny because Margee was just not what I was expecting. She does not look like the kind of person who studies fear for a living. KERR: Hi. PENMAN: Hi, nice to meet you. KERR: Nice to meet you. Come on in. PENMAN: She was the sweet, lovely welcoming person. But every once in a while, she would be describing something in the haunted house and would get really excited about something like this. KERR: All of the trick-or-treaters that we've been seeing, all of these very cute kind of cartoonish characters, are being decapitated and stabbed and eaten. VEDANTAM: Oh, that is just awful, Maggie. PENMAN: I know. So clearly, Margee is the kind of person who loves this stuff. She loves horror movies. She's always loved creepy-crawly monsters. It's just kind of, like, her thing. VEDANTAM: OK, mental note to self, avoid Margee Kerr on quiet streets, especially late at night. PENMAN: (Laughter) OK, no, but seriously, she was lovely. I met with her on a Saturday afternoon. I got a tour of her lab. We had this great chat about fear and science, what makes horror movies so popular, and then I came back. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)PENMAN: . . . At night. This is the part of the tape where you're going to hear my voice get about an octave higher. VEDANTAM: All right, so I'm imagining that this is because you're afraid. Your muscles are tensing up. Your vocal cords are going to get clenched, and that's why you're going to sound like a guinea pig. PENMAN: Yeah, I mean, that all sounds very scientific. I think my experience was just sort of like low-grade panic attack for about 25 minutes, so. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PENMAN: . . . Whatever floats your boat. But you're going to hear another voice in this tape, too, and that was Margee following behind me collecting data. And then I was also wearing this crazy lab coat with, like, little things stuck on my fingers and torso collecting my heart rate and something called galvanic skin response, which is basically just how sweaty someone is getting, and they use that as a measurement for how scared you are. VEDANTAM: So I want to hear what the data was, but before that, Maggie, tell me a little bit about the house. PENMAN: Yeah, so the beginning of the haunted house incorporated a lot of the building's history which was really cool. So this building used to be the Elks Club Lodge, and it has this sort of faded glamour. There's this spooky 1920s music kind of coming through an old phonograph. It sounds almost underwater. There's a party scene. It's full of people and animatronics and dolls in costumes. And one of the very creepy things about this is you're never quite sure which one you're dealing with until you're very close. Oh, my God. (Laughter) Oh, my God. Lots of taxidermy on the walls, and then it went from creepy to brutal with some human taxidermy. VEDANTAM: What did you just say? PENMAN: Human taxidermy. VEDANTAM: They were actually stuffing human beings with. . . PENMAN: Well, that looked like the plan. There were some sort of mangled bodies hanging from the ceiling, blood. . . VEDANTAM: Oh, dear. PENMAN: . . . Gore. VEDANTAM: Oh, dear. PENMAN: Yeah, this is where I sort of started to freak out. I don't know if I can do this. KERR: You can do it. PENMAN: I don't know. VEDANTAM: I love the fact that she's encouraging you, that she's goading you on. I love that. PENMAN: She's very gleeful about her work. That's what I'll say. And throughout the whole house, there's this kind of creepy soundtrack of whispers and music. PENMAN: And then of course, there are the actors. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Are you the chosen one? PENMAN: This guy was sort of, like, half-human, and he was just getting all up in my space. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Oh, I can smell it. Let me see. (LAUGHTER)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Oh, yes. Follow me. VEDANTAM: All right, that sounds really creepy. PENMAN: OK, see? This isn't kids' stuff. VEDANTAM: I am so sorry I did this to you, Maggie. PENMAN: Oh, well, it's OK. We're going to bring it up with the union, but. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PENMAN: . . . In the meantime, so yeah, they're a lot of what Margee referred to as boo scares, which is basically something or someone jumping out and surprising you. OK. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Are we ready? PENMAN: Leading to reactions like that. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Up the stairs. Don't crack your head, this way. VEDANTAM: That's interesting, Maggie, because when I think of scary stuff, I really divide it into two kinds of things in my head. So there's the scary stuff like we just heard where something jumps out at you and makes a scary sound. There's also the other kind of scary stuff where the fear sort of builds up really, really slowly, and you know that something bad is going to happen, but you just don't know when. PENMAN: That's exactly right. And it's funny because the boo scares are actually pretty light. Even though I was screaming, you can hear Margee sort of laughing at herself in the background for being startled. And most people who voluntarily go through a haunted house have that reaction. But what was really unnerving was the subtle stuff, the sort of distorted mirrors and darkness and fog and noise. I don't know which way I'm supposed to be going. KERR: Yes, right through here. VEDANTAM: Oh, my gosh. I can really hear the panic in your voice there. PENMAN: Yeah, the disorientation stuff really freaked me out. And some of the rooms were completely dark. You had to sort of feel your way through, not knowing what might be around the next corner. I actually talked to Margee about that sensation after we got out of the house. KERR: Yeah, the blackout rooms are so terrifying because we can't use anything to sort of gauge our position in space. So our proprioception is completely out of whack because we really need just something, just even the slightest little light, to kind of give us an idea of what's up and what's down. And when you take that away through darkness or, you know, with the use of fog - there's a ton of fog, strobe lights, too. A strobe lights combined with hyperventilation are the best at inducing a feeling depersonalization or when you sort of feel like you are outside of yourself. VEDANTAM: So here's what I'm thinking, Maggie, and I'm actually thinking about something much more serious than haunted houses at this point. The whole thing that she just talked about, the idea of disorientation and triggering disorientation as a way to trigger fear, I feel like psychologists have actually applied this in all kinds of ways, some of which are actually quite unethical if you look at the ways in which people have practiced torture. People have used exactly the same techniques of using strobe lights and loud music, darkness, cold, sounds of crying babies. And when you pipe these things in to people over extended periods of time, it actually is as traumatic as actually being beaten or abused or being physically violated in some way. PENMAN: I can really imagine that because even though this was a haunted house, it was a very controlled environment. I knew I was safe the whole time. There is just something so disorienting about being in a completely dark room or being constantly bombarded with strobe lights and sound. And the way Margee described it is basically whatever your conscious brain is saying, even if you're saying, I know I'm safe, I'm in a haunted house, no one can touch me, your sort of lizard brain kind of takes over, and you don't care if you know you're safe. You just feel that fear. And in the context of a haunted house, sometimes ordinary things can be incredibly unnerving. So I have this awesome piece of tape I want to play for you. (SOUNDBITE OF TAPE)PENMAN: So that's something they use as part of the soundtrack of the haunted house. It's creepy, right? VEDANTAM: It's totally creepy. And I can totally understand why you're hearing the sound in the background. It's dark, you're disoriented, and now everything around you feels like it's potentially a threat. PENMAN: Absolutely. And the funny thing that Margee told me later about that sound, it's actually \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" audio slowed down 800 times. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PENMAN: So there's nothing scary about the audio. But when it's slowed down and you're in that environment, you're expecting to be scared, and so you are. VEDANTAM: So tell me one thing. I'm not sure if this came up in your conversation with Margee. Why is it that people pay money to show up at these haunted houses? They pay money to go and see horror movies. PENMAN: It's a great question. And this was actually one of the big reasons I wanted to do this story is because I feel like as someone who doesn't enjoy being scared, it's so hard for me to relate to. But obviously, people like this. There's a huge horror movie industry, people love haunted houses, and Margee actually gave me some insight. KERR: You know, people who voluntarily engage with these experiences are benefiting. So we measured people before they went in and after they came out, and their mood improved significantly. And we did find that there were differences in how people were processing cognitive and emotional information after they went through, suggesting that, you know, pushing someone to that high arousal threat response, you know, it is affecting how we think, especially how we think about negative things. VEDANTAM: Wow, I would not have expected that. So going through a haunted house is really like taking a medication for anxiety. PENMAN: I can tell you, for me it was not like taking medication for anxiety. But apparently, for these people who really are thrill seekers and enjoy that adrenaline rush, I think for those people it really does relax them. KERR: When we come out, we're not, essentially, thinking as much. And that's something that - you know, lots of research has shown that when you're scared, your executive functioning, your prefrontal cortex, is taking a backseat to your limbic system. So the body is prioritizing all of those mechanisms that are going to help us survive. And so what we're thinking is that for, you know, a group of people - and we did find that, you know, those who came in who were very stressed and anxious had the biggest improvements in mood ratings. And we call it a stress recalibration. VEDANTAM: So in other words, most people who go through ScareHouse end up feeling better after they are done. You went through ScareHouse and in some ways you ended up feeling worse after you were done. I'm wondering if there might be a sort of self-selection effect here, which is most people who are going to ScareHouse are going there voluntarily. They have figured out over time that going to haunted houses and scary experiences makes them feel better. You, on the other hand, did not go voluntarily, and maybe that's because you figured out that these experiences don't make you feel better afterwards. PENMAN: Yeah, and Margee says this is actually one of the big limitations of this study is they're only collecting data from people who are already voluntarily showing up at ScareHouse. VEDANTAM: Was any of this even a little bit fun, Maggie? PENMAN: You know I hesitate to say fun. But I always knew I was safe, fundamentally. And that's kind of the line that a haunted house asks you to walk. You simultaneously know you're going to be OK, but you're losing control enough that you're able to get that thrill. KERR: And that's another awesome thing about the human mind, is that we can suspend our disbelief and sort of, allow ourselves to believe that we've lost this control while still knowing - you know, in our deepest, kind of, part - that we're actually safe. We're OK. Because if people really didn't feel that they could leave or that they could leave safely, it wouldn't be fun. It would be, you know, true trauma. VEDANTAM: So here's the thing I find really fascinating, Maggie. It's very clear haunted houses are actually safe, but they feel like they are unsafe. But there are also many experiences that actually are unsafe that feel very safe. And you know, throughout this episode, Maggie, I know I've sounded like a really callous colleague. PENMAN: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: But the truth is, I actually was afraid of something. It had nothing to do with haunted houses because pretty much no one dies in haunted houses. . . PENMAN: That's what you think. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). I was really afraid that you were going to be driving to Pittsburgh after a long day at work, five hours behind the wheel, and I was thinking about the statistics that say, more than 30,000 Americans die in traffic crashes every year. That's what you should have been afraid about. PENMAN: Yeah, that's very rational of you. But it's funny because I wasn't worried about that at all. I was totally fixated on what ghost or goblin was going to come around next corner. VEDANTAM: You know, my theory is that it actually has something to do with evolution, that our brains have been sculpted through millennia of evolution to pay attention to things that jump out from behind rocks. And that's what the haunted house does. Our brains have not evolved to be fearful of driving down the highway at 70 miles an hour in a box. PENMAN: So that makes perfect sense to me. And makes me feel a little better about being completely irrational. VEDANTAM: Well, hang on a second, Maggie. You left me in a little bit of suspense because you told me at the start that they collected all this data on you. What did Margee find? PENMAN: So it took a couple of weeks, actually, for Margee and her colleague Greg Siegle, who's a neuroscientist, to analyze my data. But I do have it here. So let me just show this to your first. OK. . . VEDANTAM: Can I see it? PENMAN: . . . So this is sort of a normal person's galvanic skin response going through the haunt. VEDANTAM: OK, so it shows this wavy line sort of steadily increasing, which presumably means they're getting more and more scared as they go through the house. PENMAN: Right. So here's mine. VEDANTAM: All right. Woah. PENMAN: Yeah. VEDANTAM: This is completely different. PENMAN: Yeah. VEDANTAM: It looks like you're spiking, and then you come down. Then you spike again, and then you come down. And it's up and down the whole time. PENMAN: Yeah, it's all over the place. So you can see, there are certain points where I got really, really scared. And then there were other times when I really calmed down a lot. And they said that part of this might be because I went through a slightly different experience than the one at the haunted house where they normally collect data from. But Margee did say that they found this really unusual. KERR: It was a bit of a roller coaster of a GSR reading. And when we look at this in comparison to other people's data that we have been going through, it's very different, which is interesting. VEDANTAM: Well here's another theory, Maggie. Is it possible that because you were also there in a professional capacity, and you were periodically stepping outside of the haunted house experience to make sure the audio was correct - you were checking in with Margee from time to time - is it possible that switching into this cognitive mode effectively calmed you down from time to time, and that's why we're seeing this up-and-down spike in the data? PENMAN: Yeah, that totally squares with the experience I had. And I also think in general it's so comforting going through a scary experience with another person. And having Margee there and being able to check in with her really helped me. What was really sweet is Margee said that she sees this all the time. It really brings strangers together to go through a haunted house together. It makes couples feel closer. It makes friends feel closer. So there's this lovely bonding quality that is kind of like the upside of this experience. VEDANTAM: Yeah, there's data showing that when couples go on a first date and they meet at a very scary place, they end up feeling closer to one another than if they meet in a very boring and ordinary place. PENMAN: Yeah, I could totally see that. I actually had to apologize to Margee at one point because I held her hand. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) All right. Very professional of you, Maggie. PENMAN: Yeah, I mean, she was a good sport about it. VEDANTAM: So I assume that the fact that you made a friend means that you're going to forgive me for putting you through the trauma of going to ScareHouse. PENMAN: Oh, I don't think you're going to get off the hook quite that easily, Shankar. I think it's time that we turned the tables. I think it's your turn to get scared. VEDANTAM: What do you have in mind? PENMAN: We're going to find out right after this break. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Support for this episode of HIDDEN BRAIN comes from Casper.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: So this is still the HIDDEN BRAIN podcast, and I'm still Shankar Vedantam, but I no longer feel like the host of this program. Maggie Penman just escorted me down to this dark, cavernous room in the bowels of NPR. Maggie, what are we doing here? PENMAN: Muah-ha-ha (ph). VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PENMAN: So, Shankar, after the whole ordeal that you put me through, I think it's only fair for me to turn the tables and scare you. But unfortunately, I'm not a very intimidating person. So I've enlisted the help of my friend Barry Gordemer. He's a senior producer at Morning Edition and also a magician. And he's been on this program before. Welcome Barry. BARRY GORDEMER, BYLINE: Thank you very much. I'm looking forward to intimidating you. VEDANTAM: You have long played the muscle in many experiments. GORDEMER: Yes, and look at that bicep, huh? VEDANTAM: It's pretty impressive, yes. What are we going to do, Barry? GORDEMER: Shankar, I have with me an envelope that I'd like to give you. VEDANTAM: Thank you, Barry. GORDEMER: What does the envelope say? VEDANTAM: The envelope has the word prediction written in a red felt pen. GORDEMER: Yes. And we're going to do it with a deck of cards. VEDANTAM: OK. GORDEMER: What I want you to do is pick the card that has been predicted in that envelope. VEDANTAM: There's only a small problem, Barry. I don't know what card has been predicted in the envelope. GORDEMER: Well, that's because you don't have the proper motivation. What we have to do is put your mind in the right place so you can concentrate and use your superior mental abilities. VEDANTAM: What do you have in mind? GORDEMER: I have here a plate and a can of whipped cream. VEDANTAM: What are you doing here, Barry? What - Barry, what are you doing? GORDEMER: Well, the idea is very simple. Should you fail in this task, it will be Maggie's job to hit you in the face with this whipped cream pie. VEDANTAM: Maggie, you are not going to do that. PENMAN: Well, I don't know, Shankar. You heard me in that haunted house. I'm a little upset right now, so. . . VEDANTAM: I have to say I feel extremely focused right now. GORDEMER: Very good. But actually, let me help your decision process a little bit. May I have five seconds on the clock please? VEDANTAM: Oh, dear. GORDEMER: That's the one right there. VEDANTAM: Yes, that's the one right there. GORDEMER: OK, keep your finger on the card. VEDANTAM: All right, so I've picked a card, so I - Maggie, I would really appreciate it if you didn't bring the place so close to me. GORDEMER: Shankar, will you open the envelope please? VEDANTAM: All right, I'm extracting a sheet of paper that was in the envelope, and it says Shankar will pick the eight of hearts. GORDEMER: Now let's see if it matches the card you picked. Maggie, stand by with the pie. Shankar, turn over the card. VEDANTAM: Oh no. It's the eight of hearts. PENMAN: Bummer. VEDANTAM: What? How did I pick this card, Barry? GORDEMER: First of all, sorry to disappoint you, Maggie. PENMAN: I was really looking forward to that. GORDEMER: The reason you picked the card is you fell into my little trap. I used fear to cloud your judgment just a little bit. VEDANTAM: And you're saying that somehow shaped which card I picked? GORDEMER: Exactly. If I could introduce a little bit of tension into the moment with the pie and also with the deadline clock, that would inhibit your ability to make an analytical choice and force you into a snap decision that greatly increases the odds that my trick will succeed. VEDANTAM: So what I find really fascinating about this, Barry, is that I feel like the same thing happened to you, Maggie, when you were at ScareHouse. Your critical thinking skills just simply shut down. PENMAN: Yeah, this is exactly what Margee was telling us about. It actually makes people feel better to go through a haunted house because they can't think about the things they've been worrying about anymore. VEDANTAM: I can't say I feel better already, but, Barry, thank you for showing us that magic trick. GORDEMER: I'd feel better if you were wearing that cream pie. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PENMAN: I'd feel better if I were eating the cream pie. VEDANTAM: HIDDEN BRAIN is produced by Kara McGuirk-Alison and Maggie Penman.

SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST:  This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. This week for Halloween, the science of fear, we'll talk about what scares us and why sometimes anticipating being afraid can be worse than the thing itself. MAGGIE PENMAN, BYLINE: I don't know if I can do this. VEDANTAM: We're going to talk about how changing a few subtle things can make us feel disoriented. MARGEE KERR: Yeah, your body is basically just preparing itself to face whatever it's going to encounter around the next bend. VEDANTAM: And how this sense of disorientation can increase your fear. PENMAN: Oh, my God, what is that? VEDANTAM: We'll also explore the upside of fear. Sometimes, being scared can actually be a good thing. We're going to do things a little differently in this episode. We decided to recruit a very brave guinea pig. PENMAN: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. VEDANTAM: Maggie Penman is one of the producers of this podcast. Maggie, welcome. PENMAN: Hi, Shankar. I don't sound very brave in that clip, I have to say. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PENMAN: That does - not my finest hour. VEDANTAM: I think you do sound like a guinea pig there. PENMAN: Absolutely. I sound like I'm being subjected to something for sure. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) All right, you are clearly not someone who enjoys being afraid. PENMAN: No, I can't even watch previews for horror movies.

And throughout the whole house, there's this kind of creepy soundtrack of whispers and music. PENMAN: And then of course, there are the actors. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Are you the chosen one? PENMAN: This guy was sort of, like, half-human, and he was just getting all up in my space. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Oh, I can smell it. Let me see. (LAUGHTER) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Oh, yes. Follow me. VEDANTAM: All right, that sounds really creepy. PENMAN: OK, see? This isn't kids' stuff. VEDANTAM: I am so sorry I did this to you, Maggie. PENMAN: Oh, well, it's OK. We're going to bring it up with the union, but. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PENMAN: . . . In the meantime, so yeah, they're a lot of what Margee referred to as boo scares, which is basically something or someone jumping out and surprising you. OK. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Are we ready? PENMAN: Leading to reactions like that. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Up the stairs. Don't crack your head, this way. VEDANTAM: That's interesting, Maggie, because when I think of scary stuff, I really divide it into two kinds of things in my head. So there's the scary stuff like we just heard where something jumps out at you and makes a scary sound. There's also the other kind of scary stuff where the fear sort of builds up really, really slowly, and you know that something bad is going to happen, but you just don't know when. PENMAN: That's exactly right. And it's funny because the boo scares are actually pretty light. Even though I was screaming, you can hear Margee sort of laughing at herself in the background for being startled. And most people who voluntarily go through a haunted house have that reaction. But what was really unnerving was the subtle stuff, the sort of distorted mirrors and darkness and fog and noise. I don't know which way I'm supposed to be going. KERR: Yes, right through here. VEDANTAM: Oh, my gosh. I can really hear the panic in your voice there. PENMAN: Yeah, the disorientation stuff really freaked me out. And some of the rooms were completely dark. You had to sort of feel your way through, not knowing what might be around the next corner. I actually talked to Margee about that sensation after we got out of the house. KERR: Yeah, the blackout rooms are so terrifying because we can't use anything to sort of gauge our position in space. So our proprioception is completely out of whack because we really need just something, just even the slightest little light, to kind of give us an idea of what's up and what's down. And when you take that away through darkness or, you know, with the use of fog - there's a ton of fog, strobe lights, too. A strobe lights combined with hyperventilation are the best at inducing a feeling depersonalization or when you sort of feel like you are outside of yourself. VEDANTAM: So here's what I'm thinking, Maggie, and I'm actually thinking about something much more serious than haunted houses at this point. The whole thing that she just talked about, the idea of disorientation and triggering disorientation as a way to trigger fear, I feel like psychologists have actually applied this in all kinds of ways, some of which are actually quite unethical if you look at the ways in which people have practiced torture. People have used exactly the same techniques of using strobe lights and loud music, darkness, cold, sounds of crying babies. And when you pipe these things in to people over extended periods of time, it actually is as traumatic as actually being beaten or abused or being physically violated in some way. PENMAN: I can really imagine that because even though this was a haunted house, it was a very controlled environment. I knew I was safe the whole time. There is just something so disorienting about being in a completely dark room or being constantly bombarded with strobe lights and sound. And the way Margee described it is basically whatever your conscious brain is saying, even if you're saying, I know I'm safe, I'm in a haunted house, no one can touch me, your sort of lizard brain kind of takes over, and you don't care if you know you're safe. You just feel that fear. And in the context of a haunted house, sometimes ordinary things can be incredibly unnerving. So I have this awesome piece of tape I want to play for you. (SOUNDBITE OF TAPE) PENMAN: So that's something they use as part of the soundtrack of the haunted house. It's creepy, right? VEDANTAM: It's totally creepy. And I can totally understand why you're hearing the sound in the background. It's dark, you're disoriented, and now everything around you feels like it's potentially a threat. PENMAN: Absolutely. And the funny thing that Margee told me later about that sound, it's actually \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" audio slowed down 800 times. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PENMAN: So there's nothing scary about the audio. But when it's slowed down and you're in that environment, you're expecting to be scared, and so you are. VEDANTAM: So tell me one thing. I'm not sure if this came up in your conversation with Margee. Why is it that people pay money to show up at these haunted houses? They pay money to go and see horror movies. PENMAN: It's a great question. And this was actually one of the big reasons I wanted to do this story is because I feel like as someone who doesn't enjoy being scared, it's so hard for me to relate to. But obviously, people like this. There's a huge horror movie industry, people love haunted houses, and Margee actually gave me some insight. KERR: You know, people who voluntarily engage with these experiences are benefiting. So we measured people before they went in and after they came out, and their mood improved significantly. And we did find that there were differences in how people were processing cognitive and emotional information after they went through, suggesting that, you know, pushing someone to that high arousal threat response, you know, it is affecting how we think, especially how we think about negative things. VEDANTAM: Wow, I would not have expected that. So going through a haunted house is really like taking a medication for anxiety. PENMAN: I can tell you, for me it was not like taking medication for anxiety. But apparently, for these people who really are thrill seekers and enjoy that adrenaline rush, I think for those people it really does relax them. KERR: When we come out, we're not, essentially, thinking as much. And that's something that - you know, lots of research has shown that when you're scared, your executive functioning, your prefrontal cortex, is taking a backseat to your limbic system. So the body is prioritizing all of those mechanisms that are going to help us survive. And so what we're thinking is that for, you know, a group of people - and we did find that, you know, those who came in who were very stressed and anxious had the biggest improvements in mood ratings. And we call it a stress recalibration. VEDANTAM: So in other words, most people who go through ScareHouse end up feeling better after they are done. You went through ScareHouse and in some ways you ended up feeling worse after you were done. I'm wondering if there might be a sort of self-selection effect here, which is most people who are going to ScareHouse are going there voluntarily. They have figured out over time that going to haunted houses and scary experiences makes them feel better. You, on the other hand, did not go voluntarily, and maybe that's because you figured out that these experiences don't make you feel better afterwards. PENMAN: Yeah, and Margee says this is actually one of the big limitations of this study is they're only collecting data from people who are already voluntarily showing up at ScareHouse. VEDANTAM: Was any of this even a little bit fun, Maggie? PENMAN: You know I hesitate to say fun. But I always knew I was safe, fundamentally. And that's kind of the line that a haunted house asks you to walk. You simultaneously know you're going to be OK, but you're losing control enough that you're able to get that thrill. KERR: And that's another awesome thing about the human mind, is that we can suspend our disbelief and sort of, allow ourselves to believe that we've lost this control while still knowing - you know, in our deepest, kind of, part - that we're actually safe. We're OK. Because if people really didn't feel that they could leave or that they could leave safely, it wouldn't be fun. It would be, you know, true trauma. VEDANTAM: So here's the thing I find really fascinating, Maggie. It's very clear haunted houses are actually safe, but they feel like they are unsafe. But there are also many experiences that actually are unsafe that feel very safe. And you know, throughout this episode, Maggie, I know I've sounded like a really callous colleague. PENMAN: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: But the truth is, I actually was afraid of something. It had nothing to do with haunted houses because pretty much no one dies in haunted houses. . . PENMAN: That's what you think. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). I was really afraid that you were going to be driving to Pittsburgh after a long day at work, five hours behind the wheel, and I was thinking about the statistics that say, more than 30,000 Americans die in traffic crashes every year. That's what you should have been afraid about. PENMAN: Yeah, that's very rational of you. But it's funny because I wasn't worried about that at all. I was totally fixated on what ghost or goblin was going to come around next corner. VEDANTAM: You know, my theory is that it actually has something to do with evolution, that our brains have been sculpted through millennia of evolution to pay attention to things that jump out from behind rocks. And that's what the haunted house does. Our brains have not evolved to be fearful of driving down the highway at 70 miles an hour in a box. PENMAN: So that makes perfect sense to me. And makes me feel a little better about being completely irrational. VEDANTAM: Well, hang on a second, Maggie. You left me in a little bit of suspense because you told me at the start that they collected all this data on you. What did Margee find? PENMAN: So it took a couple of weeks, actually, for Margee and her colleague Greg Siegle, who's a neuroscientist, to analyze my data. But I do have it here. So let me just show this to your first. OK. . . VEDANTAM: Can I see it? PENMAN: . . . So this is sort of a normal person's galvanic skin response going through the haunt. VEDANTAM: OK, so it shows this wavy line sort of steadily increasing, which presumably means they're getting more and more scared as they go through the house. PENMAN: Right. So here's mine. VEDANTAM: All right. Woah. PENMAN: Yeah. VEDANTAM: This is completely different. PENMAN: Yeah. VEDANTAM: It looks like you're spiking, and then you come down. Then you spike again, and then you come down. And it's up and down the whole time. PENMAN: Yeah, it's all over the place. So you can see, there are certain points where I got really, really scared. And then there were other times when I really calmed down a lot. And they said that part of this might be because I went through a slightly different experience than the one at the haunted house where they normally collect data from. But Margee did say that they found this really unusual. KERR: It was a bit of a roller coaster of a GSR reading. And when we look at this in comparison to other people's data that we have been going through, it's very different, which is interesting. VEDANTAM: Well here's another theory, Maggie. Is it possible that because you were also there in a professional capacity, and you were periodically stepping outside of the haunted house experience to make sure the audio was correct - you were checking in with Margee from time to time - is it possible that switching into this cognitive mode effectively calmed you down from time to time, and that's why we're seeing this up-and-down spike in the data? PENMAN: Yeah, that totally squares with the experience I had. And I also think in general it's so comforting going through a scary experience with another person. And having Margee there and being able to check in with her really helped me. What was really sweet is Margee said that she sees this all the time. It really brings strangers together to go through a haunted house together. It makes couples feel closer. It makes friends feel closer. So there's this lovely bonding quality that is kind of like the upside of this experience. VEDANTAM: Yeah, there's data showing that when couples go on a first date and they meet at a very scary place, they end up feeling closer to one another than if they meet in a very boring and ordinary place. PENMAN: Yeah, I could totally see that. I actually had to apologize to Margee at one point because I held her hand. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) All right. Very professional of you, Maggie. PENMAN: Yeah, I mean, she was a good sport about it. VEDANTAM: So I assume that the fact that you made a friend means that you're going to forgive me for putting you through the trauma of going to ScareHouse. PENMAN: Oh, I don't think you're going to get off the hook quite that easily, Shankar. I think it's time that we turned the tables. I think it's your turn to get scared. VEDANTAM: What do you have in mind? PENMAN: We're going to find out right after this break. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Support for this episode of HIDDEN BRAIN comes from Casper.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: So this is still the HIDDEN BRAIN podcast, and I'm still Shankar Vedantam, but I no longer feel like the host of this program. Maggie Penman just escorted me down to this dark, cavernous room in the bowels of NPR. Maggie, what are we doing here? PENMAN: Muah-ha-ha (ph). VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PENMAN: So, Shankar, after the whole ordeal that you put me through, I think it's only fair for me to turn the tables and scare you. But unfortunately, I'm not a very intimidating person. So I've enlisted the help of my friend Barry Gordemer. He's a senior producer at Morning Edition and also a magician. And he's been on this program before. Welcome Barry. BARRY GORDEMER, BYLINE: Thank you very much. I'm looking forward to intimidating you. VEDANTAM: You have long played the muscle in many experiments. GORDEMER: Yes, and look at that bicep, huh? VEDANTAM: It's pretty impressive, yes. What are we going to do, Barry? GORDEMER: Shankar, I have with me an envelope that I'd like to give you. VEDANTAM: Thank you, Barry. GORDEMER: What does the envelope say? VEDANTAM: The envelope has the word prediction written in a red felt pen. GORDEMER: Yes. And we're going to do it with a deck of cards. VEDANTAM: OK. GORDEMER: What I want you to do is pick the card that has been predicted in that envelope. VEDANTAM: There's only a small problem, Barry. I don't know what card has been predicted in the envelope. GORDEMER: Well, that's because you don't have the proper motivation. What we have to do is put your mind in the right place so you can concentrate and use your superior mental abilities. VEDANTAM: What do you have in mind? GORDEMER: I have here a plate and a can of whipped cream. VEDANTAM: What are you doing here, Barry? What - Barry, what are you doing? GORDEMER: Well, the idea is very simple. Should you fail in this task, it will be Maggie's job to hit you in the face with this whipped cream pie. VEDANTAM: Maggie, you are not going to do that. PENMAN: Well, I don't know, Shankar. You heard me in that haunted house. I'm a little upset right now, so. . . VEDANTAM: I have to say I feel extremely focused right now. GORDEMER: Very good. But actually, let me help your decision process a little bit. May I have five seconds on the clock please? VEDANTAM: Oh, dear. GORDEMER: That's the one right there. VEDANTAM: Yes, that's the one right there. GORDEMER: OK, keep your finger on the card. VEDANTAM: All right, so I've picked a card, so I - Maggie, I would really appreciate it if you didn't bring the place so close to me. GORDEMER: Shankar, will you open the envelope please? VEDANTAM: All right, I'm extracting a sheet of paper that was in the envelope, and it says Shankar will pick the eight of hearts. GORDEMER: Now let's see if it matches the card you picked. Maggie, stand by with the pie. Shankar, turn over the card. VEDANTAM: Oh no. It's the eight of hearts. PENMAN: Bummer. VEDANTAM: What? How did I pick this card, Barry? GORDEMER: First of all, sorry to disappoint you, Maggie. PENMAN: I was really looking forward to that. GORDEMER: The reason you picked the card is you fell into my little trap. I used fear to cloud your judgment just a little bit. VEDANTAM: And you're saying that somehow shaped which card I picked? GORDEMER: Exactly. If I could introduce a little bit of tension into the moment with the pie and also with the deadline clock, that would inhibit your ability to make an analytical choice and force you into a snap decision that greatly increases the odds that my trick will succeed. VEDANTAM: So what I find really fascinating about this, Barry, is that I feel like the same thing happened to you, Maggie, when you were at ScareHouse. Your critical thinking skills just simply shut down. PENMAN: Yeah, this is exactly what Margee was telling us about. It actually makes people feel better to go through a haunted house because they can't think about the things they've been worrying about anymore. VEDANTAM: I can't say I feel better already, but, Barry, thank you for showing us that magic trick. GORDEMER: I'd feel better if you were wearing that cream pie. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PENMAN: I'd feel better if I were eating the cream pie. VEDANTAM: HIDDEN BRAIN is produced by Kara McGuirk-Alison and Maggie Penman.

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m Shankar Vedantam. I did a story this past weekend for the public radio show, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis American Life. \u00e2\u0080\u009d The story was in an episode titled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Heart Wants What It Wants. \u00e2\u0080\u009d We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to take the whole podcast today to share this unusual story with you. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little longer than usual and best heard in a single sitting, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to give it to you without any interruptions. The story is about a con that folded very slowly over two decades. The thing that fascinated me about this story is that when the con was finally exposed, many of the victims were heartbroken. They wanted it to go on. They wanted to go keep believing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)VEDANTAM: So here's how the con worked. Guys around the country signed up for a pen pal service. It would put them in touch with women they could befriend and correspond with. And then they'd start to receive letters. JESSE: And they come from Hillsdale, Ill. Some of them are white, pink, green. VEDANTAM: Jesse is a sweet, soft-spoken man with fake plastic aviator glasses. He started receiving the letters in 1985 when he was in his 30s. Back then, he was overweight. He'd never had a serious girlfriend, always lived with his parents. After his mother died, he spent most of his time taking care of his sick dad and working at his family's restaurant. Jesse's favorite letters came from a woman named Pamala. JESSE: Yes, I usually took it at the end of the day when I got them in the mail, went into my room, and laid on my bed and just sat there and read them. Dear Jesse, deep down, you know as well as I do that you could be a lot better off than you are if you only had someone on your side, someone who would help you, encourage you, work with you, and stick with you even when things get bad. What I'm talking about, of course, is a true friend. But that kind of person is hard to find today, isn't it? VEDANTAM: Jesse had never met or talked to Pamala, but he was curious. He wrote back, telling her a little about himself. And Pamala replied again and again. The letters were typed in a girlish font and signed in a blue pen with big, loopy letters. In another letter, Pamala wrote, just before I sat down to write this letter to you, I was thinking how lucky I am that in this great, big, crazy world I found you. I hope I can be part of your life for a long time, darling. And I hope, as time goes by, I'll be able to make you happier and happier. This mystery woman seemed to know him. She made Jesse feel understood. She made him feel loved. JESSE: You can tell when you meet a person that they're not superficial, this is coming from their heart. Everybody's looking for that perfect love and everything. And this pops up. So I thought, well, could this be something different? DON LOWRY: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: This was Pamala. He was middle-aged, balding, and had a small, gray mustache. His real name was Don Lowry. Was any of it difficult to come up with these characters? Did the characters bore you? I mean, tell me about it as a writing project. D. LOWRY: (Laughter) No, no, I'd look at a photograph of the girl, and say, what kind of girl is this? Where is she from? What does she like to do? It was fairly easy after a while. The first 20 were a little bit rough, but the next 80 were not hard at all. VEDANTAM: And you enjoyed making up these characters? D. LOWRY: I loved it (laughter). Yeah, I loved it. I meant that (laughter). VEDANTAM: Don died in 2014, but I met him in 2011 in a rundown house in Butler, Pa. He was 82. If you have trouble understanding Don's voice, it's because he was a lifelong, heavy smoker. The desk in his living room was covered with ash. His sofa smelled of smoke. Don told me he always wanted to be a writer, but his real talent was in being a hustler. He always had a scheme going. In his early 30s, Don visited Mexico and wrote a traveler's guide where he explained how American men could live cheaply there, pick up women, and get by with rudimentary Spanish. D. LOWRY: It was called \u00e2\u0080\u009cMexico, Bachelor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Paradise. \u00e2\u0080\u009dVEDANTAM: It didn't sell. And then he tried something most writers would never consider. He changed the name of the book's author to a woman's name. Sales skyrocketed, he said. Apparently, lonely American men didn't want tips from a guy. They wanted tips from a girl. Don realized there was a market waiting to be exploited. He rented mailing lists from magazines that catered to single men and started writing letters to them, posing as different women. Men like Jesse were invited to join a club where, in exchange for a small fee, they could receive love letters. In a moment of inspiration, Don decided to call the women who wrote the letters angels - Angel Linda, Angel Kristina, Angel Pamala. He purchased stock photos of models and printed catalogs with photos and bios for each angel. Angels came in different flavors. Some were compliant, helpless and pure. Others were raunchy and sent nude photos of themselves. Most were young, and all were eager to please, dream women for a certain kind of man, dreamed up, of course, by another man. In one brochure, Angel Linda Scott is pictured in a one-piece swimsuit on her hands and knees. Angel Kristina looks like an idealistic woman. She's shown hugging a tree and holding a flower. I prefer a certain type of man, Christina says. He can pick up a handful of dark, rich soil and feel a kind of reverence and joy. But he's awfully hard to find. Don mailed these brochures to men like Jesse. If a man wrote back, Don began sending letters to him as Angel Kristina or Angel Linda. Don told me he didn't want members who were just looking for sex. He wanted men looking for meaningful relationships who would be in it for the long haul. He thought this would be better for business and better for the marks. D. LOWRY: A guy, his wife died, you know, and he was living alone. He didn't have any friends, you know, that kind of thing. He needed this. He didn't have anything or anybody else to cheer him up, nobody. We did it. These girls would boost their egos, you know, things like, oh, your handwriting is so masculine, things like that, little things. It gave the guy a boost. And they loved it. VEDANTAM: After a few letters to Jesse, Pamala let him know that the only thing she wanted was a little help. Darling, I want you to know that I really love writing you every day. It has filled a great need in my life, and I know I'd be very sad if I had to stop writing you and being your friend. I hope you feel the same way about me and my letters to you. I think it's fair and reasonable for me to ask you to help with the expenses of paper, envelopes, postage, photos and the other things I'll be sending you. If you could send me just $10 a week for my letters, I could continue writing every day as I have been. Jesse was fine with that. He figures he sent in $4,000 or $5,000 between 1985 and '88. It wasn't a big deal to him. JESSE: My business was prospering pretty well. We ran over $100,000 three years in a row, so it was no problem for me to be sending money and stuff, so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6VEDANTAM: Pamala often sent Jesse stories about the two of them for a little extra money. In one, Pamala and Jesse go on a picnic together. In another, he literally rescues her as a knight in shining armor. There's one story that has them both lying on a bearskin rug in front of a fireplace. And of course, it goes where you think it will go if two people are lying on a bearskin rug in front of a fireplace. But it's romantic, not explicit. The language is tame. The letter concludes, I lay beside you and whispered, good night, my sweet darling. Let us drift away to paradise in our dreams and wake up together to a new and wonderful day. I kiss you gently and fall asleep in your arms. OK, obviously cheesy, Don Lowry was not a gifted writer, but he was a gifted manipulator. When I first heard about the story, I assumed the men who signed up for the letters from the angels must have been such easy marks, so naive. Who else would buy such absurd fantasies? But then, I read the dozens and dozens of letters that Pamala sent Jesse. He saved them in a large binder, each letter in its own plastic sleeve. And as I read the letters, I started to understand the power of the psychological tools Don used to hook men like Jesse. Most of the letters aren't epic fantasies. Most are about the minutiae of Pamala's life. She goes to the bank. She talks to coworkers. She tells Jesse her thoughts on televangelists. Over and over, Pamala tells Jesse how much he means to her. She praises him, encourages him. When you read the letters one after the other, like Jesse did day after day after day, it paints a picture that feels real. I felt the Pamala in the letters was a real person. And I knew Don was writing them. There were other tricks. In one letter, Pamala asked Jesse to keep a picture of hers nearby as he read her letters so he would feel she was in the room with him. Jesse put up two photos of her on the wall. She once sent him a dime. In that letter, she told Jesse she had just had a strange day. Another driver bashed her car but didn't leave a note. Just when it looked like the day couldn't get any worse, she lost her purse. Depressed, Pamala spotted this very dime on the street. She picked it up, hoping it was a lucky charm. Later, a little boy showed up with her purse. A woman called and took responsibility for the car. Pamala told Jesse she was giving him her lucky dime. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jesse reading from the end of that letter. JESSE: (Reading) Keep this dime, darling. Let it always remind you that good people can still come into your life, and good things can still happen to you. And also think of this as a small token of my affection for you. If you hold it in your hand and squeeze it hard, you'll feel the warmth of my love coming out of it. VEDANTAM: Did you actually do that, Jesse? JESSE: Yes, I think I did do that and everything. VEDANTAM: Like I said, Jesse's mother had recently died, and his dad had heart trouble. He spent a lot of time looking after him. He wrote letters to Pamala, confiding in her about his depression. She sent him heartfelt letters about bad relationships she'd had. And she told him about visiting her grandfather, who was suffering from dementia. JESSE: That really took its toll on her, so I kind of bonded with that, knowing that she was going through the same thing that I was. Me and her kind of more or less bonded more than any other person I've ever talked to. It was kind of like a beacon from outside. It was like if you were a ship out at sea and you were looking for a lighthouse, which they used that in the deal, to look for the light and everything and guide yourself towards it, where you know that you'll have safe haven. VEDANTAM: I'm not sure I'm exactly following you. Is this something from one of the letters, where they basically talk about the lighthouse? JESSE: Yes, and, in fact, I got a little wooden figure of a lighthouse that she sent to me at one time and everything. It said, let this beacon know that somebody's out there looking out for you and everything. VEDANTAM: If Jesse had wanted to see it, there were plenty of signs the letters were mass produced. They look typed, but the paper doesn't have the indentations that come from typewriter keys. The signatures look like they've been stamped or printed. All the specifics in the letters are about Pamala's life. In the letters, did Pamala ever ask you how you were handling your mom's death? JESSE: Not that I remember, no, I don't think so. VEDANTAM: Did she ask how your dad's health was? JESSE: Not that I remember at this time, no. VEDANTAM: In fact, when I read Pamala's letters to Jesse, she never mentions any of the things he's told her. When Pamala talks about Jesse's life, she switches into generalities. I know you're sad. I know you're lonely. I know you're having a hard time. The only way the letters are personalized is that Jesse's name is sprinkled throughout, auto-filled, like a Mad Lib sheet. To Jesse, it didn't matter. He saw what he wanted to see. JESSE: At the time, I wasn't really fully absorbing all of that. I had a lot more on my plate, kind of in a turmoil with everything that was going on. So I just read them, and I kind of took some encouragement out of it. VEDANTAM: Did you ever have doubts about what was going on as you were receiving the letters? JESSE: Well, no, not at the time and everything. Like I said, I was glad to be getting letters from somebody and even though you're paying money for that because you have blinders on and not really paying attention to all of that. And like I said, when you're not the best looking person in the world, that somebody out of the blue that writes to you and tell you things and kind of build up your spirits and everything and stuff because everybody looks at you and stuff, it's kind of like the deal with the hunchback of Notre Dame. You'll never find anybody that will care for you, but there at the end, he wound up making a friend with the people that befriended him and everything. VEDANTAM: At a certain point, Pamala became the thing that kept Jesse afloat when he had to work long hours, when he had to close his restaurant and rush his father to the hospital. JESSE: Yes, there was one thing that really kindly touched me and everything. I was telling her I'm ready to give up and everything. And she just told me, get back on your feet and everything. So that really was a word of encouragement and everything. VEDANTAM: As Don went on, he realized his members were hooked, and he could take the fantasy further, much further. He invented an epic world for his angels with a magical backstory and a fantastic future. Here's how it worked. The angels supposedly live together in a retreat hidden away from the world. Most were lost souls, escaping drugs and bad men. These were women who needed a steady hand and a strong shoulder. As he invented more angels, Don came up with interweaving backstories. Some angels were good, some bad. Angels helped one another, backstabbed each other. All the men who signed up to join the Lonely Hearts Club understood they were joining an organization of goodhearted men who were devoted to taking care of the angels. The organization was known as The Call. Don promised members of The Call that they would one day move with the angels to a valley paradise into a giant building shaped like a naked woman lying down on the grass. This lady-shaped building would house meeting rooms and auditoriums. The paradise was to be called Chonda-Za. In exchange for their contributions, the members would have their needs looked after at Chonda-Za, all their needs. At the center of the entire fantasy was a matriarch, a saintly woman named Mother Maria. Maria collected and managed the money from the members, and she organized and disciplined the angels. She was said to have mystical powers and could revirginize fallen women. There were photos of Mother Maria. She was beautiful. Maria's photos were actually of a woman named Esther. She was Don's wife. Not all the members of The Call believed in Chonda-Za. Jesse stuffed the letters describing Chonda-Za in the back pocket of the binder. He figured it was just some wacky idea Pamala had and just ignored it. But there were other fish who found this hook tempting. KEN BLANCHARD: In my mind, you know, I always held this area of - tried not to be convinced, you know, 100 percent about it, you know. Surely, you know, this was too good to be true. VEDANTAM: This is Ken Blanchard. He's a big, gentle man, and was another member of The Call for many years. He was single when he joined, and he was still single when I met him in 2012. What was the draw? What did you tell yourself when you said, you know, this is too good to be true? BLANCHARD: Well, I think with me it was the prospect of maybe at least having some sort of communication with some women, you know, maybe my age, maybe, you know, maybe a little bit too much \u00e2\u0080\u0093 too young for me, maybe, you know, even then. But it sounded like a kind of a neat idea, you know, to, you know, be kind of on the leading edge of something like that, you know. Oh, jeez, I don't know. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, you know\u00e2\u0080\u00a6VEDANTAM: Well\u00e2\u0080\u00a6BLANCHARD: You know, like I say, I don't know what else there - how else to try to explain my part of it or, you know, belief in it or anything. They got me hooked, you know, on what they were saying and everything, and I believed them, so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6VEDANTAM: Don got hundreds of new sign-ups every year. Millions of dollars flowed back to Don's headquarters in Moline, Ill. He bought himself expensive cars, a Rolls-Royce and a Mercedes. He bought his sons and Esther everything they wanted. He got a big office in downtown Moline and operated a print shop. He hired assistants, salespeople and ghostwriters to expand his operation. By the mid-1980s, Don was writing love letters to more than 30,000 men. D. LOWRY: We had lawyers, doctors, professors, mechanics, bakers, you name it. All kinds of people were members. We even had a priest join The Call, really. VEDANTAM: Wait, that's not a Catholic priest. D. LOWRY: Yeah, a Catholic priest. VEDANTAM: What was he hoping to get out of it? D. LOWRY: Who the hell knows? He was probably just bored. VEDANTAM: To exploit this growing market, Don constantly experimented with new schemes and products. He started selling cassette tapes where the angels flirted with the men. He got into merch - mugs, puzzles, commemorative coins, all with angels' faces printed on them. D. LOWRY: And we sent out a pillow case with Angel Terri's face on it. And it said, now you can sleep with Angel Terri every night (laughter). We did a lot of things like that. VEDANTAM: The members weren't just sending in cash and checks. They were sending gifts. Ken sent Angel Vanessa a windbreaker. Others sent coats and shoes, even gardening equipment so the angels could grow vegetables at their secret retreat. Did you encourage them to send personal items? D. LOWRY: Oh, god, no, no, I hated that. Here's a guy. His wife died, and she left all kinds of jewelry and dresses and so on. He put them in a big cardboard box and mailed it to us. What the hell are we going to do with it, huh? VEDANTAM: Now what you wanted, of course, was you wanted them to send a check. D. LOWRY: Yeah, of course, or a money order or cash or anything (laughter). VEDANTAM: Did you tell them not to do it? D. LOWRY: Very subtly, I didn't want to hurt their feelings. They thought they were doing a great thing for the angels by sending these clothes. Yeah, I didn't want to hurt them. RICO LOWRY: My dad would blazingly just - he would have sidewalk sales, lingerie and gifts and jewelry. VEDANTAM: This is Don's son, Rico Lowry. R. LOWRY: And my dad would blazingly just \u00e2\u0080\u0093 he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be selling the lingerie on racks in front of the print shop. VEDANTAM: He would actually put up racks on the sidewalk in front of the print shop? R. LOWRY: Yep, yep, my dad had a very sarcastic and wicked sense of humor. VEDANTAM: A local police officer told me men from all over the country started showing up in Moline asking where they could find the angels. If they found their way to the print shop, Don called the cops on them. Dumbfounded police tried to explain to the men that there was no Angel Vanessa, no retreat, no Chonda-Za. But occasionally, if Don was in the mood, he'd actually allow them to meet female employees whom he had asked to pose as angels in photos. In time, Don even set up events for his most loyal members to meet the angels. He called them gatherings. At the gathering in Chicago, an advice columnist offered dating suggestions. A comedian told jokes. Angels in yellow-green dresses leaped around onstage in an interpretive dance. Jesse went to the Moline gathering. He was excited to finally meet Pamala. She looked just like she did in her pictures. In fact, she was one of Don's employees. And her name really was Pamala. She greeted Jesse warmly. But Jesse's excitement was tempered by the fact that there were a dozen other men at the gathering. Jesse was shocked to find that every man thought he was in a personal relationship with Pamala, too. They crowded around her, vying for her attention. JESSE: And then that's when it dawned on me. And I said, hey, this is not what I thought it would be or anything, that it was a rip-off. Well, that was like getting a kick in the stomach. It was upsetting and everything. We sent all that money and this and that and the other. And it wasn't what it was meant to be. It got you down to reality and stuff, so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6VEDANTAM: Jesse knew that Pamala liked music boxes, so he bought her an expensive one with a tiny record on it that played \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen The Saints Go Marching In. \u00e2\u0080\u009d Pamala loved it. He said she stared at it and let the record play. It went on and on and on. The other men stood around them and looked at Jesse. They looked at Pamala, then back to Jesse. He liked that he was making them jealous. Jesse didn't blame Pamala. He wasn't exactly sure how the scam worked, but he was sure that the woman standing before him was the same woman who wrote to him, that she was the one who had read his letters. The proof, Pamala's dog jumped into his lap. JESSE: She jumped on my lap twice and everything. That really surprised Pamala and that. So I guess she smelled my scent on the letters I was writing to her and everything and stuff, so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6VEDANTAM: We got in touch with Pamala to see if she remembered any of this, but she declined to be interviewed on tape for the story. She did confirm that she hadn't written the letters. Jesse made friends with a couple of other men at the meeting, particularly two guys named Lenny and Al. They were all like strangers who had independently watched the same soap opera for many years. JESSE: When we got to talking about it, I said, well, why did you write on to this and everything? Instead of bonding with the girls, we ended up talking each other and meeting new friends and talking about the troubles we had. So we kind of - well, they were just like me and everything. So we stayed in correspondence like they said. They wrote me letters, and they even called me at my restaurant to ask me how things were going and everything and finding out, asking about my dad and everything. So that kind of was encouraging to hear somebody calling to want to check on you and everything. VEDANTAM: In other words, they asked about all the personal stuff Pamala never asked about. Lenny and Al stayed in touch until they died. What finally brought Don Lowry's scam to an end was a woman named Susan Rasso. She was a model that Don had worked with. She had gotten into a car crash and called Don for help. He showed up at the hospital with a photographer. They unbandaged her wounds and took pictures. They sent these to all the men who were corresponding with Angel Susan and asked them for help in paying her medical bills. But, Don didn't give Susan the money. She went to the cops. KENNETH REXROTH: And she came to our office. She revealed the promises Mr. Lowry had made to her and broken. The return that Mr. Lowry received was staggering in terms of dollars and cents. VEDANTAM: This is Lt. Kenneth Rexroth of the Moline Police Department. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been aware of Don Lowry for years. He' turned away many men who'd come to the police station in search of the angels. And he'd been looking for a way to lock Don up. REXROTH: He was very diabolical. He's a sinister person. I consider Mr. Lowry to be an evil man. VEDANTAM: But thanks to Susan Rasso, the police finally had evidence to obtain subpoenas. They raided Don's print shop. They found out that some men sold everything in order to give their life savings to the angels. One man lived out of his car and forwarded his social security check to his angel. When the police got in touch with these guys, many of them realized for the first time that their treasured letters were written by a man. BLANCHARD: Well, what I was turned out to be angry about and more embarrassed about more than anything was the fact that he was even involved, that any man at all was even involved. VEDANTAM: Again, this is Ken Blanchard, who spent years receiving letters from Angel Vanessa. BLANCHARD: When I found out that these letters I had been getting all these times that I thought was some girl sharing something, you know, with me, well, then I find out it was him writing the darn thing, you know, I thought, my god, what the hell am I getting into? But I can laugh about it now, but I think at the time, I did have some feelings about that that weren't very charitable. VEDANTAM: Don's lawyer said that if members believed the angels were real, that was on them. As Don told me many years later\u00e2\u0080\u00a6D. LOWRY: People believe what they want to believe. You cannot dissuade them. Most members believed the angels lived forever in a never-never land called Retreat. We told them they live forever. They never grew old. Does that tell you anything, huh? VEDANTAM: Wait, you're surprised that they believed you? D. LOWRY: Yeah, yeah, and it helped them. I mean, it made them happy, so big deal. VEDANTAM: Don and Pamala were charged with mail fraud, conspiracy and money laundering. The press mobbed the trial. Don was shamed in the press, called a snake oil salesman at People magazine, which brings me back to what got me interested in the story in the first place, the thing that really surprised me. Many members flew from all over the country to show up at the courthouse in defense of The Call. Some stood outside with picket signs defending the brotherhood. Jesse and his friend, Al, were both there. As they waited outside the courtroom, Jesse saw Pamala come up. He rushed over to her. JESSE: She was walking up, and I noticed she was cold, so I took off my jacket and draped it over her shoulders, and we walked all the way up to the courthouse. I was kind of like a security guard. And after she went indoors, I took my coat off, and I backed off and everything. VEDANTAM: Did she say anything to you at that point? JESSE: No, not really. VEDANTAM: Members testified on the stand and said The Call had been a critical, beautiful part of their lives. One man said letters from the angels saved him from alcoholism and thoughts of suicide. Jesse testified, too. This is him reading a court transcript of what he said on the stand. JESSE: (Reading) Well, it gave you, like I said, inspiration to continue them no matter what the circumstances that you were going through, that if you persevered, you could make it. VEDANTAM: Do you remember saying this at the trial? JESSE: Yes, I do. VEDANTAM: Would you say that you still stand by what you said at trial? JESSE: Yes. VEDANTAM: So here's the thing, Jesse. You know, Don Lowry lied to you and sent you letters on behalf of someone else for many years. And you formed an emotional connection with this woman who was writing to you, when at the same time, you showed up at trial to essentially defend Don Lowry. And I'm trying to understand how and why you did that. JESSE: Well, like I said before, it wasn't actually defending him, but it was actually Pamala that was the one that we were all - we turned our attention to help her. And that meant helping Don also and everything. VEDANTAM: I understand that Don was really the mastermind of the operation, but when she showed up at these meetings and she presented herself as the same Pamala who was the Pamala in the letters, wasn't she lying to you? JESSE: Well, I guess you could think about that that way, yes. VEDANTAM: Did you ever think about it that way? JESSE: No, not until now and everything when all of this has been re-brought out and everything. VEDANTAM: Don and Pamala were both found guilty. Pamala served two years in prison. Don was in prison for 10 years. When I met Don, I asked him whether he felt he did anything wrong. D. LOWRY: I think I did something very wrong. I suppose I made it a little bit too real, you know. I did. I made it too real. VEDANTAM: Jesse lives alone now with his dog, Chewbacca. He's in his 60s and is still single. He's had some complications from diabetes recently and had parts of his foot amputated. It hasn't been easy. My producer, Stephanie Foo, visited him at his house in Texas. JESSE: I was in the hospital after my amputation, running around on my knee scooter. I said, you can still do this, keep going, and everything. So and I remember those words she told me. Get on your feet. So I do that and everything and keep going. STEPHANIE FOO, BYLINE: Wow, even now, even today. JESSE: Even today and everything and stuff, so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6FOO: So but basically that line, you know, get on your feet, it doesn't really matter who wrote it. JESSE: No, you think back, but it brings back fond memories of way back when. And you could be in your 100s and everything or older, and I hope to have this on my mind on down the line and everything and stuff, so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6VEDANTAM: Jesse still has the little wooden lighthouse Pamala sent him. It's on his dresser in his bedroom. And he still has two photos of Pamala in his den, one on the wall, one on his desk. In one, she's sitting in an office chair, hands in her lap, not glamorous or sexy or anything. Jesse says she's just sitting there, being herself. It's just a little something to say I made a friend. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST:  Welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m Shankar Vedantam. I did a story this past weekend for the public radio show, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis American Life. \u00e2\u0080\u009d The story was in an episode titled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Heart Wants What It Wants. \u00e2\u0080\u009d We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to take the whole podcast today to share this unusual story with you. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little longer than usual and best heard in a single sitting, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to give it to you without any interruptions. The story is about a con that folded very slowly over two decades. The thing that fascinated me about this story is that when the con was finally exposed, many of the victims were heartbroken. They wanted it to go on. They wanted to go keep believing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) VEDANTAM: So here's how the con worked. Guys around the country signed up for a pen pal service. It would put them in touch with women they could befriend and correspond with. And then they'd start to receive letters. JESSE: And they come from Hillsdale, Ill. Some of them are white, pink, green. VEDANTAM: Jesse is a sweet, soft-spoken man with fake plastic aviator glasses. He started receiving the letters in 1985 when he was in his 30s. Back then, he was overweight. He'd never had a serious girlfriend, always lived with his parents. After his mother died, he spent most of his time taking care of his sick dad and working at his family's restaurant. Jesse's favorite letters came from a woman named Pamala. JESSE: Yes, I usually took it at the end of the day when I got them in the mail, went into my room, and laid on my bed and just sat there and read them. Dear Jesse, deep down, you know as well as I do that you could be a lot better off than you are if you only had someone on your side, someone who would help you, encourage you, work with you, and stick with you even when things get bad. What I'm talking about, of course, is a true friend. But that kind of person is hard to find today, isn't it? VEDANTAM: Jesse had never met or talked to Pamala, but he was curious. He wrote back, telling her a little about himself. And Pamala replied again and again. The letters were typed in a girlish font and signed in a blue pen with big, loopy letters. In another letter, Pamala wrote, just before I sat down to write this letter to you, I was thinking how lucky I am that in this great, big, crazy world I found you. I hope I can be part of your life for a long time, darling. And I hope, as time goes by, I'll be able to make you happier and happier. This mystery woman seemed to know him. She made Jesse feel understood. She made him feel loved. JESSE: You can tell when you meet a person that they're not superficial, this is coming from their heart. Everybody's looking for that perfect love and everything. And this pops up. So I thought, well, could this be something different? DON LOWRY: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: This was Pamala. He was middle-aged, balding, and had a small, gray mustache. His real name was Don Lowry. Was any of it difficult to come up with these characters? Did the characters bore you? I mean, tell me about it as a writing project. D. LOWRY: (Laughter) No, no, I'd look at a photograph of the girl, and say, what kind of girl is this? Where is she from? What does she like to do? It was fairly easy after a while. The first 20 were a little bit rough, but the next 80 were not hard at all. VEDANTAM: And you enjoyed making up these characters? D. LOWRY: I loved it (laughter). Yeah, I loved it. I meant that (laughter). VEDANTAM: Don died in 2014, but I met him in 2011 in a rundown house in Butler, Pa. He was 82. If you have trouble understanding Don's voice, it's because he was a lifelong, heavy smoker. The desk in his living room was covered with ash. His sofa smelled of smoke. Don told me he always wanted to be a writer, but his real talent was in being a hustler. He always had a scheme going. In his early 30s, Don visited Mexico and wrote a traveler's guide where he explained how American men could live cheaply there, pick up women, and get by with rudimentary Spanish. D. LOWRY: It was called \u00e2\u0080\u009cMexico, Bachelor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Paradise. \u00e2\u0080\u009d VEDANTAM: It didn't sell. And then he tried something most writers would never consider. He changed the name of the book's author to a woman's name. Sales skyrocketed, he said. Apparently, lonely American men didn't want tips from a guy. They wanted tips from a girl. Don realized there was a market waiting to be exploited. He rented mailing lists from magazines that catered to single men and started writing letters to them, posing as different women. Men like Jesse were invited to join a club where, in exchange for a small fee, they could receive love letters. In a moment of inspiration, Don decided to call the women who wrote the letters angels - Angel Linda, Angel Kristina, Angel Pamala. He purchased stock photos of models and printed catalogs with photos and bios for each angel. Angels came in different flavors. Some were compliant, helpless and pure. Others were raunchy and sent nude photos of themselves. Most were young, and all were eager to please, dream women for a certain kind of man, dreamed up, of course, by another man. In one brochure, Angel Linda Scott is pictured in a one-piece swimsuit on her hands and knees. Angel Kristina looks like an idealistic woman. She's shown hugging a tree and holding a flower. I prefer a certain type of man, Christina says. He can pick up a handful of dark, rich soil and feel a kind of reverence and joy. But he's awfully hard to find. Don mailed these brochures to men like Jesse. If a man wrote back, Don began sending letters to him as Angel Kristina or Angel Linda. Don told me he didn't want members who were just looking for sex. He wanted men looking for meaningful relationships who would be in it for the long haul. He thought this would be better for business and better for the marks. D. LOWRY: A guy, his wife died, you know, and he was living alone. He didn't have any friends, you know, that kind of thing. He needed this. He didn't have anything or anybody else to cheer him up, nobody. We did it. These girls would boost their egos, you know, things like, oh, your handwriting is so masculine, things like that, little things. It gave the guy a boost. And they loved it. VEDANTAM: After a few letters to Jesse, Pamala let him know that the only thing she wanted was a little help. Darling, I want you to know that I really love writing you every day. It has filled a great need in my life, and I know I'd be very sad if I had to stop writing you and being your friend. I hope you feel the same way about me and my letters to you. I think it's fair and reasonable for me to ask you to help with the expenses of paper, envelopes, postage, photos and the other things I'll be sending you. If you could send me just $10 a week for my letters, I could continue writing every day as I have been. Jesse was fine with that. He figures he sent in $4,000 or $5,000 between 1985 and '88. It wasn't a big deal to him. JESSE: My business was prospering pretty well. We ran over $100,000 three years in a row, so it was no problem for me to be sending money and stuff, so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 VEDANTAM: Pamala often sent Jesse stories about the two of them for a little extra money. In one, Pamala and Jesse go on a picnic together. In another, he literally rescues her as a knight in shining armor. There's one story that has them both lying on a bearskin rug in front of a fireplace. And of course, it goes where you think it will go if two people are lying on a bearskin rug in front of a fireplace. But it's romantic, not explicit. The language is tame. The letter concludes, I lay beside you and whispered, good night, my sweet darling. Let us drift away to paradise in our dreams and wake up together to a new and wonderful day. I kiss you gently and fall asleep in your arms. OK, obviously cheesy, Don Lowry was not a gifted writer, but he was a gifted manipulator. When I first heard about the story, I assumed the men who signed up for the letters from the angels must have been such easy marks, so naive. Who else would buy such absurd fantasies? But then, I read the dozens and dozens of letters that Pamala sent Jesse. He saved them in a large binder, each letter in its own plastic sleeve. And as I read the letters, I started to understand the power of the psychological tools Don used to hook men like Jesse. Most of the letters aren't epic fantasies. Most are about the minutiae of Pamala's life. She goes to the bank. She talks to coworkers. She tells Jesse her thoughts on televangelists. Over and over, Pamala tells Jesse how much he means to her. She praises him, encourages him. When you read the letters one after the other, like Jesse did day after day after day, it paints a picture that feels real. I felt the Pamala in the letters was a real person. And I knew Don was writing them. There were other tricks. In one letter, Pamala asked Jesse to keep a picture of hers nearby as he read her letters so he would feel she was in the room with him. Jesse put up two photos of her on the wall. She once sent him a dime. In that letter, she told Jesse she had just had a strange day. Another driver bashed her car but didn't leave a note. Just when it looked like the day couldn't get any worse, she lost her purse. Depressed, Pamala spotted this very dime on the street. She picked it up, hoping it was a lucky charm. Later, a little boy showed up with her purse. A woman called and took responsibility for the car. Pamala told Jesse she was giving him her lucky dime. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jesse reading from the end of that letter. JESSE: (Reading) Keep this dime, darling. Let it always remind you that good people can still come into your life, and good things can still happen to you. And also think of this as a small token of my affection for you. If you hold it in your hand and squeeze it hard, you'll feel the warmth of my love coming out of it. VEDANTAM: Did you actually do that, Jesse? JESSE: Yes, I think I did do that and everything. VEDANTAM: Like I said, Jesse's mother had recently died, and his dad had heart trouble. He spent a lot of time looking after him. He wrote letters to Pamala, confiding in her about his depression. She sent him heartfelt letters about bad relationships she'd had. And she told him about visiting her grandfather, who was suffering from dementia. JESSE: That really took its toll on her, so I kind of bonded with that, knowing that she was going through the same thing that I was. Me and her kind of more or less bonded more than any other person I've ever talked to. It was kind of like a beacon from outside. It was like if you were a ship out at sea and you were looking for a lighthouse, which they used that in the deal, to look for the light and everything and guide yourself towards it, where you know that you'll have safe haven. VEDANTAM: I'm not sure I'm exactly following you. Is this something from one of the letters, where they basically talk about the lighthouse? JESSE: Yes, and, in fact, I got a little wooden figure of a lighthouse that she sent to me at one time and everything. It said, let this beacon know that somebody's out there looking out for you and everything. VEDANTAM: If Jesse had wanted to see it, there were plenty of signs the letters were mass produced. They look typed, but the paper doesn't have the indentations that come from typewriter keys. The signatures look like they've been stamped or printed. All the specifics in the letters are about Pamala's life. In the letters, did Pamala ever ask you how you were handling your mom's death? JESSE: Not that I remember, no, I don't think so. VEDANTAM: Did she ask how your dad's health was? JESSE: Not that I remember at this time, no. VEDANTAM: In fact, when I read Pamala's letters to Jesse, she never mentions any of the things he's told her. When Pamala talks about Jesse's life, she switches into generalities. I know you're sad. I know you're lonely. I know you're having a hard time. The only way the letters are personalized is that Jesse's name is sprinkled throughout, auto-filled, like a Mad Lib sheet. To Jesse, it didn't matter. He saw what he wanted to see. JESSE: At the time, I wasn't really fully absorbing all of that. I had a lot more on my plate, kind of in a turmoil with everything that was going on. So I just read them, and I kind of took some encouragement out of it. VEDANTAM: Did you ever have doubts about what was going on as you were receiving the letters? JESSE: Well, no, not at the time and everything. Like I said, I was glad to be getting letters from somebody and even though you're paying money for that because you have blinders on and not really paying attention to all of that. And like I said, when you're not the best looking person in the world, that somebody out of the blue that writes to you and tell you things and kind of build up your spirits and everything and stuff because everybody looks at you and stuff, it's kind of like the deal with the hunchback of Notre Dame. You'll never find anybody that will care for you, but there at the end, he wound up making a friend with the people that befriended him and everything. VEDANTAM: At a certain point, Pamala became the thing that kept Jesse afloat when he had to work long hours, when he had to close his restaurant and rush his father to the hospital. JESSE: Yes, there was one thing that really kindly touched me and everything. I was telling her I'm ready to give up and everything. And she just told me, get back on your feet and everything. So that really was a word of encouragement and everything. VEDANTAM: As Don went on, he realized his members were hooked, and he could take the fantasy further, much further. He invented an epic world for his angels with a magical backstory and a fantastic future. Here's how it worked. The angels supposedly live together in a retreat hidden away from the world. Most were lost souls, escaping drugs and bad men. These were women who needed a steady hand and a strong shoulder. As he invented more angels, Don came up with interweaving backstories. Some angels were good, some bad. Angels helped one another, backstabbed each other. All the men who signed up to join the Lonely Hearts Club understood they were joining an organization of goodhearted men who were devoted to taking care of the angels. The organization was known as The Call. Don promised members of The Call that they would one day move with the angels to a valley paradise into a giant building shaped like a naked woman lying down on the grass. This lady-shaped building would house meeting rooms and auditoriums. The paradise was to be called Chonda-Za. In exchange for their contributions, the members would have their needs looked after at Chonda-Za, all their needs. At the center of the entire fantasy was a matriarch, a saintly woman named Mother Maria. Maria collected and managed the money from the members, and she organized and disciplined the angels. She was said to have mystical powers and could revirginize fallen women. There were photos of Mother Maria. She was beautiful. Maria's photos were actually of a woman named Esther. She was Don's wife. Not all the members of The Call believed in Chonda-Za. Jesse stuffed the letters describing Chonda-Za in the back pocket of the binder. He figured it was just some wacky idea Pamala had and just ignored it. But there were other fish who found this hook tempting. KEN BLANCHARD: In my mind, you know, I always held this area of - tried not to be convinced, you know, 100 percent about it, you know. Surely, you know, this was too good to be true. VEDANTAM: This is Ken Blanchard. He's a big, gentle man, and was another member of The Call for many years. He was single when he joined, and he was still single when I met him in 2012. What was the draw? What did you tell yourself when you said, you know, this is too good to be true? BLANCHARD: Well, I think with me it was the prospect of maybe at least having some sort of communication with some women, you know, maybe my age, maybe, you know, maybe a little bit too much \u00e2\u0080\u0093 too young for me, maybe, you know, even then. But it sounded like a kind of a neat idea, you know, to, you know, be kind of on the leading edge of something like that, you know. Oh, jeez, I don't know. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, you know\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 VEDANTAM: Well\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 BLANCHARD: You know, like I say, I don't know what else there - how else to try to explain my part of it or, you know, belief in it or anything. They got me hooked, you know, on what they were saying and everything, and I believed them, so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 VEDANTAM: Don got hundreds of new sign-ups every year. Millions of dollars flowed back to Don's headquarters in Moline, Ill. He bought himself expensive cars, a Rolls-Royce and a Mercedes. He bought his sons and Esther everything they wanted. He got a big office in downtown Moline and operated a print shop. He hired assistants, salespeople and ghostwriters to expand his operation. By the mid-1980s, Don was writing love letters to more than 30,000 men. D. LOWRY: We had lawyers, doctors, professors, mechanics, bakers, you name it. All kinds of people were members. We even had a priest join The Call, really. VEDANTAM: Wait, that's not a Catholic priest. D. LOWRY: Yeah, a Catholic priest. VEDANTAM: What was he hoping to get out of it? D. LOWRY: Who the hell knows? He was probably just bored. VEDANTAM: To exploit this growing market, Don constantly experimented with new schemes and products. He started selling cassette tapes where the angels flirted with the men. He got into merch - mugs, puzzles, commemorative coins, all with angels' faces printed on them. D. LOWRY: And we sent out a pillow case with Angel Terri's face on it. And it said, now you can sleep with Angel Terri every night (laughter). We did a lot of things like that. VEDANTAM: The members weren't just sending in cash and checks. They were sending gifts. Ken sent Angel Vanessa a windbreaker. Others sent coats and shoes, even gardening equipment so the angels could grow vegetables at their secret retreat. Did you encourage them to send personal items? D. LOWRY: Oh, god, no, no, I hated that. Here's a guy. His wife died, and she left all kinds of jewelry and dresses and so on. He put them in a big cardboard box and mailed it to us. What the hell are we going to do with it, huh? VEDANTAM: Now what you wanted, of course, was you wanted them to send a check. D. LOWRY: Yeah, of course, or a money order or cash or anything (laughter). VEDANTAM: Did you tell them not to do it? D. LOWRY: Very subtly, I didn't want to hurt their feelings. They thought they were doing a great thing for the angels by sending these clothes. Yeah, I didn't want to hurt them. RICO LOWRY: My dad would blazingly just - he would have sidewalk sales, lingerie and gifts and jewelry. VEDANTAM: This is Don's son, Rico Lowry. R. LOWRY: And my dad would blazingly just \u00e2\u0080\u0093 he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be selling the lingerie on racks in front of the print shop. VEDANTAM: He would actually put up racks on the sidewalk in front of the print shop? R. LOWRY: Yep, yep, my dad had a very sarcastic and wicked sense of humor. VEDANTAM: A local police officer told me men from all over the country started showing up in Moline asking where they could find the angels. If they found their way to the print shop, Don called the cops on them. Dumbfounded police tried to explain to the men that there was no Angel Vanessa, no retreat, no Chonda-Za. But occasionally, if Don was in the mood, he'd actually allow them to meet female employees whom he had asked to pose as angels in photos. In time, Don even set up events for his most loyal members to meet the angels. He called them gatherings. At the gathering in Chicago, an advice columnist offered dating suggestions. A comedian told jokes. Angels in yellow-green dresses leaped around onstage in an interpretive dance. Jesse went to the Moline gathering. He was excited to finally meet Pamala. She looked just like she did in her pictures. In fact, she was one of Don's employees. And her name really was Pamala. She greeted Jesse warmly. But Jesse's excitement was tempered by the fact that there were a dozen other men at the gathering. Jesse was shocked to find that every man thought he was in a personal relationship with Pamala, too. They crowded around her, vying for her attention. JESSE: And then that's when it dawned on me. And I said, hey, this is not what I thought it would be or anything, that it was a rip-off. Well, that was like getting a kick in the stomach. It was upsetting and everything. We sent all that money and this and that and the other. And it wasn't what it was meant to be. It got you down to reality and stuff, so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 VEDANTAM: Jesse knew that Pamala liked music boxes, so he bought her an expensive one with a tiny record on it that played \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen The Saints Go Marching In. \u00e2\u0080\u009d Pamala loved it. He said she stared at it and let the record play. It went on and on and on. The other men stood around them and looked at Jesse. They looked at Pamala, then back to Jesse. He liked that he was making them jealous. Jesse didn't blame Pamala. He wasn't exactly sure how the scam worked, but he was sure that the woman standing before him was the same woman who wrote to him, that she was the one who had read his letters. The proof, Pamala's dog jumped into his lap. JESSE: She jumped on my lap twice and everything. That really surprised Pamala and that. So I guess she smelled my scent on the letters I was writing to her and everything and stuff, so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 VEDANTAM: We got in touch with Pamala to see if she remembered any of this, but she declined to be interviewed on tape for the story. She did confirm that she hadn't written the letters. Jesse made friends with a couple of other men at the meeting, particularly two guys named Lenny and Al. They were all like strangers who had independently watched the same soap opera for many years. JESSE: When we got to talking about it, I said, well, why did you write on to this and everything? Instead of bonding with the girls, we ended up talking each other and meeting new friends and talking about the troubles we had. So we kind of - well, they were just like me and everything. So we stayed in correspondence like they said. They wrote me letters, and they even called me at my restaurant to ask me how things were going and everything and finding out, asking about my dad and everything. So that kind of was encouraging to hear somebody calling to want to check on you and everything. VEDANTAM: In other words, they asked about all the personal stuff Pamala never asked about. Lenny and Al stayed in touch until they died. What finally brought Don Lowry's scam to an end was a woman named Susan Rasso. She was a model that Don had worked with. She had gotten into a car crash and called Don for help. He showed up at the hospital with a photographer. They unbandaged her wounds and took pictures. They sent these to all the men who were corresponding with Angel Susan and asked them for help in paying her medical bills. But, Don didn't give Susan the money. She went to the cops. KENNETH REXROTH: And she came to our office. She revealed the promises Mr. Lowry had made to her and broken. The return that Mr. Lowry received was staggering in terms of dollars and cents. VEDANTAM: This is Lt. Kenneth Rexroth of the Moline Police Department. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been aware of Don Lowry for years. He' turned away many men who'd come to the police station in search of the angels. And he'd been looking for a way to lock Don up. REXROTH: He was very diabolical. He's a sinister person. I consider Mr. Lowry to be an evil man. VEDANTAM: But thanks to Susan Rasso, the police finally had evidence to obtain subpoenas. They raided Don's print shop. They found out that some men sold everything in order to give their life savings to the angels. One man lived out of his car and forwarded his social security check to his angel. When the police got in touch with these guys, many of them realized for the first time that their treasured letters were written by a man. BLANCHARD: Well, what I was turned out to be angry about and more embarrassed about more than anything was the fact that he was even involved, that any man at all was even involved. VEDANTAM: Again, this is Ken Blanchard, who spent years receiving letters from Angel Vanessa. BLANCHARD: When I found out that these letters I had been getting all these times that I thought was some girl sharing something, you know, with me, well, then I find out it was him writing the darn thing, you know, I thought, my god, what the hell am I getting into? But I can laugh about it now, but I think at the time, I did have some feelings about that that weren't very charitable. VEDANTAM: Don's lawyer said that if members believed the angels were real, that was on them. As Don told me many years later\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 D. LOWRY: People believe what they want to believe. You cannot dissuade them. Most members believed the angels lived forever in a never-never land called Retreat. We told them they live forever. They never grew old. Does that tell you anything, huh? VEDANTAM: Wait, you're surprised that they believed you? D. LOWRY: Yeah, yeah, and it helped them. I mean, it made them happy, so big deal. VEDANTAM: Don and Pamala were charged with mail fraud, conspiracy and money laundering. The press mobbed the trial. Don was shamed in the press, called a snake oil salesman at People magazine, which brings me back to what got me interested in the story in the first place, the thing that really surprised me. Many members flew from all over the country to show up at the courthouse in defense of The Call. Some stood outside with picket signs defending the brotherhood. Jesse and his friend, Al, were both there. As they waited outside the courtroom, Jesse saw Pamala come up. He rushed over to her. JESSE: She was walking up, and I noticed she was cold, so I took off my jacket and draped it over her shoulders, and we walked all the way up to the courthouse. I was kind of like a security guard. And after she went indoors, I took my coat off, and I backed off and everything. VEDANTAM: Did she say anything to you at that point? JESSE: No, not really. VEDANTAM: Members testified on the stand and said The Call had been a critical, beautiful part of their lives. One man said letters from the angels saved him from alcoholism and thoughts of suicide. Jesse testified, too. This is him reading a court transcript of what he said on the stand. JESSE: (Reading) Well, it gave you, like I said, inspiration to continue them no matter what the circumstances that you were going through, that if you persevered, you could make it. VEDANTAM: Do you remember saying this at the trial? JESSE: Yes, I do. VEDANTAM: Would you say that you still stand by what you said at trial? JESSE: Yes. VEDANTAM: So here's the thing, Jesse. You know, Don Lowry lied to you and sent you letters on behalf of someone else for many years. And you formed an emotional connection with this woman who was writing to you, when at the same time, you showed up at trial to essentially defend Don Lowry. And I'm trying to understand how and why you did that. JESSE: Well, like I said before, it wasn't actually defending him, but it was actually Pamala that was the one that we were all - we turned our attention to help her. And that meant helping Don also and everything. VEDANTAM: I understand that Don was really the mastermind of the operation, but when she showed up at these meetings and she presented herself as the same Pamala who was the Pamala in the letters, wasn't she lying to you? JESSE: Well, I guess you could think about that that way, yes. VEDANTAM: Did you ever think about it that way? JESSE: No, not until now and everything when all of this has been re-brought out and everything. VEDANTAM: Don and Pamala were both found guilty. Pamala served two years in prison. Don was in prison for 10 years. When I met Don, I asked him whether he felt he did anything wrong. D. LOWRY: I think I did something very wrong. I suppose I made it a little bit too real, you know. I did. I made it too real. VEDANTAM: Jesse lives alone now with his dog, Chewbacca. He's in his 60s and is still single. He's had some complications from diabetes recently and had parts of his foot amputated. It hasn't been easy. My producer, Stephanie Foo, visited him at his house in Texas. JESSE: I was in the hospital after my amputation, running around on my knee scooter. I said, you can still do this, keep going, and everything. So and I remember those words she told me. Get on your feet. So I do that and everything and keep going. STEPHANIE FOO, BYLINE: Wow, even now, even today. JESSE: Even today and everything and stuff, so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 FOO: So but basically that line, you know, get on your feet, it doesn't really matter who wrote it. JESSE: No, you think back, but it brings back fond memories of way back when. And you could be in your 100s and everything or older, and I hope to have this on my mind on down the line and everything and stuff, so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 VEDANTAM: Jesse still has the little wooden lighthouse Pamala sent him. It's on his dresser in his bedroom. And he still has two photos of Pamala in his den, one on the wall, one on his desk. In one, she's sitting in an office chair, hands in her lap, not glamorous or sexy or anything. Jesse says she's just sitting there, being herself. It's just a little something to say I made a friend.", "section": "Hidden Brain", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2015 NPR.  All rights reserved.

GUERIN: If you live in a city, the night sky in western North Dakota will blow your mind. The stars are bright, and there are so many more that you can see. But astronomy buff Jay Bjerke notices something's missing. JAY BJERKE: Over there. GUERIN: He points at a butte that's silhouetted by a soft glow. BJERKE: You can't see stars between the horizon and 20 degrees up. That's the oil fields. GUERIN: Half a dozen natural gas flares are blazing just outside the park fence. Park ranger Jeff Zylland knows because he spent many nights this summer driving gravel roads in the dark trying to find the sources of light pollution. JEFF ZYLLAND: Yeah, there's light coming out from the flares, but there's all of these trucking facilities and gas stations and even cities that are just growing. GUERIN: The National Park Service actually measures light pollution with a special camera. It found that between 2010 and 2013, light pollution in the park's north unit increased by 500 percent - faster than at any other national park in the country. EILEEN ANDES: It's really hard to get in front of something that is moving that fast and that's that big. GUERIN: Park ranger Eileen Andes says they've been in triage mode here since the oil boom began. They're just now getting to light pollution. But things are further along at another site where oil fields threaten the night sky, the University of Texas McDonald Observatory. BILL WREN: Our goal is nothing short of changing the way the oil and gas industry lights their nighttime activities. GUERIN: Bill Wren is on a mission to keep West Texas dark. His colleagues are already straining to see faint light from distant stars. WREN: And yeah, if the sky gets brighter than the faint source we're trying to see then it's lost. GUERIN: When oil and gas development in the nearby Permian Basin took off a few years ago, Wren got worried and looked into enforcing some of the existing lighting ordinances passed decades ago to protect the observatory. WREN: I've had one person in the industry comment to me that if you start writing tickets, we're going to aim lights up in the sky just to piss you off. GUERIN: So Wren changed his approach, instead reaching out to some of the oil men to explain the problem. Most of them had never thought about lighting before. STACY LOCKE: Not at all. GUERIN: Stacy Locke is the CEO of Pioneer Energy Services. He's also a man with a soft spot for the starry West Texas sky. LOCKE: You know, it's just one of the great assets of that area. You just have dark skies. You can see stars from horizon to horizon. GUERIN: He wanted to help, and the fixes were pretty simple - point lights down, not up, and switch to warmer-colored bulbs. Together, Locke and Wren have written a paper about best practices. Stacy Locke says the key is getting the companies that own the well sites on board. LOCKE: They hire all of the service providers so they can mandate that, hey, if you want to work for me, your equipment has to be dark sky-compliant.

RAZ: You know, this is the first time in 18 years I've interviewed somebody named Guy. GUY WINCH: Really? Well, congratulations. RAZ: This is Guy Winch. He's an author and a psychologist. WINCH: Yeah, it's the first time I've been interviewed by someone called Guy. So we're both having firsts. RAZ: OK so kind of a personal question here. Do you ever wake up, you know, and for no particular reason just feel, like, really crappy? Like, bad about yourself? WINCH: You know, to be honest with you, I'm a morning person (laughter) so I usually wake up in a good mood. I know, it's very annoying. RAZ: Yeah, it's very annoying. And he does this by taking care of what he calls his emotional hygiene. And just like most of us will get a cold or a stomach bug or a headache a few times a year, Guy points out that, you know, we also go through periods where our mental health also isn't 100 percent. And so he's been arguing that we have to take care of our minds just like we do our bodies. Here's Guy Winch on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WINCH: I recently was at a friend's house, and their 5-year-old was getting ready for bed. He was standing on a stool by the sink brushing his teeth, when he slipped and scratched his leg on the stool when he fell. He cried for a minute, but then he got back up, got back on the stool, and reached out for a box of Band-Aids to put one on his cut. Now, this kid could barely tie his shoelaces, but he knew you have a cover cut so doesn't become infected and you have to care for your teeth by brushing twice a day. We all know how to maintain our physical health and how to practice dental hygiene, right? We know it since we were 5 years old. But what do we know about maintaining our psychological health? Well, nothing. What do we teach our children about emotional hygiene? Nothing. How is it we spend more time taking care of our teeth than we do our minds? RAZ: I mean when you say hygiene, I'm thinking, you know, like you said, you know, brushing my teeth at night and washing my face. And you're saying that we need to think about what's inside our head a little bit in the same way. WINCH: Right. And to me the most obvious example of that is negative self-talk. In other words, we say things to ourselves we would never consider saying to anyone else. That habit of becoming extraordinarily self-critical and self-punitive is about as opposite as emotional hygiene as can be. It is akin to taking a swim in a sea of bacteria when you have a cold - oh, let's just bathe in this for a bit and see what happens. No one would do that. I once worked with this woman who, after 20 years of marriage and an extremely ugly divorce, was finally ready for her first date. She had met this guy online and he seemed nice and he seemed successful, and most importantly, he seemed really into her. So she was very excited. She bought a new dress, and they met at an upscale New York City bar for a drink. Ten minutes into the date, the man stands up and says, I'm not interested, and walks out. Rejection is extremely painful. The woman was so hurt she couldn't move. All she could do was call a friend. And here's what the friend said - well, what do you expect? You have big hips, you have nothing interesting to say. Why would a handsome, successful man like that ever go out with a loser like you? Shocking, right, that a friend can be so cruel? But it would be much less shocking if I told you it wasn't the friend who said that. It's what the woman said to herself. And that's something we all do, especially after a rejection. We all start thinking of all our faults and all our shortcomings, what we wish we were, what we wish we weren't. We call ourselves names. Maybe not as harshly, but we all do it. RAZ: So what can you do to avoid that kind of thing? I mean, if we all do this thing that you're describing in the talk, I mean, how do we stop that voice? WINCH: So first of all, I say to people when I hear that, I say, what utility do you feel you get out of being so self-critical? What it will do is it will absolutely annihilate your self-confidence. Now, I do agree that in certain situations you do need to go over and look at your culpability, or your responsibility, or what errors you might have made, but not in a self-critical manner. What I recommend to people is, become like a detective. Detectives are impartial - or, supposed to be. They just look for clues and facts to conclude things. That's the approach you need to have to look at your mistakes. Be impartial about it. RAZ: OK so aside from, you know, like, not talking to yourself in a negative way, you know, what else could we do? WINCH: I'm actually big on gratitude. I'm grateful every day for my health. I'm grateful every day for my relationships. And any time you encounter a stumbling block or a failure, you have to remind yourself that you're capable. I - when I am having a hard time with writing, for example, I will go and I will reread something I wrote that I really thought was good to remind myself, no, no, you can actually write well, you just need to figure out how to do this thing well. You have to remind yourself that this is a hurdle. The question is, how do I get around it, not, whether I should try. It's a very different way of thinking than why did the hurdle happen to me? Why do hurdles always happen to me? Those are always very unfruitful lines of thought because they actually don't tell you anything about the hurdle. WINCH: You know, a hundred years ago, people began practicing personal hygiene, and life expectancy rates rose by over 50 percent in just a matter of decades. I believe our quality of life could rise just as dramatically if we all began practicing emotional hygiene. Can you imagine what the world would be like if everyone were psychologically healthier, if there were less loneliness and less depression, if people knew how to overcome failure? I can. Because that's the world I want to live in. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Guy Winch is a psychologist and author of \"Emotional First Aid. \" You can see his entire talk at Ted. com. Our show today, Headspace, ideas about our emotional well-being. Stay with us. I'm Guy Raz, and this is the TED Radio Hour from NPR. GUY RAZ, HOST:  On the show today, ideas about how we approach our emotional well-being and why it's important to open up about the feelings we usually want to hide. RAZ: You know, this is the first time in 18 years I've interviewed somebody named Guy. GUY WINCH: Really? Well, congratulations. RAZ: This is Guy Winch. He's an author and a psychologist. WINCH: Yeah, it's the first time I've been interviewed by someone called Guy. So we're both having firsts. RAZ: OK so kind of a personal question here. Do you ever wake up, you know, and for no particular reason just feel, like, really crappy? Like, bad about yourself? WINCH: You know, to be honest with you, I'm a morning person (laughter) so I usually wake up in a good mood. I know, it's very annoying. RAZ: Yeah, it's very annoying. And he does this by taking care of what he calls his emotional hygiene. And just like most of us will get a cold or a stomach bug or a headache a few times a year, Guy points out that, you know, we also go through periods where our mental health also isn't 100 percent. And so he's been arguing that we have to take care of our minds just like we do our bodies. Here's Guy Winch on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) WINCH: I recently was at a friend's house, and their 5-year-old was getting ready for bed. He was standing on a stool by the sink brushing his teeth, when he slipped and scratched his leg on the stool when he fell. He cried for a minute, but then he got back up, got back on the stool, and reached out for a box of Band-Aids to put one on his cut. Now, this kid could barely tie his shoelaces, but he knew you have a cover cut so doesn't become infected and you have to care for your teeth by brushing twice a day. We all know how to maintain our physical health and how to practice dental hygiene, right? We know it since we were 5 years old. But what do we know about maintaining our psychological health? Well, nothing. What do we teach our children about emotional hygiene? Nothing. How is it we spend more time taking care of our teeth than we do our minds? RAZ: I mean when you say hygiene, I'm thinking, you know, like you said, you know, brushing my teeth at night and washing my face. And you're saying that we need to think about what's inside our head a little bit in the same way. WINCH: Right. And to me the most obvious example of that is negative self-talk. In other words, we say things to ourselves we would never consider saying to anyone else. That habit of becoming extraordinarily self-critical and self-punitive is about as opposite as emotional hygiene as can be. It is akin to taking a swim in a sea of bacteria when you have a cold - oh, let's just bathe in this for a bit and see what happens. No one would do that. I once worked with this woman who, after 20 years of marriage and an extremely ugly divorce, was finally ready for her first date. She had met this guy online and he seemed nice and he seemed successful, and most importantly, he seemed really into her. So she was very excited. She bought a new dress, and they met at an upscale New York City bar for a drink. Ten minutes into the date, the man stands up and says, I'm not interested, and walks out. Rejection is extremely painful. The woman was so hurt she couldn't move. All she could do was call a friend. And here's what the friend said - well, what do you expect?

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, Headspace, ideas about our emotional well-being and the problems of the mind, problems we don't always discuss. And earlier in the show, you heard from writer Andrew Solomon and his experience with depression. It started around 1991, right after Andrew found out his mom was dying. And at the time, he'd been living in the U. K. So Andrew moved back to the U. S. , back to New York, where he was born, to be with her. ANDREW SOLOMON: I moved back in 1991, and then my mother died shortly thereafter. And my first book was published just after that. Before I moved back, a relationship I'd been in that I had thought might be a long-term and permanent one ended rather catastrophically, I think because I was so emotionally preoccupied with my mother's illness and death. I weathered the storms of 1991 fairly well, and got through in reasonably good shape. And then I found over the years that followed that I began to get sort of disconnected. RAZ: Many years later, after Andrew got his Ph. D. in psychology and then won almost every major award in literature for his writing on depression, he kind of grew to understand that is this how it starts for so many people. It's not, like, a sudden strike of sadness, but more of a gradual graying out of everything that matters. SOLOMON: I went from being full of grief and sorrow to a feeling instead of withdrawal and distance from what was happening to me. RAZ: What did you notice that was happening inside of you? SOLOMON: I often say that the opposite of depression is not happiness but vitality. And I think what began to disappear was vitality. But I was depressed and feeling kind of withdrawn and thinking, well, you know, I feel depressed because there's stuff that's wrong with my life. And anyone who experiences depression automatically thinks, I'm depressed because there are problems in my life - because there are problems in everyone's lives. And initially, you can attach your depression to whatever it is that's gone wrong in your life, and sometimes what's gone wrong in your life is in fact what's triggered the depression. I didn't understand how out of proportion it was until I got to the point of really having a breakdown. RAZ: And that breakdown? Here's how Andrew Solomon described it on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOLOMON: Finally, one day I woke up and I thought perhaps I'd had a stroke because I lay in bed completely frozen looking at the telephone thinking, something is wrong and I should call for help. And I couldn't reach out my arm and pick up the phone and dial. And finally, after four full hours of my lying and staring at it, the phone rang and somehow I managed to pick it up. And it was my father. And I said, I'm in serious trouble, we need to do something. The next day, I started with the medications and the therapy. I had two advantages as I went into the fight. The first is that I knew that, objectively speaking, I had a nice life, and that if I could only get well, there was something at the other end that was worth living for. And the other was that I had access to good treatment. But I nonetheless emerged and relapsed, and emerged and relapsed, and emerged and relapsed and finally understood I would have to be on medication and in therapy forever. And I thought, but is it a chemical problem or a psychological problem? And does it need a chemical cure or a philosophical cure? And I couldn't figure out which it was. And then I understood that, actually, the chemical cure and the psychological cure both have a role to play, and I also figured out that depression was something that was braided so deep into us that there was no separating it from our character and personality. RAZ: Why does it seem like such an important question to us, you know, like, is my depression chemical or psychological? SOLOMON: I think these are all different vocabularies for the same set of experiences. Anyone who is depressed has different things going on chemically in their brain. And anyone who is depressed is having feelings and sensations that are specific to depression. There are two points of confusion. The first is to think that they're two different ideas or two different experiences that are somehow in competition - which one is it really? - as though it were really one thing when not really the other. But the other is the confusion which people think that if you can figure out the etiology, the origin of the depression, that that dictates the cure. The fact that your depression was triggered by external circumstances doesn't mean that it will be unresponsive to medication. And the fact that your depression has chemical manifestations does not mean it will be unresponsive to conversation or dialogue or talk therapy of some kind. RAZ: What else, you know, do you think that we do not understand or misunderstand about depression? SOLOMON: Well, we don't understand what it is really. I mean, we have seen various areas of the brain that are over activated, or under activated or irregularly activated, but we don't really understand where it is located. We don't understand why the medications that help so many people are helpful really. I mean, it looks more and more as though they encourage neuronal growth and as though that has some positive effects, but it's still very vague and very confused. We don't understand the relationship between illness and personality. We'd like to say you have a personality, and added to it - as if it were a bacterial invasion - is this illness, and if you take the medication, we get rid of the illness and we're left with your personality. But there's no sharp line between personality and illness. There's not self that is the un-depressed self that is more real than the depressed self. There's always ourselves. I mean, we mold ourselves all the time. We do it when we get an education, we do it when we drink a cup of coffee. But there is a molding of the self that's involved, and I think we don't understand that either at the medical or really at the philosophical level. RAZ: What ultimately helped Andrew Solomon overcome his own depression, as with so many people, turned out to be both chemical and psychological. SOLOMON: I was very fortunate in that I had access to excellent treatment. And I took my meds and they helped me to get better, and I did a lot of psychotherapy to make sense of how I could understand my personality in the wake of the knowledge that I couldn't be fully myself without chemical support. RAZ: Slowly, in the years that followed his 1994 breakdown, Andrew's life retook some shape. He got married, he had some more success with his writing, and it was through his writing that he began to understand certain things about his own depression. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOLOMON: A lot of people said when I chose to write about my depression that it must be very difficult to be out of that closet, to have people know. They said, do people talk to you differently? And I said yes, people talk to me differently. They talk to me differently insofar as they start telling me about their experience, or their sister's experience, or their friend's experience. Things are different because now I know that depression is a family secret that everyone has. I went, a few years ago, to a conference. And on Friday of the three-day conference, one of the participants took me aside, and she said, I suffer from depression and I'm a little embarrassed about it, but I've been taking his medication, and I just wanted to ask what you think. And so I did my best to give her such advice as I could, and then she said, you know, my husband would never understand this. He's really the kind of guy to whom this wouldn't make any sense so I just, you know, it's just between us. And I said, yes, that's fine. On Sunday, at the same conference, her husband took me aside. . . (LAUGHTER)SOLOMON: . . . And he said, my wife wouldn't think that I was really much of a guy if she knew this, but I've been dealing with this depression and I'm taking some medication, and I wondered what you think. They were hiding the same medication in two different places in the same bedroom. And I said that I thought communication within the marriage might be triggering some of their problems. But I was also struck by the burdensome nature of such mutual secrecy. Depression is so exhausting, it takes up so much of your time and energy, and silence about it, it really does make the depression worse. RAZ: We're so secretive about depression, you know, and America does this - lots of things America doesn't do well, but one of the things it does well is actually talk about depression better than most other countries do. SOLOMON: People do talk better about depression than in most other countries, and people are dying to talk about their experience. And a lot of what they feel is that no one else could understand. But my experience is that all of those depressed people who are afraid of the impression they'll make on all of those people they perceive never to have deal with depression are actually keeping a secret from people who have the same secret from them. RAZ: Yeah. SOLOMON: But if people were able to talk more openly about these experiences, they would discover that most people's response is not to laugh at them but to say, that happened to sister, or to say, my best friend went through that and I was worried that he was going to kill himself, or to say, oh, my God, me too. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SOLOMON: It's a strange property of the English language, and indeed of many other languages, that we use the same word depression to describe how a kid feels when it rains on his birthday and to describe how somebody feels the minute before they commit suicide. You don't think in depression that you've put on a gray veil and are seeing the world through the haze of a bad mood. You think that the veil has been taken away, the veil of happiness, and that now you're seeing truly. It's easier to help schizophrenics who perceive that there's something foreign inside of them that needs to be exorcised, but it's difficult with depressives because we believe we are seeing the truth. People say to me, well, is it continuous with normal sadness? And I say, in a way, it's continuous with normal sadness. There is a certain amount of continuity, but it's the same way there's continuity between having an iron fence outside your house that gets a little rust spot that you have to sort of sand-off and maybe do a little repainting and what happens if you leave the house for a hundred years and it rusts through until it's only a pile of orange dust. And it's that orange dust spot, that orange dust problem, that someone were setting out to address. So now people say, you take these happy pills, and do you feel happy? And I don't. But I don't feel sad about having to eat lunch, and I don't feel sad about my answering machine, and I don't feel sad about taking a shower. I feel sad about professional disappoints, about damaged relationships, about global warming. Those are the things that I feel sad about now. And I said to myself, well, what is the conclusion? How did those people who have better lives, even with bigger depression, manage to get through? What is the mechanism of resilience? And what I came up with over time was that the people who deny their experience - the ones who say, I was depressed a long time ago and I never want to think about it again and I'm not going to look at it and I'm just going to get on with my life, ironically, those are the people who are most enslaved by what they have. Shutting out the depression strengthens it. While you hide from it, it grows. And the people who do better are the ones who are able to tolerate the fact that they have this condition. Those who can tolerate their depression are the ones who achieve resilience. RAZ: What if, you know, depression or anxiety or something, like, we could just admit, you know, to ourselves, I mean, to everyone that we're struggling with, you know? I mean, you know, like, the way you tell people, you know, don't shake my hand 'cause I have a cold. SOLOMON: But I'll tell you the weird thing, or at least a weird thing, which is that when I am well, I have found it manageable, if not easy, to talk openly about these experiences and have had a sense of purposefulness in doing so. And then I get another minor occurrence and I have to rearrange some things and cancel some plans. And all of a sudden, I'm ashamed again. And I find myself telling people that I had food poisoning or that I had to stay home because one of the kids was sick or something like that because I can't - even having published a book, done a TED talk, appeared here on the TED Radio Hour now, done all of these other things, I still can't say to people, I'm so sorry, I can't come, but I'm having a depressive episode. It's not too bad, it probably won't last too long. RAZ: How often does that happen? SOLOMON: I don't know. Probably every two or three years, I have some little period of relapse. I was once being rather casual about the possibility in the office of the therapist I've now seen for many years, a wonderful psychiatrist. And I was little off-hand about something, and he said, Andrew, in this room, we never forget that you are fully capable of taking the express elevator to the bargain-basement of mental health. (LAUGHTER)SOLOMON: So I would say it happens once every few years. RAZ: It's true that Andrew, because he's written and spoken about his depression so much over the years, has a different kind of relationship with his own mental health than you or I might, and it's arguably easier for him to laugh about it and easier for him to talk about it. But he still believes that every single person has the ability to build meaning from even the darkest places our minds can sometimes take us. SOLOMON: The question is not so much of finding great meaning and deciding your depression has been very meaningful, it's of seeking that meaning and thinking, when comes again, this will be hellish, but I will learn something from it. I had learned in my own depression how big an emotion can be, how it can be more real than facts. And I have found that that experience has allowed me to experience positive emotion in a more intense and more focused way. The opposite of depression is not happiness but vitality. And these days, my life is vital even on the days when I'm sad. And I have discovered something inside of myself that I would have to call a soul, that I had never formulated until that day 20 years ago when hell came to pay me a surprise visit. I think that while I hated being depressed and would hate to be depressed again, I found a way to love my depression. I love it because it has forced me to find and cling to joy. I love it because each day I decide, sometimes gamely and sometimes against the moment's reason, to cleave to the reasons for living. And that, I think, is a highly privileged rapture. Thank you.

And so I did my best to give her such advice as I could, and then she said, you know, my husband would never understand this. He's really the kind of guy to whom this wouldn't make any sense so I just, you know, it's just between us. And I said, yes, that's fine. On Sunday, at the same conference, her husband took me aside. . . (LAUGHTER) SOLOMON: . . . And he said, my wife wouldn't think that I was really much of a guy if she knew this, but I've been dealing with this depression and I'm taking some medication, and I wondered what you think. They were hiding the same medication in two different places in the same bedroom. And I said that I thought communication within the marriage might be triggering some of their problems. But I was also struck by the burdensome nature of such mutual secrecy. Depression is so exhausting, it takes up so much of your time and energy, and silence about it, it really does make the depression worse. RAZ: We're so secretive about depression, you know, and America does this - lots of things America doesn't do well, but one of the things it does well is actually talk about depression better than most other countries do. SOLOMON: People do talk better about depression than in most other countries, and people are dying to talk about their experience. And a lot of what they feel is that no one else could understand. But my experience is that all of those depressed people who are afraid of the impression they'll make on all of those people they perceive never to have deal with depression are actually keeping a secret from people who have the same secret from them. RAZ: Yeah. SOLOMON: But if people were able to talk more openly about these experiences, they would discover that most people's response is not to laugh at them but to say, that happened to sister, or to say, my best friend went through that and I was worried that he was going to kill himself, or to say, oh, my God, me too. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SOLOMON: It's a strange property of the English language, and indeed of many other languages, that we use the same word depression to describe how a kid feels when it rains on his birthday and to describe how somebody feels the minute before they commit suicide. You don't think in depression that you've put on a gray veil and are seeing the world through the haze of a bad mood. You think that the veil has been taken away, the veil of happiness, and that now you're seeing truly. It's easier to help schizophrenics who perceive that there's something foreign inside of them that needs to be exorcised, but it's difficult with depressives because we believe we are seeing the truth. People say to me, well, is it continuous with normal sadness? And I say, in a way, it's continuous with normal sadness. There is a certain amount of continuity, but it's the same way there's continuity between having an iron fence outside your house that gets a little rust spot that you have to sort of sand-off and maybe do a little repainting and what happens if you leave the house for a hundred years and it rusts through until it's only a pile of orange dust. And it's that orange dust spot, that orange dust problem, that someone were setting out to address. So now people say, you take these happy pills, and do you feel happy? And I don't. But I don't feel sad about having to eat lunch, and I don't feel sad about my answering machine, and I don't feel sad about taking a shower. I feel sad about professional disappoints, about damaged relationships, about global warming. Those are the things that I feel sad about now. And I said to myself, well, what is the conclusion? How did those people who have better lives, even with bigger depression, manage to get through? What is the mechanism of resilience? And what I came up with over time was that the people who deny their experience - the ones who say, I was depressed a long time ago and I never want to think about it again and I'm not going to look at it and I'm just going to get on with my life, ironically, those are the people who are most enslaved by what they have. Shutting out the depression strengthens it. While you hide from it, it grows. And the people who do better are the ones who are able to tolerate the fact that they have this condition. Those who can tolerate their depression are the ones who achieve resilience. RAZ: What if, you know, depression or anxiety or something, like, we could just admit, you know, to ourselves, I mean, to everyone that we're struggling with, you know? I mean, you know, like, the way you tell people, you know, don't shake my hand 'cause I have a cold. SOLOMON: But I'll tell you the weird thing, or at least a weird thing, which is that when I am well, I have found it manageable, if not easy, to talk openly about these experiences and have had a sense of purposefulness in doing so. And then I get another minor occurrence and I have to rearrange some things and cancel some plans. And all of a sudden, I'm ashamed again. And I find myself telling people that I had food poisoning or that I had to stay home because one of the kids was sick or something like that because I can't - even having published a book, done a TED talk, appeared here on the TED Radio Hour now, done all of these other things, I still can't say to people, I'm so sorry, I can't come, but I'm having a depressive episode. It's not too bad, it probably won't last too long. RAZ: How often does that happen? SOLOMON: I don't know. Probably every two or three years, I have some little period of relapse. I was once being rather casual about the possibility in the office of the therapist I've now seen for many years, a wonderful psychiatrist. And I was little off-hand about something, and he said, Andrew, in this room, we never forget that you are fully capable of taking the express elevator to the bargain-basement of mental health. (LAUGHTER) SOLOMON: So I would say it happens once every few years. RAZ: It's true that Andrew, because he's written and spoken about his depression so much over the years, has a different kind of relationship with his own mental health than you or I might, and it's arguably easier for him to laugh about it and easier for him to talk about it. But he still believes that every single person has the ability to build meaning from even the darkest places our minds can sometimes take us. SOLOMON: The question is not so much of finding great meaning and deciding your depression has been very meaningful, it's of seeking that meaning and thinking, when comes again, this will be hellish, but I will learn something from it. I had learned in my own depression how big an emotion can be, how it can be more real than facts. And I have found that that experience has allowed me to experience positive emotion in a more intense and more focused way. The opposite of depression is not happiness but vitality. And these days, my life is vital even on the days when I'm sad. And I have discovered something inside of myself that I would have to call a soul, that I had never formulated until that day 20 years ago when hell came to pay me a surprise visit. I think that while I hated being depressed and would hate to be depressed again, I found a way to love my depression. I love it because it has forced me to find and cling to joy. I love it because each day I decide, sometimes gamely and sometimes against the moment's reason, to cleave to the reasons for living. And that, I think, is a highly privileged rapture. Thank you.

I'm Guy Raz. Our show today, Headspace, ideas about our approaches to emotional well-being. DAVID ANDERSON: You know, all of us have family members that have dealt with some aspects of anxiety or, you know, depression, other things, and friends as well. RAZ: Or us - or we have. ANDERSON: That's right. RAZ: And that's actually what led David Anderson, who's a neurobiologist, to study the connection between the brain's circuitry and our emotions. ANDERSON: Emotion is absolutely central to understanding everything that happens in our brain. RAZ: But that's actually a kind of unusual thing for a neurobiologist to focus on. Because most people like David, who study the circuitry of the brain, are concerned with how we think, and not many scientists look at that same circuitry to understand how we feel. ANDERSON: Our perceptions, our decision-making, our actions, our planning - everything is affected by emotion. And yet, emotion has been relegated sort of to the area of psychology. And it's really frustrating to see how primitive the state of medicine is. And it's because of our deep lack of understanding of the underlying biology. RAZ: For example, think about how medicine works when it comes to our bodies. ANDERSON: If you're suspected of having a cancer diagnosis, you go to your doctor and you get bone scans, biopsies, blood tests, liver function screens. RAZ: But when it comes to our minds. . . ANDERSON: If you worry that you might be depressed, you go to your doctor and you get a questionnaire. RAZ: So David's idea is that as much as we're able to open up about our emotions, there are still so much more our brains can tell us about how they work. So why don't we have a more scientific approach to mental health? Here's David Anderson's theory, as told on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ANDERSON: Part of the reason for this is that we have an oversimplified and increasingly outmoded view of the biological basis of psychiatric disorders. We tend to view them - and the popular press aids and abets this view - as chemical imbalances in the brain, as if the brain were some kind of bag of chemical soup full of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. This view is conditioned by the fact that many of the drugs that are prescribed to treat these disorders, like Prozac, act by globally changing brain chemistry as if the brain were indeed a bag of chemical soup. But that can't be the answer because these drugs actually don't work all that well. A lot of people won't take them or stop taking them because of their unpleasant side effects. These drugs have so many side effects because using them to treat a complex psychiatric disorder is a bit like trying to change your engine oil by opening a can and pouring it all over the engine block. Some of it will dribble into the right place, but a lot of it will do more harm than good. Now, an emerging view is that psychiatric disorders are actually disturbances of neural circuits that mediate emotion, mood, and affect. When we think about cognition, we analogize the brain to a computer. That's no problem. Well, it turns out that the computer analogy is just as valid for emotion. It's just that we don't tend to think about it that way. But we know much less about the circuit basis of psychiatric disorders because of the overwhelming dominance of this chemical imbalance hypothesis. Now, it's not that chemicals are not important in psychiatric disorders, it's just that they don't bathe the brain like soup. Rather, they're released in very specific locations and they act on specific synapses to change the flow of information in the brain. RAZ: So the way we behave, the things we do, the way we feel - they're electrical currents. ANDERSON: Yup. And there are very telling, although anecdotal, examples from the work of a famous neurosurgeon in Canada, named Wilder Penfield, who was stimulating different regions of the brain with electrical current. And in some patients, that brief electrical stimulation could evoke a whole emotional response like a feeling of panic, or sudden crying and sadness, by stimulation of particular neurons in particular circuits. RAZ: Now, an experiment like that, it's kind of hard to do with human subjects today. Wilder Penfield did his in the early 20th century. So David's figured out a different way to find where specific brain circuits influence specific emotions. And instead of humans, he uses. . . ANDERSON: Drosophila. RAZ: What's a Drosophila? Sorry. ANDERSON: It's commonly referred to as a fruit fly. RAZ: A fruit fly. ANDERSON: Yeah. It's just amazing to me that something so small packs so many complex and interesting behaviors into its tiny little brain. RAZ: OK so you might be wondering, how can fruit flies tell us anything about human emotions? Well, it turns out you can trigger something that is, neurochemically speaking, pretty similar to human emotion in the brain of a fruit fly. So David and his colleagues design an experiment to see. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ANDERSON: If flies could be provoked into showing the kind of behavior that you see by the proverbial wasp at the picnic table, you know, the one that keeps coming back to your hamburger the more vigorously you try to swat it away, and seems to keep getting irritated? So we built a device, which we call a puff-o-mat, in which we could deliver little brief air puffs to fruit flies in these plastic tubes on our laboratory bench and blow them away. And what we found is that if we gave these flies in the puff-o-mat several puffs in a row, they became somewhat hyperactive and took a while to calm down. More puffs, or more intense puffs, make the state last for a longer period of time. RAZ: Now, that hyperactivity, even though we're talking about the brain of a fruit fly, actually relies on the same chemicals you and I have in our brains. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ANDERSON: That's right - flies, like people, have dopamine, and it acts on their brains and on their synapses through the same dopamine receptor molecules that you and I have. Dopamine plays a number of important functions in the brain including in attention, arousal, reward. And disorders of the dopamine system have been linked to a number of mental disorders including drug abuse, Parkinson's disease and ADHD. RAZ: OK so dopamine functions differently in the brain depending on where in the brain you're talking about. So in some areas, it can make you hyperactive, and in others, it can calm you down. ANDERSON: And in order to understand what's going on in a particular disorder, like ADHD or depression, we need to understand the where in the brain as well as the what. RAZ: We can't do that in humans - at least, not yet - but in the brains of the fruit flies. . . ANDERSON: We were able to see where in the brain this dopamine receptor was expressed and to find out where that dopamine receptor actually had to function in order to control this calming down. RAZ: And once David found the dopamine receptor, he could put the fly under a powerful microscope. ANDERSON: You're literally peering down a lens into the brain of a living fruit fly. . . RAZ: Wow. ANDERSON: . . . And watching neurons blink on and off while that fly is behaving or smelling or responding to some other stimulus. RAZ: OK this is not brain surgery. It's fly brain surgery. And at this level of detail, David can actually take that tiny fruit fly dopamine receptor and turn it off and on. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ANDERSON: So when we take away the dopamine receptor and the flies take longer to calm down, from that we infer that the normal function of this receptor - and dopamine - is to cause the flies to calm down faster after the puff. And that's a bit reminiscent of ADHD, which has been linked to disorders of the dopamine system in humans. So slowly, I began to realize that what started out as a rather playful attempt to try to annoy fruit flies might actually have some relevance to a human psychiatric disorder. RAZ: Is there a connection you can make between what you're finding and what might actually be an effective way to treat some of these illnesses? ANDERSON: I would say it's a little too early for that. I wish there were, but we are able to identify the genes that are turned on in individual types of neurons, and that might lead to the discovery of new potential drug targets. RAZ: So if today, right, when you are treated with Ritalin for ADHD or Prozac for depression, could you imagine in, like, 50 years, not actually taking a pill but getting something like an electrical pulse, you know, to specific a part of your brain? ANDERSON: You could imagine getting an electrical pulse, but you could also imagine delivering an electrical pulse to your brain by taking a pill. So technologies are developing now that allow us to activate neurons with chemicals that act on a receptor for the drug, which is genetically targeted to a particular type of neuron. And the pill would only go to the part of the brain where you need it to correct the symptom. To go back to this engine oil analogy, you'd be pouring the oil into the place where the engine oil goes and not just slopping it all over the engine block. That's the dream.

But there is one thing we do know and it's that keeping those problems locked up isn't going to get us any closer to finding answers. So on the show today, we're going to do that. We're going to open up, go into our headspace and hear new ideas from TED speakers about biological and philosophical approaches to our emotional well-being. SOLOMON: All of those depressed people who are afraid of the impression they'll make on all of those people they perceive never to have dealt with depression are actually keeping a secret from people who have the same secret from them. . . RAZ: Yeah. SOLOMON: . . . And all that effort that goes into it could better be spent on recovering.", "section": "TED Radio Hour", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2015 NPR.  All rights reserved.

He'll be back later in the show. First though, to the story of 23-year-old Alix Generous. It's a story which may make you rethink your assumptions about mental health. Here's Alix on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ALIX GENEROUS: I am a very visual thinker. I think in pictures not words. You might have noticed that I don't have much inflection in my voice. That's why people often confuse me with a GPS. (LAUGHTER)GENEROUS: So this can make basic communication a challenge unless you need directions. So. . . (LAUGHTER)GENEROUS: A few years ago, when I started doing presentations, I went to get headshots done for the first time. The photographer told me to look flirty, and I had no idea what she was talking about. (LAUGHTER)GENEROUS: She said, do that thing, you know, with your eyes, when you're flirting with guys. What thing? I asked. You know, squint. And so I tried, really, I looked like I was searching for Waldo. There's a reason for this, as there is a reason that Waldo is hiding so. . . (LAUGHTER)GENEROUS: I have Asperger's, a high-functioning form of autism that impairs the basic social skills one is expected to display. It's made life difficult in many ways and, growing up, I struggled to fit in socially. My friends would tell jokes, but I didn't understand them. My personality switched from being shy and awkward to being defiant and cursing out a storm. Needless to say, I did not have many friends. I was also hypersensitive to texture. The feel of water on my skin was like pins and needles, and so for years I refused to shower. I can assure you that my hygiene routine is up to standards now. (LAUGHTER)RAZ: Alix can joke about all this now. It's sort of how she copes with it. But it wasn't easy for her to get to this place. Opening up about what's going on in our minds is hard for anyone, but Asperger's is a condition that, by its definition, makes it really hard to communicate your feelings. GENEROUS: And a lot of times, there were a lot of incoming feelings that would come that I wouldn't understand where they'd come from or why they were there. And how I reacted to them varied, and most of the time it was tantrums or meltdowns, and other times I just stood in solitude and felt sad. RAZ: When Alix was a kid, doctors looked at all these symptoms and they came to a conclusion - not Asperger's, but bipolar disorder. And that was a misdiagnosis. GENEROUS: I keep all of my journals in one drawer at my house from throughout my life, and I opened one that I had when I was 8 years old and the prompt was, what do you wish for? And I wrote, I wish I didn't have bipolar disease. And I don't think any child should have to be writing that at the age of 8 years old. And I started medications, I think, when I was 6 years old - or, give or take a year. I don't quite remember. RAZ: Wow. GENEROUS: In all of the pictures you see when I was a child, I have kind of squinty, like, tired eyes all the time. And I don't remember a lot of my childhood, even from 6 to 11 or 12. I have friends that I would talk to that I went to school with in that age range, and they would tell me all these fun memories they had with me, and I didn't remember any of them. RAZ: At 8 years old - you're 8 years old and you're thinking, I'm bipolar and I'm depressed. I mean, that's a lot for an 8-year-old to deal with. GENEROUS: Yes, there's this quote by William Gibson - before you diagnose yourself with depression, just make sure you're not surrounded by [expletive] because a lot of times people feel depressed and feel this way because people are telling them these things and making them feel that way. RAZ: Yeah. GENEROUS: And I did have some pretty awful teachers and peers in my life. I was bullied. And so in that way, environment determines a lot. RAZ: Yeah, it made it worse. GENEROUS: It did, it pin-holed me to that specific feeling that something's wrong with me because people are treating me this way. RAZ: Throughout her childhood, Alix was in and out of treatment centers, and she had a particularly bad experience at one place when she was 12. She had to do chores that she thought were unfair. But Alix couldn't quite express it. She couldn't communicate her feelings about why she thought that. GENEROUS: And to the doctors at the treatment facility, that was viewed as defiance, and to address that, they gave me an L-dopa medication that induced me medically into a psychosis. I started to see things that weren't there and I became very paranoid. Like, I thought the people at the school poisoned my food so I wouldn't eat. I thought that I couldn't go to sleep because they would kill me while I was sleeping. I saw, like, things come at me, and I thought I had to do certain things in order to live longer, like wear certain colors. It was a very bizarre experience, and it was because of those medications. My family and I developed a code word that I could say to them, and they'd come pick me up, no questions asked. RAZ: What was the code word? GENEROUS: I think it was watermelon. RAZ: And that was it, they came? GENEROUS: Yes. It was a very stressful time, and I was only 12 years old at the time. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GENEROUS: I transferred to a new treatment center that understood my aversions, my trauma and my social anxiety. And I - and they knew how to treat it, and I got the help I finally needed. And after 18 months of hard work, I went on to do incredible things. At 19, I won a research competition on my research on coral reefs and I ended up speaking at the U. N. Convention on Biological Diversity presenting this research. And at 22, I'm getting ready to graduate college, and I am a co-founder of a biotech company called AutismSees. (APPLAUSE)GENEROUS: Thank you. One of the things with Asperger's is that oftentimes, these people have a very complex inner life, and I know for myself I have a very colorful personality, rich ideas and just a lot going on in my mind. But there is a gap between where that stands and how I communicate it with the rest of the world. And this can make basic communication a challenge. So many people with autism are being overlooked every day and they're being taken advantage of. My dream for people with autism is to change that, to remove the roadblocks that prevents them from succeeding. RAZ: You know, it's really incredible to hear how far you've come after what you've been through. I mean, you were a kid that was convinced you were bad and mean and weird because that's how people treated you. But you are a nice person. I mean, you care about people, it's obvious. GENEROUS: Thank you. RAZ: I mean, right? That's how you thought of yourself. GENEROUS: I did. And sometimes a lot of my insecurities are based off of that. I'm always questioning if I acted appropriately, or if I was too odd or whether that person liked me or not. Like, it doesn't matter how much success you're deemed to have achieved, sometimes these things are carried with you. And I'm trying to work through it now that I'm aware of it. And you do that by actually interacting with the world with the person you want to be rather than what you think you are. RAZ: Alix Generous. She's also the co-founder of AutismSees, where she's working on technologies to help people with autism communicate better. You can see her entire talk at ted. com.

I'm Rachel Martin, and this is For the Record. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM CLIP MONTAGE)WILLIAM SHATNER: (As Captain James Kirk in \"Star Trek\") Space. TOM HANKS: (As Jim Lovell in \"Apollo 13\") Houston, we have a problem. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Astronaut is awestruck. SANDRA BULLOCK: (As Ryan Stone in \"Gravity\") What do I do? SHATNER: (As Captain James Kirk in \"Star Trek\") The final frontier. MATT DAMON: (As Mark Watney in \"The Martian\") I'm going to have to science the [expletive] out of this. MARTIN: Most of our ideas about space come from movies - or maybe your third grade trip to the planetarium. Today, you can log on to NASA's website and watch live feeds from the International Space Station, a real-life space adventure. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SCOTT KELLY: Let me just get my bearings here. I'm looking at the moon out there. MARTIN: At this very moment, astronaut Scott Kelly is on month eight of his year-long stay on the space station. This past Friday, he and Kjell Lindgren made their second spacewalk. What's important to remember here, they were outside the space station when they did this, tied only with a tether, floating in outer space. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KELLY: I can go do it. I'd prefer to do it if you guys are OK with it. MARTIN: Their assignment was to configure a vent door on the port-side ammonia tank. TRACY CALDWELL DYSON: OK Scott, we're going to take your lead. We're happy to have you go and do that. MARTIN: Today, we hear from three astronauts about this very particular space experience. For the Record: Walking in Space. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KELLY: How does that look there, Tracy? Do you see that? CALDWELL DYSON: I can see it. And that looks good, Scott. MARTIN: That voice on the other end of the line is Tracy Caldwell Dyson. She's watching a feed of commander Kelly's spacewalk from Houston. CALDWELL DYSON: I am totally in their air - I mean (laughter) to an annoying degree, probably. MARTIN: On October 28, Scott Kelly and Kjell Lindgren were out on their first spacewalk, and their only connection to Earth was Tracy Caldwell Dyson. She was the NASA astronaut in Houston giving them directions. CALDWELL DYSON: It's nice when you have someone that's done it before because then they can, you know, relay experiences or at least speak to them in a manner that they know that they would want to be spoken to. MARTIN: She knows what it's like because she's been there. She's done three spacewalks herself. She's a member of a small group of people who've had this experience, not just going up into space but actually floating around in it. TERRY VIRTS: I've flown jet fighters and been a test pilot. And there's a lot of things I've done in my life. But I had never - there's nothing like spacewalking. MARTIN: This is Terry Virts. He's been on two spaceflights, and he's done three spacewalks. Before you get to float around in the atmosphere, there's a lot of training, as you'd expect. Much of it happens in a huge swimming pool at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. It's the closest you can come to simulating the experience. Here's Tracy Caldwell Dyson. CALDWELL DYSON: You know, we take it for granted in the pool here where we train that we don't have to have a death grip. But when you're out in space and you realize there's no tether other than the one that you've attached to structure - there's no diver floating around to keep you safe - and you just see this planet beneath your feet going 17,500 miles per hour, and you and the other person in a puffy white suit are the only two out there in the vacuum of space, you tend to hang on a little tighter. MARTIN: And that puffy white suit is really heavy. VIRTS: The spacesuit itself weighs about 400 pounds on Earth, and it's pressurized. And so what looks like a big, thick, bulky, you know, winter parka - when you pressurize it, that material becomes like steel. And so moving around in this spacesuit, just to move your arm requires physical exertion. MARTIN: Tracy Caldwell Dyson remembers her first spacewalk clearly. CALDWELL DYSON: I had to go out the hatch and go immediately on top of the crew lock. And when you go on top of it, you are basically looking behind the space station at the aft end, we call it. And there's nothing - no structure in your view. And you just see the earth. And I'm up there, and, you know, even though I've got, you know, probably 50 handrails all around me that I can hang on to and I've got a hook - a big hook from my waist to structure so I know about going anywhere - it was still one of those breathtaking moments where it's like, whoa (laughter). MARTIN: Those moments of reflection are rare. These spacewalks can take more than seven hours, and they demand intense, focused concentration. VIRTS: Ninety-nine-and-a-half percent of your time - my time on my spacewalks, I can say - was completely focused on what was going on. I felt not rushed, but pressed every second that I was outside. Like, there's no time to stop and look around. There's no time to take pictures. There's no time to do anything other than - you got another task going on because you don't want to spend extra time outside. MARTIN: Because things can go wrong. LUCA PARMITANO: My name is Luca Parmitano. I live in Houston because I'm an astronaut. MARTIN: Two years ago, things did go very wrong for this Italian astronaut. Early on in his spacewalk, he felt water on the back of his head. PARMITANO: And I knew that something was not right. MARTIN: There was a leak in his helmet. Parmitano didn't want to tell ground control in Houston. He knew they might cancel his spacewalk. And at that moment, he really didn't think it was a big deal. But he told them anyway. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PARMITANO: I feel a lot of water on the back of my head. SHANE KIMBROUGH: Are you sweating? Are you working hard? PARMITANO: I am sweating. But it feels like a lot of water. That is when things went really south. The sun went down. And when the sun goes down on an orbit, it is not like one of those beautiful sunsets. It lasts only a few seconds. One second you have light, and the next you have no light whatsoever. It is complete, utter blackness. And at that moment, I was also upside down. And that's when the water covered my eyes, my ears and my nose. MARTIN: A liter and a half of water had flooded into his helmet. It came from the cooling system in his suit. Water acts differently in space. It forms a goopy kind of gel that sticks to your skin. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KIMBROUGH: Hey Luca, can you clarify - is it increasing or not increasing? PARMITANO: It's hard to tell, but it feels like a lot of water. MARTIN: Pretty quickly, that water disabled Parmitano's communication system. PARMITANO: I couldn't hear anything anymore. I couldn't see anything anymore. And I couldn't breathe through my nose because my nose was filled up with water. MARTIN: He could still breathe through his mouth, but he couldn't see. Slowly, he felt his way along the surface of the space station in the direction of the airlock. When he finally made it back, his partner on that spacewalk, Chris Cassidy, radioed to Houston that Luca was fine - miserable, but fine. Has this changed your ambition? Has this changed your desire to go back up in space again? PARMITANO: Well, I was - I wanted to go out the next day. MARTIN: No matter the risk, it's hard for astronauts to call it quits. Here's Tracy Caldwell Dyson. CALDWELL DYSON: It's my hope that I get to go again. But we have so few flight opportunities, and we have new people that haven't flown once, even. And so you need to give everybody a chance to get up there and get that experience. MARTIN: NASA ended its shuttle program in 2011, which means when NASA sends astronauts into space, they ride on small spacecraft operated by other countries. Astronauts just don't have as many opportunities as they used to. VIRTS: The flights that you've had are fine, but the only flight you really care about is your next flight. MARTIN: Again, this is astronaut Terry Virts. VIRTS: I can remember watching the sun rise, which is just spectacular. It reaches from one side of the horizon to the other. It's a long, thin blue-orange band. And I just remember, you know, almost hearing from God sitting there, thinking about creation. It's almost like you're in some secret room, seeing something that, you know, humans weren't meant to see or something. It was kind of a glance into the forbidden view. MARTIN: Astronauts Terry Virts, Tracy Caldwell Dyson, and Luca Parmitano. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Rachel Martin, and this is For the Record.

There's no time to do anything other than - you got another task going on because you don't want to spend extra time outside. MARTIN: Because things can go wrong. LUCA PARMITANO: My name is Luca Parmitano. I live in Houston because I'm an astronaut. MARTIN: Two years ago, things did go very wrong for this Italian astronaut. Early on in his spacewalk, he felt water on the back of his head. PARMITANO: And I knew that something was not right. MARTIN: There was a leak in his helmet. Parmitano didn't want to tell ground control in Houston. He knew they might cancel his spacewalk. And at that moment, he really didn't think it was a big deal. But he told them anyway. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PARMITANO: I feel a lot of water on the back of my head. SHANE KIMBROUGH: Are you sweating? Are you working hard? PARMITANO: I am sweating. But it feels like a lot of water. That is when things went really south. The sun went down. And when the sun goes down on an orbit, it is not like one of those beautiful sunsets. It lasts only a few seconds. One second you have light, and the next you have no light whatsoever. It is complete, utter blackness. And at that moment, I was also upside down. And that's when the water covered my eyes, my ears and my nose. MARTIN: A liter and a half of water had flooded into his helmet. It came from the cooling system in his suit. Water acts differently in space. It forms a goopy kind of gel that sticks to your skin. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KIMBROUGH: Hey Luca, can you clarify - is it increasing or not increasing? PARMITANO: It's hard to tell, but it feels like a lot of water. MARTIN: Pretty quickly, that water disabled Parmitano's communication system. PARMITANO: I couldn't hear anything anymore. I couldn't see anything anymore. And I couldn't breathe through my nose because my nose was filled up with water. MARTIN: He could still breathe through his mouth, but he couldn't see. Slowly, he felt his way along the surface of the space station in the direction of the airlock. When he finally made it back, his partner on that spacewalk, Chris Cassidy, radioed to Houston that Luca was fine - miserable, but fine. Has this changed your ambition? Has this changed your desire to go back up in space again? PARMITANO: Well, I was - I wanted to go out the next day. MARTIN: No matter the risk, it's hard for astronauts to call it quits. Here's Tracy Caldwell Dyson. CALDWELL DYSON: It's my hope that I get to go again. But we have so few flight opportunities, and we have new people that haven't flown once, even. And so you need to give everybody a chance to get up there and get that experience. MARTIN: NASA ended its shuttle program in 2011, which means when NASA sends astronauts into space, they ride on small spacecraft operated by other countries. Astronauts just don't have as many opportunities as they used to. VIRTS: The flights that you've had are fine, but the only flight you really care about is your next flight. MARTIN: Again, this is astronaut Terry Virts. VIRTS: I can remember watching the sun rise, which is just spectacular. It reaches from one side of the horizon to the other. It's a long, thin blue-orange band. And I just remember, you know, almost hearing from God sitting there, thinking about creation. It's almost like you're in some secret room, seeing something that, you know, humans weren't meant to see or something. It was kind of a glance into the forbidden view.

We're going there because the park has the most native species of orchids in the U. S. - think the setting for the book \"The Orchid Thief. \" Over the years, many varieties of orchids have been lost because of poachers and habitat destruction. And scientists want to bring them back and they are looking to Cuba for help. NPR's Greg Allen waded through the swamp and sent this report. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: If you visit Fakahatchee Strand, you'll likely run into park biologist Mike Owen. He's spent most of his career there - 22 years - studying a place that's truly unique. MIKE OWEN: And, you know, the ecosystem is 5,000 years old, so 22 years is maybe a wink (laughter) you know, in that time span. ALLEN: Fakahatchee is the largest strand swamp in the world. That's a type of shallow swamp found only in Florida where water drains south from Lake Okeechobee through stands of cypress trees with thick 100-foot tall canopies. To see orchids in their native habitat, Owen takes visitors on swamp walks. OWEN: A little bit of sawgrass right here inside the ditch. ALLEN: We step off a park trail and are soon wading through sawgrass and water nine inches deep. OWEN: And notice how clear that water is. ALLEN: Twenty years ago, Owen was author Susan Orlean's guide in Fakahatchee when she wrote her book \"The Orchid Thief. \" Orchids, Owen says, are especially susceptible to poachers - people who illegally take plants from the reserve. OWEN: The orchids have an allure, and some people just take it upon themselves to go out there and just take whatever they want. ALLEN: Logging also took a toll on Fakahatchee. In the '40s and '50s, most of the old growth cypress was cut down. But since the '70s, when it became a state park, the swamp and the stately cypress trees have largely recovered. We leave the sawgrass prairie and slosh into a stand of trees, mostly palms and cypress. OWEN: This is a small cypress dome. And this is one of the sites of our cowhorn orchid restoration project. ALLEN: Over the last decade, working in partnership with the Atlanta Botanical Garden, scientists at Fakahatchee Strand have harvested seeds in the wild and cultivated cowhorn orchids that they replanted throughout the swamp. The cowhorn, like many orchids, thrive by growing on tree trunks and limbs. When they're mature with flower, Owen says, cowhorns are spectacular. OWEN: When these plants bloom, usually in March or April, they can have literally hundreds of flowers, little yellow flowers with little dots on them. Well, because it is so charismatic and easy to find, people did remove them. ALLEN: When the project started a decade ago, just 17 cowhorn orchids could still be found in the 85,000-acre park. Today, because of the project, there are several hundred. But there are two other orchids that used to grow in Fakahatchee but now are no longer found there or anywhere in Florida. One is the rattail orchid. The other is known only by its scientific name - Epidendrum acunae. Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission biologist Dennis Giardina says, for him and Mike Owen, finding them became a passion. DENNIS GIARDINA: There has been a lot of time and effort and energy spent looking for these lost orchids, especially in the areas where they were last documented. So we're pretty certain that they are in fact locally extinct. ALLEN: Using techniques they pioneered with the cowhorn orchid, Giardina and Owen were convinced that they could restore the lost orchids to Fakahatchee if they could find nearby plants. The likeliest place to look was Cuba, just 200 miles away. At a conference in Cuba three years ago, Giardina met with botanists from the island. He recalls his pitch. GIARDINA: The closest populations of these two species occur in western Cuba. Please help us. Please collaborate with us because we want to try to bring these orchids back. ALLEN: Cuban researchers were willing and helpful. As it turned out, they had both species at the botanical garden and have been monitoring other populations in the wild. It will take time, a decade or more, but Giardina says now he and Mike Owen are confident that with help of seed from Cuba, they'll be able to bring back the lost orchids to Fakahatchee Strand.

You just have to keep up with them. Listen and subscribe to the NPR Politics podcast at npr. org/podcasts and on the NPR One app. This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. On this week's episode, we're talking about backup plans. Researcher Katy Milkman shares her study on why it's not always a good idea to have a plan B. KATY MILKMAN: It may make you less motivated to pursue your primary goals. VEDANTAM: Dan Pink is here for another round of Stopwatch Science. DANIEL PINK, BYLINE: So these are glorious times for scholars who research moral hazard. VEDANTAM: And we invited Matthew McConaughey to talk about the importance of backup plans in the movie \"Interstellar. \"(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"INTERSTELLAR\")MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: (As Cooper) Some kind of vehicle, a space station? MICHAEL CAINE: (As Professor Brand) Both, plan A. MCCONAUGHEY: (As Cooper) How do you get it off the ground? ANNE HATHAWAY: (As Brand) That's why there's plan B. VEDANTAM: But, Matthew was a little busy, so we went with our plan B and invited my friend Adam Cole from NPR Science Desk instead. ADAM COLE, BYLINE: Hello, having some real flashbacks to junior prom right now. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) Just kidding, Adam, you were always plan A. COLE: That sounds a lot better, yeah. VEDANTAM: So, Adam, just like the last time, I want you to listen to all the ideas in this episode and come up with a song that ties it all together. Do you think you could do that? COLE: Well, I'll try. But if I can't do it, do we have some sort of backup plan in place? VEDANTAM: (Laughter) Here's the thing, Adam. We don't. And to understand why we don't, you need to listen to this next set of ideas. The researcher Katy Milkman at the University of Pennsylvania was very interested in what happens when we have backup plans. Here she is. MILKMAN: We have this sense that having a security blanket or a backup plan B is a strategy that will be helpful to us. It'll make us more emotionally comfortable with our plans, and it'll make us feel like we're taking less risk. VEDANTAM: Katy Milkman tells me that there is a surprising downside to having that kind of safety net. Here she is again. MILKMAN: It may make you less motivated to pursue your primary goals, so because you know that all your eggs aren't in this one basket, you may feel more confident and comfortable relaxing and letting up and not pushing as hard toward your primary goal. Since you know things will be OK, you can always go with your backup plan. VEDANTAM: They used a couple of different methods to figure this out. MILKMAN: The first method, which absolutely does not prove cause and effect but does provide some tantalizing evidence, was to simply survey people in a train station. VEDANTAM: So, Adam, when Katy Milkman told me that the first part of her study was at a train station, we decided we would try and replicate this ourselves, and we went down to Union Station in Washington, D. C. , a producer and I, and ran a little experiment ourselves. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Do you have about five, 10 minutes to talk with us? FIONA: Cool. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: What is your name? FIONA: Fiona (ph). VEDANTAM: While walking through Union Station, we came across Fiona. She's a young woman from Kenya who was in Washington visiting her family. Her Romanian boyfriend was down the hall buying bus tickets to New York. Fiona and Rasvon (ph) are planning on moving to the United Kingdom together, but it's challenging for them to get the right visas. FIONA: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: So plan A is that you just get the visa and get to the U. K. FIONA: And get a job there. VEDANTAM: And get a job there, really (unintelligible). FIONA: Yeah. VEDANTAM: What's plan B? FIONA: Plan B is maybe Germany or something, close enough. . . VEDANTAM: OK. FIONA: . . . Because I have family in Germany, so. . . VEDANTAM: OK. FIONA: . . . It might be easier to be in Germany. VEDANTAM: You are keeping a lot of options open. FIONA: A lot of options because with visas, you never know. So I need, like, plan A to zed, yes. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) So here's the question. When you have so many options, do you think that it actually distracts you from focusing on plan A, that having plan B, C, D, E, F, G, that it actually makes it less - you're less focused on plan A because you have all those other things at the back of your head? FIONA: No, I'm very focused on plan A, hoping it works. But you know, I'm trying to be pessimistic so that I'm not disappointed if plan A doesn't work out, OK, fallback plan, fallback plan. It just makes it - makes me more calm. In case of anything going wrong with plan A. . . VEDANTAM: Yeah. FIONA: . . . I know I have a B, C or. . . VEDANTAM: Yeah. FIONA: So with everything in my life, I always have, you know, other plans on the side. VEDANTAM: You have backup plans? FIONA: Yes. VEDANTAM: Let me ask you a question. Has there ever been a time in your life when you have not had a plan B or C because you've just said, this is the only thing that I want, there's nothing else that's going to be acceptable, and therefore, I'm not going to have a plan B, C, D or E. I'm just. . . FIONA: For me. . . VEDANTAM: . . . This is just plan A and nothing else. FIONA: For me, no, I think my boyfriend works with that. I mean, he just works with one plan. I'm the one who's trying to teach him how to have millions of plans on the side. I mean, even a boyfriend, at least I've -  I hope I don't have to go to plan B and C, but it's good to have plan, you know. OK, if we don't work out, this is what I'll do, you know (laughter). VEDANTAM: So your boyfriend. . . FIONA: There he is. VEDANTAM: Before he comes, in the 30 seconds before he's here. . . FIONA: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . Let me ask you, so if he doesn't work out, what's the plan B? FIONA: Every girl has people that maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, every girl, even she does. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). FIONA: You love one person, but if something doesn't work out, there's that guy, possible, possible, possible. Everyone has that. VEDANTAM: And so. . . FIONA: I don't know about men, but women has. VEDANTAM: So you actually have this list of people in your head. . . FIONA: Possibilities. VEDANTAM: . . . And you've basically said, this person right now that you're with is 80 percent, but there's a 75 percent chance of someone. . . FIONA: Some of them maybe even 40 percent, but it's still in the line. VEDANTAM: But it's still in line. You keep them in the line. FIONA: They're better than zero, you know? VEDANTAM: I see. FIONA: Yes. VEDANTAM: I see. Is this your boyfriend? FIONA: Yes. VEDANTAM: And we were just talking about - we are NPR reporters, and we're doing a story that looks at how people make plans and how they think about their plans. And she was talking about the different strategies and approaches that you both have in your personalities. RASVON: Yeah. VEDANTAM: So when you're making plans, do you often have a plan B and say, if this doesn't work out, that's going to work out? She was saying that you just are very focused on the things that you want to do. RASVON: Yeah, this is - I don't want to be in a situation when I feel vulnerable, especially in another country when I travel, if it's a traveling plan. So every time I look at other options, you know, the worst case scenario with what can go. . . VEDANTAM: So you actually do keep options? FIONA: Yeah, but he's more focused on plan A. RASVON: Yeah, I focus because I also don't accept failure in my plan. Everything has to go according to the plan. VEDANTAM: So in general, for the big things in your life, not, you know, how to get to Philadelphia and which bus to get, but for the big things in your life - where are you going to work and who are you going to marry and - do you actually have very clear ideas of what you want and say, this is what's going to happen, and I'm going to stick to that? RASVON: I'm trying to impose this philosophy of life. I think before I believed in more natural, and things just happen. But I'm thinking lately - I took this approach - I need to know what I want because otherwise, it will not just come to me. I need to be - to step up, take decisions, and go with it, not let it just come with karma. So nowadays, I feel I'm imposing myself this philosophy of knowing what I want. I want this, and why do I want this, and stick to it. VEDANTAM: So in terms of romantic life, do you have a plan B if she doesn't work out? Or are you saying, this is the one, and I'm not going to think about any other plans or plans and options? FIONA: Very good question. RASVON: Very good question, I don't have a plan B. I'm sticking to plan A. I'm sticking to my decision, and I will make it work. If I start with a plan B in a relationship, I think is - yeah, I'm thinking of the worst case scenario, but alcohol will get me through that. I don't need another plan B. But now I'm sticking to plan A because I think I'm doing a mutual decision in the moment or I hope I'm doing it. VEDANTAM: So I'm fascinated because you are actually saying that having a plan B can affect how much you focus on plan A. RASVON: On the plan A, then so I guess maybe first when I talked about focusing on when I'm traveling, maybe I look like a control freak. But I also think plan B makes you relaxed and think, yeah, whatever, let's just have a drink, and if you miss the bus, you take the second one. Let's just not give her all your attention because if it's not going to work, there's plenty of fish in the sea. But this will just make you relaxed and maybe not focused enough because the plan B is also comfortable. Plan B is always the comfort zone. You go back. There are plenty of buses. There are plenty of girls. There's plenty of this. It's back to the comfort zone where you don't have to step up, look at the time, bring flowers, give kisses. COLE: Well, I think that Rasvon (ph) has just written the song himself. That was very poetic. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). COLE: But what's the science behind this? VEDANTAM: So, Adam, Katy Milkman wanted to find out the evidence as well. She decided take her research out of the train station and into the laboratory. MILKMAN: And what we did is we gave participants a shared goal. They all had the same goal, which was to achieve high performance on a task we'd assigned to them. And in one study, we told them that if they achieved that high performance, they would get to finish up five minutes early. So they'd get the same pay that they were expecting to receive, but they'd have five extra minutes in their day to do with whatever they pleased. And one group, we asked them before they pursued this task to think about another way that they could save five minutes today if they didn't achieve the goal of getting five minutes back in our study. A second group we asked to simply brainstorm about what one could do with five minutes, to hold brainstorming constant. And then a third group was a control group, and they had no initial instructions. They just began the task. And what we found is that the group who had thought about a backup plan, about another way that they could save five minutes today, achieve significantly less success on the task we assign them. They worked less hard, they solve fewer puzzles, and this was significantly fewer than people in either of our control groups. VEDANTAM: So this is actually a disturbing finding in some ways because it really suggests that this very normal and perhaps even wise course of action, which is to have a plan B, to have a safety net when you're embarking on something difficult and dangerous, really has a downside. I mean, there's a real tension here. MILKMAN: That's right. I think there is a really important tension here. And again, what I don't want to say is that it means we should be done with backup plans because they provide real value. And all we're trying to show here is that there's a downside we might not be appreciating, and that we should try to find ways to stay equally motivated even if we do want to provide a safety net for ourselves. VEDANTAM: How do we go about doing that? I mean, this has been found in similar studies. If you look at people wearing helmets, for example, when they go bicycling they take more risks as they're bicycling. If you ask people to wear seatbelts in cars, they now drive a little bit faster than if they were not wearing seat belts. And I don't think, as you're saying, the implication is we should eliminate seatbelts and ask people not to wear helmets. But how do we get around this human tendency to say, I'm protected and therefore I can take a chance? MILKMAN: That's an absolutely fabulous question. I think it's the big question that the study raises. And unfortunately, we don't know the answer. But I do think awareness is always a good start, so recognizing that there is this downside, that there is this risk of feeling too comfortable, of feeling too confident. At least hopefully, that can begin to combat it. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering - in your own life, Katy, do you make backup plans? MILKMAN: I absolutely make backup plans. VEDANTAM: Give me an example of backup plans that you've made. MILKMAN: Oh gosh. That's a good question. I'm trying to think of my latest backup plan. So Jihae Shin was a doctoral student here at the University of Pennsylvania, at the Wharton school. And she was preparing to go on the academic job market hoping to find a fabulous faculty job. And she came into my office and said she was a bit worried about having a backup plan, making a plan B in case she didn't get that job, because she was worried it might demotivate her. Maybe one interesting implication is to think about whether or not you can outsource the job of backup plans. So as a student's advisor, for instance, perhaps they can focus solely on the primary plan of getting a job and let the advisor worry about the backup plan of where we'll find them a postdoctoral scholarship if they don't find a faculty position. Maybe that's the best of both worlds. The student stays motivated and feels that they only have a plan A, no plan B. But the advisor's taking care of offsetting the risk by worry about the plan B in the background. VEDANTAM: I think for this plan to work, you have to have an advisor that sends signals that they may be unreliable. MILKMAN: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: (Laughter) And that would send a message that the advisor actually can't be trusted to come up with a proper backup plan, which would motivate you to really focus on your primary goal. MILKMAN: That's right. Or you could simply have an advisor who's very quiet and doesn't signal one way or the other. And hopefully that will provide enough uncertainty that the student will work very, very hard. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) Thank you so much for talking with me today. MILKMAN: My pleasure. Thank you. COLE: So, Shankar, have you been coming up with a backup plan secretly in case I fail? VEDANTAM: You know, Adam, I think the point of Katy Milkman's research is I shouldn't tell you if I have a backup plan because if I do, it's going to make you slack off and think you have a safety net - so absolutely not, Adam. COLE: Wow, my heart rate is rising as we speak. I guess I'll furiously take more notes. VEDANTAM: Wonderful. Now we're going to take a short break. When we come back, I'm going to play a game of Stopwatch Science with my friend Daniel Pink. Dan and I will talk about a phenomenon called moral hazard. And the idea of moral hazard is that when you think you have a safety net, when you know that you have a backup plan, a plan B, you will take plan A less seriously, and as a result, all sorts of bad things happen.

VEDANTAM: Welcome to another edition of Stopwatch Science. I'm joined by senior Stopwatch Science correspondent, Daniel Pink. Hi, Dan. PINK: Hey, Shankar. VEDANTAM: Now, in addition to his role here on the HIDDEN BRAIN, Dan is also an author and a commentator. In Stopwatch Science, Dan and I challenge each other to present two pieces of research in under a minute each. Today, we're presenting studies about moral hazard. This is the idea that safety nets can sometimes cause us to take unnecessary risks. They change our behavior. There's no safety net here on Stopwatch Science, just a timer and a buzzer. Dan, can you tell me what sound I'm going to hear if I exceed my one minute? PINK: Well, I've chosen the old car horn sound, like this. . . (SOUNDBITE OF CAR HORN)VEDANTAM: That sounds a little like a rooster, doesn't it? I have decided that the sound that I'm going to play for Dan when he exceeds his time is this. . . (SOUNDBITE OF CHIMPANZEE)PINK: What is that? VEDANTAM: That's the sound of a chimpanzee, Dan. PINK: OK. Thank you, alright. VEDANTAM: Dan Pink, your first minute starts right now. PINK: So these are glorious times for scholars who research moral hazard. There's nothing like a financial crisis - it's really the full-employment act for moral hazard scholars, including Michael Aklin and Andreas Kern. While one is from Pitt, one is from Georgetown, and they did something really interesting. They had a theory that they decided to back up looking at some numbers. And they found - I'll go straight to the punch line - that if you want to predict which countries are going to have a financial crisis, look to see where US troops are deployed. Now, the reason for this is, once again, moral hazard. The thinking is that hey, if there are troops in a particular country, and the country goes south financially, big brother Uncle Sam is going to step up and bail the country out. Now, they also tested something. They said, wait, maybe we put troops in countries that are at risk of financial crisis. Eh, not the same. . . (SOUNDBITE OF CHIMPANZEE)PINK: Come on. VEDANTAM: This is so interesting I'm actually going to let you go on. Keep going. PINK: Now, do we put troops in places that are at risk of financial instability? VEDANTAM: Exactly, yeah. PINK: And the answer is no because there are other markers when US troops go there that actually indicate financial health. What it suggests is that when we deploy troops out there. . . VEDANTAM: Yeah. PINK: . . . It makes countries say, hey, we're protected, we can take some risks. VEDANTAM: And that's pretty much the standard definition of moral hazard. PINK: You got it. VEDANTAM: I think that's pretty amazing, Dan. PINK: Thank you. So speaking of moral hazard, I'm going to turn on my stopwatch here. And I'm going to give you one minute. Now, remember the car horn will sound if you exceed your one minute. So get ready right now. VEDANTAM: Alright, I'm going to be talking about bicycles and bicycle helmets in a very interesting experiment that was run in England some years ago. This is a study by Ian Walker, who's in the Department of Psychology at the University of Bath, or Bath - I'm not quite how they pronounce it. Anyway, what he did was he rolled on a stretch of highway either with his helmet on or with his helmet off and then measured, using a camera, how close cars came to him when he was wearing the helmet and when he was not wearing the helmet. And what moral hazard predicts is that when he seems to be protected because he's wearing a helmet, car drivers feel like they can take more risks because they feel that if I get close enough and he topples over, he's not going to die, he's wearing a helmet. And that's exactly what he found. When he was wearing a helmet, car drivers actually came closer to him - they drove closer. One of the interesting things he also found is that when he wore a woman's wig, fewer people came close to him because they had the stereotype that women drivers or women. . . (SOUNDBITE OF CAR HORN)PINK: They honked at him because he was wearing a wig. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) That's probably exactly what they did. But in this case they honked from some distance because their stereotype was women bicyclists were a little less stable than male bicyclists. PINK: Very interesting. So I guess Shankar's message to all you kids out there is, don't wear a helmet, just put on a woman's wig. VEDANTAM: I'm not sure I would say that but I'm not going to say more on that because I know Dan is just trying to buy time instead of paying attention to the fact that his one minute starts right now. PINK: OK, so we talked about Uncle Sam. Now we're going to talk about an even higher power - God. There's some great research out of Stanford showing that when people hear references to God, they're willing to take bigger risks. . . VEDANTAM: Wow. PINK: . . . But only certain kinds of risks. So here's what they did. They said to people, do you want, for a fee, stare into the bright light that might harm your eyes? People who were reminded of God beforehand were more likely to do it. VEDANTAM: Wow. PINK: Now, they also did - tested this with things that were - had moral content to them. So they said, do you want to learn how to bribe people? Do you want to learn how to parasail? And when people were faced with the opportunity to learn how to bribe people, something that had moral content, they were actually less likely to take that risk. So what this shows is that when it comes to physical risk - not anything that involves values - that being exposed to God - seeing things like In God We Trust, seeing something like the 10 Commandments - can make people. . . (SOUNDBITE OF CHIMPANZEE)PINK: . . . Chirp like a chimpanzeeVEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: Yeah. VEDANTAM: That was really interesting, Dan. PINK: So because people feel protected - people feel protected by God so they'll take more risk. Now, Shankar, I have to say, in this case you're not protected by God or by United States military. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: . . . Or by a wig. So you are all on your own, starting right now. VEDANTAM: I'm happy to report that the study that I'm just about to tell Dan is going to destabilize him to the extent that he's probably going to forget about the stopwatch. . . PINK: OK. VEDANTAM: . . . Because it has to do with how parents with college-going kids behave. PINK: Uh-oh. VEDANTAM: And Dan has kids who are just about to head off to college. And this is research by Laura Hamilton who looks at what the effect is of parents paying for their children when they go to college. PINK: OK. VEDANTAM: And what Laura Hamilton finds is that the more money parents pay for their kids, the less kids are required to sort of stand on their own in college, the worse that kids perform in terms of their GPA. It's not a huge effect, but what it finds is that when kids don't have to feel like their performance in college is actually on them, that there's somebody who is carrying them, that someone who is going to give the money, it makes them say, I'm just going to take it easy. I'm going to go to the bar. I'm just going to hang out with my friends. I'm going to pay less attention to my studies. So I don't know how this is going to change your behavior vis-a-vis your kids, Dan, but I'm going to tell you that it might be a good idea just to cut your kids off just like you're cutting me off right now. PINK: Yeah, wow, that's actually quite fascinating. It makes me want to call my daughter and say, Sophia, it's been nice knowing you, but next fall. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: . . . You're completely on your own. Good luck. I'm just trying to avoid moral hazard, darling. VEDANTAM: If you do that Dan, just make sure you didn't tell her the idea came from me. PINK: No, I won't. VEDANTAM: All right, this has been another round of Stopwatch Science. I'm Shankar Vedantam. PINK: And I'm Daniel Pink. VEDANTAM: I'm back in the studio now with Adam Cole, producer reporter extraordinary from NPR's Science Desk, and we've challenged Adam to come up with a song that stitches all the ideas in this podcast episode together. Adam, have you gotten any ideas? COLE: I've written down the downside to safety nets, a lack of focus on primary goals, the Kenya-Romania-Germany-U. K. couple. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). COLE: . . . Moral hazard, plenty of girls, plenty of buses. VEDANTAM: Writing a song is going to be a breeze for you. COLE: That's right. I'm just going to go back to the skunk bear cave, and we'll see what I come up with. VEDANTAM: All right, everyone. Adam is now out of the skunk bear cave. Was this a success? COLE: I - well, I came up with something. I know that you're a huge fan of pop punk, and so. . . VEDANTAM: Of course. COLE: Famously, so what we've got here is a pop punk garage band. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). COLE: . . . Entitled Moral Hazzard with two Zs. . . VEDANTAM: Hazzard with two Zs. I love it. COLE: . . . With the song, \"I Don't Need No Plan B. \"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"I DON'T NEED NO PLAN B\")MORAL HAZZARD: (Singing) They all say you better have a plan B, but I say no way. I don't need the security. My old man won't pay for university, and Uncle Sam won't prop up my economy. No backup plan because backups can distract me from my goal today. No safety net, my alphabet begins and ends with A. I don't need no plan B, no plan B. I don't need no plan B, yeah, yeah. It's not risk-free, but it's a good philosophy. I don't need no plan B, no plan B. When I bike, don't wear a helmet on my head because I like to wear this wig instead. I realize I'm no Matthew McConaughey. For you, I'd fly from Kenya to the U. K. All around the world there's lots of girls, but there is just one us. You make me flip, your love's a trip, and I won't miss that bus. I don't need no plan B, no plan B. I don't need no plan B, yeah, yeah. There's other fish in the sea, but you're the only one for me. I don't need no plan B, no plan B. I got my eggs in one basket, my money in one place. Every day's fantastic because I get to see your face. But I know what's on your mind, Stu and Steve and Stanley. Forget those other guys. You don't need no plan B. You don't need no plan B, no plan B. You don't need no plan B, yeah, yeah. There's other fish in the sea, but you're the only one for me. You don't need no plan B, no plan B. I don't need no plan B. You don't need no plan B. We don't need no plan B. We don't need no plan B, no plan B. VEDANTAM: Adam Cole, thank you so much for playing our game. COLE: Thanks for having me. (SOUNDBITE OF MORAL HAZZARD SONG, \"I DON'T NEED NO PLAN B\")VEDANTAM: That was amazing. COLE: Thank you.

On this week's episode, we're talking about backup plans. Researcher Katy Milkman shares her study on why it's not always a good idea to have a plan B. KATY MILKMAN: It may make you less motivated to pursue your primary goals. VEDANTAM: Dan Pink is here for another round of Stopwatch Science. DANIEL PINK, BYLINE: So these are glorious times for scholars who research moral hazard. VEDANTAM: And we invited Matthew McConaughey to talk about the importance of backup plans in the movie \"Interstellar. \" (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"INTERSTELLAR\") MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: (As Cooper) Some kind of vehicle, a space station? MICHAEL CAINE: (As Professor Brand) Both, plan A. MCCONAUGHEY: (As Cooper) How do you get it off the ground? ANNE HATHAWAY: (As Brand) That's why there's plan B. VEDANTAM: But, Matthew was a little busy, so we went with our plan B and invited my friend Adam Cole from NPR Science Desk instead. ADAM COLE, BYLINE: Hello, having some real flashbacks to junior prom right now. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) Just kidding, Adam, you were always plan A. COLE: That sounds a lot better, yeah. VEDANTAM: So, Adam, just like the last time, I want you to listen to all the ideas in this episode and come up with a song that ties it all together. Do you think you could do that? COLE: Well, I'll try. But if I can't do it, do we have some sort of backup plan in place? VEDANTAM: (Laughter) Here's the thing, Adam. We don't. And to understand why we don't, you need to listen to this next set of ideas. The researcher Katy Milkman at the University of Pennsylvania was very interested in what happens when we have backup plans. Here she is. MILKMAN: We have this sense that having a security blanket or a backup plan B is a strategy that will be helpful to us. It'll make us more emotionally comfortable with our plans, and it'll make us feel like we're taking less risk. VEDANTAM: Katy Milkman tells me that there is a surprising downside to having that kind of safety net. Here she is again. MILKMAN: It may make you less motivated to pursue your primary goals, so because you know that all your eggs aren't in this one basket, you may feel more confident and comfortable relaxing and letting up and not pushing as hard toward your primary goal. Since you know things will be OK, you can always go with your backup plan. VEDANTAM: They used a couple of different methods to figure this out. MILKMAN: The first method, which absolutely does not prove cause and effect but does provide some tantalizing evidence, was to simply survey people in a train station. VEDANTAM: So, Adam, when Katy Milkman told me that the first part of her study was at a train station, we decided we would try and replicate this ourselves, and we went down to Union Station in Washington, D. C. , a producer and I, and ran a little experiment ourselves. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Do you have about five, 10 minutes to talk with us? FIONA: Cool. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: What is your name? FIONA: Fiona (ph). VEDANTAM: While walking through Union Station, we came across Fiona. She's a young woman from Kenya who was in Washington visiting her family. Her Romanian boyfriend was down the hall buying bus tickets to New York. Fiona and Rasvon (ph) are planning on moving to the United Kingdom together, but it's challenging for them to get the right visas. FIONA: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: So plan A is that you just get the visa and get to the U. K. FIONA: And get a job there. VEDANTAM: And get a job there, really (unintelligible). FIONA: Yeah. VEDANTAM: What's plan B? FIONA: Plan B is maybe Germany or something, close enough. . . VEDANTAM: OK. FIONA: . . . Because I have family in Germany, so. . . VEDANTAM: OK. FIONA: . . . It might be easier to be in Germany. VEDANTAM: You are keeping a lot of options open. FIONA: A lot of options because with visas, you never know. So I need, like, plan A to zed, yes. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) So here's the question. When you have so many options, do you think that it actually distracts you from focusing on plan A, that having plan B, C, D, E, F, G, that it actually makes it less - you're less focused on plan A because you have all those other things at the back of your head? FIONA: No, I'm very focused on plan A, hoping it works. But you know, I'm trying to be pessimistic so that I'm not disappointed if plan A doesn't work out, OK, fallback plan, fallback plan. It just makes it - makes me more calm. In case of anything going wrong with plan A. . . VEDANTAM: Yeah. FIONA: . . . I know I have a B, C or. . . VEDANTAM: Yeah. FIONA: So with everything in my life, I always have, you know, other plans on the side. VEDANTAM: You have backup plans? FIONA: Yes. VEDANTAM: Let me ask you a question. Has there ever been a time in your life when you have not had a plan B or C because you've just said, this is the only thing that I want, there's nothing else that's going to be acceptable, and therefore, I'm not going to have a plan B, C, D or E. I'm just. . . FIONA: For me. . . VEDANTAM: . . . This is just plan A and nothing else. FIONA: For me, no, I think my boyfriend works with that. I mean, he just works with one plan. I'm the one who's trying to teach him how to have millions of plans on the side. I mean, even a boyfriend, at least I've -  I hope I don't have to go to plan B and C, but it's good to have plan, you know. OK, if we don't work out, this is what I'll do, you know (laughter). VEDANTAM: So your boyfriend. . . FIONA: There he is. VEDANTAM: Before he comes, in the 30 seconds before he's here. . . FIONA: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . Let me ask you, so if he doesn't work out, what's the plan B? FIONA: Every girl has people that maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, every girl, even she does. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). FIONA: You love one person, but if something doesn't work out, there's that guy, possible, possible, possible. Everyone has that. VEDANTAM: And so. . . FIONA: I don't know about men, but women has. VEDANTAM: So you actually have this list of people in your head. . . FIONA: Possibilities. VEDANTAM: . . . And you've basically said, this person right now that you're with is 80 percent, but there's a 75 percent chance of someone. . . FIONA: Some of them maybe even 40 percent, but it's still in the line. VEDANTAM: But it's still in line. You keep them in the line. FIONA: They're better than zero, you know? VEDANTAM: I see. FIONA: Yes. VEDANTAM: I see. Is this your boyfriend? FIONA: Yes. VEDANTAM: And we were just talking about - we are NPR reporters, and we're doing a story that looks at how people make plans and how they think about their plans. And she was talking about the different strategies and approaches that you both have in your personalities. RASVON: Yeah. VEDANTAM: So when you're making plans, do you often have a plan B and say, if this doesn't work out, that's going to work out? She was saying that you just are very focused on the things that you want to do. RASVON: Yeah, this is - I don't want to be in a situation when I feel vulnerable, especially in another country when I travel, if it's a traveling plan. So every time I look at other options, you know, the worst case scenario with what can go. . . VEDANTAM: So you actually do keep options? FIONA: Yeah, but he's more focused on plan A. RASVON: Yeah, I focus because I also don't accept failure in my plan. Everything has to go according to the plan. VEDANTAM: So in general, for the big things in your life, not, you know, how to get to Philadelphia and which bus to get, but for the big things in your life - where are you going to work and who are you going to marry and - do you actually have very clear ideas of what you want and say, this is what's going to happen, and I'm going to stick to that? RASVON: I'm trying to impose this philosophy of life. I think before I believed in more natural, and things just happen. But I'm thinking lately - I took this approach - I need to know what I want because otherwise, it will not just come to me. I need to be - to step up, take decisions, and go with it, not let it just come with karma. So nowadays, I feel I'm imposing myself this philosophy of knowing what I want. I want this, and why do I want this, and stick to it. VEDANTAM: So in terms of romantic life, do you have a plan B if she doesn't work out? Or are you saying, this is the one, and I'm not going to think about any other plans or plans and options? FIONA: Very good question. RASVON: Very good question, I don't have a plan B. I'm sticking to plan A. I'm sticking to my decision, and I will make it work. If I start with a plan B in a relationship, I think is - yeah, I'm thinking of the worst case scenario, but alcohol will get me through that. I don't need another plan B. But now I'm sticking to plan A because I think I'm doing a mutual decision in the moment or I hope I'm doing it. VEDANTAM: So I'm fascinated because you are actually saying that having a plan B can affect how much you focus on plan A. RASVON: On the plan A, then so I guess maybe first when I talked about focusing on when I'm traveling, maybe I look like a control freak. But I also think plan B makes you relaxed and think, yeah, whatever, let's just have a drink, and if you miss the bus, you take the second one. Let's just not give her all your attention because if it's not going to work, there's plenty of fish in the sea. But this will just make you relaxed and maybe not focused enough because the plan B is also comfortable. Plan B is always the comfort zone. You go back. There are plenty of buses. There are plenty of girls. There's plenty of this. It's back to the comfort zone where you don't have to step up, look at the time, bring flowers, give kisses. COLE: Well, I think that Rasvon (ph) has just written the song himself. That was very poetic. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). COLE: But what's the science behind this? VEDANTAM: So, Adam, Katy Milkman wanted to find out the evidence as well. She decided take her research out of the train station and into the laboratory. MILKMAN: And what we did is we gave participants a shared goal. They all had the same goal, which was to achieve high performance on a task we'd assigned to them. And in one study, we told them that if they achieved that high performance, they would get to finish up five minutes early. So they'd get the same pay that they were expecting to receive, but they'd have five extra minutes in their day to do with whatever they pleased. And one group, we asked them before they pursued this task to think about another way that they could save five minutes today if they didn't achieve the goal of getting five minutes back in our study. A second group we asked to simply brainstorm about what one could do with five minutes, to hold brainstorming constant. And then a third group was a control group, and they had no initial instructions. They just began the task. And what we found is that the group who had thought about a backup plan, about another way that they could save five minutes today, achieve significantly less success on the task we assign them. They worked less hard, they solve fewer puzzles, and this was significantly fewer than people in either of our control groups. VEDANTAM: So this is actually a disturbing finding in some ways because it really suggests that this very normal and perhaps even wise course of action, which is to have a plan B, to have a safety net when you're embarking on something difficult and dangerous, really has a downside. I mean, there's a real tension here. MILKMAN: That's right. I think there is a really important tension here. And again, what I don't want to say is that it means we should be done with backup plans because they provide real value. And all we're trying to show here is that there's a downside we might not be appreciating, and that we should try to find ways to stay equally motivated even if we do want to provide a safety net for ourselves. VEDANTAM: How do we go about doing that? I mean, this has been found in similar studies. If you look at people wearing helmets, for example, when they go bicycling they take more risks as they're bicycling. If you ask people to wear seatbelts in cars, they now drive a little bit faster than if they were not wearing seat belts. And I don't think, as you're saying, the implication is we should eliminate seatbelts and ask people not to wear helmets. But how do we get around this human tendency to say, I'm protected and therefore I can take a chance? MILKMAN: That's an absolutely fabulous question. I think it's the big question that the study raises. And unfortunately, we don't know the answer. But I do think awareness is always a good start, so recognizing that there is this downside, that there is this risk of feeling too comfortable, of feeling too confident. At least hopefully, that can begin to combat it. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering - in your own life, Katy, do you make backup plans? MILKMAN: I absolutely make backup plans. VEDANTAM: Give me an example of backup plans that you've made. MILKMAN: Oh gosh. That's a good question. I'm trying to think of my latest backup plan. So Jihae Shin was a doctoral student here at the University of Pennsylvania, at the Wharton school. And she was preparing to go on the academic job market hoping to find a fabulous faculty job. And she came into my office and said she was a bit worried about having a backup plan, making a plan B in case she didn't get that job, because she was worried it might demotivate her. Maybe one interesting implication is to think about whether or not you can outsource the job of backup plans. So as a student's advisor, for instance, perhaps they can focus solely on the primary plan of getting a job and let the advisor worry about the backup plan of where we'll find them a postdoctoral scholarship if they don't find a faculty position. Maybe that's the best of both worlds. The student stays motivated and feels that they only have a plan A, no plan B. But the advisor's taking care of offsetting the risk by worry about the plan B in the background. VEDANTAM: I think for this plan to work, you have to have an advisor that sends signals that they may be unreliable. MILKMAN: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: (Laughter) And that would send a message that the advisor actually can't be trusted to come up with a proper backup plan, which would motivate you to really focus on your primary goal. MILKMAN: That's right. Or you could simply have an advisor who's very quiet and doesn't signal one way or the other. And hopefully that will provide enough uncertainty that the student will work very, very hard. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) Thank you so much for talking with me today. MILKMAN: My pleasure. Thank you. COLE: So, Shankar, have you been coming up with a backup plan secretly in case I fail? VEDANTAM: You know, Adam, I think the point of Katy Milkman's research is I shouldn't tell you if I have a backup plan because if I do, it's going to make you slack off and think you have a safety net - so absolutely not, Adam. COLE: Wow, my heart rate is rising as we speak. I guess I'll furiously take more notes. VEDANTAM: Wonderful. Now we're going to take a short break. When we come back, I'm going to play a game of Stopwatch Science with my friend Daniel Pink. Dan and I will talk about a phenomenon called moral hazard. And the idea of moral hazard is that when you think you have a safety net, when you know that you have a backup plan, a plan B, you will take plan A less seriously, and as a result, all sorts of bad things happen.

VEDANTAM: Welcome to another edition of Stopwatch Science. I'm joined by senior Stopwatch Science correspondent, Daniel Pink. Hi, Dan. PINK: Hey, Shankar. VEDANTAM: Now, in addition to his role here on the HIDDEN BRAIN, Dan is also an author and a commentator. In Stopwatch Science, Dan and I challenge each other to present two pieces of research in under a minute each. Today, we're presenting studies about moral hazard. This is the idea that safety nets can sometimes cause us to take unnecessary risks. They change our behavior. There's no safety net here on Stopwatch Science, just a timer and a buzzer. Dan, can you tell me what sound I'm going to hear if I exceed my one minute? PINK: Well, I've chosen the old car horn sound, like this. . . (SOUNDBITE OF CAR HORN) VEDANTAM: That sounds a little like a rooster, doesn't it? I have decided that the sound that I'm going to play for Dan when he exceeds his time is this. . . (SOUNDBITE OF CHIMPANZEE) PINK: What is that? VEDANTAM: That's the sound of a chimpanzee, Dan. PINK: OK. Thank you, alright. VEDANTAM: Dan Pink, your first minute starts right now. PINK: So these are glorious times for scholars who research moral hazard. There's nothing like a financial crisis - it's really the full-employment act for moral hazard scholars, including Michael Aklin and Andreas Kern. While one is from Pitt, one is from Georgetown, and they did something really interesting. They had a theory that they decided to back up looking at some numbers. And they found - I'll go straight to the punch line - that if you want to predict which countries are going to have a financial crisis, look to see where US troops are deployed. Now, the reason for this is, once again, moral hazard. The thinking is that hey, if there are troops in a particular country, and the country goes south financially, big brother Uncle Sam is going to step up and bail the country out. Now, they also tested something. They said, wait, maybe we put troops in countries that are at risk of financial crisis. Eh, not the same. . . (SOUNDBITE OF CHIMPANZEE) PINK: Come on. VEDANTAM: This is so interesting I'm actually going to let you go on. Keep going. PINK: Now, do we put troops in places that are at risk of financial instability? VEDANTAM: Exactly, yeah. PINK: And the answer is no because there are other markers when US troops go there that actually indicate financial health. What it suggests is that when we deploy troops out there. . . VEDANTAM: Yeah. PINK: . . . It makes countries say, hey, we're protected, we can take some risks. VEDANTAM: And that's pretty much the standard definition of moral hazard. PINK: You got it. VEDANTAM: I think that's pretty amazing, Dan. PINK: Thank you. So speaking of moral hazard, I'm going to turn on my stopwatch here. And I'm going to give you one minute. Now, remember the car horn will sound if you exceed your one minute. So get ready right now. VEDANTAM: Alright, I'm going to be talking about bicycles and bicycle helmets in a very interesting experiment that was run in England some years ago. This is a study by Ian Walker, who's in the Department of Psychology at the University of Bath, or Bath - I'm not quite how they pronounce it. Anyway, what he did was he rolled on a stretch of highway either with his helmet on or with his helmet off and then measured, using a camera, how close cars came to him when he was wearing the helmet and when he was not wearing the helmet. And what moral hazard predicts is that when he seems to be protected because he's wearing a helmet, car drivers feel like they can take more risks because they feel that if I get close enough and he topples over, he's not going to die, he's wearing a helmet. And that's exactly what he found. When he was wearing a helmet, car drivers actually came closer to him - they drove closer. One of the interesting things he also found is that when he wore a woman's wig, fewer people came close to him because they had the stereotype that women drivers or women. . . (SOUNDBITE OF CAR HORN) PINK: They honked at him because he was wearing a wig. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) That's probably exactly what they did. But in this case they honked from some distance because their stereotype was women bicyclists were a little less stable than male bicyclists. PINK: Very interesting. So I guess Shankar's message to all you kids out there is, don't wear a helmet, just put on a woman's wig. VEDANTAM: I'm not sure I would say that but I'm not going to say more on that because I know Dan is just trying to buy time instead of paying attention to the fact that his one minute starts right now. PINK: OK, so we talked about Uncle Sam. Now we're going to talk about an even higher power - God. There's some great research out of Stanford showing that when people hear references to God, they're willing to take bigger risks. . . VEDANTAM: Wow. PINK: . . . But only certain kinds of risks. So here's what they did. They said to people, do you want, for a fee, stare into the bright light that might harm your eyes? People who were reminded of God beforehand were more likely to do it. VEDANTAM: Wow. PINK: Now, they also did - tested this with things that were - had moral content to them. So they said, do you want to learn how to bribe people? Do you want to learn how to parasail? And when people were faced with the opportunity to learn how to bribe people, something that had moral content, they were actually less likely to take that risk. So what this shows is that when it comes to physical risk - not anything that involves values - that being exposed to God - seeing things like In God We Trust, seeing something like the 10 Commandments - can make people. . . (SOUNDBITE OF CHIMPANZEE) PINK: . . . Chirp like a chimpanzee VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: Yeah. VEDANTAM: That was really interesting, Dan. PINK: So because people feel protected - people feel protected by God so they'll take more risk. Now, Shankar, I have to say, in this case you're not protected by God or by United States military. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: . . . Or by a wig. So you are all on your own, starting right now. VEDANTAM: I'm happy to report that the study that I'm just about to tell Dan is going to destabilize him to the extent that he's probably going to forget about the stopwatch. . . PINK: OK. VEDANTAM: . . . Because it has to do with how parents with college-going kids behave. PINK: Uh-oh. VEDANTAM: And Dan has kids who are just about to head off to college. And this is research by Laura Hamilton who looks at what the effect is of parents paying for their children when they go to college. PINK: OK. VEDANTAM: And what Laura Hamilton finds is that the more money parents pay for their kids, the less kids are required to sort of stand on their own in college, the worse that kids perform in terms of their GPA. It's not a huge effect, but what it finds is that when kids don't have to feel like their performance in college is actually on them, that there's somebody who is carrying them, that someone who is going to give the money, it makes them say, I'm just going to take it easy. I'm going to go to the bar. I'm just going to hang out with my friends. I'm going to pay less attention to my studies. So I don't know how this is going to change your behavior vis-a-vis your kids, Dan, but I'm going to tell you that it might be a good idea just to cut your kids off just like you're cutting me off right now. PINK: Yeah, wow, that's actually quite fascinating. It makes me want to call my daughter and say, Sophia, it's been nice knowing you, but next fall. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: . . . You're completely on your own. Good luck. I'm just trying to avoid moral hazard, darling. VEDANTAM: If you do that Dan, just make sure you didn't tell her the idea came from me. PINK: No, I won't. VEDANTAM: All right, this has been another round of Stopwatch Science. I'm Shankar Vedantam. PINK: And I'm Daniel Pink. VEDANTAM: I'm back in the studio now with Adam Cole, producer reporter extraordinary from NPR's Science Desk, and we've challenged Adam to come up with a song that stitches all the ideas in this podcast episode together. Adam, have you gotten any ideas? COLE: I've written down the downside to safety nets, a lack of focus on primary goals, the Kenya-Romania-Germany-U. K. couple. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). COLE: . . . Moral hazard, plenty of girls, plenty of buses. VEDANTAM: Writing a song is going to be a breeze for you. COLE: That's right. I'm just going to go back to the skunk bear cave, and we'll see what I come up with. VEDANTAM: All right, everyone. Adam is now out of the skunk bear cave. Was this a success? COLE: I - well, I came up with something. I know that you're a huge fan of pop punk, and so. . . VEDANTAM: Of course. COLE: Famously, so what we've got here is a pop punk garage band. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). COLE: . . . Entitled Moral Hazzard with two Zs. . . VEDANTAM: Hazzard with two Zs. I love it. COLE: . . . With the song, \"I Don't Need No Plan B. \" (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"I DON'T NEED NO PLAN B\") MORAL HAZZARD: (Singing) They all say you better have a plan B, but I say no way. I don't need the security. My old man won't pay for university, and Uncle Sam won't prop up my economy. No backup plan because backups can distract me from my goal today. No safety net, my alphabet begins and ends with A. I don't need no plan B, no plan B. I don't need no plan B, yeah, yeah. It's not risk-free, but it's a good philosophy. I don't need no plan B, no plan B. When I bike, don't wear a helmet on my head because I like to wear this wig instead. I realize I'm no Matthew McConaughey. For you, I'd fly from Kenya to the U. K. All around the world there's lots of girls, but there is just one us. You make me flip, your love's a trip, and I won't miss that bus. I don't need no plan B, no plan B. I don't need no plan B, yeah, yeah. There's other fish in the sea, but you're the only one for me. I don't need no plan B, no plan B. I got my eggs in one basket, my money in one place. Every day's fantastic because I get to see your face. But I know what's on your mind, Stu and Steve and Stanley. Forget those other guys. You don't need no plan B. You don't need no plan B, no plan B. You don't need no plan B, yeah, yeah. There's other fish in the sea, but you're the only one for me. You don't need no plan B, no plan B. I don't need no plan B. You don't need no plan B. We don't need no plan B. We don't need no plan B, no plan B. VEDANTAM: Adam Cole, thank you so much for playing our game. COLE: Thanks for having me. (SOUNDBITE OF MORAL HAZZARD SONG, \"I DON'T NEED NO PLAN B\") VEDANTAM: That was amazing. COLE: Thank you.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. A few months ago, I was asked to host an event in Washington, D. C. , with the comedian Aziz Ansari. You might know him as Tom Haverford from \"Parks And Recreation,\" or you might be binge-watching his new original series on Netflix, \"Master Of None. \" What you might not know about Aziz is that he's also interested in human behavior. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)AZIZ ANSARI: One out of three people that get married now, they meet their spouse through online dating. So you could look at it like, oh, well, there's an insane amount of love that would not even be there had it not been for these things. And I feel like you can't deny that that's a positive thing. VEDANTAM: He recently co-wrote a book with the sociologist Eric Klinenberg called \"Modern Romance\" about the changing state of love in the digital age. We taped the live conversation at George Washington University's Lisner Auditorium, and we're going to play you an excerpt. If you know anything about Aziz, we don't need to tell you this episode is going to get a little racy. If you're in the car with kids, you might want to save this episode for later. Enjoy. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC, SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)VEDANTAM: I want to jump to one particular section that you start right at the top of the book, looking at ways in which people text one another. . . ANSARI: Sure. VEDANTAM: . . . And the fact that people turn out to be surprisingly bad at texting. Actually, I should correct that. What you're saying is that men turn out to be surprisingly bad at texting women. ANSARI: Yeah. (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)ANSARI: Well, I will say this, OK? When we, like, ask women, like, well, what are the things you like when guys text you, like, what are the factors that make a text that you like, and kind of the consensus we got was asking them to do a specific thing at a specific time, saying something that may be, like, recalled, like an interaction that they had in the past to kind of just show that you are engaged and this was something that you're in to. And the last thing was, like, just, you know, some sort of humor is also helpful. And, you know, in the book, we talk about this stuff, and it's not from the perspective of this is what you should do, more like how the [expletive] do people not know, like, this is all you have to do. Like, the bar is startlingly low. Like, it's really, like, very scary how low the bar is. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering whether we can have you just read a short excerpt from the book that talks about how badly men are doing this. And you have a little excerpt here. . . ANSARI: Sure. VEDANTAM: . . . With a guy who tries to text a woman. It's on page 42 for anyone if you want to. . . ANSARI: OK, great. VEDANTAM: . . . Read along, so. . . ANSARI: OK. (Reading) So people say it doesn't matter what you text someone. They like you, they like you. After interviewing hundreds of singles, I can scientifically confirm that this is total [expletive]. For those who doubt me, here is an example from a show I did at the Chicago Theater in the spring of 2014. During that tour, after material about texting, I would ask if anyone in the audience had recently met someone or had been texting back and forth. If they had, they would come onto the stage now and pick a few people and read, analyze and ask them about what was happening in their messages. At this particular show, I was speaking with Rachel who had met a guy at a good friend's wedding. As it happened, the guy was also a friend of her sister's, so he had a pretty good shot at a first date with her. She was single. She was interested. All he had to do was send her a simple message introducing himself and asking her to do something. Here's what happened. (LAUGHTER)ANSARI: (Reading) He sends his first message. Hi, Rachel. Since I never got a chance to ask you to dance at Marissa and Chris's wedding - I'm Chris's old roommate from Purdue - he and your sister gave me your number. I wanted to say hi and sort of texty introduce myself, haha (ph). Hope you had a great weekend, dot dot dot. Hope to chat with you soon. (LAUGHTER)ANSARI: (Reading) Rachel wrote back 10 minutes later. Hey, great to meet you, currently enjoying my birthday weekend with lots of good Mexican food. It happens when your birthday is in Cinco de Mayo. Hope you had a great weekend, too. He wrote back shortly. I totally realize upon reading my last message I didn't include my name (laughter). (LAUGHTER)ANSARI: I'm Will, smiley face. Feliz cumpleanos as well. (LAUGHTER)ANSARI: And totally digging on the Cinco de Mayo theme. Rachel never met Will. (LAUGHTER)ANSARI: (Reading) After a few messages of this nature, Rachel stopped responding. None of us know Will. He may be a kind, handsome man with a heart of gold. But all we have to go on is those messages, and those messages have shaped in our minds a very dorky, terrifyingly Caucasian weirdo. (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)VEDANTAM: So one of the things that you point out in the book is that there's this arms race in waiting when someone texts you, that if you. . . ANSARI: Yeah. VEDANTAM: . . . Respond to a text right away, you instantly lose all leverage because you indicate interest. You indicate desperation. So you wait when someone texts you. And now that person is playing the same game with you, so they wait and respond to texting you, and now you have this extended waiting game. ANSARI: It's so weird, and it's weird because everyone knows what people are doing, and they still [expletive] do it. (LAUGHTER)ANSARI: Like, oh, you're going to wait 20 minutes? Oh, did you have a meeting? No, you [expletive] didn't. You were waiting on purpose. Well, guess what, I'm going to wait 40 minutes. I'm going to double that [expletive] because I have [expletive] going on, too, not really, but I'm going to pretend like I do. It's so weird. You know, that was the thing that was interesting to me. Like, I wondered, like, why did that waiting drive me crazy when I was single and, like, had to deal with that. Like, I would go crazy. And, you know, in the book, we looked at a lot of studies. We talked to a lot of very smart people, and they explain it to me, and it made sense. Like, basically, the idea is like - let's say you're a guy. You meet three women, and you text all three of them, and two of them write you back. The two that write you back, they kind of put your mind at ease, right? Well, the third one has not written you back, so they're not putting your mind at ease. And they've created uncertainty, and uncertainty is very powerful, and it sticks in your mind. And you're like, well, what the [expletive] is going on? What did I do? Did I do something wrong? Does this person not like me? What's happening? What's happening? And so that person has more presence of your mind, and just that presence on your mind can sometimes develop into attraction. So when they finally do put your mind at ease, it's more meaningful to you. But there's also kind of, like, at a certain point, if you wait too long, then the person's like, well, screw, this person. Like, they waited too long. Like, screw them. I'm going to hang out with one of these other people that wrote me back quickly or whatever. So it's just never quite a precise thing. There's not, like, something you can say where it's like, OK, if you wait, like, this amount of minutes, you're going to be perfect. Like, all those things vary from person to person. There's a lot of factors. But the thing we learned is, like, that amount of time decreases as you get to younger people. Like, if you talk - I'm 32. If you talk to someone my age, they're like, oh, if they wait, like, you know, a day or, like, six hours, it's a little unnerving. If you talk to someone who is, like, in college now, they're like, I haven't heard anything in five minutes. What's happened? (LAUGHTER)ANSARI: OK, it's that window is getting smaller and smaller. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: When we come back, we'll talk about how the ever-growing pool of dating options can be both a blessing and a curse. This is related to an idea in psychology known as the paradox of choice. Having too many choices can be tough when you're dating or when you're buying jam. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ANSARI: Like, there's just too much goddamn jam out there. Like. . . (LAUGHTER)ANSARI: . . . You know, you go on a date, and you go to the bathroom, like, a few pieces of jam have texted you, and you're like, what the [expletive] is this. You go online, there's so much jam out there. There's iPhone apps that literally tell you that there's jam nearby that wants to get eaten at that very moment. I mean. . . (LAUGHTER)ANSARI: . . . What can you do? VEDANTAM: Stay with us.

VEDANTAM: Welcome back to HIDDEN BRAIN. Aziz Ansari talks in his book about the vast number of dating choices people have today. This led to an idea that's been explored in the social sciences. It's known as the paradox of choice. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ANSARI: One of the big changes for people that are, like, dating now is you have more options than any generation of people ever. You know, when we talked to people that were living in retirement homes and stuff, it was really interesting. They talked about how, like - especially with the women it was really interesting. You know, they were saying, like, well, you know, I was 20 years old. I was living with my parents. I didn't have the opportunity to pursue education or my own career. I didn't really get to become an adult until I got married. And there was some guy that lived in the neighborhood. He was pretty nice. And I wanted to get out of the house, and I was like, all right, I'll get married, you know. (LAUGHTER)ANSARI: And they really said that. I was like, are - it sounds like it because they were like - some of the women, they were really happy. They were like, oh, we grew to have this deep bond, but other women were like, no, not as much of a bond, and. . . (LAUGHTER)ANSARI: . . . And getting married was kind of the first step in adulthood for those generations. But for us, this, you know, people now, marriage isn't always a first step. You know, you go to college, you pursue a career, you live in a bunch of different places, and you meet so many people throughout all these different stages of your life. You have this whole stage of life that is referred to as emerging adulthood. And yeah, you meet so many people that way. And then you add in the online dating aspect of things, and you have more options than anyone could have possibly imagined in those generations of retirement homes. VEDANTAM: So I mean, I can see why a dating pool of three people is too small to actually find your life partner, but a dating pool of 30,000 or 300,000 is just unmanageable because what happens is every time you meet someone who's potentially interesting, a little voice in the back of your head says, if you wait for another two days, you could find someone better than this. ANSARI: Well, yeah, you - well, the problem is it's what we refer to or what does this gentleman Barry Schwartz that we interviewed in the book - he does a lot of research on choice, and he wrote this book called the \"Paradox Of Choice,\" and the kind of main thesis of that book is the idea that, like, you know, when you have more options, your instinct is, oh, well, that's better. I have more options, I have more things to choose from. I'll be happier. But in reality, when they do study after study, they find the more options you have, the harder it is to make a decision. And when you do make a decision, you end up being less satisfied because you're thinking about whether you made the wrong decision or whether one of these other things would've been a better match for you. And the really famous study is this study they did in a grocery store where they had two different displays with jams. And one display had, like, you know, five jams, and then the other display had, like, 36 jams. And whenever it was the five jams, people were way more likely to buy the jams. And when they had the 36 jams, they were just overwhelmed, and they didn't know what to do, and they ended up not buying jam sometimes, so. . . (LAUGHTER)ANSARI: And they also said this, which is really interesting. They said, like, oh, people that bought the jams from the 36, like, the bigger display or whatever else - I'm getting these numbers wrong. I'm paraphrasing it, but the core of the thing is right. The one they bought from the one with the bigger display with more options, the people reported being less satisfied with the jam, which I found really hilarious, the idea that someone ate jam and like, this jam's not satisfying. What's wrong with this jam (laughter)? This doesn't taste like strawberries (laughter). But the thing we say in the book is, like, to me, like, that totally applies to modern romance because, I mean, there's just too much goddamn jam out there. Like. . . (LAUGHTER)ANSARI: . . . You know, you go on a date, and you go to the bathroom, like a few pieces of jam have texted you, and you're like, what the [expletive] is this. You go online, there's so much jam out there. There's iPhone apps that literally tell you that there's jam nearby that wants to get eaten at that very moment. I mean. . . (LAUGHTER)ANSARI: . . . What can you do? (APPLAUSE)VEDANTAM: You know, you talk in the book about this guy you interviewed who I think who was on match. com, and you actually got to observe him making choices where he was sort of reviewing pictures of women and then deciding whether he liked them or not. ANSARI: Yes. VEDANTAM: And I don't know if you remember the specific anecdote, but I'm wondering if you can just tell us about it. ANSARI: Yeah, I remember this guy. I - so. . . (LAUGHTER)ANSARI: . . . He just - he didn't seem like - like, he wasn't, like, a hunk or anything. Like, he wasn't a stud. He was just kind of, like - and this is mean, but he was just kind of like a mediocre white guy (laughter). And he logged onto his account, and it said, like, oh - it was a match. com account in this case - and he looks on it, and he was just like - and it said, like, you have these many matches. And I looked at the photo, and I was like, wow, that woman's very attractive. And then he looked at her profile, and he is, like, debating whether he should send her message, and he's like, no, and I was like, what? (LAUGHTER)ANSARI: Why are you not sending her a message? And he's like, she likes the Red Sox. (LAUGHTER)ANSARI: And I was like, what? And then, like, I saw him go to another woman and ignore her. And then he ignored, like, one other woman and then he sent this other woman, like, a quick message. And it blew my mind because if any of those other three women that he, like, put an X on, if they had seen him in a bar, like, you know, 20 years ago and, like, smiled at him, he would have [expletive]. (LAUGHTER)ANSARI: He would have went crazy. He would have been crazy. These were beautiful women. They were very interesting and seem like intelligent, thoughtful people just - and, you know, based on what little I saw from the profile - but they seem like interesting people where it would be a catch for this guy. But now, he was just like, eh, whatever. Like, there's so many people out here - who cares? VEDANTAM: So - But here's the thing that I find really sad about what you're describing, which is that people are looking at these pictures and they're making judgments about this other person based on this very, very small amount of information, and often based on things that they think are important criteria to them. So if you ask people, they will tell you, I want someone who's this tall or this short or this color hair or this body profile and so on. ANSARI: Yeah. VEDANTAM: But if you actually look at the data of who people end up with, people often don't end up with the people that they say they're actually looking for. So if they eliminate people based on the criteria they think they have, they might be  eliminating their soul mates. ANSARI: Exactly, yeah. I mean, yeah - there's plenty of studies that show that we're horrible at knowing what we really like, you know? Whenever they look at these online sites and they see what people say they prefer and what they actually go after, it's always - there's always a big contrast. You're like, what? You said you like this but that's actually who you're interested in. I think that goes back to this idea of, like, you know, all these online dating sites - you have all these filters and all this stuff. But none of it really matters. Like, it's really just about, like, this connection that you have with someone in person and seeing if there's some sort of spark or connection. Like, when you have this connection with someone in real life, you don't stop and go wait, wait, wait - hold on, what are your favorite movies? Like, you're just - you don't give a [expletive]. You're engaged with the person, and you like it, and it's fun. And I think sometimes with these online sites, the people that seem to be a little frustrated were people that were trying to find this perfect person and spending this extended period of time, like, messaging back and forth and trying to find this elusive rapport. And really, you just find that in person. And I think our kind of big take-away from online dating was what this woman Helen Fisher told us is - and she's, like, this amazingly smart social anthropologist and also works with match. com. And she's like, you know, these sites shouldn't be called online dating sites. They should be called online introduction services because you want to meet this person in person. Like - and what I realized is, like, you know, you don't meet the perfect person online. You can meet a person online. But to find out they're perfect, you have to see how you are in a person. VEDANTAM: So in other words, you really - you have to sort of date three before you actually figure out whether this person is for you or not. But if you're in constantly swipe right-swipe left mode, you are not going to get to that point. ANSARI: Or even worse than the swipe right-swipe left mode is this mode of like, oh, let me just keep sending messages and see if this is my dream person. You know, Tinder, I actually I think - and those kind of swipe apps - I totally see why those came about. Like, there's some people that would say, oh, well that seems really shallow, just to see a picture and just, like, swipe and decide if you're going to meet someone. But, I mean, when you go into a bar or a party, you're looking at people and going no, no, yes - you're doing that. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: So I'm trying to internalize your lesson, which is that it's less important to meet new people and more important to spend time with the people you meet to figure out if they're actually right for you. ANSARI: So the thing we mention in the book is what we call the Flo Rida theory of acquired likability through repetition. . . (LAUGHTER)ANSARI: . . . Which basically is saying, like, yes, they're [expletive] people. Yes, of course. But I'd like to think there's a lot of great people out there. And a lot of people that we're quick to dismiss. If you apply this theory - the theory is basically like, we're all like a Flo Rida song, you know? The first time you hear it, you're like, all right, Flo Rida, I've heard this [expletive] before; get it out of here, leave me alone. And then you keep hearing it. And it gets stuck in your head. And you're like, Flo Rida, you've done it again - let's dance. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: I was reading a section of the book this afternoon that brought back some memories from some years ago involving a certain Congressman from New York. . . ANSARI: Sure. VEDANTAM: . . . And some Facebook messages he had exchanged with a woman named Lisa from Las Vegas. I'm wondering if you might be able to read this exchange for us. ANSARI: Sure. VEDANTAM: And I want to ask you whether you think these online sites and this technology has increased the risk of indiscretions and infidelity. ANSARI: Sure. All right. (Reading) I remember reading the Anthony Weiner Facebook messages. Seeing the way he was just messaging random women all over the country and watching the messages quickly escalate from innocuous to very sexual was unbelievable. This is a transcript of a chat session he had with one of these women - a lady named Lisa from Las Vegas. Weiner and Lisa - sorry to bring this back guys - but it is fascinating. Lisa - I'm trying to find the wonderful Anthony Weiner who I fell in love with for yelling at those damn Republicans the other day. And you as were as funny as hell on \"The Daily Show. \" Your friend requests are full. You must friend me. You are awesome. Anthony - thank you, Lisa - glad you have my back. You keeping an eye on that wackadoodle (ph) Sharron Angle for us? Lisa - how insane is she? Who needs Social Security, Medicare or education? If this wacko wins my state, I swear I'll have to move. She may be dumber than plain, and that is tough to find. (LAUGHTER)ANSARI: (Reading) Like this cute new pic of you - when are you coming to Vegas to help me beat up the right-wing crazies? Anthony - This is my pull-my-finger shot - glad you like. I'm ready for a Vegas trip. Truth telling during the day - got a night plan for us? Lisa - Haha (ph) that was a very loaded question. I've got all kinds of night plans for us. When are you coming? Anthony - Don't know - make me an offer I can't refuse. Lisa - To get us in the mood, first we watch back-to-back episodes of \"The Daily Show\" and \"Colbert Report. \"(LAUGHTER)ANSARI: (Reading) Then to really spice things up, we go deface all of my neighbors' Sharron Angle yard signs. Then when we're really hot, we go to the bookstore and cover all the Glenn Beck books with copies of \"The Audacity Of Hope. \"(LAUGHTER)ANSARI: (Reading) I do this about once a week. You can tell I'm a very exciting girl. Or if this is not your thing, we can just get drunk and have mad, passionate sex. For me, the most offensive part was that he used the word wackadoodle. (LAUGHTER)ANSARI: (Reading) Also, did you catch that sly, almost subliminal, blink-and-you-might-miss-it allusion to sex? It was when she said they could have mad, passionate sex. (APPLAUSE)VEDANTAM: So what do you think, Aziz? Have these online technologies made us more prone to indiscretion and infidelity, or is this just a manifestation of how we've always been? ANSARI: I think it definitely - there's definitely - if you're trying to get involved in indiscretions you - if you have these online things and you have your phone - if you have your phone, you have this very private world where you can conduct all sorts of [expletive] that no one knows about. There's a story we tell in the book of this person who says they were - they had, like, a work colleague. And they were friendly with each other. She was married. And she sent, like, a text message about something once. And it was, like, work-related. And he wrote back. And then later he saw something that was kind of funny that reminded him of her and he sent a message. And they started joking back and forth. And this rapport started developing. And they eventually had this, like, very, like, intimate thing going on the phone where they were, like, having long conversations. And it became this very intimate thing. And it eventually led to some infidelity. And it was interesting because the guy was like, you know, if I didn't have text message, I wouldn't have sent that first message that started leading to that rapport, you know, I would never have called her at her home and been like, hey, did you see that thing? Like, you know - but with your phone you can kind of build these kind of things that really escalate very quickly. And also I think, like, you know, in the Anthony Weiner thing it's like, oh, he's able to test the waters with that medium a little bit, where he's like, don't know, make me an offer I can't refuse. She could be like, oh, well, we'll go to Chili's. And he'll be like, oh, that doesn't sound fun. But she immediately, like, got it and started getting sexual. And he knew, like, okay, this is a sexual thing - she's down. And then after that message that I read, like, the floodgates opened and then, you know, there was all the photos and all that stuff. I - you know, I think - I don't think you can kind of accurately say whether it's led to an increase on the amount of infidelity that's going on. I do think there's certain aspects of it that make it a little more - lend itself to it, yeah. VEDANTAM: One of the things you talk about in the book is about how online dating is rapidly becoming the way many people meet. But you also find that this is especially true for same-sex couples - that same-sex couples' online dating has really become the dominant way people meet one another. Why do you think that's going on, and what do you think it means? ANSARI: Well, that is about something - a phenomenon related to what are referred to as thin markets. You know, I spoke with this woman who, like, late in her life - like, she was married to a guy. And then she got divorced and just kind of decided, like, you know what, I'm a lesbian. Like, I've been a lesbian my whole life. And she lives in this small town in Texas. And she started online dating and going out on dates and stuff like that. And I thought about that. I was like, wow, like, if that was her, you know, 20, 30 years ago, that would have been a much different thing. You know, being in a place like Texas, in a small town where maybe people aren't as open to that kind of stuff - it would have been way harder, whereas now she can go online and she's able to meet people and it's really a huge. . . VEDANTAM: And so this in some way is sort of the positive side of technology, isn't it? Because it allows people who have minority interests, if you will, or sort of special interests, not to be lonely forever - to actually find people who match their interests, match their needs. And this is what technology has enabled. ANSARI: Yeah, it's really helped in those kind of thin markets or whatever. And I think that's a - it's a good point that, like, for all these things there - I feel like, you know, kind of one of the big questions the book is asking is, oh, is all this stuff good or bad? And I think for each thing, it's not one answer. It's both. It really just depends on how you use these tools. You know, something like online dating - there's one notion of like, oh, everyone's on their phones, everyone thinks that there's something better out there, and it's just added so much stress to my life, and I hate it. Than you could also look at the other side of, like, well, one out of three people that get married now, they meet their spouse through online dating. And a huge percentage of these people are meeting people that they would not have met had it not been for these sites. So you could look at it like, oh, well, there's an insane amount of new love in the world that's created because of this technology. And there's just this overwhelming amount of love that would not even be there had it not been for these things. And I feel like you can't deny that that's a positive thing.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. A few months ago, I was asked to host an event in Washington, D. C. , with the comedian Aziz Ansari. You might know him as Tom Haverford from \"Parks And Recreation,\" or you might be binge-watching his new original series on Netflix, \"Master Of None. \" What you might not know about Aziz is that he's also interested in human behavior. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) AZIZ ANSARI: One out of three people that get married now, they meet their spouse through online dating. So you could look at it like, oh, well, there's an insane amount of love that would not even be there had it not been for these things. And I feel like you can't deny that that's a positive thing. VEDANTAM: He recently co-wrote a book with the sociologist Eric Klinenberg called \"Modern Romance\" about the changing state of love in the digital age. We taped the live conversation at George Washington University's Lisner Auditorium, and we're going to play you an excerpt. If you know anything about Aziz, we don't need to tell you this episode is going to get a little racy. If you're in the car with kids, you might want to save this episode for later. Enjoy. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC, SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VEDANTAM: I want to jump to one particular section that you start right at the top of the book, looking at ways in which people text one another. . . ANSARI: Sure. VEDANTAM: . . . And the fact that people turn out to be surprisingly bad at texting. Actually, I should correct that. What you're saying is that men turn out to be surprisingly bad at texting women. ANSARI: Yeah. (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE) ANSARI: Well, I will say this, OK? When we, like, ask women, like, well, what are the things you like when guys text you, like, what are the factors that make a text that you like, and kind of the consensus we got was asking them to do a specific thing at a specific time, saying something that may be, like, recalled, like an interaction that they had in the past to kind of just show that you are engaged and this was something that you're in to. And the last thing was, like, just, you know, some sort of humor is also helpful. And, you know, in the book, we talk about this stuff, and it's not from the perspective of this is what you should do, more like how the [expletive] do people not know, like, this is all you have to do. Like, the bar is startlingly low. Like, it's really, like, very scary how low the bar is. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering whether we can have you just read a short excerpt from the book that talks about how badly men are doing this. And you have a little excerpt here. . . ANSARI: Sure. VEDANTAM: . . . With a guy who tries to text a woman. It's on page 42 for anyone if you want to. . . ANSARI: OK, great. VEDANTAM: . . . Read along, so. . . ANSARI: OK. (Reading) So people say it doesn't matter what you text someone. They like you, they like you. After interviewing hundreds of singles, I can scientifically confirm that this is total [expletive]. For those who doubt me, here is an example from a show I did at the Chicago Theater in the spring of 2014. During that tour, after material about texting, I would ask if anyone in the audience had recently met someone or had been texting back and forth. If they had, they would come onto the stage now and pick a few people and read, analyze and ask them about what was happening in their messages. At this particular show, I was speaking with Rachel who had met a guy at a good friend's wedding. As it happened, the guy was also a friend of her sister's, so he had a pretty good shot at a first date with her. She was single. She was interested. All he had to do was send her a simple message introducing himself and asking her to do something. Here's what happened. (LAUGHTER) ANSARI: (Reading) He sends his first message. Hi, Rachel. Since I never got a chance to ask you to dance at Marissa and Chris's wedding - I'm Chris's old roommate from Purdue - he and your sister gave me your number. I wanted to say hi and sort of texty introduce myself, haha (ph). Hope you had a great weekend, dot dot dot. Hope to chat with you soon. (LAUGHTER) ANSARI: (Reading) Rachel wrote back 10 minutes later. Hey, great to meet you, currently enjoying my birthday weekend with lots of good Mexican food. It happens when your birthday is in Cinco de Mayo. Hope you had a great weekend, too. He wrote back shortly. I totally realize upon reading my last message I didn't include my name (laughter). (LAUGHTER) ANSARI: I'm Will, smiley face. Feliz cumpleanos as well. (LAUGHTER) ANSARI: And totally digging on the Cinco de Mayo theme. Rachel never met Will. (LAUGHTER) ANSARI: (Reading) After a few messages of this nature, Rachel stopped responding. None of us know Will. He may be a kind, handsome man with a heart of gold. But all we have to go on is those messages, and those messages have shaped in our minds a very dorky, terrifyingly Caucasian weirdo. (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE) VEDANTAM: So one of the things that you point out in the book is that there's this arms race in waiting when someone texts you, that if you. . . ANSARI: Yeah. VEDANTAM: . . . Respond to a text right away, you instantly lose all leverage because you indicate interest. You indicate desperation. So you wait when someone texts you. And now that person is playing the same game with you, so they wait and respond to texting you, and now you have this extended waiting game. ANSARI: It's so weird, and it's weird because everyone knows what people are doing, and they still [expletive] do it. (LAUGHTER) ANSARI: Like, oh, you're going to wait 20 minutes? Oh, did you have a meeting? No, you [expletive] didn't. You were waiting on purpose. Well, guess what, I'm going to wait 40 minutes. I'm going to double that [expletive] because I have [expletive] going on, too, not really, but I'm going to pretend like I do. It's so weird. You know, that was the thing that was interesting to me. Like, I wondered, like, why did that waiting drive me crazy when I was single and, like, had to deal with that. Like, I would go crazy. And, you know, in the book, we looked at a lot of studies. We talked to a lot of very smart people, and they explain it to me, and it made sense. Like, basically, the idea is like - let's say you're a guy. You meet three women, and you text all three of them, and two of them write you back. The two that write you back, they kind of put your mind at ease, right? Well, the third one has not written you back, so they're not putting your mind at ease. And they've created uncertainty, and uncertainty is very powerful, and it sticks in your mind. And you're like, well, what the [expletive] is going on? What did I do? Did I do something wrong? Does this person not like me? What's happening? What's happening? And so that person has more presence of your mind, and just that presence on your mind can sometimes develop into attraction. So when they finally do put your mind at ease, it's more meaningful to you. But there's also kind of, like, at a certain point, if you wait too long, then the person's like, well, screw, this person. Like, they waited too long. Like, screw them. I'm going to hang out with one of these other people that wrote me back quickly or whatever. So it's just never quite a precise thing. There's not, like, something you can say where it's like, OK, if you wait, like, this amount of minutes, you're going to be perfect. Like, all those things vary from person to person. There's a lot of factors. But the thing we learned is, like, that amount of time decreases as you get to younger people. Like, if you talk - I'm 32. If you talk to someone my age, they're like, oh, if they wait, like, you know, a day or, like, six hours, it's a little unnerving. If you talk to someone who is, like, in college now, they're like, I haven't heard anything in five minutes. What's happened? (LAUGHTER) ANSARI: OK, it's that window is getting smaller and smaller. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: When we come back, we'll talk about how the ever-growing pool of dating options can be both a blessing and a curse. This is related to an idea in psychology known as the paradox of choice. Having too many choices can be tough when you're dating or when you're buying jam. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANSARI: Like, there's just too much goddamn jam out there. Like. . . (LAUGHTER) ANSARI: . . . You know, you go on a date, and you go to the bathroom, like, a few pieces of jam have texted you, and you're like, what the [expletive] is this. You go online, there's so much jam out there. There's iPhone apps that literally tell you that there's jam nearby that wants to get eaten at that very moment. I mean. . . (LAUGHTER) ANSARI: . . . What can you do? VEDANTAM: Stay with us.

VEDANTAM: Welcome back to HIDDEN BRAIN. Aziz Ansari talks in his book about the vast number of dating choices people have today. This led to an idea that's been explored in the social sciences. It's known as the paradox of choice. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANSARI: One of the big changes for people that are, like, dating now is you have more options than any generation of people ever. You know, when we talked to people that were living in retirement homes and stuff, it was really interesting. They talked about how, like - especially with the women it was really interesting. You know, they were saying, like, well, you know, I was 20 years old. I was living with my parents. I didn't have the opportunity to pursue education or my own career. I didn't really get to become an adult until I got married. And there was some guy that lived in the neighborhood. He was pretty nice. And I wanted to get out of the house, and I was like, all right, I'll get married, you know. (LAUGHTER) ANSARI: And they really said that. I was like, are - it sounds like it because they were like - some of the women, they were really happy. They were like, oh, we grew to have this deep bond, but other women were like, no, not as much of a bond, and. . . (LAUGHTER) ANSARI: . . . And getting married was kind of the first step in adulthood for those generations. But for us, this, you know, people now, marriage isn't always a first step. You know, you go to college, you pursue a career, you live in a bunch of different places, and you meet so many people throughout all these different stages of your life. You have this whole stage of life that is referred to as emerging adulthood. And yeah, you meet so many people that way. And then you add in the online dating aspect of things, and you have more options than anyone could have possibly imagined in those generations of retirement homes. VEDANTAM: So I mean, I can see why a dating pool of three people is too small to actually find your life partner, but a dating pool of 30,000 or 300,000 is just unmanageable because what happens is every time you meet someone who's potentially interesting, a little voice in the back of your head says, if you wait for another two days, you could find someone better than this. ANSARI: Well, yeah, you - well, the problem is it's what we refer to or what does this gentleman Barry Schwartz that we interviewed in the book - he does a lot of research on choice, and he wrote this book called the \"Paradox Of Choice,\" and the kind of main thesis of that book is the idea that, like, you know, when you have more options, your instinct is, oh, well, that's better. I have more options, I have more things to choose from. I'll be happier. But in reality, when they do study after study, they find the more options you have, the harder it is to make a decision. And when you do make a decision, you end up being less satisfied because you're thinking about whether you made the wrong decision or whether one of these other things would've been a better match for you. And the really famous study is this study they did in a grocery store where they had two different displays with jams. And one display had, like, you know, five jams, and then the other display had, like, 36 jams. And whenever it was the five jams, people were way more likely to buy the jams. And when they had the 36 jams, they were just overwhelmed, and they didn't know what to do, and they ended up not buying jam sometimes, so. . . (LAUGHTER) ANSARI: And they also said this, which is really interesting. They said, like, oh, people that bought the jams from the 36, like, the bigger display or whatever else - I'm getting these numbers wrong. I'm paraphrasing it, but the core of the thing is right. The one they bought from the one with the bigger display with more options, the people reported being less satisfied with the jam, which I found really hilarious, the idea that someone ate jam and like, this jam's not satisfying. What's wrong with this jam (laughter)? This doesn't taste like strawberries (laughter). But the thing we say in the book is, like, to me, like, that totally applies to modern romance because, I mean, there's just too much goddamn jam out there. Like. . . (LAUGHTER) ANSARI: . . . You know, you go on a date, and you go to the bathroom, like a few pieces of jam have texted you, and you're like, what the [expletive] is this. You go online, there's so much jam out there. There's iPhone apps that literally tell you that there's jam nearby that wants to get eaten at that very moment. I mean. . . (LAUGHTER) ANSARI: . . . What can you do? (APPLAUSE) VEDANTAM: You know, you talk in the book about this guy you interviewed who I think who was on match. com, and you actually got to observe him making choices where he was sort of reviewing pictures of women and then deciding whether he liked them or not. ANSARI: Yes. VEDANTAM: And I don't know if you remember the specific anecdote, but I'm wondering if you can just tell us about it. ANSARI: Yeah, I remember this guy. I - so. . . (LAUGHTER) ANSARI: . . . He just - he didn't seem like - like, he wasn't, like, a hunk or anything. Like, he wasn't a stud. He was just kind of, like - and this is mean, but he was just kind of like a mediocre white guy (laughter). And he logged onto his account, and it said, like, oh - it was a match. com account in this case - and he looks on it, and he was just like - and it said, like, you have these many matches. And I looked at the photo, and I was like, wow, that woman's very attractive. And then he looked at her profile, and he is, like, debating whether he should send her message, and he's like, no, and I was like, what? (LAUGHTER) ANSARI: Why are you not sending her a message? And he's like, she likes the Red Sox. (LAUGHTER) ANSARI: And I was like, what? And then, like, I saw him go to another woman and ignore her. And then he ignored, like, one other woman and then he sent this other woman, like, a quick message. And it blew my mind because if any of those other three women that he, like, put an X on, if they had seen him in a bar, like, you know, 20 years ago and, like, smiled at him, he would have [expletive]. (LAUGHTER) ANSARI: He would have went crazy. He would have been crazy. These were beautiful women. They were very interesting and seem like intelligent, thoughtful people just - and, you know, based on what little I saw from the profile - but they seem like interesting people where it would be a catch for this guy. But now, he was just like, eh, whatever. Like, there's so many people out here - who cares? VEDANTAM: So - But here's the thing that I find really sad about what you're describing, which is that people are looking at these pictures and they're making judgments about this other person based on this very, very small amount of information, and often based on things that they think are important criteria to them. So if you ask people, they will tell you, I want someone who's this tall or this short or this color hair or this body profile and so on. ANSARI: Yeah. VEDANTAM: But if you actually look at the data of who people end up with, people often don't end up with the people that they say they're actually looking for. So if they eliminate people based on the criteria they think they have, they might be  eliminating their soul mates. ANSARI: Exactly, yeah. I mean, yeah - there's plenty of studies that show that we're horrible at knowing what we really like, you know? Whenever they look at these online sites and they see what people say they prefer and what they actually go after, it's always - there's always a big contrast. You're like, what? You said you like this but that's actually who you're interested in. I think that goes back to this idea of, like, you know, all these online dating sites - you have all these filters and all this stuff. But none of it really matters. Like, it's really just about, like, this connection that you have with someone in person and seeing if there's some sort of spark or connection. Like, when you have this connection with someone in real life, you don't stop and go wait, wait, wait - hold on, what are your favorite movies? Like, you're just - you don't give a [expletive]. You're engaged with the person, and you like it, and it's fun. And I think sometimes with these online sites, the people that seem to be a little frustrated were people that were trying to find this perfect person and spending this extended period of time, like, messaging back and forth and trying to find this elusive rapport. And really, you just find that in person. And I think our kind of big take-away from online dating was what this woman Helen Fisher told us is - and she's, like, this amazingly smart social anthropologist and also works with match. com. And she's like, you know, these sites shouldn't be called online dating sites. They should be called online introduction services because you want to meet this person in person. Like - and what I realized is, like, you know, you don't meet the perfect person online. You can meet a person online. But to find out they're perfect, you have to see how you are in a person. VEDANTAM: So in other words, you really - you have to sort of date three before you actually figure out whether this person is for you or not. But if you're in constantly swipe right-swipe left mode, you are not going to get to that point. ANSARI: Or even worse than the swipe right-swipe left mode is this mode of like, oh, let me just keep sending messages and see if this is my dream person. You know, Tinder, I actually I think - and those kind of swipe apps - I totally see why those came about. Like, there's some people that would say, oh, well that seems really shallow, just to see a picture and just, like, swipe and decide if you're going to meet someone. But, I mean, when you go into a bar or a party, you're looking at people and going no, no, yes - you're doing that. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: So I'm trying to internalize your lesson, which is that it's less important to meet new people and more important to spend time with the people you meet to figure out if they're actually right for you. ANSARI: So the thing we mention in the book is what we call the Flo Rida theory of acquired likability through repetition. . . (LAUGHTER) ANSARI: . . . Which basically is saying, like, yes, they're [expletive] people. Yes, of course. But I'd like to think there's a lot of great people out there. And a lot of people that we're quick to dismiss. If you apply this theory - the theory is basically like, we're all like a Flo Rida song, you know? The first time you hear it, you're like, all right, Flo Rida, I've heard this [expletive] before; get it out of here, leave me alone. And then you keep hearing it. And it gets stuck in your head. And you're like, Flo Rida, you've done it again - let's dance. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: I was reading a section of the book this afternoon that brought back some memories from some years ago involving a certain Congressman from New York. . . ANSARI: Sure. VEDANTAM: . . . And some Facebook messages he had exchanged with a woman named Lisa from Las Vegas. I'm wondering if you might be able to read this exchange for us. ANSARI: Sure. VEDANTAM: And I want to ask you whether you think these online sites and this technology has increased the risk of indiscretions and infidelity. ANSARI: Sure. All right. (Reading) I remember reading the Anthony Weiner Facebook messages. Seeing the way he was just messaging random women all over the country and watching the messages quickly escalate from innocuous to very sexual was unbelievable. This is a transcript of a chat session he had with one of these women - a lady named Lisa from Las Vegas. Weiner and Lisa - sorry to bring this back guys - but it is fascinating. Lisa - I'm trying to find the wonderful Anthony Weiner who I fell in love with for yelling at those damn Republicans the other day. And you as were as funny as hell on \"The Daily Show. \" Your friend requests are full. You must friend me. You are awesome. Anthony - thank you, Lisa - glad you have my back. You keeping an eye on that wackadoodle (ph) Sharron Angle for us? Lisa - how insane is she? Who needs Social Security, Medicare or education? If this wacko wins my state, I swear I'll have to move. She may be dumber than plain, and that is tough to find. (LAUGHTER) ANSARI: (Reading) Like this cute new pic of you - when are you coming to Vegas to help me beat up the right-wing crazies? Anthony - This is my pull-my-finger shot - glad you like. I'm ready for a Vegas trip. Truth telling during the day - got a night plan for us? Lisa - Haha (ph) that was a very loaded question. I've got all kinds of night plans for us. When are you coming? Anthony - Don't know - make me an offer I can't refuse. Lisa - To get us in the mood, first we watch back-to-back episodes of \"The Daily Show\" and \"Colbert Report. \" (LAUGHTER) ANSARI: (Reading) Then to really spice things up, we go deface all of my neighbors' Sharron Angle yard signs. Then when we're really hot, we go to the bookstore and cover all the Glenn Beck books with copies of \"The Audacity Of Hope. \" (LAUGHTER) ANSARI: (Reading) I do this about once a week. You can tell I'm a very exciting girl. Or if this is not your thing, we can just get drunk and have mad, passionate sex. For me, the most offensive part was that he used the word wackadoodle. (LAUGHTER) ANSARI: (Reading) Also, did you catch that sly, almost subliminal, blink-and-you-might-miss-it allusion to sex? It was when she said they could have mad, passionate sex. (APPLAUSE) VEDANTAM: So what do you think, Aziz? Have these online technologies made us more prone to indiscretion and infidelity, or is this just a manifestation of how we've always been? ANSARI: I think it definitely - there's definitely - if you're trying to get involved in indiscretions you - if you have these online things and you have your phone - if you have your phone, you have this very private world where you can conduct all sorts of [expletive] that no one knows about. There's a story we tell in the book of this person who says they were - they had, like, a work colleague. And they were friendly with each other. She was married. And she sent, like, a text message about something once. And it was, like, work-related. And he wrote back. And then later he saw something that was kind of funny that reminded him of her and he sent a message. And they started joking back and forth. And this rapport started developing. And they eventually had this, like, very, like, intimate thing going on the phone where they were, like, having long conversations. And it became this very intimate thing. And it eventually led to some infidelity. And it was interesting because the guy was like, you know, if I didn't have text message, I wouldn't have sent that first message that started leading to that rapport, you know, I would never have called her at her home and been like, hey, did you see that thing? Like, you know - but with your phone you can kind of build these kind of things that really escalate very quickly. And also I think, like, you know, in the Anthony Weiner thing it's like, oh, he's able to test the waters with that medium a little bit, where he's like, don't know, make me an offer I can't refuse. She could be like, oh, well, we'll go to Chili's. And he'll be like, oh, that doesn't sound fun. But she immediately, like, got it and started getting sexual. And he knew, like, okay, this is a sexual thing - she's down. And then after that message that I read, like, the floodgates opened and then, you know, there was all the photos and all that stuff. I - you know, I think - I don't think you can kind of accurately say whether it's led to an increase on the amount of infidelity that's going on. I do think there's certain aspects of it that make it a little more - lend itself to it, yeah. VEDANTAM: One of the things you talk about in the book is about how online dating is rapidly becoming the way many people meet. But you also find that this is especially true for same-sex couples - that same-sex couples' online dating has really become the dominant way people meet one another. Why do you think that's going on, and what do you think it means? ANSARI: Well, that is about something - a phenomenon related to what are referred to as thin markets. You know, I spoke with this woman who, like, late in her life - like, she was married to a guy. And then she got divorced and just kind of decided, like, you know what, I'm a lesbian. Like, I've been a lesbian my whole life. And she lives in this small town in Texas. And she started online dating and going out on dates and stuff like that. And I thought about that. I was like, wow, like, if that was her, you know, 20, 30 years ago, that would have been a much different thing. You know, being in a place like Texas, in a small town where maybe people aren't as open to that kind of stuff - it would have been way harder, whereas now she can go online and she's able to meet people and it's really a huge. . . VEDANTAM: And so this in some way is sort of the positive side of technology, isn't it? Because it allows people who have minority interests, if you will, or sort of special interests, not to be lonely forever - to actually find people who match their interests, match their needs. And this is what technology has enabled. ANSARI: Yeah, it's really helped in those kind of thin markets or whatever. And I think that's a - it's a good point that, like, for all these things there - I feel like, you know, kind of one of the big questions the book is asking is, oh, is all this stuff good or bad? And I think for each thing, it's not one answer. It's both. It really just depends on how you use these tools. You know, something like online dating - there's one notion of like, oh, everyone's on their phones, everyone thinks that there's something better out there, and it's just added so much stress to my life, and I hate it. Than you could also look at the other side of, like, well, one out of three people that get married now, they meet their spouse through online dating. And a huge percentage of these people are meeting people that they would not have met had it not been for these sites. So you could look at it like, oh, well, there's an insane amount of new love in the world that's created because of this technology. And there's just this overwhelming amount of love that would not even be there had it not been for these things. And I feel like you can't deny that that's a positive thing.

And on the show today, ideas about Adaptation. And Chris McDougall, who we just heard from, was talking mainly about an adaptation that had to happen for the survival of our species. But for Daniel Kish, the adaptation was about his own survival. Thanks for doing this. DANIEL KISH: Yeah. RAZ: You know, I was saying you should get, like, residual checks from NPR. KISH: Well, we'll have to make such an arrangement. RAZ: OK, so you may have heard Daniel on NPR before. He was on an episode of Invisibilia, but in case you don't know, the story, he's been blind since he was an infant. And yet, somehow by adapting, Daniel figured out a way to see. KISH: Yes, it is a form of seeing, but it's a form of seeing that's really quite native to the human brain. RAZ: Daniel sees with sound. KISH: Do you mind demonstrating what that experience is like? Like, in the room you're in? Well, this is not a room that's very well-suited to this. RAZ: Acoustically it's. . . KISH: It's a padded studio. RAZ: It's a radio studio, yes, sorry about that. KISH: But having said that, let me just grab something that's - happens to be here on the table. RAZ: Great. KISH: It's a clipboard. So I'm just going to make a shh (ph) sound. And I'm going to move this clipboard toward and away from my face, trying not to bang the microphone here - OK. Shh (ph). RAZ: OK, what Daniel is demonstrating here, is the way sound changes depending on what's around you. And certain animals can use those sound changes to get a sense of their surroundings, it's called flash sonar or echolocation. But while bats and dolphins are born with this ability, for Daniel - for any human - it's an adaptation. Wow. KISH: Now, the shushing isn't really conducive because it will tire you out. RAZ: So instead of shushing, Daniel learned. . . KISH: (Tongue-clicking). RAZ: To click his tongue. And he uses these clicks to get all kinds of information. Clicks go out, the sound bounces off, say, a table, it comes back to Daniel's ears, and it helps him figure out how close the table is. KISH: You would know there's something there, OK, don't bump into it. RAZ: But he can also tell whether that object has a hard or soft surface. KISH: And as I'm talking now and moving this thing toward me and away from me, you can kind of hear this - sort of a hard surface, compared to something like. What I have in front of me is absorbent. RAZ: Daniel learned to detect those kind of small differences when he was just over a year old. KISH: In the house, I might've discovered the curtains sounded softer than the wall. The refrigerator, you know, would've sounded different from the oven. So an infant will start to build these things up. KISH: Very, very fast. I mean, an infant's brain is just really, really conducive to that. RAZ: In fact, what's going on in Daniel's brain is similar to what happens in your brain when you see with your eyes. He really does get a kind of mental image of the world around him. KISH: I refer to it as a three-dimensional, fuzzy geometry. See, you get three-dimensional representations of physical surfaces and their arrangements and layouts. RAZ: So it is a form of seeing. And that process for Daniel, it's all about neural real estate. Basically, your brain's capacity to handle different information. And for most people, vision is what takes up a lot of that neural real estate. KISH: Some would say as much as 40 percent of the brain is dedicated to visual processing, so that's a large chunk of brain. The computational power is already there. It's just a matter of kind of changing the input channels. RAZ: And that's exactly what Daniel has done. He's adapted to his blindness by basically repurposing his brain ever since he was a baby, as he described on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KISH: I was born with bilateral retinoblastoma, retinal cancer. My right eye was removed at seven months of age. I was 13 months when they removed my left eye. The first thing I did upon awakening from that last surgery was to climb out of my crib and begin wandering around the intensive care nursery, probably looking for the one who did this to me. RAZ: And that curiosity never really stopped. He just found a new way to keep exploring. And, of course, his parents played a pretty big role. But mostly, they did that by letting Daniel find his own way to adapt. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KISH: They understood that ignorance and fear were but matters of the mind, and the mind is adaptable. They believed that I should grow up to enjoy the same freedoms and responsibilities as everyone else. In their own words, I would move out - which I did when I was 18 - I will pay taxes - thanks - and they knew the difference between love and fear. Fear immobilizes us in the face of challenge. They knew that blindness would pose a significant challenge. I was not raised with fear. They put my freedom first before all else because that is what love does. RAZ: For Daniel, this was the main difference between him and other blind kids. He was given the freedom to figure things out on his own. And in this way, Daniel was both pretty normal and really unusual because he was a blind kid who was raised more or less like a kid who could see. KISH: Sighted infants learn to see from experiencing the world and by systematically withdrawing our support from the infant. We're not holding their hand for support all of this time, and we're not bringing things to them all the time because we expect that by the age of about 12 months that they're going to start taking their first steps, and we're all very happy about that. And if you're lucky, you capture it on film. That is not the way this happens for blind kids. RAZ: Yeah. KISH: But it is the way it happened for me. RAZ: I mean, when you were a child, were you just sort of, like, climbing trees and, like, climbing stuff and trying to, you know, just do the things that any kid does? KISH: (Laughter) Yeah. So I pressed hard to get into things and onto things and up things and over things, so - and, you know, it's kind of funny in a way because with blind kids, we tend to characterize blindness with immobility. RAZ: Yeah. KISH: And we couldn't be further from the truth because for a blind kid to act upon that sense of curiosity that tends to be natural, they have to move. They have to become very physical about their environment. And to restrict that is devastating. RAZ: So today, Daniel spends most of his time trying to undo those restrictions. And he does this by teaching kids who are also blind how to do what he does - how to get around the world more independently. And what he's constantly telling those kids is that their social barriers are much bigger than their physical ones. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KISH: Think for a moment about your own impressions of blindness. Think about your reactions when I first came on to the stage or the prospect of your own blindness. The terror is incomprehensible to most of us because blindness is thought to epitomize ignorance and unawareness - hapless exposure to the ravages of the dark unknown - how poetic. Fortunately for me, my parents were not poetic. They were pragmatic. I was not raised to think of myself as in any way remarkable. I have always regarded myself much like anyone else who navigates the dark unknowns of their own challenges. Is that so remarkable? I do not use my eyes. I use my brain. Now someone, somewhere must think that's remarkable or I wouldn't be up here. (LAUGHTER)KISH: But let's consider this for a moment. Everyone out there who has ever faced a challenge, raise your hands. Woosh. OK. Lots of hands going up - a moment - let me do a headcount. (LAUGHTER)KISH: This'll take a while. Lots of hands in the air. Keep them up. Those of you who use your brains to navigate these challenges put your hands down. OK. Anyone with your hands still up has challenges of your own. (LAUGHTER)KISH: So we all face challenges. And we all face the dark unknown which is endemic to most challenges. Which is what most of us fear. OK. But we all have brains that activate to allow us to navigate the journey through these challenges. RAZ: Do you think that you adapted to your blindness, or did you think that you adapted to a world that is designed for people who can see? KISH: Both. It would be both because you adapt to your conditions. And your conditions include your characteristics as well as the characteristics around you. So a creature like a dolphin who functions mostly in the dark had to develop a way of functioning in the dark (laughter). RAZ: Yeah. KISH: Yeah. So they developed their sonar - same with bats. Bats, very cleverly realized - you know what? - most creatures in the world see, and don't really travel very much in the dark. So why not travel in the dark? So I guess as a - as a human who was blind I adapted to my blindness by finding a different way to see in a world that isn't really conducive to not seeing. RAZ: I mean, it seems like you, you know, you did what humans are just kind of naturally meant to do. Right? Like, we're wired to do this - that our bodies, our minds we - we adapt to the circumstances and the challenges around us. KISH: That's just it. One of the first critical functions of our brain is to adapt. To adapt to conditions. To understand its conditions. So if you try to contrive around that you're seriously second-guessing what the brain is capable of. So I would say that that's true. I would say that the brain is naturally inclined to adapt. And really what my - what my own circumstances did when I was younger was to - to let that play out. RAZ: Daniel Kish. He founded World Access for the Blind. You can see his entire talk at Ted. com GUY RAZ, HOST:   It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR, I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about Adaptation.

RAZ: He is out to convince you. . . MCDOUGALL: I'm Chris McDougall. I'm the author of \"Born To Run. \"RAZ: . . . That millions of years ago, evolution turned us into runners. And Chris says running, to be precise, long-distance running, is basically all we got. MCDOUGALL: I mean, think about this right now.

But we also know that humans only started to kill their prey with rocks and spears about 200,000 years ago, so a big anthropological mystery, which Chris laid out on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MCDOUGALL: So somehow for nearly two million years, we are killing animals without any weapons. Now we're not using our strength because we are the biggest sissies in the jungle, OK. Every other animal is stronger than we are. They have fangs. They have claws. They have nimbleness. They have speed. You know, we think Usain Bolt is fast. Usain Bolt would get his [expletive] kicked by a squirrel. OK, we're not fast. (LAUGHTER)MCDOUGALL: That would be an Olympic event. Turn a squirrel loose. Whoever catches the squirrel, you get a gold medal. (LAUGHTER)MCDOUGALL: So no weapons, no speed, no strength, no fangs, no claws, how are we killing these animals? Perhaps it's because humans, as much as we like to think of ourselves as masters of the universe, actually evolved as nothing more than a pack of hunting dogs. Maybe we evolved as a hunting-pack animal because the one advantage we have in the wilderness is sweat. Better than any other mammal on earth, we can sweat really well. But the advantage of that is the fact that when it comes to running under hot heat for long distances, we're superb. We're the best on the planet. You take a horse on a hot day, and after about five or six miles, that horse has a choice. It's either going to breathe, or it's going to cool off, but it ain't doing both. We can. So what if we evolved as hunting-pack animals? What if the only natural advantage we had in the world was the fact that we could get together as a group, go out there on an African savanna, pick out an antelope, and go out as a pack and run that thing to death? RAZ: I mean, we essentially evolve to endure. MCDOUGALL: That's exactly it. That is our one superpower on earth. RAZ: Yeah. MCDOUGALL: And I love it, too, because it's not the superpower you would choose for yourself. You know, if you were given all of the powers in the animal kingdom at your disposal, you think, I want to soar like a hawk. I want to swim like a dolphin. But actually, it was that ability to sweat which made every other great human achievement possible because the fact that we could sweat allowed us to run super long distances on hot days. RAZ: Yeah. MCDOUGALL: So rather than overpowering animals, rather than out-sprinting them, we can endure. We can go and go and go and go until they would just collapse and fall over. RAZ: This is how we became who we are by adapting. And though we think of adaptation as something intrinsic like evolution, it can also be a choice, a decision you make to change, and a power we all have. So on the show today, we're going to explore ideas about adaptation, whether it's adapting to our biological circumstances or our physical limitations or the changing world around us. For Chris McDougall, the idea that humans adapted to run long distances means that somewhere deep inside of us, we're built for it. So the obvious question Chris asked is, if we're intrinsically meant to do this, how come most of us don't? (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MCDOUGALL: And the answer to what I think can be found down in the Copper Canyons of Mexico where there's a tribe, a reclusive tribe called the Tarahumara Indians, they have been living essentially unchanged for the past 400 years. When the conquistadors arrived in North America, you had two choices. You could either fight back and engage, or you could take off. The Mayans and the Aztecs engaged, which is why there are very few Mayans and Aztecs. The Tarahumara had a different strategy. They took off and hid in this labyrinthine networking kind of spider webbing system of canyons called the Copper Canyons. And there they've remained since the 1600s, essentially the same way they've always been. Deep in the old age, 70 and 80 years old, these guys aren't running marathons. They're running mega-marathons. They're not doing 26 miles. They're doing 100, 150 miles at a time and apparently without injury, without problems. RAZ: Wow, I mean, how did this happen? I mean, what's the story? MCDOUGALL: So here's the thing. When I first went down to the Copper Canyons to look for the Tarahumara, I thought that what I was going to be finding was like, you know, Professor X's X-Men Academy. I thought. . . RAZ: Yeah. MCDOUGALL: . . . I was going to find this, like, culture of, like, mutants. RAZ: Right. MCDOUGALL: What I discovered instead was this is normal humanity. I was looking into our own past. I was actually looking at what humans really are. We're the ones that have adapted to an artificial culture. The Tarahumara are kind of like living Smithsonian exhibits. They are preserving the same natural abilities that humans relied on millions of years ago. RAZ: And today, Chris believes most of us have actually over-adapted. We've lost something primal about how we run. And the story of how that may have happened starts with a guy named Bill Bowerman. MCDOUGALL: And he was a coach at the University of Oregon. RAZ: Bowerman coached track and field there. And in the mid-1970s, he heard about a group of people in New Zealand who would run through the hills near their town. MCDOUGALL: Former cardiac patients, people who had had heart attacks, and Bowerman thought, well, this is crazy. You know, this idea of, like, jogging through the mountains is insane. These people are going to die. But what he realized is these people were actually prospering. Instead of their hearts giving out, their hearts were getting stronger. RAZ: OK, so long story short, running was not exactly the thing it is today back in the 1970s. So Bowerman brings the phenomenon of jogging to the U. S. , and he starts by inviting students to come jog with him on the weekend. And one of those students was a guy on Bill Bowerman's track team. His name was Phil Knight. And he had an idea. MCDOUGALL: Phil said, hey, you know, as long as people are interested in this new hobby of jogging, there's not much we can do to capitalize on except for one thing. The only thing you can use is a pair of shoes. So, Phil Knight started the company of Blue Ribbon Sports, which became Nike, and he started to innovate and mess around with shoes. Now the early Nike running shoes were like same kind of things that Jesse Owens and Roger Bannister wore. RAZ: Yeah, so, like, what was Jesse Owens running in? MCDOUGALL: A pair of slippers, everybody's in - and essentially, it's actually not very different than what elite runners would wear today. . . RAZ: Yeah. MCDOUGALL: . . . Which is the thinnest sliver of protection underneath their soles, nothing else. But what really made Nike's fortune is bigger is better. The bigger you can make it, the more cushiony, the more soft, the more people are going to be attracted to it. So it was really Nike that came up with this idea of the cushioned running shoe. RAZ: Yeah, I remember when I was a kid, the first time I saw Nike Airs, you know, use of the little window in the shoe. . . MCDOUGALL: Right. RAZ: . . . And the sole, and you thought, oh, how cool. You're walking on air. MCDOUGALL: And that's a thing about it, too. The real big breakthrough that Nike came up with is this idea that if you don't buy the right shoe, you're going to get injured. And that's where all this cushioning and motion control and all this foot correction stuff began. RAZ: As for exactly what this all has to do with those tribes in Mexico and how Chris made that connection, well, he's a runner. MCDOUGALL: I would say just about every day, yeah. RAZ: And he started a couple years after college to lose weight. MCDOUGALL: But I kept getting hurt. I kept getting injured, and I would see doctors, and they would say, well, you know, dude, you're built like Shrek. Of course you're getting injured. So I had given up running for years. It was only after I went down to the Copper Canyons and I watched these, like, 80-year-old Tarahumara runners doing 30 miles through the mountains that I thought, there probably isn't a right way to run. RAZ: It took a few years of studying the Tarahumara Indians for Chris McDougall to figure out the secret. What he still believes is the right way to run. And when he did figure it out, it wasn't just a turning point in his own life. It was a moment that would reshape the entire multibillion-dollar running shoe industry. MCDOUGALL: So here's the big lightbulb moment for me. In 1994, someone got the idea of entering a group of Tarahumara runners in this legendary race called the Leadville Trail 100. It's a 100-mile race through the Rocky Mountains. They entered the face, and they just obliterated the field. RAZ: Wow. MCDOUGALL: And not only did they win, they had been given new running shoes to wear. They didn't like them, so they went to the town dump and carved out sandals from discarded tires, strapped them on, and ran 100 miles in them. So essentially, what they did was they preserved the adaptations which allowed humans to survive in hostile environments for most of our existence. RAZ: And once Chris wrote about this, you can imagine what happened next. It inspired the entire barefoot running movement. Chris is the reason you see people wearing those five-fingered toe shoes at the gym, the reason running shoes seem to get lighter and lighter every time you go out looking for a new pair. And when Chris gave this TED Talk back in 2010, that movement was just taking off. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MCDOUGALL: So what I've been seeing today is there is kind of a growing subculture of barefoot runners, people who have gotten rid of their shoes. And what they have found uniformly is you get rid of the shoes, you get rid of the stress, you get rid of the injuries and the ailments, and what you find is something the Tarahumara have known for a very long time, that this can be a whole lot of fun. I've experienced it personally myself. I was injured all my life, and then in my early 40s, I got rid of my shoes, and my running. . . RAZ: OK, we should point out that there's been a lot of public debate about the health benefits of running barefoot. In fact, more than a few people have been injured trying to run barefoot. But, Chris McDougall's theory on our over-adaptation does make you wonder whether we've lost something primal about how our bodies work. MCDOUGALL: If you look at the foot, the foot is this amazing piece of architecture. It has an arch with absorbed shock. It has these five toes which spread out and balance. It has these 20, 60 intricately connected bones and ligaments and tendons and censures (ph). It is an unbelievable miracle of creation, and yet somehow, some guy in Oregon in a lab thinks he can sketch something which is better than that. RAZ: I mean, it makes sense at a certain time in our history that we had to adapt to chase gazelles, so we needed to be barefoot. But now we have to adapt to walk the long aisles of Costco to load our cars. MCDOUGALL: (Laughter). RAZ: So is there a possibility that, you know, another two, 300 hundred years of cushioned running, we'll just, you know, sort of change our physiology, and we'll be fine? MCDOUGALL: I hope not. It's so unnecessary. Like, why would you bother? Why would you bother to try and adapt yourself? It would be like we could adapt to hitting ourselves in the face with a hammer if we kept at it long enough. But you know what, maybe just put the hammer down. Don't do it anymore. RAZ: I'm actually really glad that we don't have to chase gazelles anymore. MCDOUGALL: You know, yes and no, obviously, I haven't moved to the Copper Canyons and live in a cave, you know. On the other hand, if you're a running culture, like, you can't be materialistic, so, you know, you're not hoarding a bunch of crap and working 9 to 5 and, like, attacking your neighbors. You're just, like, chilling and running. RAZ: Chris McDougall, he wrote \"Born To Run. \" You can check out his entire talk at ted. com. Our show today, ideas about adaptation, I'm Guy Raz, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. GUY RAZ, HOST:   It's the TED RADIO HOUR from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. So you might be a really terrible runner. Maybe it's just not your thing. But this guy. . . CHRIS MCDOUGALL: Yup, I'm right here. RAZ: Great. Oh, perfect. MCDOUGALL: Sure. RAZ: He is out to convince you. . . MCDOUGALL: I'm Chris McDougall. I'm the author of \"Born To Run. \" RAZ: . . . That millions of years ago, evolution turned us into runners. And Chris says running, to be precise, long-distance running, is basically all we got. MCDOUGALL: I mean, think about this right now. If you stripped me naked and you chucked me out in the woods, I have no natural weaponry at all. I mean, humans as animals, we're not very strong. RAZ: You - yeah, right. MCDOUGALL: We can't climb very well. We don't swim very well. We can't fly. We have no fangs. We got nothing. I probably would not walk back out of those woods. RAZ: There's a theory about human evolution, and it argues that the human brain basically just exploded in size about 2 million years ago. And a lot of that growth came from food, which included eating animals. But we also know that humans only started to kill their prey with rocks and spears about 200,000 years ago, so a big anthropological mystery, which Chris laid out on the TED stage.

A trip planned for eighth graders was called off last week. There were mixed feelings. STACY ZDANIS: As a parent, you should never have to worry about sending your child somewhere in this country for fears that they might not come back. MARTIN: That's Stacy Zdanis (ph). Her son was supposed to take that field trip. Atif Kareshi (ph) worries about the message being sent to the kids. ATIF KARESHI: Some of us have to make the difficult choices, where we may be scared internally for our kids, but we have to let them live a life where they're not afraid to do those things. MARTIN: You can hear the ambivalence. They want life to go on as normal. But they also want to keep their kids safe. We asked NPR's social science correspondent, Shankar Vedantam, to help us figure out why we react so strongly to threats that are statistically very unlikely. He joins me now in the studio. Hey, Shankar, thanks for coming in. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Happy to be here, Rachel. MARTIN: When we see events like the attacks in Paris and, more recently, the attack in Mali, a lot of us feel fear acutely, even though it might not make sense because these attacks are happening so far away, geographically speaking. But case in point, soon after the Paris attacks, I was in a crowded movie theater, watching a movie like a lot of people. And there was a sound effect that happened in the film. VEDANTAM: Yeah. MARTIN: And for a split second, I got a pit in my stomach. VEDANTAM: Yeah. MARTIN: And I started looking around for the exits. And I was imagining worst-case scenarios. VEDANTAM: Yeah. MARTIN: And I'm someone who lives in the news. I live in this story. And I know the odds of something happening in that moment are so small. VEDANTAM: Yeah. MARTIN: But something like an immediate attack refocuses the mind. Why is that? VEDANTAM: It does. And the interesting thing, Rachel, as you point out, is that these are events that are happening hundreds or thousands of miles away. You know, after the 9/11 attacks, researchers observed that there were people who were sitting on the West Coast who were as traumatized watching the 9/11 attacks unfold on television as people who were physically in New York and Washington. And one of the things they've picked up on is that mass media, and television in particular, have allowed events that are very far away to come into our homes in this extremely visceral fashion so that even though you might consciously know this event is happening hundreds or thousands of miles away, there's a part of your brain that actually feels, I'm on high alert. I might be in danger. MARTIN: It's not just terrorism, though, right? We saw this kind of emotional reaction after the Ebola crisis, with the fear of some kind of health threat. VEDANTAM: That's right. I think one of the other things that's really interesting here, Rachel, is that our fears are not always connected to what's most dangerous. So when you think about terrorism, for example, terrorism is extremely scary. But on the 10 leading causes of death that the CDC tracks every year, terrorism is not even on the list. You know, heart disease and diabetes and suicide are on the list. Terrorism is not - the same with health conditions. The flu kills 30,000 people every year in the United States. Ebola might have affected a couple of people. And yet, our fears connected to these new and unusual threats are often disproportionate to the actual risk that they possess. MARTIN: Are there any studies out there that show what the effect might be when we react out of fear that might be disproportionate to the threat? VEDANTAM: Yeah, I think there's been quite a lot of work that's looked at this. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, for example, people looked at the fact that many Americans were fearful about air travel. And as a result, many Americans chose to drive to wherever they were trying to go instead of fly to wherever they needed to go. And you know where this is going because driving turns out to actually be significantly riskier than flying. And there's been some studies that show that as a result of the increased driving, hundreds of Americans might have died in traffic crashes as they were trying to keep themselves from being on a hijacked plane. MARTIN: NPR's Shankar Vedantam, he covers social science research. He's also the host of the new podcast, Hidden Brain. Shankar, thank you so much. VEDANTAM: Thanks so much, Rachel. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  The terrorist attacks in Paris have had people in this country feeling on edge. Some school districts even canceled field trips to Washington, D.

Hey, Shankar, thanks for coming in. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Happy to be here, Rachel. MARTIN: When we see events like the attacks in Paris and, more recently, the attack in Mali, a lot of us feel fear acutely, even though it might not make sense because these attacks are happening so far away, geographically speaking. But case in point, soon after the Paris attacks, I was in a crowded movie theater, watching a movie like a lot of people. And there was a sound effect that happened in the film. VEDANTAM: Yeah. MARTIN: And for a split second, I got a pit in my stomach. VEDANTAM: Yeah. MARTIN: And I started looking around for the exits. And I was imagining worst-case scenarios. VEDANTAM: Yeah. MARTIN: And I'm someone who lives in the news. I live in this story. And I know the odds of something happening in that moment are so small. VEDANTAM: Yeah. MARTIN: But something like an immediate attack refocuses the mind. Why is that? VEDANTAM: It does. And the interesting thing, Rachel, as you point out, is that these are events that are happening hundreds or thousands of miles away. You know, after the 9/11 attacks, researchers observed that there were people who were sitting on the West Coast who were as traumatized watching the 9/11 attacks unfold on television as people who were physically in New York and Washington. And one of the things they've picked up on is that mass media, and television in particular, have allowed events that are very far away to come into our homes in this extremely visceral fashion so that even though you might consciously know this event is happening hundreds or thousands of miles away, there's a part of your brain that actually feels, I'm on high alert. I might be in danger. MARTIN: It's not just terrorism, though, right? We saw this kind of emotional reaction after the Ebola crisis, with the fear of some kind of health threat. VEDANTAM: That's right. I think one of the other things that's really interesting here, Rachel, is that our fears are not always connected to what's most dangerous. So when you think about terrorism, for example, terrorism is extremely scary. But on the 10 leading causes of death that the CDC tracks every year, terrorism is not even on the list. You know, heart disease and diabetes and suicide are on the list. Terrorism is not - the same with health conditions. The flu kills 30,000 people every year in the United States. Ebola might have affected a couple of people. And yet, our fears connected to these new and unusual threats are often disproportionate to the actual risk that they possess. MARTIN: Are there any studies out there that show what the effect might be when we react out of fear that might be disproportionate to the threat? VEDANTAM: Yeah, I think there's been quite a lot of work that's looked at this. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, for example, people looked at the fact that many Americans were fearful about air travel. And as a result, many Americans chose to drive to wherever they were trying to go instead of fly to wherever they needed to go. And you know where this is going because driving turns out to actually be significantly riskier than flying. And there's been some studies that show that as a result of the increased driving, hundreds of Americans might have died in traffic crashes as they were trying to keep themselves from being on a hijacked plane. MARTIN: NPR's Shankar Vedantam, he covers social science research. He's also the host of the new podcast, Hidden Brain. Shankar, thank you so much.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. Though the cups at Starbucks have been red since the day after Halloween, Thanksgiving marks the start of the holiday season for most people. That means taking the time to reflect on everything we are grateful for, being generous, spending time with the people we love. DANIEL PINK, BYLINE: So you can say to yourself, ah, I can't get into an argument with uncle Joe, but that might not work nearly as well as saying, you know, I don't get into stupid political fights with people who don't know what they're talking about. VEDANTAM: We all know that the whole spending-time-with-the-people-we-love part can be a little challenging. TYLER OKIMOTO: When you refuse to apologize, it actually makes you feel more empowered. VEDANTAM: On this week's episode, we'll talk about some themes that often come up in disagreements around the dinner table, and we'll give you some strategies to help keep the peace. STEVE INSKEEP, BYLINE: (Laughter) Just pay them. VEDANTAM: This holiday week, we're going to bring you two short conversations I had with Steve Inskeep. He's a host of NPR's Morning Edition. If you haven't heard me on the air, I often talk with Steve about new social science research on the radio. After that, we're going to have a brand-new edition of Stopwatch Science with Daniel Pink. Our theme throughout this episode is how social science can help you have a happy Thanksgiving. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE ICE STORM\")KEVIN KLINE: (As Ben Hood) So let's do it right, and Wendy, why don't you say grace? You used to love to say grace, remember? CHRISTINA RICCI: (As Wendy Hood) Dear Lord, thank you for this Thanksgiving holiday and for all the material possessions that we have and enjoy and for letting us white people kill all the Indians and steal their tribal lands and stuff ourselves like pigs even though children in Asia are being napalmed. KLINE: (As Ben Hood) Jesus, enough, all right. VEDANTAM: The Thanksgiving dinner table can be a place where tensions arise, as in that clip from the 1997 movie \"The Ice Storm. \" And very often, those fights tend to be about politics. Steve Inskeep asked me why it's so difficult to find common ground in these conversations. INSKEEP: Okay, so what's the new research? VEDANTAM: The research looks at seemingly intractable conflicts, such as the conflicts between Democrats and Republicans. And it shows that besides disagreements about the issues, there's an underlying psychological process that makes the search for common ground really difficult. The research comes from Liane Young at Boston College, and along with Adam Waits and Jeremy Gingers, she asked Democrats and Republicans about the emotions that motivate them and the emotions that motivate their opponents. Both sides said that they were motivated by positive emotions such as love or loyalty to their fellow Republicans or their fellow Democrats, but that their opponents were motivated primarily by hate and animosity. Now, this was true of both Republicans and Democrats. Here's Young talking about the Democratic volunteers. LIANE YOUNG: Democrats were much more likely to say that they're motivated by love compared to hate. We then went and asked them, how much is the Republican Party motivated by love and hate? And there we found that Democrats were likely to say that Republicans were motivated by their hate of Democrats rather than their love of Republicans. INSKEEP: OK, so the research says that I'm thinking the worst of the other guy, or more properly, I think that you're thinking the worst of me. I think you hate me, and that colors my perceptions of you. VEDANTAM: That's precisely right, Steve. The point that Young and her colleagues are making is that if we believe that our opponents hate us, it's really hard to imagine common ground. So this might be one reason conflicts end up being intractable not just in politics, but in arguments over the Thanksgiving table. When we feel an aunt or an uncle or a grandparent is out to get us, we do everything we can to defend ourselves against this hate that's coming across the table. What we don't often realize is the person sitting across the table is trying to defend themselves from what they think is our hate for them. So Young and her colleagues think that if we try to see the other side as also being driven by positive emotions such as loyalty or love, rather than animosity, the arguments don't disappear, but it takes the sting out of the arguments. INSKEEP: You know, we have a colleague here at work who talks about assuming the best intentions of the other person. I suppose that's the insight here is to assume the best of intentions of the partisan jerk across the table from me. VEDANTAM: That's exactly right, Steve. People live very different lives and they're coming together for a Thanksgiving meal, so it's not surprising they're going to bring their loyalties to their own groups to the shared dinner. Young told me she hopes to apply the lesson of her study to her own Thanksgiving if an argument happens to break out. Here she is. YOUNG: In the case of a fiery Thanksgiving debate, it's good to give the benefit of the doubt that this person isn't arguing with me because they hate me. But I would tell myself hey, you know, they want me to understand their point of view because they think it's right, and this grandparent is motivated by their love of me. INSKEEP: But wait a minute here, suppose I try so hard to be big about this and to be open-minded and the other person is just a jerk, or I'm afraid the other person is going to be a jerk. What would it take to get the other person to open their minds? VEDANTAM: Well, that's a good question, Steve. Young's study actually might point to the solution because she and her colleagues wanted to see if they could do anything to get people to accurately perceive their opponent's point of view. Now, since this is America, they decided to try the old-fashioned approach. They promised volunteers a financial incentive. INSKEEP: (Laughter) Just pay them, pay them. VEDANTAM: They found that when you tell Democrats and Republicans that they stand to earn about $10 if they can accurately describe what's happening in their political opponents' minds, both sides now say the views of their opponents are probably shaped by positive emotions, such as loyalty and love, rather than hate. I asked Young whether the same technique might work at Thanksgiving dinner tables. Now I have to say she was very skeptical that this could work, but I say that we should run an experiment, slip a $10 bill under people's plates, and as they sit down see if that gives us a happy Thanksgiving. INSKEEP: Shankar, there's a little something for you underneath your paper there. VEDANTAM: You know, Steve, I always thought so highly of you. So hopefully, your Thanksgiving dinner will be argument-free. But just in case it's not, our next story is about apologizing. In the 1973 movie \"A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving,\" Peppermint Patty picks a fight at the dinner table. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"A CHARLIE BROWN THANKSGIVING\")CHRISTOPHER DEFARIA: (As Peppermint Patty) What kind of a Thanksgiving dinner is this? Where's the turkey, Chuck? Don't you know anything about Thanksgiving dinners? Where's the mashed potatoes? Where's the cranberry sauce? Where's the pumpkin pie? VEDANTAM: Sometimes we know we've done something wrong, but it's still really hard to say we are sorry. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"A CHARLIE BROWN THANKSGIVING\")DEFARIA: (As Peppermint Patty) Do you think I hurt old Chuck's feelings? I bet I hurt his feelings. Golly, why can't I act right outside of a baseball game? Marcie, maybe you can go to old Chuck and patch things up for me. Maybe you can tell him how I really feel. Tell him that I didn't mean it the way it sounded. Marcie, you can do it. You go see him, and tell him that I really like him and that the dinner is OK with me. JIMMY AHRENS: (As Marcie) Well, I don't know. I think maybe you should go to Chuck and tell him yourself. VEDANTAM: I talked to Steve about why I love you really can mean never having to say you're sorry or at least never wanting to. INSKEEP: OK, if you've ever looked after a group of children, chances are you have tried to break up a squabble using the following words. Come on now. Just say you're sorry. If your advice was met with stony-faced resistance, you will want to listen to this. Shankar, not sorry to have you here. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). INSKEEP: So what do you mean, not apologizing? What is this about? VEDANTAM: Apologies present us with a puzzle, and the puzzle is kids find it hard to do. Adults find it hard to do. It's even hard when it's completely rational. So in the criminal justice system, for example, you have situations where someone has been found guilty, and they're awaiting sentencing. And the only thing that could reduce the severity of their sentence is if they say, I'm sorry. And time and time again, people refuse to apologize. So, Tyler Okimoto, who is a researcher at University of Queensland in Australia, along with his colleagues Michael Wenzel and Kyli Hedrick, they decided to conduct some psychological experiments to understand why people refuse to apologize. Now parents have been telling their kids for years, look, just say you're sorry. You're going to feel better about yourself. Okimoto finds that parents have been telling their kids the truth, but they haven't been telling their kids the whole truth. Here he is. OKIMOTO: We do find that apologies do make apologizers feel better, but the interesting thing is is that refusals to apologize also makes people feel better. And in fact, in some cases, it makes them feel even better than an apology would have. VEDANTAM: So what he does is he asks a number of people to remember times when they've harmed someone, and most people, of course, remember trivial things, domestic quarrels and stuff like that. But some people also remember serious harms they've done. They remember crimes, such as theft. And Okimoto does two things. He asked them, did you actually apologize in real life? And then second, he conducts a laboratory experiment, where he asks them to compose an email where they either apologize or they refuse to apologize. And what he finds is that both in real life, as well as in the laboratory, refusing to apologize increases your feelings of status and increases your feelings of integrity. INSKEEP: You feel like you have more integrity because you refused to apologize for something that you know you should apologize for. VEDANTAM: That exactly right. The human mind is a wonderful thing, Steve. INSKEEP: OK, so what is the conclusion here? We should never apologize for anything. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) Well, actually, there are huge interpersonal costs to not apologizing and not just between individuals, between groups. I mean, think about conflicts that have been stuck for decades because one side can't tell another side, look, we're really sorry about what we did. The value of Okimoto's research is it starts to get a handle on why people find it so hard to apologize. Here he is again. OKIMOTO: When you refuse to apologize, it actually makes you feel more empowered. That power and control seems to translate into greater feelings of self-worth. INSKEEP: I think I'm getting this because when you apologize, you are putting your fate in someone else's hands. They will accept the apology or not or respond however they do. When you say, I will not apologize, you are still in control. VEDANTAM: Yeah, and I think this research actually reminds me of the value of something that philosophers have been saying for a very long time, which is being able to apologize is not a sign of weakness. It's actually a sign of strength because if you look at the people who find it difficult to apologize, it's people who feel threatened, people who feel an apology would somehow make them extremely vulnerable. INSKEEP: And of course, if you're a little kid being asked to apologize, you feel vulnerable. You're little to begin with, and that almost suggests that maybe a parent would want to approach that situation a different way. VEDANTAM: If you're actually trying to change people's behavior, love and support might be more effective. INSKEEP: Because if not, people end up giving that apology that they don't really mean. VEDANTAM: They're completely insincere. INSKEEP: Sorry. VEDANTAM: That was Morning Edition's Steve Inskeep with a rendition of a totally sincere apology. Coming up, Stopwatch Science with Daniel Pink. We'll tell you how to keep from overeating, overshopping, and fighting with your relatives this holiday. Back in a moment.

We're going to stick with our war and peace and Thanksgiving theme in our next segment, which is Stopwatch Science. I'm joined, as always, by Daniel Pink. Hi, Dan. PINK: Hey, Shankar. VEDANTAM: Dan and I are going to give one another 60 seconds to describe ideas from social science research. We're going to do things a little differently this time based on some of your feedback. As we approach the 60-second mark, our producers, Kara and Maggie, will gently bring up the music, just like they do at the Oscars. So Dan, what do you think? This is a kinder, gentler version of Stopwatch Science. PINK: Kinder, gentler, Clooney-esque (ph) - those are three adjectives that describe me very well. VEDANTAM: They do indeed, Dan. Alright, so Thanksgiving can be a wonderful time of peace and harmony. In other words, they speak to all of Dan Pink's finest qualities. But sometimes things can go off the rails. Maybe that's because a fight breaks out at the table. Maybe it's simply because you eat too much. On this edition of Stopwatch Science, Dan and I are going to give you tips on how to have a better Thanksgiving. Dan, if you are ready, your first 60 seconds starts now. PINK: Well, Shankar, as you say, Thanksgiving, for many of us, is about resisting temptation. So how can we do it better? Well, a paper published in the Journal of Consumer Research suggests one secret might be a simple language trick. We should shift from saying I can't to saying I don't. Now, in one of the experiments, undergraduates were trained to resist unhealthy foods by saying to themselves either, I can't eat X, or I don't eat X. Later, they were offered a choice between chocolate and a healthy granola bar. Of those using the I-can't self talk, fewer than 40 percent picked the healthy snack. But in the I-don't group, nearly two thirds chose the healthier option. VEDANTAM: Wow. PINK: What's going on is what linguists call semantic framing. Semantic framing - different words give us different views of reality. Can't is disempowering. It implies someone or something else is in control. Don't is empowering. Implies that I'm in charge of what I do and, ultimately, who I am. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: That's fascinating, Dan. And you were also empowered by the fact that you finished well under 60 seconds. PINK: I feel like riding a horse across an open plain right now. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) I think you forgot to thank your family and your friends for this wonderful movie that's just been made. But I have a question for you, Dan. So I can understand how you can apply this semantic framing when it comes to overeating at Thanksgiving. Can you also apply it, do you think, to limiting the kind of fights that sometimes break out? PINK: Absolutely. Absolutely. I'm thinking in some cases, depending on your family, this might be more useful in that regard. So you can say to yourself, oh, I can't get into an argument with Uncle Joe. But that might not work nearly as well as saying, you know, I don't get into stupid political fights with people who don't know what they're talking about. VEDANTAM: I'm going to remember that when I speak with Uncle Joe on Thursday. PINK: (Laughter) Alright, so now on to you, Shankar. Your 60 seconds starts right now. Leaf Van Boven at the University of Colorado, George Loewenstein at Carnegie Mellon and other colleagues recently analyzed a factors that I think plays a role in Thanksgiving table social breakdowns, Dan. It has to do with the concept of hot and cold emotions. So when I'm not very hungry, for example, I know that I should eat healthy. But when I am hungry, and I'm in the group of hunger, I forget my resolution. George Loewenstein once told me that the key idea here is not that we have these hot and cold states, but that when we are in a cold state, we are terrible at forecasting how we will behave when we're in the grip of emotions, when we're in the hot state. The researchers recently applied this idea to embarrassing situations. Many of us think we can handle embarrassing situations, but when we're actually confronted by an embarrassing situation, we fail to act with courage and confidence. I think this plays a role in Thanksgiving table meltdowns. We think we will rise to the occasion to confront that proverbial drunk Uncle Joe, but we fail to predict that when he actually starts acting up, we will lapse into silence. PINK: Yeah, sad but true - but what were the actual experiments that they did to demonstrate this? VEDANTAM: Well, they did a bunch of things. One of the things they did that I thought was very interesting is they asked volunteers to predict whether they would be willing to dance to the 1970 James Brown song \"Sex Machine. \" If they agreed to dance in front of others for three full minutes, they were to be given two dollars. Now, compared to the number of volunteers who predicted that they would be willing to dance, about 1 in 10 were actually willing to dance. So in fact, Dan, when I heard about the study I told myself, Dan and I should actually run this experiment during Stopwatch Science. Would you be willing to dance to \"Sex Machine\" at the end of the segment today? PINK: Do I get two bucks? No, I can't do that. VEDANTAM: Are you sure? PINK: Well, actually I should say I don't do something like that. Sorry. VEDANTAM: Well played, Dan, well played. All right, your next 60 seconds starts right now. PINK: All right, here's some good news. Stuffing your face with turkey, gravy and candied yams might have an upside. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: Arul and Himanshu Mishra - they're a husband and wife team at the University of Utah - have found that on Thanksgiving, what's bad for your waistline might actually be good for your wallet. A few years ago, they interrupted 170 people on Thanksgiving evening, and they asked those people how willing they'd be to buy deeply discounted items. The researchers found that those who'd eaten a traditional holiday meal were significantly less likely to be seduced by the bargains. What's going on here? In a word, serotonin. That's a brain chemical that regulates mood. When serotonin goes up - which it does when we eat tryptophan-heavy foods like turkey and rich carbohydrates like mashed potatoes - our impulsiveness goes down. PINK: In other words, if you want to save money on Black Friday, pig out on Thanksgiving Thursday. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) I love it, Dan. I have to say that I have an alternate theory though, which is that the people who have eaten so much at Thanksgiving, they might just be in a food coma. They're just physically not able to get to the telephone to speak to telemarketers. PINK: It's an interesting theory. It's a testable theory. My hunch is that the research would validate that being in a food coma reduces your impulsivity. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: All right, so on that, let's go to your second and final study, Shankar. Your 60 seconds starts right now. VEDANTAM: All right, we've known for a very long time that children are easily distracted by bright and shiny objects. Turns out, adults are too, and this can be a very useful idea to apply at Thanksgiving. Martin Reimann at the University of Arizona and Antoine Bechara and Deborah MacInnis at the University of Southern California, they ran an experiment. They set up a food stand and offered people chicken nuggets, beef tacos and bacon-avocado sandwiches. They told the volunteers that if they chose a half serving instead of a full serving, they would get a lottery ticket - a chance to win either a $100 Amazon gift card or 10,000 frequent flyer miles. And they measured how likely people were to choose the full serving versus the half serving. They found that about two-thirds of the volunteers chose the full serving without the lottery incentive, but with the lottery tickets, that number dropped by more than half. If people thought they could win a prize, they ate less. In other words, if you want to incentivize people to eat in moderation or behave nicely at Thanksgiving, the answer is simple - hand out lottery tickets. PINK: (Laughter) Well, that's great. You know, I really think you've uncovered the true meaning of Thanksgiving, which is handing out cash prizes for dumb luck. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: You know, that's what this country is all about. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) That's exactly right. PINK: It puts me in the holiday spirit. VEDANTAM: Well, there you go.

SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST:  This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. Though the cups at Starbucks have been red since the day after Halloween, Thanksgiving marks the start of the holiday season for most people. That means taking the time to reflect on everything we are grateful for, being generous, spending time with the people we love. DANIEL PINK, BYLINE: So you can say to yourself, ah, I can't get into an argument with uncle Joe, but that might not work nearly as well as saying, you know, I don't get into stupid political fights with people who don't know what they're talking about. VEDANTAM: We all know that the whole spending-time-with-the-people-we-love part can be a little challenging. TYLER OKIMOTO: When you refuse to apologize, it actually makes you feel more empowered. VEDANTAM: On this week's episode, we'll talk about some themes that often come up in disagreements around the dinner table, and we'll give you some strategies to help keep the peace. STEVE INSKEEP, BYLINE: (Laughter) Just pay them. VEDANTAM: This holiday week, we're going to bring you two short conversations I had with Steve Inskeep. He's a host of NPR's Morning Edition. If you haven't heard me on the air, I often talk with Steve about new social science research on the radio. After that, we're going to have a brand-new edition of Stopwatch Science with Daniel Pink. Our theme throughout this episode is how social science can help you have a happy Thanksgiving. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE ICE STORM\") KEVIN KLINE: (As Ben Hood) So let's do it right, and Wendy, why don't you say grace? You used to love to say grace, remember? CHRISTINA RICCI: (As Wendy Hood) Dear Lord, thank you for this Thanksgiving holiday and for all the material possessions that we have and enjoy and for letting us white people kill all the Indians and steal their tribal lands and stuff ourselves like pigs even though children in Asia are being napalmed. KLINE: (As Ben Hood) Jesus, enough, all right. VEDANTAM: The Thanksgiving dinner table can be a place where tensions arise, as in that clip from the 1997 movie \"The Ice Storm. \" And very often, those fights tend to be about politics. Steve Inskeep asked me why it's so difficult to find common ground in these conversations. INSKEEP: Okay, so what's the new research? VEDANTAM: The research looks at seemingly intractable conflicts, such as the conflicts between Democrats and Republicans. And it shows that besides disagreements about the issues, there's an underlying psychological process that makes the search for common ground really difficult. The research comes from Liane Young at Boston College, and along with Adam Waits and Jeremy Gingers, she asked Democrats and Republicans about the emotions that motivate them and the emotions that motivate their opponents. Both sides said that they were motivated by positive emotions such as love or loyalty to their fellow Republicans or their fellow Democrats, but that their opponents were motivated primarily by hate and animosity. Now, this was true of both Republicans and Democrats. Here's Young talking about the Democratic volunteers. LIANE YOUNG: Democrats were much more likely to say that they're motivated by love compared to hate. We then went and asked them, how much is the Republican Party motivated by love and hate? And there we found that Democrats were likely to say that Republicans were motivated by their hate of Democrats rather than their love of Republicans. INSKEEP: OK, so the research says that I'm thinking the worst of the other guy, or more properly, I think that you're thinking the worst of me. I think you hate me, and that colors my perceptions of you. VEDANTAM: That's precisely right, Steve. The point that Young and her colleagues are making is that if we believe that our opponents hate us, it's really hard to imagine common ground. So this might be one reason conflicts end up being intractable not just in politics, but in arguments over the Thanksgiving table. When we feel an aunt or an uncle or a grandparent is out to get us, we do everything we can to defend ourselves against this hate that's coming across the table. What we don't often realize is the person sitting across the table is trying to defend themselves from what they think is our hate for them. So Young and her colleagues think that if we try to see the other side as also being driven by positive emotions such as loyalty or love, rather than animosity, the arguments don't disappear, but it takes the sting out of the arguments. INSKEEP: You know, we have a colleague here at work who talks about assuming the best intentions of the other person. I suppose that's the insight here is to assume the best of intentions of the partisan jerk across the table from me. VEDANTAM: That's exactly right, Steve. People live very different lives and they're coming together for a Thanksgiving meal, so it's not surprising they're going to bring their loyalties to their own groups to the shared dinner. Young told me she hopes to apply the lesson of her study to her own Thanksgiving if an argument happens to break out. Here she is. YOUNG: In the case of a fiery Thanksgiving debate, it's good to give the benefit of the doubt that this person isn't arguing with me because they hate me. But I would tell myself hey, you know, they want me to understand their point of view because they think it's right, and this grandparent is motivated by their love of me. INSKEEP: But wait a minute here, suppose I try so hard to be big about this and to be open-minded and the other person is just a jerk, or I'm afraid the other person is going to be a jerk. What would it take to get the other person to open their minds? VEDANTAM: Well, that's a good question, Steve. Young's study actually might point to the solution because she and her colleagues wanted to see if they could do anything to get people to accurately perceive their opponent's point of view. Now, since this is America, they decided to try the old-fashioned approach. They promised volunteers a financial incentive. INSKEEP: (Laughter) Just pay them, pay them. VEDANTAM: They found that when you tell Democrats and Republicans that they stand to earn about $10 if they can accurately describe what's happening in their political opponents' minds, both sides now say the views of their opponents are probably shaped by positive emotions, such as loyalty and love, rather than hate. I asked Young whether the same technique might work at Thanksgiving dinner tables. Now I have to say she was very skeptical that this could work, but I say that we should run an experiment, slip a $10 bill under people's plates, and as they sit down see if that gives us a happy Thanksgiving. INSKEEP: Shankar, there's a little something for you underneath your paper there. VEDANTAM: You know, Steve, I always thought so highly of you. So hopefully, your Thanksgiving dinner will be argument-free. But just in case it's not, our next story is about apologizing. In the 1973 movie \"A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving,\" Peppermint Patty picks a fight at the dinner table. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"A CHARLIE BROWN THANKSGIVING\") CHRISTOPHER DEFARIA: (As Peppermint Patty) What kind of a Thanksgiving dinner is this? Where's the turkey, Chuck? Don't you know anything about Thanksgiving dinners? Where's the mashed potatoes? Where's the cranberry sauce? Where's the pumpkin pie? VEDANTAM: Sometimes we know we've done something wrong, but it's still really hard to say we are sorry. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"A CHARLIE BROWN THANKSGIVING\") DEFARIA: (As Peppermint Patty) Do you think I hurt old Chuck's feelings? I bet I hurt his feelings. Golly, why can't I act right outside of a baseball game? Marcie, maybe you can go to old Chuck and patch things up for me. Maybe you can tell him how I really feel. Tell him that I didn't mean it the way it sounded. Marcie, you can do it. You go see him, and tell him that I really like him and that the dinner is OK with me. JIMMY AHRENS: (As Marcie) Well, I don't know. I think maybe you should go to Chuck and tell him yourself. VEDANTAM: I talked to Steve about why I love you really can mean never having to say you're sorry or at least never wanting to. INSKEEP: OK, if you've ever looked after a group of children, chances are you have tried to break up a squabble using the following words. Come on now. Just say you're sorry. If your advice was met with stony-faced resistance, you will want to listen to this. Shankar, not sorry to have you here. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). INSKEEP: So what do you mean, not apologizing? What is this about? VEDANTAM: Apologies present us with a puzzle, and the puzzle is kids find it hard to do. Adults find it hard to do. It's even hard when it's completely rational. So in the criminal justice system, for example, you have situations where someone has been found guilty, and they're awaiting sentencing. And the only thing that could reduce the severity of their sentence is if they say, I'm sorry. And time and time again, people refuse to apologize. So, Tyler Okimoto, who is a researcher at University of Queensland in Australia, along with his colleagues Michael Wenzel and Kyli Hedrick, they decided to conduct some psychological experiments to understand why people refuse to apologize. Now parents have been telling their kids for years, look, just say you're sorry. You're going to feel better about yourself. Okimoto finds that parents have been telling their kids the truth, but they haven't been telling their kids the whole truth. Here he is. OKIMOTO: We do find that apologies do make apologizers feel better, but the interesting thing is is that refusals to apologize also makes people feel better. And in fact, in some cases, it makes them feel even better than an apology would have. VEDANTAM: So what he does is he asks a number of people to remember times when they've harmed someone, and most people, of course, remember trivial things, domestic quarrels and stuff like that. But some people also remember serious harms they've done. They remember crimes, such as theft. And Okimoto does two things. He asked them, did you actually apologize in real life? And then second, he conducts a laboratory experiment, where he asks them to compose an email where they either apologize or they refuse to apologize. And what he finds is that both in real life, as well as in the laboratory, refusing to apologize increases your feelings of status and increases your feelings of integrity. INSKEEP: You feel like you have more integrity because you refused to apologize for something that you know you should apologize for. VEDANTAM: That exactly right. The human mind is a wonderful thing, Steve. INSKEEP: OK, so what is the conclusion here? We should never apologize for anything. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) Well, actually, there are huge interpersonal costs to not apologizing and not just between individuals, between groups. I mean, think about conflicts that have been stuck for decades because one side can't tell another side, look, we're really sorry about what we did. The value of Okimoto's research is it starts to get a handle on why people find it so hard to apologize. Here he is again. OKIMOTO: When you refuse to apologize, it actually makes you feel more empowered. That power and control seems to translate into greater feelings of self-worth. INSKEEP: I think I'm getting this because when you apologize, you are putting your fate in someone else's hands. They will accept the apology or not or respond however they do. When you say, I will not apologize, you are still in control. VEDANTAM: Yeah, and I think this research actually reminds me of the value of something that philosophers have been saying for a very long time, which is being able to apologize is not a sign of weakness. It's actually a sign of strength because if you look at the people who find it difficult to apologize, it's people who feel threatened, people who feel an apology would somehow make them extremely vulnerable. INSKEEP: And of course, if you're a little kid being asked to apologize, you feel vulnerable. You're little to begin with, and that almost suggests that maybe a parent would want to approach that situation a different way. VEDANTAM: If you're actually trying to change people's behavior, love and support might be more effective. INSKEEP: Because if not, people end up giving that apology that they don't really mean. VEDANTAM: They're completely insincere. INSKEEP: Sorry. VEDANTAM: That was Morning Edition's Steve Inskeep with a rendition of a totally sincere apology. Coming up, Stopwatch Science with Daniel Pink. We'll tell you how to keep from overeating, overshopping, and fighting with your relatives this holiday. Back in a moment.

We're going to stick with our war and peace and Thanksgiving theme in our next segment, which is Stopwatch Science. I'm joined, as always, by Daniel Pink. Hi, Dan. PINK: Hey, Shankar. VEDANTAM: Dan and I are going to give one another 60 seconds to describe ideas from social science research. We're going to do things a little differently this time based on some of your feedback. As we approach the 60-second mark, our producers, Kara and Maggie, will gently bring up the music, just like they do at the Oscars. So Dan, what do you think? This is a kinder, gentler version of Stopwatch Science. PINK: Kinder, gentler, Clooney-esque (ph) - those are three adjectives that describe me very well. VEDANTAM: They do indeed, Dan. Alright, so Thanksgiving can be a wonderful time of peace and harmony. In other words, they speak to all of Dan Pink's finest qualities. But sometimes things can go off the rails. Maybe that's because a fight breaks out at the table. Maybe it's simply because you eat too much. On this edition of Stopwatch Science, Dan and I are going to give you tips on how to have a better Thanksgiving. Dan, if you are ready, your first 60 seconds starts now. PINK: Well, Shankar, as you say, Thanksgiving, for many of us, is about resisting temptation. So how can we do it better? Well, a paper published in the Journal of Consumer Research suggests one secret might be a simple language trick. We should shift from saying I can't to saying I don't. Now, in one of the experiments, undergraduates were trained to resist unhealthy foods by saying to themselves either, I can't eat X, or I don't eat X. Later, they were offered a choice between chocolate and a healthy granola bar. Of those using the I-can't self talk, fewer than 40 percent picked the healthy snack. But in the I-don't group, nearly two thirds chose the healthier option. VEDANTAM: Wow. PINK: What's going on is what linguists call semantic framing. Semantic framing - different words give us different views of reality. Can't is disempowering. It implies someone or something else is in control. Don't is empowering. Implies that I'm in charge of what I do and, ultimately, who I am. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: That's fascinating, Dan. And you were also empowered by the fact that you finished well under 60 seconds. PINK: I feel like riding a horse across an open plain right now. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) I think you forgot to thank your family and your friends for this wonderful movie that's just been made. But I have a question for you, Dan. So I can understand how you can apply this semantic framing when it comes to overeating at Thanksgiving. Can you also apply it, do you think, to limiting the kind of fights that sometimes break out? PINK: Absolutely. Absolutely. I'm thinking in some cases, depending on your family, this might be more useful in that regard. So you can say to yourself, oh, I can't get into an argument with Uncle Joe. But that might not work nearly as well as saying, you know, I don't get into stupid political fights with people who don't know what they're talking about. VEDANTAM: I'm going to remember that when I speak with Uncle Joe on Thursday. PINK: (Laughter) Alright, so now on to you, Shankar. Your 60 seconds starts right now. Leaf Van Boven at the University of Colorado, George Loewenstein at Carnegie Mellon and other colleagues recently analyzed a factors that I think plays a role in Thanksgiving table social breakdowns, Dan. It has to do with the concept of hot and cold emotions. So when I'm not very hungry, for example, I know that I should eat healthy. But when I am hungry, and I'm in the group of hunger, I forget my resolution. George Loewenstein once told me that the key idea here is not that we have these hot and cold states, but that when we are in a cold state, we are terrible at forecasting how we will behave when we're in the grip of emotions, when we're in the hot state. The researchers recently applied this idea to embarrassing situations. Many of us think we can handle embarrassing situations, but when we're actually confronted by an embarrassing situation, we fail to act with courage and confidence. I think this plays a role in Thanksgiving table meltdowns. We think we will rise to the occasion to confront that proverbial drunk Uncle Joe, but we fail to predict that when he actually starts acting up, we will lapse into silence. PINK: Yeah, sad but true - but what were the actual experiments that they did to demonstrate this? VEDANTAM: Well, they did a bunch of things. One of the things they did that I thought was very interesting is they asked volunteers to predict whether they would be willing to dance to the 1970 James Brown song \"Sex Machine. \" If they agreed to dance in front of others for three full minutes, they were to be given two dollars. Now, compared to the number of volunteers who predicted that they would be willing to dance, about 1 in 10 were actually willing to dance. So in fact, Dan, when I heard about the study I told myself, Dan and I should actually run this experiment during Stopwatch Science. Would you be willing to dance to \"Sex Machine\" at the end of the segment today? PINK: Do I get two bucks? No, I can't do that. VEDANTAM: Are you sure? PINK: Well, actually I should say I don't do something like that. Sorry. VEDANTAM: Well played, Dan, well played. All right, your next 60 seconds starts right now. PINK: All right, here's some good news. Stuffing your face with turkey, gravy and candied yams might have an upside. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: Arul and Himanshu Mishra - they're a husband and wife team at the University of Utah - have found that on Thanksgiving, what's bad for your waistline might actually be good for your wallet. A few years ago, they interrupted 170 people on Thanksgiving evening, and they asked those people how willing they'd be to buy deeply discounted items. The researchers found that those who'd eaten a traditional holiday meal were significantly less likely to be seduced by the bargains. What's going on here? In a word, serotonin. That's a brain chemical that regulates mood. When serotonin goes up - which it does when we eat tryptophan-heavy foods like turkey and rich carbohydrates like mashed potatoes - our impulsiveness goes down. PINK: In other words, if you want to save money on Black Friday, pig out on Thanksgiving Thursday. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) I love it, Dan. I have to say that I have an alternate theory though, which is that the people who have eaten so much at Thanksgiving, they might just be in a food coma. They're just physically not able to get to the telephone to speak to telemarketers. PINK: It's an interesting theory. It's a testable theory. My hunch is that the research would validate that being in a food coma reduces your impulsivity. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: All right, so on that, let's go to your second and final study, Shankar. Your 60 seconds starts right now. VEDANTAM: All right, we've known for a very long time that children are easily distracted by bright and shiny objects. Turns out, adults are too, and this can be a very useful idea to apply at Thanksgiving. Martin Reimann at the University of Arizona and Antoine Bechara and Deborah MacInnis at the University of Southern California, they ran an experiment. They set up a food stand and offered people chicken nuggets, beef tacos and bacon-avocado sandwiches. They told the volunteers that if they chose a half serving instead of a full serving, they would get a lottery ticket - a chance to win either a $100 Amazon gift card or 10,000 frequent flyer miles. And they measured how likely people were to choose the full serving versus the half serving. They found that about two-thirds of the volunteers chose the full serving without the lottery incentive, but with the lottery tickets, that number dropped by more than half. If people thought they could win a prize, they ate less. In other words, if you want to incentivize people to eat in moderation or behave nicely at Thanksgiving, the answer is simple - hand out lottery tickets. PINK: (Laughter) Well, that's great. You know, I really think you've uncovered the true meaning of Thanksgiving, which is handing out cash prizes for dumb luck. VEDANTAM: (Laughter).

One hundred years ago today, Albert Einstein presented his theory of general relativity. So for the next few minutes, this is going to be a safe space for everyone who might think they have a vague understanding that maybe the theory of relativity is a really big deal, but maybe you don't really know exactly why or what that means. Consider this a physics amnesty. Astrophysicists and NPR blogger Adam Frank promises not to judge as I ask some really ignorant questions right now. Hey, Adam. ADAM FRANK: Hey, how's it going, Ari? SHAPIRO: Let's start with the basics on this 100th anniversary. What exactly is the theory of general relativity? FRANK: So I think the first thing to understand is what Einstein gave us with the general theory of relativity. And what it was was a insight into the fundamental nature of space and time. You know, and that's kind of a big deal. SHAPIRO: And that insight was that they're not separate things, but they're actually connected to each other, right? FRANK: Right, exactly. I mean, when you think about space and time, they're kind of weird, right? They rule our life. We move through space our entire lives, time is always ticking away and yet, we don't see them, right? They're invisible. And what Einstein was able to do for physicists was to show us a way of understanding them as a unified whole. And the vision that he gave us was so radical from anything else that anybody had ever conceived. SHAPIRO: And what was that vision? What was that insight about the relationship that space and time have to one another? FRANK: Well, the first thing he understood was that space and time are not separate things, right? So from Newton, people had - sort of had the idea that, you know, time was just this river that flowed at the same rate, you know, one hour per hour, everywhere in space. And space was just an empty stage on which the stuff of life happened. And what Einstein showed was first of all, that you could never separate them. Space and time were one thing. It was this whole four-dimensional reality we call space-time. And more than that, the stage was dynamic - that space-time was a thing. It could bend and it could stretch and it could mold. And that idea that space-time was not just this emptiness, but that it was actually a dynamic player in the drama of the universe. SHAPIRO: But this is where I start to get lost. Einstein's theory tells us that if we send someone out into space, they're going to age at a different rate than someone on earth? Do I even have that right? FRANK: Yeah, it's true. So the general theory of relativity showed us that the rate at which time flows depends on how close you are to a massive body. SHAPIRO: That is so weird. I'm sorry, that is so weird. (LAUGHTER)FRANK: No, it's weird for me too. It never stops - that's the great thing about relativity. It never stops being weird, right? No matter how - I've been working with it for 30 years, and I'm still like, oh, my - you're kidding me. So what this means is when you're - if you're downstairs and your kids are upstairs, time is flowing slower for you than it is for the kids up there - relatively. SHAPIRO: Are there real-world technologies that we use today that wouldn't work if Einstein had not had this insight? FRANK: You know, it's an interesting question because if you'd asked me that question 20 years ago or 30 years ago, I'd have been like, no, this is - you know, this is super important for physicists and their understanding of the universe, but there's really nothing around that we use. But now everything is changed because literally without general relativity, we would all be lost. And I say that because it's essential to GPS. SHAPIRO: Really? FRANK: All of us - yeah. All of us are using GPS technologies, right? It's in our phone. And the only reason it's accurate is because we have to take into account that time difference. You know, GPS works by having these satellites orbiting, and they're sending signals back and forth. And if we didn't take into account the fact that the time is flowing at a different rate for the satellites as it is for us on the ground, it would start to lose time in some sense. It would lose accuracy - about 45 microseconds per day. And you think, oh, that's not very much. But, you know, after a week, for example, if you were to step out on your porch in Columbus, Ohio, the GPS would tell you that you were 5,000 meters above Detroit. So GPS is so accurate, the small differences matter a lot. SHAPIRO: That's Adam Frank who teaches astrophysics at the University of Rochester. Thanks for the explainer. FRANK: Oh, it was great. Thank you. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  It was the discovery that changed the universe - or rather our understanding of the universe.

FRANK: You know, it's an interesting question because if you'd asked me that question 20 years ago or 30 years ago, I'd have been like, no, this is - you know, this is super important for physicists and their understanding of the universe, but there's really nothing around that we use. But now everything is changed because literally without general relativity, we would all be lost. And I say that because it's essential to GPS. SHAPIRO: Really? FRANK: All of us - yeah. All of us are using GPS technologies, right? It's in our phone. And the only reason it's accurate is because we have to take into account that time difference. You know, GPS works by having these satellites orbiting, and they're sending signals back and forth. And if we didn't take into account the fact that the time is flowing at a different rate for the satellites as it is for us on the ground, it would start to lose time in some sense. It would lose accuracy - about 45 microseconds per day. And you think, oh, that's not very much. But, you know, after a week, for example, if you were to step out on your porch in Columbus, Ohio, the GPS would tell you that you were 5,000 meters above Detroit. So GPS is so accurate, the small differences matter a lot. SHAPIRO: That's Adam Frank who teaches astrophysics at the University of Rochester. Thanks for the explainer. FRANK: Oh, it was great.

But in all the data, it's easy to forget that there are people behind those equations and models. And when people are involved, there's always room for - well, what else? - human error. Thomas Levenson's book \"The Hunt For Vulcan\" explores one pretty glaring error that was taken as fact for more than 50 years. And that is the belief that there was another planet in our solar system that we could not see because it was behind the sun. Thomas Levenson is with us now from the studios at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he's the head of the science writing program. Professor Levenson, thanks so much for speaking with us. THOMAS LEVENSON: Thank you for having me. MARTIN: How did the idea that Vulcan existed come into being? LEVENSON: Well, they idea of the planet Vulcan came into being for absolutely the best reasons. You know, the way you find new things in the solar system or anywhere is by noticing something odd about what you already can see. And in the mid-19th century, an extremely talented astronomer - I mean, really, really top-flight guy - was studying the orbit of the planet Mercury, and he found that there was a wobble in it.  There was an unexplained extra residue of motion. And, you know, there's a perfect standard explanation in the science of the time - Newtonian - you know, Isaac Newton's great theory for what would cause that extra bit of motion - another planet that we hadn't yet discovered inside the orbit of Mercury that could tug it just slightly off its expected course. MARTIN: Would you read from the - actually, there's a little section from the preface that I was hoping I could get you to read. Do you have a copy of the book with you? LEVENSON: I do. MARTIN: OK. You want to read that for us? LEVENSON: All right. (Reading) As a hypothesis, conjuring a plane out of an orbital glitch was perfectly reasonable. Indeed, there was precedent, and at first, it seemed not just logical, but right. Almost as soon as Mercury's plight became public knowledge, amateur and professional astronomers alike spotted and identified an object lurking within the concealing glare of the sun. It would be seen again, over and over, more than a dozen times over two decades. Its own orbit would be calculated, its history recovered in old records of unexplained sightings. It would even receive a name. There was only one problem. The planet Vulcan was never there. MARTIN: And your book tells the story of how it came to be understood that it wasn't there. And a person - a name that I think any people will know - if they don't know any other scientists' names, they probably know this one. A man named Albert Einstein is the reason that we no longer think that. LEVENSON: Well, Albert - I mean, I actually think of him as Big Al because I've been working on him so long. But Albert Einstein had a problem in the first decade of the 20th century. In 1905, he invented the special theory of relativity, which explained motion in all kinds of circumstances but one, which was motion under the influence of gravity. And so from about 1907 on, he started trying to reconcile the fact that his special theory of relativity and Newton's laws of motion - Newton's ideas about gravitation - were incompatible. They clashed. And he spent eight years on the problem, completed 100 years ago this month. He showed that it was the actual shape of space and time that produces this visible wobble in its orbit that requires no extra explanation for it. It's just that's the way the shape of space is where it happens to be. MARTIN: How excited was Einstein about coming to this conclusion? LEVENSON: Einstein - he kind of lost his mind for a little bit. He did the calculation, you know, to see if Mercury behaved as his - if his theory produced an account of Mercury that behaved as the real Mercury does. And he was working through the calculation, and there are bunch of steps. And he got to the end, and he, you know, got the number. And he looked at the number, and he looked at the table of what astronomers had observed, and he saw that they matched. He said he had palpitations. I mean, his heart was literally shuddering in his chest. I just have this vision - I mean, this is completely made up, but I have this vision of Einstein, sockless, dancing at his desk when he got the number, right? Just, you know. . . MARTIN: Why do you think the story of Vulcan isn't better known? I'm wondering if you think it's one of the things that should be taught as a cautionary tale of forcing the facts to fit the explanation. LEVENSON: We don't teach the history of science by the things that people messed up on. We teach the history of science - we teach all of history by the things that worked. You know, the transcontinental railroad goes through, and you drive the golden spike, and there it is. You don't talk to all the, you know, railroad companies that went bankrupt somewhere in the Great Plains, right? And in science, you don't dwell on the blind alleys, but the blind alleys are most of what science actually does. You have to go down the blind alley. You bang your head against that, you know, blank wall at the end of it, come back out again and try something else. And that's the real experience, and that's why Vulcan is so wonderful. It shows how you do it and, ultimately, how you get out of that. MARTIN: But I do have ask you - so I do - I do find myself wondering - are there things that we assume today that will turn out to be ridiculous in the future? LEVENSON: I am absolutely certain. I mean, I'd bet real money on this that 100 years from now somebody's going to look back on things we believe about who knows what - our current theories of the brain or consciousness, some of the deep ideas people work in physics, ways that, you know, social relations are presumed to work. Anything - you name it. There's something out there. We have assumption, we have a mental model, we have a theory that just isn't right. And a hundred years from now, somebody's going to look back at them and say - wasn't that ridiculous? How could they get it so wrong? Isn't it obvious? I mean, yeah, human beings don't get things right all at once. It takes us a lot of time. We make a lot of mistakes. We have category mistakes. And it takes a great leap of the imagination to get from what you really know you know to the wacky thing that turns out to be more true than your remembered-but-erroneous past. MARTIN: Thomas Levenson - his book is called \"The Hunt For Vulcan And How Albert Einstein Destroyed A Planet, Discovered Relativity And Deciphered The Universe. \" Professor Levenson, thank you very much.

To understand it, you need something big and complicated. PHIL WEBSTER: OK, so it is very noisy in here. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Phil Webster is taking me into a windowless room full of hulking black monoliths. This is NASA's Center for Climate Simulation in Maryland. WEBSTER: The computers generate a lot of heat, so there's a lot of fans, a lot of cooling and stuff that's in it. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Webster runs this supercomputing center with help from a guy nicknamed in the alpha geek, Dan Duffy.

DAN DUFFY: If you took everybody on the face of the Earth - all 7. 3, 7. 4 billion people - and you had them multiply two numbers together every single second for 145 hours total. That's what this entire computing center can do in one second. GREENFIELDBOYCE: OK. That is a mind-boggling amount of number crunching. And when this thing runs a climate simulation, it takes months for it to spit out an answer. To find out what exactly is going on inside there, I went to New York City. And if you ever watch the TV show \"Seinfeld,\" you'll know exactly where I am. I'm standing right outside that restaurant, the corner restaurant the gang used to hang out at. Right above this restaurant are the offices of one of the world's foremost climate modelers. Hi there. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Hi. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Is this Goddard Institute for Space Studies? UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Yes. GREENFIELDBOYCE: I'm here to see Gavin Schmidt. The first thing I see in Gavin Schmidt's office is a black board on the wall that's covered with equations. These scientific scribbles were left by the last guy who worked here, a famous climate change researcher named Jim Hansen. For someone like me, it's totally incomprehensible, but this is the language these folks use to talk about everything that makes up our climate. What is a climate model, really? Is it just a bunch of equations? GAVIN SCHMIDT: So the climate model - you're best thinking of it as an encapsulation of all the things that we can go out and measure, right? So we can go and measure how much sunlight reflects off the sea ice. We can go and measure how much water you need to have in the air before you form a cloud. You can go and measure how the winds affect the ocean currents, right? Those are physical processes that we've been observing for hundreds of years. A climate model encapsulates each of those processes, the ones that we think of as being important, and it links them all together. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Researchers created the first primitive models of Earth's climate back in the 1960s on computers that used punch cards. Schmidt says there's now around 30 different groups worldwide doing climate simulations using supercomputers. And the consensus is, if greenhouse gas emissions keep rising, the world will look different. On his desktop computer screen, Schmidt pulls up one graphic of the globe that's color-coded for temperature. I watch it get redder and redder as the years tick up into the future. SCHMIDT: So you're looking at a situation where there's very little ice left in the Arctic. You're looking at temperature changes on land that are the equivalent of, you know, moving south by a couple of thousand miles. So you know, climates of New York would have the climates of Miami. GREENFIELDBOYCE: How confident do you feel about those kinds of predictions? SCHMIDT: That's a great question. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says, well, these simulations are able to basically re-create the Earth's climate as we see it today. SCHMIDT: What you see are patterns in the models that reflect what you see in the real world. We know that we must be getting something fundamentally correct in order for that to happen. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He rattles off a bunch of other reasons to feel confident. Can these models re-create past events like the last Ice Age? SCHMIDT: Yes, they do. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Do models created independently by different groups show similar patterns? SCHMIDT: Yes, they do. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Yes. Do the models make pretty good short-term predictions? Yeah. SCHMIDT: So models have verifiable skill. They're not perfect, but nonetheless, they make useful predictions. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Whether or not the world actually will use them - that's what diplomats are hashing out in Paris right now. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

The first big meeting took place 18 years ago in Japan. The Kyoto conference produced the first international treaty to slow climate change. But the treaty fell apart, and scientists say the planet is now closer than ever to a climate catastrophe. NPR's Christopher Joyce reports that this time negotiators say they've got a radically new approach to avoid a repeat of Kyoto. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: You could say the 1990s was when the world got a little scarier. Scientists said the planet is warming unnaturally and they were pretty sure humans were causing it by burning too much fossil fuels like coal and oil and natural gas that put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Governments met in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, to do something about it. Two weeks into the talks, though, it looked hopeless. People thought their economies would tank without energy from fossil fuels. Then Vice President Al Gore flew in to reassure everyone that cutting back on CO2 would not break the bank. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)AL GORE: The imperative here is to do what we promise rather than to promise what we cannot do. JOYCE: A treaty emerged. It set targets for developed countries to reduce the greenhouse gases that cause warming. Gore reassured the developing world that they would be exempt. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GORE: We understand that your first priority is to lift your citizens from the poverty so many endure and build strong economies that will assure a better future. This is your right. It will not be denied. HARALD DOVLAND: I thought we had come a very big step forward. JOYCE: Harald Dovland represented the Norwegian government in Kyoto. DOVLAND: We had the first commitment. We had a process on strengthening commitments. It didn't work out. JOYCE: Why not? Well, these emissions cuts were set to start 10 years later so everyone had time to prepare. But the U. S. never even signed on. The Senate would not approve it. And during that 10 years, China's economy took off. Their greenhouse gas emissions soared. Valli Moosa, a South African delegate at Kyoto, says the treaty was handicapped from the start. VALLI MOOSA: You actually cannot have a meaningful agreement without China and the United States being part of it. JOYCE: And many developed countries either didn't live up to their promised emissions cuts or dropped out of the treaty. By 2009, it was clear that Kyoto was not going to slow the planet's fever. World governments met in a mood of desperation in Copenhagen to draft a new treaty. They failed. Rich countries were worried about ruining their economies. And many wanted developing nations to pitch in as well. That set off a global spat. You made this mess, said the developing countries. It's like the sign at the gift shop. You break it, you pay for it. Copenhagen rattled the international climatocracy so much that they radically changed course. So for Paris, here's the thinking. For one thing, says South Africa's Valli Moosa, international bureaucrats just cannot tell the world's biggest economies what to do. MOOSA: I don't believe that you're going to be able to make through this process a China or a United States do something that it already doesn't want to. JOYCE: So this time, governments are volunteering to limit emissions. The limits won't be set by international bureaucrats. Moreover, everybody, not just the developed world, has to limit their emissions. And now there's lots of money for developing countries to use to help with climate change. There's an international fund that will have $100 billion in it eventually. The U. S. has promised $3 billion; China, $3. 1 billion. French climate negotiator Laurence Tubiana says the message from Paris will be you can get rich and still reduce emissions. LAURENCE TUBIANA: How much I'm sacrificing for the sake of emission reductions - it's no more. And now from the Chinese to even the Indians are really coming in. It's about low-carbon economy. JOYCE: So the Paris conference, the climate community wants you to know, will be very different from the diplomatic failures of the past. Valli Moosa, the former climate negotiator who's now a businessman in South Africa, says he hopes that people are still listening. MOOSA: You know, the eyes just glaze over. Now, even people in the environmental movement actually don't understand the detail of the current negotiations because they just can't - you just can't keep up your energy to follow all of this stuff for so many years. JOYCE: But he and everyone else in the climate policy world say this problem is way too big to have any simple solution. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

The first big meeting took place 18 years ago in Japan. The Kyoto conference produced the first international treaty to slow climate change. But the treaty fell apart, and scientists say the planet is now closer than ever to a climate catastrophe. NPR's Christopher Joyce reports that this time negotiators say they've got a radically new approach to avoid a repeat of Kyoto. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: You could say the 1990s was when the world got a little scarier. Scientists said the planet is warming unnaturally and they were pretty sure humans were causing it by burning too much fossil fuels like coal and oil and natural gas that put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Governments met in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, to do something about it. Two weeks into the talks, though, it looked hopeless. People thought their economies would tank without energy from fossil fuels. Then Vice President Al Gore flew in to reassure everyone that cutting back on CO2 would not break the bank. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) AL GORE: The imperative here is to do what we promise rather than to promise what we cannot do. JOYCE: A treaty emerged. It set targets for developed countries to reduce the greenhouse gases that cause warming. Gore reassured the developing world that they would be exempt. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GORE: We understand that your first priority is to lift your citizens from the poverty so many endure and build strong economies that will assure a better future. This is your right. It will not be denied. HARALD DOVLAND: I thought we had come a very big step forward. JOYCE: Harald Dovland represented the Norwegian government in Kyoto. DOVLAND: We had the first commitment. We had a process on strengthening commitments. It didn't work out. JOYCE: Why not? Well, these emissions cuts were set to start 10 years later so everyone had time to prepare. But the U. S. never even signed on. The Senate would not approve it. And during that 10 years, China's economy took off. Their greenhouse gas emissions soared. Valli Moosa, a South African delegate at Kyoto, says the treaty was handicapped from the start. VALLI MOOSA: You actually cannot have a meaningful agreement without China and the United States being part of it. JOYCE: And many developed countries either didn't live up to their promised emissions cuts or dropped out of the treaty. By 2009, it was clear that Kyoto was not going to slow the planet's fever. World governments met in a mood of desperation in Copenhagen to draft a new treaty. They failed. Rich countries were worried about ruining their economies. And many wanted developing nations to pitch in as well. That set off a global spat. You made this mess, said the developing countries. It's like the sign at the gift shop. You break it, you pay for it. Copenhagen rattled the international climatocracy so much that they radically changed course. So for Paris, here's the thinking. For one thing, says South Africa's Valli Moosa, international bureaucrats just cannot tell the world's biggest economies what to do. MOOSA: I don't believe that you're going to be able to make through this process a China or a United States do something that it already doesn't want to. JOYCE: So this time, governments are volunteering to limit emissions. The limits won't be set by international bureaucrats. Moreover, everybody, not just the developed world, has to limit their emissions. And now there's lots of money for developing countries to use to help with climate change. There's an international fund that will have $100 billion in it eventually. The U. S. has promised $3 billion; China, $3. 1 billion. French climate negotiator Laurence Tubiana says the message from Paris will be you can get rich and still reduce emissions. LAURENCE TUBIANA: How much I'm sacrificing for the sake of emission reductions - it's no more. And now from the Chinese to even the Indians are really coming in. It's about low-carbon economy. JOYCE: So the Paris conference, the climate community wants you to know, will be very different from the diplomatic failures of the past. Valli Moosa, the former climate negotiator who's now a businessman in South Africa, says he hopes that people are still listening. MOOSA: You know, the eyes just glaze over. Now, even people in the environmental movement actually don't understand the detail of the current negotiations because they just can't - you just can't keep up your energy to follow all of this stuff for so many years. JOYCE: But he and everyone else in the climate policy world say this problem is way too big to have any simple solution.

He's the only one of over sixty that I look at in my book who I think is at the same level as the artists he forged. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. On today's podcast - how the brain tells real from fake when it comes to fine art and fine wine. We start with Noah Charney, author of \"The Art Of Forgery. \" We talk about master forger Eric Hebborn. CHARNEY: And his story is one of revenge over monetary gain. That's why he turned to forgery. He initially had been a failed artist. He couldn't get traction with his own original artworks, even though he had some serious talent. And he had been at a flea market, and he purchased some drawings that he thought might be of value. He brought them to an art gallery in London, and the gallerist said, you know, this is pretty good, I'll take it off your hands, it's not bad. So he sold them and he made a profit, so he was quite pleased. But then he came back past the gallery a little bit later and saw that it was in the window - the very object he had sold - for much more than he had paid. And he felt that he had been, essentially, swindled by the gallery and decided to get revenge. VEDANTAM: And so when you look at Hebborn and his reaction to this gallery, he is outraged that the gallery cheated him and that this gallery is part of the art establishment that has not taken him seriously, has not given him his due. And he makes this life-changing decision. What was the decision? CHARNEY: The decision was to try to make his own drawings in the style of old masters and try to pass them off as originals. And by doing so, he gains a sort of passive-aggressive revenge that is the primary initial motivation for the majority of art forgers in this book. And there are two components to it. On the one hand, if he creates a drawing, and the experts think that it's by a great master, then he can convince himself that he must be as good as the master. But the second part is that if he's able to fool these so-called experts, he demonstrates how foolish they are. And the implication is that they were foolish not to endorse his own original artworks. VEDANTAM: When Hebborn decided to forge the great masters, he decided to do it in a way that was quite unique. What was that way? CHARNEY: The majority of successful art forgers in the 20th century use variations on what I call a provenance trap, and there are four variations on it. But the essential component is it uses provenance, or the documented history of an object, as a trap to lure the researcher to authenticate the work. Let's be honest, every art historian wants to be Indiana Jones and wants to find lost treasures. And you may or may not know that the majority of works that we know of made by old masters are lost. In some cases, as much as two-thirds of the oeuvres of these famous artists of the Renaissance - we know of them through documented references to them, but we don't know where they are. So provenance trap uses documented history and then creates lost works that match the real documented history. And Eric Hebborn is an example of that. He very cleverly created drawings that looked like preparatory sketches for famous paintings. We all know that famous artists throughout history prepared their paintings and sculptures by doing sketches, by doing drawings. But it was not until relatively recently that drawings were considered a collectible art form and worth keeping. It's a little bit like blueprints and a building. You keep the building, but you don't necessarily keep the blueprints. Eric Hebborn would create what appeared to be these preparatory drawings for works like the one I'm looking at in the book right now - Anthony van Dyck's \"Crowning With Thorns,\" which is in the Museo del Prado in Madrid. He created what looked like a drawing in preparation for that. And we know, logically, that van Dyck made lots of preparatory drawings, but they simply aren't extant anymore. VEDANTAM: I wonder if you could just walk me through these two drawings that I'm looking at in the book here. I'm seeing the original on my left-hand side, and I'm seeing Hebborn's preparatory drawing for this work on the right. What am I seeing here in Anthony van Dyck's \"Crowning With Thorns? \"CHARNEY: In the original painting, which was finished around 1620, is an oil on canvas. It's a substantial size, and it shows Christ having the crown of thorns lowered on him as he's bound. And he's surrounded by people who would have been his torturers. And he seems resigned to his fate. And it's very beautiful, it's very glossy. There's a brilliant use of oil paints. You can have an almost sculptural quality to Christ's body. VEDANTAM: I'm seeing his face, Christ's face, turned to the right from our perspective. I'm seeing there's a figure in the foreground in the right-hand side of the painting who's reaching out and touching Christ on his left arm. And there's a host of figures in the background who are doing various things. CHARNEY: Right. There are a number of figures - there's one, two, three, four, five figures in the background, including people peering in through a grated window in the back to spy on what's happening. And Christ is seated quite comfortably facing front out to the viewer. Now, when we turn to the preparatory drawing, the positioning of the figures and the number of the figures is different, but this is entirely normal. Artists, when they're coming up with the concept, or inventione, of the artwork, will do various sketches to try to get a composition that they like. And the composition of this preparatory drawing is actually in the shape of an S. It's something called figura serpentinata, which was described by Michelangelo as the most beautiful form in nature. The flickering of a candle flame is supposed to be the positioning of the bodies that is the most elegant. And that's something that we see here in Eric Hebborn's forgery of a van Dyck drawing. And it's normal to have sketches that look somewhat different from the finished product. In fact, it would be suspicious if there was a drawing that looked exactly like the finished product. But here you have this idea. Christ is leaning far to the side, he's being physically supported by one of his executioners as another one pushes the crown of thorns more violently onto his head. It's more dynamic, and there's more movement to it, more diagonals. And it essentially looks like an initial concept that he decided not to follow through with for this drawing. It's very clever because it's not hitting you over the head with the fact that this must be preparatory drawing. VEDANTAM: But what I find really, really clever about this was that Hebborn was leaving me to complete his con. And there's two things that I found really intriguing there from a psychological perspective. One, when Hebborn is basically presenting a preparatory drawing that looks actually quite different from the finished drawing, he's allowing the expert to connect the dots. That is psychologically very clever because he's taking advantage of the fact the expert has vanity and wants to make these connections. And the best con game is where the mark essentially executes the con for you. That's one of the things he was doing. But the second thing was, by so doing, he's also demonstrating to himself that the expert really is not an expert. And he's demonstrating for his own psychological satisfaction that this world of the art expert is a sham world. CHARNEY: It's true. It's very clever on his part. And the majority of successful forgers use some variation on the theme that you describe. They set a trap without being too specific and allow the experts to dive headfirst into it and enthusiastically authenticate the work because it feels to them like a great discovery that they are making personally. It feels like a triumph. And once an expert goes out on a limb and says this is authentic, it is very hard for them to go back on it. So they wind up tangling themselves in this net that's been laid out by the forger. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: What struck me as I was reading this chapter was the extraordinary attention to detail and the effort that Hebborn put in to mastering the techniques needed to pass off his works as real. CHARNEY: Well, Hebborn was particularly meticulous. Out of all the forgers I looked at, he was really the one who was the most passionate as an art historian and as a researcher and was focused on getting the materials correct whenever he could. Getting the technique right is something that you can do essentially by practice. You can practice over and over again, and you could come up with a signature that looks almost identical to mine. And if you practice it enough, you can do it with a fluidity that looks authentic. Getting the materials correct is much harder, and it's more expensive. It is also not strictly necessary because most forgers that I looked got the style just about right. They had a very clever provenance trap that was the confidence trick that passed off the object. And they didn't really need to get the materials correct because it's not normal for objects to be forensically tested. Unless some red flag is raised stylistically or in terms of the object's history, nobody does forensic testing. This is part of a residual gentleman's agreement in the art trade that dates back hundreds of years, that if an expert says it's good. . . VEDANTAM: . . . It's good. CHARNEY: Then it's good. There really has to be something very wrong for them to forensically test it. VEDANTAM: Or maybe the experts disagree. CHARNEY: Or if the experts disagree - if they can't reach a consensus, then the tiebreaker is broken by scientific testing. These days, it doesn't have to be the case. Forensic testing is neither particularly expensive nor is it invasive necessarily into the object. But Hebborn took that level of detail because he was a perfectionist, because he loved what he was doing and was very passionate about it and because I think he wanted to genuinely feel that he was doing exactly what the old masters were doing. And he is the only one of all the artists I looked at - all the art forgers I looked at - who I think was at a similar level to the people he was forging. VEDANTAM: When you look at the work that he did, where he basically broke down the different colors that the masters were using, how did he actually find this out? I mean, he was spending enormous amounts of time being a scholar - not just being a forger but being a scholar. He couldn't have done the forgeries if he hadn't done the scholarship. CHARNEY: He had a bent as a chemist. And he did analyses of the pigments used by different artists. VEDANTAM: It is so interesting that he spent so much time thinking about his technique but also thinking about what he needed to do to himself in order to be able to pull off these forgeries. One of the things you talk about in this book is how he achieved this fluidity of line, that he was able to forge these things in a way that looked tossed off. What did he do? CHARNEY: Well, he's a real character. And he volunteered all of his secrets because he was looking for notoriety. And he wrote a book called \"The Art Forger's Handbook,\" which incidentally has been found in the studio of many an art forger arrested since it came out. And one of his tricks was to get drunk. He would get drunk while he was making the drawings, and it would achieve a certain fluidity of line and body. And in the process, he would not overthink things. And when I was giving you the example of if you tried to forge my signature, you wouldn't have the mental or physical capacity, if you drink enough, to be too painstaking about it. And a painstaking line is a giveaway to an expert that something funny's going on. He would do dozens of sketches to prepare the fluidity of line he was after. But then he would start drinking heavily and then do his sketches as well in order to ensure that he wouldn't overthink things. VEDANTAM: So his forgeries were actually committed while he was under the influence of alcohol? CHARNEY: Absolutely. And he volunteers this. He actually has step-by-step recipes for how he made his forgeries of paintings and drawings in his book. And that's one of the ways we can work backwards and see, well, if these were the techniques employed by Hebborn, other forgers might have used similar techniques. And future forgers literally reproduced the recipes that he put into play in his book. VEDANTAM: I'm really intrigued by the idea that the motivation for so many of these forger Hebborn included, is not money. So when you think about forgery and the effort and the time it takes to forge a masterpiece, clearly you would think that the value, the financial value, the forger is deriving is it has to be a big part of it. And I'm really intrigued by the idea that it's really a psychological motivation that comes first. CHARNEY: It's true. The reason that many forgers continue into a career of forgery is eventually they realize this is a source of income. But that initial motivation is this passive-aggressive revenge. However, there's a caveat here because the revenge is a private victory until you're caught. And a lot of these forgers have either intentionally made a mistake, perhaps subconsciously, in order to get caught or quite overtly outed themselves, as in the case of Eric Hebborn, who published a memoir and a how-to manual for future forgers. The reason is that they have to enjoy this revenge entirely in private until somebody discovers them. But the moment they are discovered, then all of a sudden, they are shown as a great artist, and they have publicly shamed the experts who they were out to shame when they set out. So this is the completion. The self-actualization is only when they're caught. A lot of these forgers actually inserted what one forger by the name of Tom Keating called time bombs. And these are intentionally inserted anachronisms that could be used if the forger chooses to announce that the work is a forgery, even if no one would otherwise believe him. What's an example? One of my favorite stories is a German forger named Lothar Malskat, who was a restorer of medieval frescoes just after the Second World War. And he was commissioned to restore frescoes in a church that had been damaged by Allied bombs. But when he got there, he found that the frescoes were so badly destroyed there was nothing he could do, and the photographs in the archives didn't show enough to reproduce it. But that didn't stop him. He decided to make his own medieval frescoes. And when they were revealed, it was a big national sensation, so much so that the German government printed 4 million postage stamps with a detail from the frescoes on it. But he didn't want this private victory. He wanted to get credit for what he had done. And nobody believed him. So he took the very unusual step of suing himself so that he could have the public forum of a courtroom in which to argue his case that he was the artist of these frescoes. VEDANTAM: He was both the prosecutor and the defendant. CHARNEY: He was. It's a very weird case in legal history. And still, nobody believed him until he pointed out two time bombs that he had inserted intentionally in case no one believed him. One was a turkey. Turkeys are indigenous to North America. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). CHARNEY: . . . And there would've been no turkeys in 13th-century Germany. And second was Marlene Dietrich, who's portrait was hidden in the background. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). CHARNEY: . . . And she definitely wasn't around in the 13th century. VEDANTAM: So this is so interesting because, of course, when you think about stories about swashbuckling Robin Hoods, the leaving behind a motif in your crime that you rob a bank and you leave behind a white glove or you rob something else and you leave behind the same white glove, the desire to leave a stamp on what it is that you have done changes this in some ways from the world of just straightforward crime, where you really want to cover your tracks completely to something quite different. CHARNEY: One of the issues here and the reason that forgers are quite happy to be caught in the end is that forgers tend to get very low sentences. Some of them don't even go to jail at all. From a public perspective, there is no fear of art forgers. If you go to a cocktail party and I whispered to you that this intriguing looking gentleman in the corner is a Ponzi scheme, right, you would say, I don't want anything to do with him. However, if I say he's an art forger, you'd be intrigued. You'd probably head straight over and start chatting. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) I would. CHARNEY: They're non-threatening, they're not scary, and there's something to admire in them. And they're these wonderful Dickensian characters who - you have a sense of them more as a prankster than a real criminal. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Is it possible, though, that Hebborn's desire for revenge and these psychological forces that were driving him kept him from accomplishing what might have actually been his life's work? CHARNEY: It's entirely possible, but on the other hand, I think that he would say that his life's work shifted to being the greatest art forger in history. And I think he makes - he could make a good case for that. And he's in good company. There are forgers in my book who include Michelangelo, Luca Giordano, Marcantonio Raimondi, very famous Renaissance artists who also dabbled in forgery, and he is up there in terms of his physical ability to reproduce another artist's style, the care that he put in both the concept of playing with the artists existing of her and reproducing the materials in an accurate way. He is a genius, but he's a genius at art forgery, and I don't think it panned out as a genius of original artistry. VEDANTAM: Noah Charney, I want to thank you for talking with me today. This has been a pleasure. CHARNEY: Thanks for having me.

I've asked myself why I find the story of Eric Hebborn so compelling. He was a criminal, but I think of him as a Robin Hood-type criminal. Part of it is because, as Noah Charney said, art crime doesn't disturb us. In fact, as Denis Leary's detective character in the 1999 movie \"The Thomas Crown Affair\" says, the stakes for art crime are pretty low unless you're a member of the 1 percent. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR\")DENIS LEARY: (As Michael McCann) The week before I met you, I nailed two crooked real estate agents and a guy who was beating his kids to death. So if some Houdini wants to snatch a couple swirls of paint that are really only important to some very silly rich people, I don't really give a damn. VEDANTAM: But there's another reason Hebborn is a compelling figure. Most of us don't understand the world of art, and we have the vague suspicion that people who claim to know what they're talking about are faking it. So, Hebborn wasn't just making a fast buck. He was waging a populist war. I sometimes feel this way about people who talk about a bottle of wine that has a hint of briny oyster shell riding the Lacey Moose. That's an actual quote from a recent wine review. Psychological studies show that when you pour cheap wine from an expensive bottle, wine aficionados say, that wine has flavors of lightly toasted brioche, spun honey and glazed apricot. Baba Shiv is a marketing professor at Stanford. He recently invited wine connoisseurs to a blind taste test. They refused to show up. Why did they refuse to come? SHIV: You have someone who is in a vineyard and supposed to be an expert in tasting wine, and now if I invite them over here and we find out that they're no different than the novices, then there goes the reputation in a way. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: OK, so that totally confirms my view that these connoisseurs weren't really experts. But here's where the science gets in the way of a nice theory. Something happened in Baba Shiv's wine experiment that shook my populist sensibilities. The researchers put volunteers in a brain scanner, gave them different wines. These were occasional wine drinkers, not experts. Some wines from $5 bottles were said to be from a $45 bottle. Other wines from a $90 bottle was said to be from a $10 bottle. The volunteers said that wine from the more expensive bottles tasted better compared to the same wine poured from a supposedly cheap bottle. All right, score one for the populist. The wine drinkers were fooled. But here's where it gets complicated. The researchers examined the brain scans of the volunteers. SHIV: So what we found essentially is that the area of the brain that codes for pleasure, which is the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, this is the area of the brain that codes for pleasure in real time and has been documented in other studies. And what we found, essentially, was that this area of the brain that codes for pleasure in real time shows greater activation when the brain thinks it is taking a higher-priced wine than when the brain thinks it is tasting a lower-priced wine. VEDANTAM: The volunteers, in other words, weren't merely saying the wine from the expensive bottle tasted better because they thought that's what they were supposed to say. The volunteers actually did experience the wine differently. It tasted better. SHIV: If you have expectations about how much pleasure you're going to derive from, let us say, wine, your expectations actually turn into reality. VEDANTAM: The difference between a $200 bottle of wine and a bottle that cost $8. 99 is only partly about the wine. If paying more for a bottle of wine makes you want to save it for a special occasion, share it with good friends over a meal, savor it, then yes, that bottle of wine will taste better. It's exactly the same with art. Forgers show us that experts can be fooled, but they also miss something important. The value of a painting is only partly about the painting itself. When you look at a masterpiece, you are looking at paint on canvas, but that isn't all you're doing. You're thinking about Monet's hand holding the paintbrush. You're thinking about history, the passage of time. The meaning of the painting isn't just what's on the canvas. It's what you bring to it. When Hebborn's preparatory drawings were revealed to be forgeries, the drawings didn't change, but something did change in our mind. Instead of making us think about history and time, the drawings were now merely clever. They stopped being masterpieces. HIDDEN BRAIN is produced by Kara McGuirk-Alison and Maggie Penman.

VEDANTAM: I wonder if you could just walk me through these two drawings that I'm looking at in the book here. I'm seeing the original on my left-hand side, and I'm seeing Hebborn's preparatory drawing for this work on the right. What am I seeing here in Anthony van Dyck's \"Crowning With Thorns? \" CHARNEY: In the original painting, which was finished around 1620, is an oil on canvas. It's a substantial size, and it shows Christ having the crown of thorns lowered on him as he's bound. And he's surrounded by people who would have been his torturers. And he seems resigned to his fate. And it's very beautiful, it's very glossy. There's a brilliant use of oil paints. You can have an almost sculptural quality to Christ's body. VEDANTAM: I'm seeing his face, Christ's face, turned to the right from our perspective. I'm seeing there's a figure in the foreground in the right-hand side of the painting who's reaching out and touching Christ on his left arm. And there's a host of figures in the background who are doing various things. CHARNEY: Right. There are a number of figures - there's one, two, three, four, five figures in the background, including people peering in through a grated window in the back to spy on what's happening. And Christ is seated quite comfortably facing front out to the viewer. Now, when we turn to the preparatory drawing, the positioning of the figures and the number of the figures is different, but this is entirely normal. Artists, when they're coming up with the concept, or inventione, of the artwork, will do various sketches to try to get a composition that they like. And the composition of this preparatory drawing is actually in the shape of an S. It's something called figura serpentinata, which was described by Michelangelo as the most beautiful form in nature. The flickering of a candle flame is supposed to be the positioning of the bodies that is the most elegant. And that's something that we see here in Eric Hebborn's forgery of a van Dyck drawing. And it's normal to have sketches that look somewhat different from the finished product. In fact, it would be suspicious if there was a drawing that looked exactly like the finished product. But here you have this idea. Christ is leaning far to the side, he's being physically supported by one of his executioners as another one pushes the crown of thorns more violently onto his head. It's more dynamic, and there's more movement to it, more diagonals. And it essentially looks like an initial concept that he decided not to follow through with for this drawing. It's very clever because it's not hitting you over the head with the fact that this must be preparatory drawing. VEDANTAM: But what I find really, really clever about this was that Hebborn was leaving me to complete his con. And there's two things that I found really intriguing there from a psychological perspective. One, when Hebborn is basically presenting a preparatory drawing that looks actually quite different from the finished drawing, he's allowing the expert to connect the dots. That is psychologically very clever because he's taking advantage of the fact the expert has vanity and wants to make these connections. And the best con game is where the mark essentially executes the con for you. That's one of the things he was doing. But the second thing was, by so doing, he's also demonstrating to himself that the expert really is not an expert. And he's demonstrating for his own psychological satisfaction that this world of the art expert is a sham world. CHARNEY: It's true. It's very clever on his part. And the majority of successful forgers use some variation on the theme that you describe. They set a trap without being too specific and allow the experts to dive headfirst into it and enthusiastically authenticate the work because it feels to them like a great discovery that they are making personally. It feels like a triumph. And once an expert goes out on a limb and says this is authentic, it is very hard for them to go back on it. So they wind up tangling themselves in this net that's been laid out by the forger. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: What struck me as I was reading this chapter was the extraordinary attention to detail and the effort that Hebborn put in to mastering the techniques needed to pass off his works as real. CHARNEY: Well, Hebborn was particularly meticulous. Out of all the forgers I looked at, he was really the one who was the most passionate as an art historian and as a researcher and was focused on getting the materials correct whenever he could. Getting the technique right is something that you can do essentially by practice. You can practice over and over again, and you could come up with a signature that looks almost identical to mine. And if you practice it enough, you can do it with a fluidity that looks authentic. Getting the materials correct is much harder, and it's more expensive. It is also not strictly necessary because most forgers that I looked got the style just about right. They had a very clever provenance trap that was the confidence trick that passed off the object. And they didn't really need to get the materials correct because it's not normal for objects to be forensically tested. Unless some red flag is raised stylistically or in terms of the object's history, nobody does forensic testing. This is part of a residual gentleman's agreement in the art trade that dates back hundreds of years, that if an expert says it's good. . . VEDANTAM: . . . It's good. CHARNEY: Then it's good. There really has to be something very wrong for them to forensically test it. VEDANTAM: Or maybe the experts disagree. CHARNEY: Or if the experts disagree - if they can't reach a consensus, then the tiebreaker is broken by scientific testing. These days, it doesn't have to be the case. Forensic testing is neither particularly expensive nor is it invasive necessarily into the object. But Hebborn took that level of detail because he was a perfectionist, because he loved what he was doing and was very passionate about it and because I think he wanted to genuinely feel that he was doing exactly what the old masters were doing. And he is the only one of all the artists I looked at - all the art forgers I looked at - who I think was at a similar level to the people he was forging. VEDANTAM: When you look at the work that he did, where he basically broke down the different colors that the masters were using, how did he actually find this out? I mean, he was spending enormous amounts of time being a scholar - not just being a forger but being a scholar. He couldn't have done the forgeries if he hadn't done the scholarship. CHARNEY: He had a bent as a chemist. And he did analyses of the pigments used by different artists. VEDANTAM: It is so interesting that he spent so much time thinking about his technique but also thinking about what he needed to do to himself in order to be able to pull off these forgeries. One of the things you talk about in this book is how he achieved this fluidity of line, that he was able to forge these things in a way that looked tossed off. What did he do? CHARNEY: Well, he's a real character. And he volunteered all of his secrets because he was looking for notoriety. And he wrote a book called \"The Art Forger's Handbook,\" which incidentally has been found in the studio of many an art forger arrested since it came out. And one of his tricks was to get drunk. He would get drunk while he was making the drawings, and it would achieve a certain fluidity of line and body. And in the process, he would not overthink things. And when I was giving you the example of if you tried to forge my signature, you wouldn't have the mental or physical capacity, if you drink enough, to be too painstaking about it. And a painstaking line is a giveaway to an expert that something funny's going on. He would do dozens of sketches to prepare the fluidity of line he was after. But then he would start drinking heavily and then do his sketches as well in order to ensure that he wouldn't overthink things. VEDANTAM: So his forgeries were actually committed while he was under the influence of alcohol? CHARNEY: Absolutely. And he volunteers this. He actually has step-by-step recipes for how he made his forgeries of paintings and drawings in his book. And that's one of the ways we can work backwards and see, well, if these were the techniques employed by Hebborn, other forgers might have used similar techniques. And future forgers literally reproduced the recipes that he put into play in his book. VEDANTAM: I'm really intrigued by the idea that the motivation for so many of these forger Hebborn included, is not money. So when you think about forgery and the effort and the time it takes to forge a masterpiece, clearly you would think that the value, the financial value, the forger is deriving is it has to be a big part of it. And I'm really intrigued by the idea that it's really a psychological motivation that comes first. CHARNEY: It's true. The reason that many forgers continue into a career of forgery is eventually they realize this is a source of income. But that initial motivation is this passive-aggressive revenge. However, there's a caveat here because the revenge is a private victory until you're caught. And a lot of these forgers have either intentionally made a mistake, perhaps subconsciously, in order to get caught or quite overtly outed themselves, as in the case of Eric Hebborn, who published a memoir and a how-to manual for future forgers. The reason is that they have to enjoy this revenge entirely in private until somebody discovers them. But the moment they are discovered, then all of a sudden, they are shown as a great artist, and they have publicly shamed the experts who they were out to shame when they set out. So this is the completion. The self-actualization is only when they're caught. A lot of these forgers actually inserted what one forger by the name of Tom Keating called time bombs. And these are intentionally inserted anachronisms that could be used if the forger chooses to announce that the work is a forgery, even if no one would otherwise believe him. What's an example? One of my favorite stories is a German forger named Lothar Malskat, who was a restorer of medieval frescoes just after the Second World War. And he was commissioned to restore frescoes in a church that had been damaged by Allied bombs. But when he got there, he found that the frescoes were so badly destroyed there was nothing he could do, and the photographs in the archives didn't show enough to reproduce it. But that didn't stop him. He decided to make his own medieval frescoes. And when they were revealed, it was a big national sensation, so much so that the German government printed 4 million postage stamps with a detail from the frescoes on it. But he didn't want this private victory. He wanted to get credit for what he had done. And nobody believed him. So he took the very unusual step of suing himself so that he could have the public forum of a courtroom in which to argue his case that he was the artist of these frescoes. VEDANTAM: He was both the prosecutor and the defendant. CHARNEY: He was. It's a very weird case in legal history. And still, nobody believed him until he pointed out two time bombs that he had inserted intentionally in case no one believed him. One was a turkey. Turkeys are indigenous to North America. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). CHARNEY: . . . And there would've been no turkeys in 13th-century Germany. And second was Marlene Dietrich, who's portrait was hidden in the background. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). CHARNEY: . . . And she definitely wasn't around in the 13th century. VEDANTAM: So this is so interesting because, of course, when you think about stories about swashbuckling Robin Hoods, the leaving behind a motif in your crime that you rob a bank and you leave behind a white glove or you rob something else and you leave behind the same white glove, the desire to leave a stamp on what it is that you have done changes this in some ways from the world of just straightforward crime, where you really want to cover your tracks completely to something quite different. CHARNEY: One of the issues here and the reason that forgers are quite happy to be caught in the end is that forgers tend to get very low sentences. Some of them don't even go to jail at all. From a public perspective, there is no fear of art forgers. If you go to a cocktail party and I whispered to you that this intriguing looking gentleman in the corner is a Ponzi scheme, right, you would say, I don't want anything to do with him. However, if I say he's an art forger, you'd be intrigued. You'd probably head straight over and start chatting. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) I would. CHARNEY: They're non-threatening, they're not scary, and there's something to admire in them. And they're these wonderful Dickensian characters who - you have a sense of them more as a prankster than a real criminal. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Is it possible, though, that Hebborn's desire for revenge and these psychological forces that were driving him kept him from accomplishing what might have actually been his life's work? CHARNEY: It's entirely possible, but on the other hand, I think that he would say that his life's work shifted to being the greatest art forger in history. And I think he makes - he could make a good case for that. And he's in good company. There are forgers in my book who include Michelangelo, Luca Giordano, Marcantonio Raimondi, very famous Renaissance artists who also dabbled in forgery, and he is up there in terms of his physical ability to reproduce another artist's style, the care that he put in both the concept of playing with the artists existing of her and reproducing the materials in an accurate way. He is a genius, but he's a genius at art forgery, and I don't think it panned out as a genius of original artistry. VEDANTAM: Noah Charney, I want to thank you for talking with me today. This has been a pleasure. CHARNEY: Thanks for having me.

I've asked myself why I find the story of Eric Hebborn so compelling. He was a criminal, but I think of him as a Robin Hood-type criminal. Part of it is because, as Noah Charney said, art crime doesn't disturb us. In fact, as Denis Leary's detective character in the 1999 movie \"The Thomas Crown Affair\" says, the stakes for art crime are pretty low unless you're a member of the 1 percent. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR\") DENIS LEARY: (As Michael McCann) The week before I met you, I nailed two crooked real estate agents and a guy who was beating his kids to death. So if some Houdini wants to snatch a couple swirls of paint that are really only important to some very silly rich people, I don't really give a damn. VEDANTAM: But there's another reason Hebborn is a compelling figure. Most of us don't understand the world of art, and we have the vague suspicion that people who claim to know what they're talking about are faking it. So, Hebborn wasn't just making a fast buck. He was waging a populist war. I sometimes feel this way about people who talk about a bottle of wine that has a hint of briny oyster shell riding the Lacey Moose. That's an actual quote from a recent wine review. Psychological studies show that when you pour cheap wine from an expensive bottle, wine aficionados say, that wine has flavors of lightly toasted brioche, spun honey and glazed apricot. Baba Shiv is a marketing professor at Stanford. He recently invited wine connoisseurs to a blind taste test. They refused to show up. Why did they refuse to come? SHIV: You have someone who is in a vineyard and supposed to be an expert in tasting wine, and now if I invite them over here and we find out that they're no different than the novices, then there goes the reputation in a way. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: OK, so that totally confirms my view that these connoisseurs weren't really experts. But here's where the science gets in the way of a nice theory. Something happened in Baba Shiv's wine experiment that shook my populist sensibilities. The researchers put volunteers in a brain scanner, gave them different wines. These were occasional wine drinkers, not experts. Some wines from $5 bottles were said to be from a $45 bottle. Other wines from a $90 bottle was said to be from a $10 bottle. The volunteers said that wine from the more expensive bottles tasted better compared to the same wine poured from a supposedly cheap bottle. All right, score one for the populist. The wine drinkers were fooled. But here's where it gets complicated. The researchers examined the brain scans of the volunteers. SHIV: So what we found essentially is that the area of the brain that codes for pleasure, which is the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, this is the area of the brain that codes for pleasure in real time and has been documented in other studies. And what we found, essentially, was that this area of the brain that codes for pleasure in real time shows greater activation when the brain thinks it is taking a higher-priced wine than when the brain thinks it is tasting a lower-priced wine. VEDANTAM: The volunteers, in other words, weren't merely saying the wine from the expensive bottle tasted better because they thought that's what they were supposed to say. The volunteers actually did experience the wine differently. It tasted better. SHIV: If you have expectations about how much pleasure you're going to derive from, let us say, wine, your expectations actually turn into reality. VEDANTAM: The difference between a $200 bottle of wine and a bottle that cost $8. 99 is only partly about the wine. If paying more for a bottle of wine makes you want to save it for a special occasion, share it with good friends over a meal, savor it, then yes, that bottle of wine will taste better. It's exactly the same with art. Forgers show us that experts can be fooled, but they also miss something important. The value of a painting is only partly about the painting itself. When you look at a masterpiece, you are looking at paint on canvas, but that isn't all you're doing. You're thinking about Monet's hand holding the paintbrush. You're thinking about history, the passage of time. The meaning of the painting isn't just what's on the canvas. It's what you bring to it. When Hebborn's preparatory drawings were revealed to be forgeries, the drawings didn't change, but something did change in our mind. Instead of making us think about history and time, the drawings were now merely clever. They stopped being masterpieces. HIDDEN BRAIN is produced by Kara McGuirk-Alison and Maggie Penman.

The report states that up until 2003, Iran had a program to develop what the nuclear watchdog describes as a nuclear explosive device. And joining me to discuss this is NPR's science correspondent Geoff Brumfiel. Hi. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Hi there. SIEGEL: This summer, the U. S. and other world powers entered into a deal with Iran to put limits on its nuclear program and to keep it peaceful in exchange for lifting sanctions. Now we have a report saying that the Iranians were, at one point, developing a bomb. This does not derail the deal. Why is that? BRUMFIEL: Well, looking over Iran's past nuclear activities was always part of the deal. For many years now, there's been a lot of evidence that Iran had a nuclear weapons program. The IAEA wanted Iran to answer questions about that, and under the deal, Iran agreed to do that. So now the International Atomic Energy Agency's board of governors is going to have to decide whether to close the file based on what the IAEA has found and what Iran did. And that's something, we should say, that Iran really wants. In fact, Iran has said that it's not going to carry out certain activities, such as moving some of its uranium stockpile out of the country, until this file on its past nuclear weapons work is closed. SIEGEL: So what's in the report? BRUMFIEL: Well, the report details a lot of work done by Iran on a lot of different aspects of getting a nuclear weapon, everything from sort of manufacturing some prototypes of the uranium core for the bomb. I should say these are not actual, you know, bomb pieces, but they're sort of templates that Iran could use and also work to put that on a missile so that they could deliver it. This, I should say, was in the R and D phase. It was pretty extensive, though. They were making calculations. They were doing simulations on computers. They were even doing some physical tests with explosives. The IAEA, as we've just said, conclude that the bulk of this program ended in 2003, but there was still sporadic work going on until 2009. SIEGEL: Just to clarify, Geoff, did the IAEA have people in Iran talking to primary sources, or were they getting this information from foreign intelligence agencies? BRUMFIEL: It's a combination of both. So the IAEA has received information from what it calls member states. That would be foreign intelligent agencies like the U. S. has. But also, as part of this nuclear deal, the IAEA actually went to Iran. It carried out some inspections, and it asked the Iranians about the - this past work. SIEGEL: Now that it has put out this report - the IAEA has - what are the Iranians saying about it? BRUMFIEL: Well, right. So the Iranians were asked to explain themselves, and as the IAEA lays out in this report, they basically deny everything. They say some of this explosive work was done for the oil industry. Other of it was done to develop conventional munitions for their military. And in the report, the IAEA basically says, hey, we don't believe you guys. I mean, here's your side of the story, but we don't believe that you had a weapons program. SIEGEL: Well, does the fact that the Iranians don't own up to what the IAEA has found - does that pose problems for the Iran deal, for the nuclear deal? BRUMFIEL: I think the critics of the deal will definitely use this report as ammunition to point out, hey, you know, this is a sign that Iran is not a good-faith actor. On the other hand, the whole point of this deal is that we don't trust Iran, that, you know, we want inspectors to go in and look at these sites all across Iran and make sure that they're not doing nuclear work and - or, well, work to develop a nuclear weapon. And so I think that this report also shows that the inspectors that are going to be going into Iran really have the teeth to do what they need to do. SIEGEL: NPR's Geoff Brumfiel, thank you. BRUMFIEL: Thank you very much. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  Today, the International Atomic Energy Agency released a report which details past work by Iran to get a nuclear weapon. The report states that up until 2003, Iran had a program to develop what the nuclear watchdog describes as a nuclear explosive device. And joining me to discuss this is NPR's science correspondent Geoff Brumfiel. Hi. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Hi there. SIEGEL: This summer, the U. S. and other world powers entered into a deal with Iran to put limits on its nuclear program and to keep it peaceful in exchange for lifting sanctions. Now we have a report saying that the Iranians were, at one point, developing a bomb. This does not derail the deal. Why is that? BRUMFIEL: Well, looking over Iran's past nuclear activities was always part of the deal. For many years now, there's been a lot of evidence that Iran had a nuclear weapons program. The IAEA wanted Iran to answer questions about that, and under the deal, Iran agreed to do that. So now the International Atomic Energy Agency's board of governors is going to have to decide whether to close the file based on what the IAEA has found and what Iran did. And that's something, we should say, that Iran really wants. In fact, Iran has said that it's not going to carry out certain activities, such as moving some of its uranium stockpile out of the country, until this file on its past nuclear weapons work is closed. SIEGEL: So what's in the report? BRUMFIEL: Well, the report details a lot of work done by Iran on a lot of different aspects of getting a nuclear weapon, everything from sort of manufacturing some prototypes of the uranium core for the bomb. I should say these are not actual, you know, bomb pieces, but they're sort of templates that Iran could use and also work to put that on a missile so that they could deliver it. This, I should say, was in the R and D phase. It was pretty extensive, though. They were making calculations. They were doing simulations on computers. They were even doing some physical tests with explosives. The IAEA, as we've just said, conclude that the bulk of this program ended in 2003, but there was still sporadic work going on until 2009. SIEGEL: Just to clarify, Geoff, did the IAEA have people in Iran talking to primary sources, or were they getting this information from foreign intelligence agencies? BRUMFIEL: It's a combination of both. So the IAEA has received information from what it calls member states. That would be foreign intelligent agencies like the U. S. has. But also, as part of this nuclear deal, the IAEA actually went to Iran. It carried out some inspections, and it asked the Iranians about the - this past work. SIEGEL: Now that it has put out this report - the IAEA has - what are the Iranians saying about it? BRUMFIEL: Well, right. So the Iranians were asked to explain themselves, and as the IAEA lays out in this report, they basically deny everything. They say some of this explosive work was done for the oil industry. Other of it was done to develop conventional munitions for their military. And in the report, the IAEA basically says, hey, we don't believe you guys. I mean, here's your side of the story, but we don't believe that you had a weapons program. SIEGEL: Well, does the fact that the Iranians don't own up to what the IAEA has found - does that pose problems for the Iran deal, for the nuclear deal? BRUMFIEL: I think the critics of the deal will definitely use this report as ammunition to point out, hey, you know, this is a sign that Iran is not a good-faith actor. On the other hand, the whole point of this deal is that we don't trust Iran, that, you know, we want inspectors to go in and look at these sites all across Iran and make sure that they're not doing nuclear work and - or, well, work to develop a nuclear weapon. And so I think that this report also shows that the inspectors that are going to be going into Iran really have the teeth to do what they need to do. SIEGEL: NPR's Geoff Brumfiel, thank you.

SIMON: During your second term in the House, you became passionate about climate change, I think it's safe to say. What convinced you this was a pressing issue? INGLIS: Well, it was really the love of my son that started it. You know, I was my first six years in Congress saying that climate change was hooey, Al Gore's imagination. I hadn't looked into it at all. All I knew was he was for it, and therefore, I was against it. But I was out of Congress for six years and then ran again in '04. My son was voting for the first time. And so he came to me and said, dad, I'll vote for you. But you're going to clean up your act on the environment. So that was the first of three steps. Second step was going to Antarctica and seeing the evidence in the ice core drillings. Third step was really a spiritual awakening, another science community trip, Great Barrier Reef, snorkeling with an Aussie climate scientist. And I found it rather inspiring. So I came home and introduced the Raise Wages, Cut Carbon Act of 2009 - probably not the best idea in the midst of the Great Recession, in perhaps the reddest district in the reddest state in the nation. SIMON: What arguments do you make to Republican conservatives about climate that you think might be most resonant? INGLIS: What we talk about is being climate realists and energy optimists. We should be realistic about the science. And then let's also be energy optimists, realize the power of free enterprise to fix this problem. If we would just put the cost on the fuels, then the free enterprise system would sort this out. And also, at the same time, we should eliminate all subsidies for all fuels. Then the innovation that would come from the free enterprise system would be exciting. SIMON: I think a lot of Americans would say, well, of course we know the price of energy. It's the price we pay for a tank of gas. INGLIS: No, there are hidden costs, of course. It's - basically what economists say is what you need to do is internalize the negative externalities, reveal those hidden costs. Make it so that at the meter, at the pump, we see the true cost. SIMON: Wouldn't the established energy companies go nuts? INGLIS: It depends on who they are, of course. If it's a natural gas company or a company that has significant natural gas assets, they'd be excited about this if they thought it was going to be - really going to happen. That's our challenge at republicen. org, is convincing particularly some natural gas folks that really, this could happen, that the fossil fuels could become accountable. And, of course, when that happens, coal would fall much faster to the competitive pressure of natural gas. And the natural gas companies would make a lot more money off of their product. Is it the end-all? No, it isn't. Natural gas still has CO2 emissions. But it's 50 percent less emissions than coal. So that's an example of how fixing the economics would then fix the environmental consequence. SIMON: Mr. Inglis, as you survey this field of Republican candidates for president, do you see and hear any who express your viewpoint on the climate change? INGLIS: It's been helpful to hear what John Kasich has said on the topic. Jeb Bush has had some fairly positive things to say. I think even the exchange between Marco Rubio and Chris Christie in one of the debates was helpful in that they were trying to move away from the label of the denier. And so what we think would be effective is helping them to change the question. Currently, if a Republican is asked in front of a very conservative crowd, do you believe in climate change or, is it a fact, an affirmative answer ostracizes them from the audience. But if we can phrase that question differently - can free enterprise solve climate change? - then they can answer that question in the affirmative in front of the reddist-meat crowd because of course we conservatives believe that free enterprise can solve problems you don't even have.

JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Most visitors go to the Isle of Skye for the scenery or the hiking or maybe a tipple of Talisker straight from the distillery - not paleontologist Stephen Brusatte. He goes in search of dinosaur fossils. And last April, he struck paleontological gold. STEPHEN BRUSATTE: What we found is the biggest dinosaur site that's ever been found in Scotland. PALCA: It was a huge collection of dinosaur footprints. Brusatte is an American who now works at the University of Edinburgh. I spoke with him by phone from his office there. Brusatte says he and his colleagues almost missed the footprints. They'd gone to a spot along the north coast of Skye, where they'd gotten a tip there were some fossils to be found.

BRUSATTE: We just normally don't think of dinosaurs as animals that are frolicking around in the water like that. We think of them as these animals thundering across the land. But these dinosaurs here were very much at home near the water and even in the water.

But yesterday, a team of scientists unveiled something new that took a lot of people here by surprise. NPR's Christopher Joyce is here in Paris covering the summit with me and has this report. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Since the 1960s, scientists have tracked what's been an almost inexorable rise in the amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. CO2 is the main greenhouse gas that causes warming, so more CO2 means more warming. Last year, however, that rise apparently flattened out, and this year, CO2 emissions around the world actually dipped. Climate scientist Rob Jackson from Stanford University says it's a small dip - less than 1 percent - but it's significant. ROB JACKSON: I was surprised by the result. Previously, we've only seen this sort of thing when global economies were in crisis. That's the most exciting piece of this puzzle. We're seeing a flattening or a decline in emissions at a time when the global economy is still growing robustly. JOYCE: Usually when economies are doing well, they're using more energy and putting out more CO2. Jackson and an international team used data from the Global Carbon Project, which tracks worldwide CO2 emissions. Climate scientist Corinne Le Quere from the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom says there's one main reason for the good news. CORINNE LE QUERE: It's mostly down to China's use of coal. JOYCE: China burns an enormous amount of coal, and that creates an enormous amount of CO2. LE QUERE: And now China's economic growth has slowed down. They have done massive measures to deal with their problem of air pollution. And all of a sudden, well, it looks like their use of coal in 2015 has actually gone down. JOYCE: That's lowered China's CO2 emissions a startling 4 percent this year. Worldwide, a total decline is less than that - less than 1 percent. It's not much, but it reverses a relentless increase over the past few years. Writing in the journal Nature Climate Science, the team also notes that the emissions from Western Europe and the U. S. have also flattened out. That's largely due to a lot more solar and wind power and natural gas replacing coal in the U. S. But Le Quere says it's China, the world's biggest source of CO2, that will drive the ups and downs in the admissions numbers for the world. And she says people should not expect the downturn to last. LE QUERE: From now, whether the emissions are going to pick up again in China, I certainly think they will. JOYCE: Because, she says, China's economy will probably revive. Moreover, the researchers say the findings are based on emissions reports from China, which have not always been accurate. But John Holdren, the science adviser to the White House, says whether the decline is a blip or more permanent, it suggests that a real decline in emissions is within reach. JOHN HOLDREN: The global total should absolutely be going down after 2020. So what we are seeing now is a good sign, and it should not be regarded as cause for false hope. It should be regarded as cause for real hope that the world is turning this around. But we'll need to do much more. JOYCE: That's because India will soon be the world's biggest source of CO2 instead of China, as it embraces coal to bring electricity to hundreds of millions of its citizens.

Those are two different views of an investigation being carried out by Republican Lamar Smith. He is chairman of the House Science Committee in Congress. And he's investigating a major study on climate change by government researchers. He says he's performing his oversight duties as a lawmaker. But NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports that today, some 600 scientists and engineers, including former employees of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - or NOAA - are sending letters to the head of that agency, telling her to keep fighting against political interference in science. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: All of this started in June, when the prestigious journal Science published a study on climate change that was big news. NPR covered it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)AUDIE CORNISH: Now a revision on how much the planet has been warming. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The study showed there had been no slowdown or pause in warming over the last couple decades, as researchers had previously thought. The so-called global warming hiatus had been a favorite talking point for conservatives who doubt the scientific consensus on climate change. But NOAA researcher Tom Karl told NPR. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)TOM KARL: We think the data no longer supports the notion of having a hiatus. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That got the attention of Lamar Smith. He's a Republican from Texas who chairs the House Science Committee. LAMAR SMITH: I have a couple of concerns about the study. One, the timing is very suspicious, right before the climate meeting in Paris. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says whistleblowers have told him the study was rushed into publication. And he says it did not include satellite data. L. SMITH: They left out the gold standard when it comes to determining what the global temperature has been and by - therefore sort of cherry picking their data, it didn't seem to me to be a completely honest study. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And you don't think the normal, scientific peer review process that would take place at a high-profile journal like Science would flag something like cherry picking data? L. SMITH: No, I don't think that Science Magazine had access to a whistleblower like we did saying it had been rushed and had not been sufficiently peer-reviewed. And you know, Science Magazine may have its own bias. I don't know. Maybe they wanted to rush it out before the Paris summit as well. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Science is published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. It's the world's largest multidisciplinary science society. Jesse Smith is an editor there. He says satellite data is irrelevant. This study dealt with sea surface temperature measurements from ships and buoys. And, he says, the review process took longer than normal. JESSE SMITH: We subjected the paper to even more scrutiny than we subject most papers to. GREENFIELDBOYCE: So if someone's going around saying that your journal is, like, shoddy and missing obvious points and, like, rushing things - I mean, do you take this personally at all? J. SMITH: No. It's misguided and uninformed. So I can't really take it personally. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The executive publisher of Science and the head of the association is Rush Holt. He's a physicist who spent over a decade in the House of Representatives as a Democrat from New Jersey. RUSH HOLT: The scientific process is modern civilization's best means for arriving at reliable truth. And that process should be allowed to work without political meddling. GREENFIELDBOYCE: What really bugged him was that Smith had issued a subpoena for tons of documents, including scientists' emails. HOLT: You don't issue subpoenas to scientists for doing their conscientious work. GREENFIELDBOYCE: You've served in Congress. Do you think issuing subpoenas for something like this is an abuse of power? HOLT: It's certainly an abuse of subpoenas. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The subpoena is why Jim Buizer decided to sign the new letter that urges NOAA's administrator to keep protecting scientists from politics. Buizer is a climate expert who used to work for NOAA. Now he's at the University of Arizona. He says in the past, emails taken out of context have been used to cast doubt on the work of climate researchers. JIM BUIZER: We don't have anything to hide. It's just that people don't understand how we work. GREENFIELDBOYCE: A rule change earlier this year made it easier for the House science chair to issue subpoenas. Andrew Rosenberg at the Union of Concerned Scientists worries that more will be coming. ANDREW ROSENBERG: This one is to investigate scientists who produced a result he doesn't like. I think what he's doing is bullying. I think it's intimidation tactics. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Asked if he was bullying scientists, Lamar Smith says he is responsible for conducting oversight. L. SMITH: And when I see government agencies using taxpayers' dollars and not coming up with studies that I think are based upon good data and good evidence and good science, then I think not only do the people have a right to know that. Their representatives in Congress have a right to know that as well. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says NOAA is resisting his request for information. L. SMITH: Which, of course, would naturally make people suspicious. GREENFIELDBOYCE: NOAA's spokesperson, Ciaran Clayton, says all of the study's data is public and on the agency's website. The scientists who did the study twice met with committee staffers to answer questions. CIARAN CLAYTON: We feel we've provided all the information that the committee needs to understand the issue. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Smith's latest request for NOAA documents says his first priority isn't communications from scientists but certain other NOAA staffers. He wants those documents by December 15. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  So is it oversight, or is it harassment? Those are two different views of an investigation being carried out by Republican Lamar Smith. He is chairman of the House Science Committee in Congress. And he's investigating a major study on climate change by government researchers. He says he's performing his oversight duties as a lawmaker. But NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports that today, some 600 scientists and engineers, including former employees of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - or NOAA - are sending letters to the head of that agency, telling her to keep fighting against political interference in science. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: All of this started in June, when the prestigious journal Science published a study on climate change that was big news. NPR covered it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) AUDIE CORNISH: Now a revision on how much the planet has been warming. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The study showed there had been no slowdown or pause in warming over the last couple decades, as researchers had previously thought. The so-called global warming hiatus had been a favorite talking point for conservatives who doubt the scientific consensus on climate change. But NOAA researcher Tom Karl told NPR. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) TOM KARL: We think the data no longer supports the notion of having a hiatus. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That got the attention of Lamar Smith. He's a Republican from Texas who chairs the House Science Committee. LAMAR SMITH: I have a couple of concerns about the study. One, the timing is very suspicious, right before the climate meeting in Paris. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says whistleblowers have told him the study was rushed into publication. And he says it did not include satellite data. L. SMITH: They left out the gold standard when it comes to determining what the global temperature has been and by - therefore sort of cherry picking their data, it didn't seem to me to be a completely honest study. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And you don't think the normal, scientific peer review process that would take place at a high-profile journal like Science would flag something like cherry picking data? L. SMITH: No, I don't think that Science Magazine had access to a whistleblower like we did saying it had been rushed and had not been sufficiently peer-reviewed. And you know, Science Magazine may have its own bias. I don't know. Maybe they wanted to rush it out before the Paris summit as well. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Science is published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. It's the world's largest multidisciplinary science society. Jesse Smith is an editor there. He says satellite data is irrelevant. This study dealt with sea surface temperature measurements from ships and buoys. And, he says, the review process took longer than normal. JESSE SMITH: We subjected the paper to even more scrutiny than we subject most papers to. GREENFIELDBOYCE: So if someone's going around saying that your journal is, like, shoddy and missing obvious points and, like, rushing things - I mean, do you take this personally at all? J. SMITH: No. It's misguided and uninformed. So I can't really take it personally. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The executive publisher of Science and the head of the association is Rush Holt. He's a physicist who spent over a decade in the House of Representatives as a Democrat from New Jersey. RUSH HOLT: The scientific process is modern civilization's best means for arriving at reliable truth. And that process should be allowed to work without political meddling. GREENFIELDBOYCE: What really bugged him was that Smith had issued a subpoena for tons of documents, including scientists' emails. HOLT: You don't issue subpoenas to scientists for doing their conscientious work. GREENFIELDBOYCE: You've served in Congress. Do you think issuing subpoenas for something like this is an abuse of power? HOLT: It's certainly an abuse of subpoenas. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The subpoena is why Jim Buizer decided to sign the new letter that urges NOAA's administrator to keep protecting scientists from politics. Buizer is a climate expert who used to work for NOAA. Now he's at the University of Arizona.

This episode has lots of jokes. Some people might find the jokes offensive. In fact, the thin line between being funny and being offensive is our theme today. If you're listening with young kids, you might want to save this for later. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)BILL BURR: I say a lot of absurd, over-the-top things because if people see a train wreck possibly coming, they're going to listen. VEDANTAM: Welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. On today's episode, I'm going to give you a special technique to peer into someone else's head. It's using humor - the joke. What we laugh at and what we don't laugh at tell us very important things about ourselves and about other people. BURR: You've got people in lab coats examining dick jokes (laughter). VEDANTAM: Comedian Bill Burr is here to help us explore why we laugh at jokes that push the boundaries. NPR's Elizabeth Blair joined me for that conversation. It's coming up soon. But first, I want to tell you about some research into what makes people laugh. ROBERT LYNCH: So it's called an implicit association test. VEDANTAM: This is Robert Lynch. He's an evolutionary anthropologist. He studies how traits passed down through evolution affect human behavior. He now works at the University of Missouri. LYNCH: Instead of asking, do you prefer blacks or do you prefer whites, or do you associate women more with career and men more with family or the reverse, you actually time them on how fast they categorize things on a keyboard. VEDANTAM: In the test he gave volunteers, he studied their associations on gender attitudes. What's interesting about these associations is that they're often unconscious or implicit. People aren't aware of them. Lynch also had the volunteers listen to jokes related to gender issues. The comic he chose - Bill Burr. BURR: Like, I dated this girl one time, she was, like, really into, like, women's issues. So we used to always have these dumbass arguments. So one time she came up to me and she goes, OK, explain this to me, Bill. Why does a guy make more an hour to do the exact same job, huh (ph)? I go, I'll tell you why. Because in the unlikely event that we're both on a Titanic and it starts to sink, for some (expletive) reason, you get to leave with the kids and I have to stay. Yeah, that's why I get the dollar more an hour. LYNCH: People laugh, but there's a big range. Some people didn't at all; some people almost falling out of their chairs. VEDANTAM: Now, if you asked people why they laughed or didn't, some people will tell you the joke was funny and others will tell you it wasn't. But Lynch thinks something else is going on. People's unconscious attitudes about gender were strongly correlated with whether they laughed or found the joke offensive. LYNCH: The take-home message is that people who associated female with family and males with career more strongly - had stereotypic or traditional gender preferences, it's called - tended to laugh more at that segment. VEDANTAM: The joke about men and women, in other words, is actually a test. If you watch the audience as Bill tells that joke, you can get a pretty good sense of what's going on in the mind of the person who laughs and the mind of the person who doesn't laugh. Lynch thinks there are strong evolutionary reasons people behave this way. In fact, he thinks humor itself may have evolved because it allows people to tell who belongs to their in-group and who doesn't. LYNCH: A lot of laughter is about taboo topics and things like that. So it's communicating something that we may not be so readily willing to admit, but we're communicating it to other people to find out if they share our preferences. And then if it doesn't work out, it was just a joke, you know. And so it's got this - it's kind of a coded message saying hey, are you part of my group? Are we in the same in-group? And by laughing at that joke, you're maybe, possibly signaling that yeah, I think women are more associated with family. I mean, that's a lame way to say it. But that's - you're implying that you have these stereotypical gender preferences, or traditional, I should say. VEDANTAM: So in some ways, I think what I'm hearing you say is that for a very long time, we actually have been using jokes as a way to understand what's happening inside other people's heads. The joke has been a brain scan for much of human history. LYNCH: That's a good way to put it, yeah. So unlike verbal communication, which is very susceptible to deception and lying and oh yeah, no, I believe what you believe, yeah I'm on your team, yeah I'm in the same group, laughter may be a way to honestly signal. There's always, in evolution, kind of a need to signal things honestly when there's - when they're so susceptible to deception. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: That's evolutionary anthropologist Robert Lynch. When we come back, Elizabeth Blair is going to join me. We'll talk about how comedians need to skirt the edge of what's offensive in order to be funny. Sometimes, that can mean going over the edge. BURR: There is no reason to hit a woman. And I was just like, really? I could give you, like, 17 right off the top of my head. VEDANTAM: Stay with us.

I was talking about this idea - the idea that jokes can act like a brain scanner - with Elizabeth Blair. Elizabeth is an arts reporter at NPR, and she covers the world of standup comedy. Elizabeth, welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. ELIZABETH BLAIR, BYLINE: Thanks, Shankar, it's great to be here. I mean, this is a topic that is dear to my heart because I love standup comedy, and I always thought there was a psychology - a science - behind why we laugh, why we wouldn't laugh. And I'm just very eager to hear more. VEDANTAM: And I remember we had this fantastic conversation a couple of months ago, Elizabeth. We were sitting on the fourth-floor patio at NPR, playing clips from our favorite comedians and not just listening to the comedians but listening to ourselves, listening when it is we laugh and when it is we don't. BLAIR: And why we laughed and why we didn't. And it wasn't always for the same reasons. VEDANTAM: No, it wasn't for the same reasons. I've actually brought in a couple of clips with me today, Elizabeth. I want you to listen less to the comedian and more to the audience's reactions to the comedian. The comedian is someone you're going to know - Louis CK. I'm sure you're a fan. BLAIR: He's a master. VEDANTAM: And what he does in this series of clips is he brings the audience very close to a place where they're going to be very uncomfortable. Here's Louis. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"OH MY GOD\")LOUIS CK: Everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts. Hopefully, the good thoughts win. For me, I always have both. I have, like, the thing I believe, the good thing. That's the thing I believe. And then there's this thing. And I don't believe it, but it is there. (LAUGHTER)CK: It's always this thing, and then this thing. It's become a category in my brain that I call of course, but maybe. (LAUGHTER)CK: I'll give you an example. OK, like of course - of course - children who have nut allergies need to be protected. Of course we have to segregate their food from nuts, have their medication available at all times. And anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies, of course. But maybe. . . (LAUGHTER)CK: . . . Maybe if touching a nut kills you, you're supposed to die. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: So I love this transition between the of course and the maybe, because the of course part is the part that we all agree - appropriate views, civilized views. And the maybe part is this part in our brain that sort of is lurking there, hidden below the surface. BLAIR: But we don't speak it. We don't say it because it's inappropriate. It's not polite. VEDANTAM: Exactly, and what I love is how Louis is sort of pulling us closer and closer and closer to that line. So what he does is he walks us even further to the line in this next clip. Here he is. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"OH MY GOD\")CK: Of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. (LAUGHTER)CK: Listen, listen - you all clapped for dead kids with the nuts. For kids dying from nuts, you applauded. So you're in this with me now, you understand? You don't get to cherry pick. (LAUGHTER)CK: Those kids did nothing to you. (APPLAUSE)BLAIR: And you can hear the audience. The nerves are there. They're not quite bellowing anymore. But there's some laughter, but there's some sort of, hm (ph), I don't know if I can laugh at this. VEDANTAM: I totally agree. And it's almost as if he has actually trapped them because he actually brought them in, initially with something that they basically said, okay, we'll walk with you. But now he's taken them to this really dark place. And what I like about this clip, Elizabeth, is that it reflects ideas that social scientists have talked about for more than a century. In 1905, Sigmund Freud wrote a book called \"Jokes And Their Relation To The Unconscious. \" And one of the points he makes is that jokes are usually violations of deeply-held taboos. So part of why a joke is funny is that it allows us to get up against this place in our brain that's really dark and really scary. BLAIR: Yeah, no, and that's one reason I love comedy. I almost feel like when I walk out of a great show, it forces me to be a little more authentic with my feelings. I might not express them, but, you know, let's face it. We all do have some really dark thoughts. That's human. VEDANTAM: Yeah, and it's interesting you say that Elizabeth, because in some ways Freud talks about this idea too - this idea that the joke actually offers us a mechanism for catharsis. It allows us to get out things in ourselves that we really want to have come out. BLAIR: I was in Montreal recently at the Just For Laughs Festival. And I actually asked Margaret Cho about this very thing - why do people laugh, or what is it about comedy that sort of releases something? And this is what she said. MARGARET CHO: It's kind of like they're laughing out of fear because, (laughter) like, they can't believe that you said it. Like, it's kind of a fear. But it's also, like, that you're laughing because somebody is actually playing with fire and that this may erupt into something incredibly explosive. VEDANTAM: So here's where I might push back just a bit, Elizabeth. I came by some new research published recently in one of the social science journals. It was work by Peter McGraw. He's a behavioral scientist at the University of Colorado. And he makes the argument that really, for a joke to work, yes, it has to violate a taboo. It has to question or challenge something that we believe in. But it has to do it in a way that is actually safe - that if it actually questions this taboo in a way that's unsafe, or it gets too close to challenging something that's very close to our own heart, the joke stops being funny. It starts being offensive. BLAIR: I mean, if you're a parent of a child who has a nut allergy, that Louis CK joke - you probably are not laughing. VEDANTAM: Right, you probably find it disturbing. And this goes back to the idea that Robert Lynch told us at the start, which is what you find funny and what you don't says a lot about what's happening inside your own head. Okay, we've talked a lot about the scientific research into humor. Let's bring a real comic on the stage. BURR: Hello. BLAIR: Is that Bill Burr? BURR: This is he. VEDANTAM: We got in touch with Bill Burr to ask him about the thin line between being funny and being offensive. You have made me nervous for many, many years, so I'm delighted to be talking to you. BURR: Why? (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: Well, your jokes have made me peer into my own soul, and I don't like what I see there. BLAIR: (Laughter). BURR: Well, you and me both. (LAUGHTER)BURR: I'm now talking about me, not you, though. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). BLAIR: That's great. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Elizabeth and I asked Bill about different jokes and the audience's reaction to them. BLAIR: Right. He did a joke on \"Conan\" about Bruce, now Caitlyn Jenner. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"CONAN\")BURR: I miss that guy. I miss him already. (LAUGHTER)BURR: He should've told us. He should've given us a chance to say goodbye. (LAUGHTER)BURR: I love - you know, I watched him on the Olympics. I watched him on \"CHiPs. \" I watched him on that horrible show my wife watched where he just walks around in the background. (LAUGHTER)BURR: And then it's just like, man, nobody listened to him. It was just so sad. And then I don't know. I don't know where. It's just - he just. . . CONAN O'BRIEN: And then he's gone. BURR: . . . All of a sudden he's Caitlyn. And then you couldn't react. Well, you couldn't on any level be like, oh, my God, you know, what the F you - on any level. You couldn't say that, or you were automatically homophobic. O'BRIEN: Yeah. BURR: It's like, dude, I didn't hear your inner thoughts. O'BRIEN: (Laughter). BURR: I didn't know what you were doing. And all of a sudden, you're supposed to. . . (LAUGHTER)BURR: You just shave your beard off. People are like, oh, my God, that's your chin. Wow. (LAUGHTER)BURR: This guy walked out a dude, came back a woman, and you're just supposed to be like, oh, yes, anyways, Caitlyn. And so I was saying. . . (LAUGHTER)BURR: That's something I do during my act where I always lead people down a road where they're like, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, OK. It's a way - it's something that I kind of do subconsciously now, but it's something that I did when I was on my way up. And people didn't know who I was. It was a way to keep the crowd interested because if people see a trainwreck possibly coming, they're going to listen. VEDANTAM: But, Bill said he's listening to the audience, too. BURR: Like, the crowd is just this thing. I mean, you can't really see a lot of them, so it just becomes this thing that you're listening to. And just over the years of doing it, I guess you are making adjustments. But after a while, it's, like, subconscious. You don't even know you're doing it. BLAIR: One of the bits from one of your Netflix specials that we were really interested in was your whole riff on domestic abuse. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"I'M SORRY YOU FEEL THAT WAY\")BURR: What do you think wife beaters are doing when they drive home? They're, like, so focused on hitting their wife they're just - they got blinders on. They're not reading anything. (LAUGHTER)BLAIR: And, you know, do you remember the audience's reaction to some of that? BURR: Yeah, it killed. (LAUGHTER)BURR: Right. No, it killed. BLAIR: But, Shankar, the truth is not everyone in the audience thought so because there was also this reaction. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"I'M SORRY YOU FEEL THAT WAY\")BURR: Bill Burr, they're still going to do it. Did that get too weird for you guys? (LAUGHTER)BLAIR: Bill said he intentionally takes the audience to an uncomfortable place. BURR: So a lot of the times when I do my jokes, I deliberately have this setup. I leave it vague and almost just have a where is he going to go with this? Is it going to - you know, is this going in a clan direction, or is this going in a Greenpeace direction? VEDANTAM: (Laughter). BLAIR: Yeah. BURR: So you kind of have them on the fence, and they want to see what the result is. And then hopefully, they come along for the ride. VEDANTAM: I told Bill that some researchers think that jokes are a kind of brain scanner, that while he's trying to make an audience laugh, others are studying why the audience laughs. So what people laugh at and what they don't laugh at can actually tell you a lot about what's going on inside their heads. And, you know, there was a. . . (LAUGHTER)BURR: This sounds like some, like, the beginnings of somebody trying to take over the world. (LAUGHTER)BURR: Once you can figure out what is going on their head but what they laugh at, did he have, like, a secret camera? BLAIR: I don't think he was convinced. VEDANTAM: Yeah, I agree. Now since Robert Lynch used Bill's humor about gender issues in his experiment, we decided to go back to that subject. BLAIR: Yeah, we brought back the domestic violence bit because when Bill performed this joke for one crowd, there was a very interesting response from the audience. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"I'M SORRY YOU FEEL THAT WAY\")BURR: So at the end of the hour, they come to the logical conclusion. They're like, there is no reason to hit a woman. There is no reason to hit a woman. And I was just like, really? I could give you, like, 17 right off the top of my head. (LAUGHTER)BURR: You could wake me from a drunken stupor I could still give you, like, nine. (LAUGHTER)BURR: Dude, there's plenty of reasons to hit a woman. You just don't do it. But to sit there and suggest that there's no reason. . . (LAUGHTER)BURR: . . . Dude, the level of ego behind that statement, what are you, levitating above the rest of us? You're never annoying. (LAUGHTER)BURR: Women, how many times have you thought about slapping your [expletive] guy in the head this week? (LAUGHTER)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Every day. BURR: There you go. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: I asked Bill why I found it funny when the woman talks about domestic violence in a way I didn't find it funny when Bill joked about it. BURR: Because we're in different weight classes. And generally speaking, unless you're fighting Ronda Rousey or one of those amazing athletes in the MMA or Laila Ali, like somebody who knows how to fight. . . VEDANTAM: Right. BURR: . . . Generally speaking, you know, guys, you know, can beat up a woman. So what's funny is it's the same thing if you see a little guy knock out a big guy. It's hilarious. VEDANTAM: Right. BURR: If you see the big guy knock out the little guy, it's awful. It doesn't make you feel good. So that's why, you know, it isn't really a double standard because they have to live in the fear of being hit. You know, I hate when guys go, oh, that's a double standard as far - I'm not saying you're saying this, but when they're like, you know, oh, they can joke about it, but I can't, it's like, yes, yes, that's like those weird white people that go, well, how come they can say it and we can't. . . VEDANTAM: Right. BURR: . . . When they're talking about the N-word. It's just like, dude, do you really not understand the whole dynamics of that? VEDANTAM: Bill's explanation perfectly mirrors what Peter McGraw's research has found. A woman talking about beating up a man feels like a benign violation because we know it doesn't happen that often. A man talking about beating up a woman feels offensive because we know that kind of thing happens all the time. BLAIR: You know, Shankar, one thing I didn't know about Bill Burr is that he actually likes hecklers. He doesn't like people who just yell, you suck all the time, but he actually likes people who don't agree with him. BURR: I say a lot of absurd over-the-top things. Like, I really don't put any boundaries - I try not to, anyways - on what I say. And then, you know, when I do that men-women stuff, I want women to yell stuff out because I want to - you actually can learn stuff while you're doing stand-up, like how they react, their points that they make versus yours, you know. I mean, I've always said, I don't read, and I'm a moron, so by all means, you know, I'd love to hear your opinion. VEDANTAM: All right, so, Bill Burr is going to keep saying absurd things, and you should all keep yelling things out. But I had one last question for him. Where do things go from here? I mean, so you've built such an impressive career, and you've done so many different things. What's next on that horizon? BURR: I think this is the time where I start my drug habit. (LAUGHTER)BURR: Then I screw the whole thing up. BLAIR: Oh, no. BURR: I hit rock bottom. BLAIR: No. BURR: I do a reality show. And then later on, I write the book. VEDANTAM: Don't say that, Bill. BLAIR: (Laughter). BURR: And then I'll play somebody's grandfather on a sitcom. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: That's comedian Bill Burr. His new animated series, \"F Is For Family,\" premieres December 18 on Netflix. Elizabeth, I want to thank you for hanging out with me today on the HIDDEN BRAIN. BLAIR: Thank you, Shankar.

But first, I want to tell you about some research into what makes people laugh. ROBERT LYNCH: So it's called an implicit association test. VEDANTAM: This is Robert Lynch. He's an evolutionary anthropologist. He studies how traits passed down through evolution affect human behavior. He now works at the University of Missouri. LYNCH: Instead of asking, do you prefer blacks or do you prefer whites, or do you associate women more with career and men more with family or the reverse, you actually time them on how fast they categorize things on a keyboard. VEDANTAM: In the test he gave volunteers, he studied their associations on gender attitudes. What's interesting about these associations is that they're often unconscious or implicit. People aren't aware of them. Lynch also had the volunteers listen to jokes related to gender issues. The comic he chose - Bill Burr. BURR: Like, I dated this girl one time, she was, like, really into, like, women's issues. So we used to always have these dumbass arguments. So one time she came up to me and she goes, OK, explain this to me, Bill. Why does a guy make more an hour to do the exact same job, huh (ph)? I go, I'll tell you why. Because in the unlikely event that we're both on a Titanic and it starts to sink, for some (expletive) reason, you get to leave with the kids and I have to stay. Yeah, that's why I get the dollar more an hour. LYNCH: People laugh, but there's a big range. Some people didn't at all; some people almost falling out of their chairs. VEDANTAM: Now, if you asked people why they laughed or didn't, some people will tell you the joke was funny and others will tell you it wasn't. But Lynch thinks something else is going on. People's unconscious attitudes about gender were strongly correlated with whether they laughed or found the joke offensive. LYNCH: The take-home message is that people who associated female with family and males with career more strongly - had stereotypic or traditional gender preferences, it's called - tended to laugh more at that segment. VEDANTAM: The joke about men and women, in other words, is actually a test. If you watch the audience as Bill tells that joke, you can get a pretty good sense of what's going on in the mind of the person who laughs and the mind of the person who doesn't laugh. Lynch thinks there are strong evolutionary reasons people behave this way. In fact, he thinks humor itself may have evolved because it allows people to tell who belongs to their in-group and who doesn't. LYNCH: A lot of laughter is about taboo topics and things like that. So it's communicating something that we may not be so readily willing to admit, but we're communicating it to other people to find out if they share our preferences. And then if it doesn't work out, it was just a joke, you know. And so it's got this - it's kind of a coded message saying hey, are you part of my group? Are we in the same in-group? And by laughing at that joke, you're maybe, possibly signaling that yeah, I think women are more associated with family. I mean, that's a lame way to say it. But that's - you're implying that you have these stereotypical gender preferences, or traditional, I should say. VEDANTAM: So in some ways, I think what I'm hearing you say is that for a very long time, we actually have been using jokes as a way to understand what's happening inside other people's heads. The joke has been a brain scan for much of human history. LYNCH: That's a good way to put it, yeah. So unlike verbal communication, which is very susceptible to deception and lying and oh yeah, no, I believe what you believe, yeah I'm on your team, yeah I'm in the same group, laughter may be a way to honestly signal. There's always, in evolution, kind of a need to signal things honestly when there's - when they're so susceptible to deception. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: That's evolutionary anthropologist Robert Lynch. When we come back, Elizabeth Blair is going to join me. We'll talk about how comedians need to skirt the edge of what's offensive in order to be funny. Sometimes, that can mean going over the edge. BURR: There is no reason to hit a woman. And I was just like, really? I could give you, like, 17 right off the top of my head. VEDANTAM: Stay with us.

I was talking about this idea - the idea that jokes can act like a brain scanner - with Elizabeth Blair. Elizabeth is an arts reporter at NPR, and she covers the world of standup comedy. Elizabeth, welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. ELIZABETH BLAIR, BYLINE: Thanks, Shankar, it's great to be here. I mean, this is a topic that is dear to my heart because I love standup comedy, and I always thought there was a psychology - a science - behind why we laugh, why we wouldn't laugh. And I'm just very eager to hear more. VEDANTAM: And I remember we had this fantastic conversation a couple of months ago, Elizabeth. We were sitting on the fourth-floor patio at NPR, playing clips from our favorite comedians and not just listening to the comedians but listening to ourselves, listening when it is we laugh and when it is we don't. BLAIR: And why we laughed and why we didn't. And it wasn't always for the same reasons. VEDANTAM: No, it wasn't for the same reasons. I've actually brought in a couple of clips with me today, Elizabeth. I want you to listen less to the comedian and more to the audience's reactions to the comedian. The comedian is someone you're going to know - Louis CK. I'm sure you're a fan. BLAIR: He's a master. VEDANTAM: And what he does in this series of clips is he brings the audience very close to a place where they're going to be very uncomfortable. Here's Louis. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"OH MY GOD\") LOUIS CK: Everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts. Hopefully, the good thoughts win. For me, I always have both. I have, like, the thing I believe, the good thing. That's the thing I believe. And then there's this thing. And I don't believe it, but it is there. (LAUGHTER) CK: It's always this thing, and then this thing. It's become a category in my brain that I call of course, but maybe. (LAUGHTER) CK: I'll give you an example. OK, like of course - of course - children who have nut allergies need to be protected. Of course we have to segregate their food from nuts, have their medication available at all times. And anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies, of course. But maybe. . . (LAUGHTER) CK: . . . Maybe if touching a nut kills you, you're supposed to die. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: So I love this transition between the of course and the maybe, because the of course part is the part that we all agree - appropriate views, civilized views. And the maybe part is this part in our brain that sort of is lurking there, hidden below the surface. BLAIR: But we don't speak it. We don't say it because it's inappropriate. It's not polite. VEDANTAM: Exactly, and what I love is how Louis is sort of pulling us closer and closer and closer to that line. So what he does is he walks us even further to the line in this next clip. Here he is. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"OH MY GOD\") CK: Of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. (LAUGHTER) CK: Listen, listen - you all clapped for dead kids with the nuts. For kids dying from nuts, you applauded. So you're in this with me now, you understand? You don't get to cherry pick. (LAUGHTER) CK: Those kids did nothing to you. (APPLAUSE) BLAIR: And you can hear the audience. The nerves are there. They're not quite bellowing anymore. But there's some laughter, but there's some sort of, hm (ph), I don't know if I can laugh at this. VEDANTAM: I totally agree. And it's almost as if he has actually trapped them because he actually brought them in, initially with something that they basically said, okay, we'll walk with you. But now he's taken them to this really dark place. And what I like about this clip, Elizabeth, is that it reflects ideas that social scientists have talked about for more than a century. In 1905, Sigmund Freud wrote a book called \"Jokes And Their Relation To The Unconscious. \" And one of the points he makes is that jokes are usually violations of deeply-held taboos. So part of why a joke is funny is that it allows us to get up against this place in our brain that's really dark and really scary. BLAIR: Yeah, no, and that's one reason I love comedy. I almost feel like when I walk out of a great show, it forces me to be a little more authentic with my feelings. I might not express them, but, you know, let's face it. We all do have some really dark thoughts. That's human. VEDANTAM: Yeah, and it's interesting you say that Elizabeth, because in some ways Freud talks about this idea too - this idea that the joke actually offers us a mechanism for catharsis. It allows us to get out things in ourselves that we really want to have come out. BLAIR: I was in Montreal recently at the Just For Laughs Festival. And I actually asked Margaret Cho about this very thing - why do people laugh, or what is it about comedy that sort of releases something? And this is what she said. MARGARET CHO: It's kind of like they're laughing out of fear because, (laughter) like, they can't believe that you said it. Like, it's kind of a fear. But it's also, like, that you're laughing because somebody is actually playing with fire and that this may erupt into something incredibly explosive. VEDANTAM: So here's where I might push back just a bit, Elizabeth. I came by some new research published recently in one of the social science journals. It was work by Peter McGraw. He's a behavioral scientist at the University of Colorado. And he makes the argument that really, for a joke to work, yes, it has to violate a taboo. It has to question or challenge something that we believe in. But it has to do it in a way that is actually safe - that if it actually questions this taboo in a way that's unsafe, or it gets too close to challenging something that's very close to our own heart, the joke stops being funny. It starts being offensive. BLAIR: I mean, if you're a parent of a child who has a nut allergy, that Louis CK joke - you probably are not laughing. VEDANTAM: Right, you probably find it disturbing. And this goes back to the idea that Robert Lynch told us at the start, which is what you find funny and what you don't says a lot about what's happening inside your own head. Okay, we've talked a lot about the scientific research into humor. Let's bring a real comic on the stage. BURR: Hello. BLAIR: Is that Bill Burr? BURR: This is he. VEDANTAM: We got in touch with Bill Burr to ask him about the thin line between being funny and being offensive. You have made me nervous for many, many years, so I'm delighted to be talking to you. BURR: Why? (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: Well, your jokes have made me peer into my own soul, and I don't like what I see there. BLAIR: (Laughter). BURR: Well, you and me both. (LAUGHTER) BURR: I'm now talking about me, not you, though. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). BLAIR: That's great. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Elizabeth and I asked Bill about different jokes and the audience's reaction to them. BLAIR: Right. He did a joke on \"Conan\" about Bruce, now Caitlyn Jenner. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"CONAN\") BURR: I miss that guy. I miss him already. (LAUGHTER) BURR: He should've told us. He should've given us a chance to say goodbye. (LAUGHTER) BURR: I love - you know, I watched him on the Olympics. I watched him on \"CHiPs. \" I watched him on that horrible show my wife watched where he just walks around in the background. (LAUGHTER) BURR: And then it's just like, man, nobody listened to him. It was just so sad. And then I don't know. I don't know where. It's just - he just. . . CONAN O'BRIEN: And then he's gone. BURR: . . . All of a sudden he's Caitlyn. And then you couldn't react. Well, you couldn't on any level be like, oh, my God, you know, what the F you - on any level. You couldn't say that, or you were automatically homophobic. O'BRIEN: Yeah. BURR: It's like, dude, I didn't hear your inner thoughts. O'BRIEN: (Laughter). BURR: I didn't know what you were doing. And all of a sudden, you're supposed to. . . (LAUGHTER) BURR: You just shave your beard off. People are like, oh, my God, that's your chin. Wow. (LAUGHTER) BURR: This guy walked out a dude, came back a woman, and you're just supposed to be like, oh, yes, anyways, Caitlyn. And so I was saying. . . (LAUGHTER) BURR: That's something I do during my act where I always lead people down a road where they're like, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, OK. It's a way - it's something that I kind of do subconsciously now, but it's something that I did when I was on my way up. And people didn't know who I was. It was a way to keep the crowd interested because if people see a trainwreck possibly coming, they're going to listen. VEDANTAM: But, Bill said he's listening to the audience, too. BURR: Like, the crowd is just this thing. I mean, you can't really see a lot of them, so it just becomes this thing that you're listening to. And just over the years of doing it, I guess you are making adjustments. But after a while, it's, like, subconscious. You don't even know you're doing it. BLAIR: One of the bits from one of your Netflix specials that we were really interested in was your whole riff on domestic abuse. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"I'M SORRY YOU FEEL THAT WAY\") BURR: What do you think wife beaters are doing when they drive home? They're, like, so focused on hitting their wife they're just - they got blinders on. They're not reading anything. (LAUGHTER) BLAIR: And, you know, do you remember the audience's reaction to some of that? BURR: Yeah, it killed. (LAUGHTER) BURR: Right. No, it killed. BLAIR: But, Shankar, the truth is not everyone in the audience thought so because there was also this reaction. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"I'M SORRY YOU FEEL THAT WAY\") BURR: Bill Burr, they're still going to do it. Did that get too weird for you guys? (LAUGHTER) BLAIR: Bill said he intentionally takes the audience to an uncomfortable place. BURR: So a lot of the times when I do my jokes, I deliberately have this setup. I leave it vague and almost just have a where is he going to go with this? Is it going to - you know, is this going in a clan direction, or is this going in a Greenpeace direction? VEDANTAM: (Laughter). BLAIR: Yeah. BURR: So you kind of have them on the fence, and they want to see what the result is. And then hopefully, they come along for the ride. VEDANTAM: I told Bill that some researchers think that jokes are a kind of brain scanner, that while he's trying to make an audience laugh, others are studying why the audience laughs. So what people laugh at and what they don't laugh at can actually tell you a lot about what's going on inside their heads. And, you know, there was a. . . (LAUGHTER) BURR: This sounds like some, like, the beginnings of somebody trying to take over the world. (LAUGHTER) BURR: Once you can figure out what is going on their head but what they laugh at, did he have, like, a secret camera? BLAIR: I don't think he was convinced. VEDANTAM: Yeah, I agree. Now since Robert Lynch used Bill's humor about gender issues in his experiment, we decided to go back to that subject. BLAIR: Yeah, we brought back the domestic violence bit because when Bill performed this joke for one crowd, there was a very interesting response from the audience. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"I'M SORRY YOU FEEL THAT WAY\") BURR: So at the end of the hour, they come to the logical conclusion. They're like, there is no reason to hit a woman. There is no reason to hit a woman. And I was just like, really? I could give you, like, 17 right off the top of my head. (LAUGHTER) BURR: You could wake me from a drunken stupor I could still give you, like, nine. (LAUGHTER) BURR: Dude, there's plenty of reasons to hit a woman. You just don't do it. But to sit there and suggest that there's no reason. . . (LAUGHTER) BURR: . . . Dude, the level of ego behind that statement, what are you, levitating above the rest of us? You're never annoying. (LAUGHTER) BURR: Women, how many times have you thought about slapping your [expletive] guy in the head this week? (LAUGHTER) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Every day. BURR: There you go. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: I asked Bill why I found it funny when the woman talks about domestic violence in a way I didn't find it funny when Bill joked about it. BURR: Because we're in different weight classes. And generally speaking, unless you're fighting Ronda Rousey or one of those amazing athletes in the MMA or Laila Ali, like somebody who knows how to fight. . . VEDANTAM: Right. BURR: . . . Generally speaking, you know, guys, you know, can beat up a woman. So what's funny is it's the same thing if you see a little guy knock out a big guy. It's hilarious. VEDANTAM: Right. BURR: If you see the big guy knock out the little guy, it's awful. It doesn't make you feel good. So that's why, you know, it isn't really a double standard because they have to live in the fear of being hit. You know, I hate when guys go, oh, that's a double standard as far - I'm not saying you're saying this, but when they're like, you know, oh, they can joke about it, but I can't, it's like, yes, yes, that's like those weird white people that go, well, how come they can say it and we can't. . . VEDANTAM: Right. BURR: . . . When they're talking about the N-word. It's just like, dude, do you really not understand the whole dynamics of that? VEDANTAM: Bill's explanation perfectly mirrors what Peter McGraw's research has found. A woman talking about beating up a man feels like a benign violation because we know it doesn't happen that often. A man talking about beating up a woman feels offensive because we know that kind of thing happens all the time. BLAIR: You know, Shankar, one thing I didn't know about Bill Burr is that he actually likes hecklers. He doesn't like people who just yell, you suck all the time, but he actually likes people who don't agree with him. BURR: I say a lot of absurd over-the-top things. Like, I really don't put any boundaries - I try not to, anyways - on what I say. And then, you know, when I do that men-women stuff, I want women to yell stuff out because I want to - you actually can learn stuff while you're doing stand-up, like how they react, their points that they make versus yours, you know. I mean, I've always said, I don't read, and I'm a moron, so by all means, you know, I'd love to hear your opinion. VEDANTAM: All right, so, Bill Burr is going to keep saying absurd things, and you should all keep yelling things out. But I had one last question for him. Where do things go from here? I mean, so you've built such an impressive career, and you've done so many different things. What's next on that horizon? BURR: I think this is the time where I start my drug habit. (LAUGHTER) BURR: Then I screw the whole thing up. BLAIR: Oh, no. BURR: I hit rock bottom. BLAIR: No. BURR: I do a reality show. And then later on, I write the book. VEDANTAM: Don't say that, Bill. BLAIR: (Laughter). BURR: And then I'll play somebody's grandfather on a sitcom. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: That's comedian Bill Burr. His new animated series, \"F Is For Family,\" premieres December 18 on Netflix. Elizabeth, I want to thank you for hanging out with me today on the HIDDEN BRAIN. BLAIR: Thank you, Shankar.

A Texas company wants to use seismic testing to look for oil in the Big Cypress National Preserve, a protected area next to Everglades National Park. Environmental groups worry the testing could harm endangered plants and animals and as NPR's Greg Allen reports, open sensitive areas to drilling and fracking. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Betty Osceola has lived her whole life in the Everglades. She's a member of the Miccosukee tribe. During the Seminole Wars of the 19th century, her ancestors hid from federal troops in the Everglades swamps and cypress forests. BETTY OSCEOLA: This land, the Everglades, they protected us in our time of need. She provided us shelter. She provided us food. She provided us water. As indigenous people, it's our turn to take up and speak for her. ALLEN: The Everglades covers thousands of square miles in Florida and extends far beyond the boundaries of the national park. Osceola was part of a group protesting plans for a seismic testing on 70,000 acres in a key part of the ecosystem, Big Cypress National Preserve. While oil drilling isn't allowed in the national park, it is allowed in neighboring Big Cypress. Don Hargrove is the Preserve's minerals management specialist. DON HARGROVE: Oil drilling and oil fields were here when Big Cypress was created. As a condition of the establishment of the Preserve, oil and gas will still continue. ALLEN: Hargrove says there are over a dozen active wells in Big Cypress now, but that number may increase. The Burnett Oil Company wants to look for oil by crisscrossing the Preserve with large 60,000 pound trucks. The trucks generate a seismic signal by vibrating large plates against the ground. The first phase of the survey would take about eight weeks. In an environmental assessment, the National Park Service says it believes the activity would likely have just a minor impact on endangered wildlife. As the trucks come through, the Park Service says animals like the Florida panther will move. Matthew Schwartz with the South Florida Wildlands Association isn't so sure. MATTHEW SCHWARTZ: They have no idea when they're going through an area if there's a denning panther, maybe a female panther with kittens in an area, and that panther might abandon a den when it hears the intrusion. ALLEN: The staff at Big Cypress National Preserve held a public meeting this week to answer questions about the seismic testing. They played a video of one of the large thumper trucks in action. Where's the bang? One audience member asked. Dave Wisniewski, who conducts the seismic surveys for Burnett, says that's a common misconception. DAVE WISNIEWSKI: But it's an engine noise is all you hear. And when it's shaking, you can hear it actually shake up a little different pitch, but there's no boom. ALLEN: For environmental groups and others who live near Big Cypress, there's a bigger concern - it's what the survey may find. With new techniques like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, fracking, oil companies have begun to take a new look for reserves in Florida. They're particularly interested in a geological area called the Sunniland Trend. Wisniewski says that's where the seismic survey comes in. WISNIEWSKI: So this'll identify, hopefully, reserves for Burnett, and then minimize the amount of drilling they have to actually do. ALLEN: Matthew Schwartz of the South Florida Wildlands Association says Burnett Oil Company has rights to look for oil on more than half of the Preserve's 730,000 acres. SCHWARTZ: They're probably going to find oil 'cause this is smack in the middle of the Sunniland Trend. And then comes - what? - new access roads, oil pads, drill rigs, fracking? I mean, all of that is on the horizon for the most bio diverse piece of federal land, public land in the continental United States.

INSKEEP: It's also about whether the United States will lead and keep its commitments. All Things Considered host Ari Shapiro is at the summit in Paris. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: The U. S. is different from many of the other countries here. First of all, it's big. In the 20th century, no country in the world emitted more carbon. And second of all. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Everybody else is taking climate change really seriously. SHAPIRO: Here in Paris last week, President Obama said, in other advanced democracies, the fact of climate change is not really up for political debate. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)OBAMA: They are arguing about a whole bunch of things. One thing they're not arguing about is whether the science of climate change is real and whether or not we have to do something about it. SHAPIRO: While President Obama was in Paris, House Republicans in Washington were debating a bill to gut the administration's clean energy plan. This is not just small-ball domestic politics that the rest of the world ignores. Other countries at this summit accuse the U. S. of trying to have it both ways, emitting more carbon per capita than almost any other country, while wagging fingers at the rest of the world. Chandra Bhushan is with the Indian delegation. He gave a long presentation comparing the U. S. to India. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHANDRA BHUSHAN: If all the U. S. power plants was considered a country, it would have been the third-largest polluter of greenhouse gas in the world. SHAPIRO: This is an area called climate generations. It's outside of where the main negotiations are taking place. And in this hall, you find the environmental groups, the civil society organizations, the activists, the volunteers, people from all over the world. CLAUDINE PIERSON: My name is Claudine Pierson, and I'm a conference interpreter working here for the COP 21 in Paris. I was really surprised to see so many American around. How are they perceived? Like polluters, I guess. SHAPIRO: She's French, and she says everyone here knows that Congress is fighting Obama on carbon emissions. PIERSON: Yes, they're well aware that because it was all over the newspapers, so we know. SHAPIRO: And lots of people share her view of the U. S. as an outlier. Mamadou Mboudji is with an environmental organization from Senegal. MAMADOU MBOUDJI: I perceive the American as a country that does not respect the others' opinions. SHAPIRO: Hanging over all of this is the fact that the U. S. has walked away from global climate deals before. Still, lots of people here note a big change since Obama took office. They say the U. S. is no longer seen as a spoiler in these talks. The question now is whether the hot political debate in Washington is tying the hands of American negotiators in Paris. U. S. Energy Secretary Earnest Moniz told me absolutely not. EARNEST MONIZ: The programs that have been put forward will be executed. They are based upon existing authorities, whether it is efficiency standards for vehicles or the clean power plan for power plants. SHAPIRO: But can negotiators from the U. S. really negotiate in good faith given that, for example, Republicans in Congress threaten to shut down the federal government if the U. S. delegation here commits to paying too much to developing countries to deal with impacts of climate change? MONIZ: Well, look, there are certain issues. You put your finger on it. There are certainly certain issues that require congressional action. But again, most of the steps that we are taking - the president's plan is on existing authorities, and this program will go forward. RACHEL KYTE: I think that what the phrases you hear here are that everybody understands that the American delegation's negotiating in good faith. SHAPIRO: Rachel Kyte operates at the highest levels in these talks. She's the World Bank's special envoy for climate change. She says, in meeting rooms here, people get that U. S. climate politics can be complicated. KYTE: And that is a complexity that everybody understands that the U. S. will have to work its way through. SHAPIRO: Kyte says people outside the United States are a bit perplexed by this, but it's not the first time the rest of the world has found the U. S. perplexing. INSKEEP: That's Ari Shapiro of NPR's All Things Considered, who's covering the climate summit in Paris. And Ari's still on the line. Ari, how do negotiators from other countries account for the possibility that the next American president might walk away from part or all of this agreement? SHAPIRO: You know, I asked the chief U. S. negotiator, Todd Stern, about this before the summit began. And he told me, despite all the rhetoric, there's actually a long history of presidents from different parties respecting the international agreements that their predecessors have signed onto. If you look at nuclear arms treaties or the laws of war, these are international agreements that have withstood changes in administration, changes of party. And he expects that agreement that might come out of Paris would be the same. INSKEEP: You refer to a concern in your story, Ari, about the United States getting disadvantaged in an agreement like this, that the United States gives away the store to developing nations that don't have the same requirements the U. S. does. And I want to bring another voice into the conversation. NPR's Christopher Joyce is covering these climate talks. Christopher, does this deal, as it's shaping up, give some advantage to developing nations? CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: It has to give some. I mean, everybody's coming to the table. It's like a poker game; everybody's got a different hand. And the U. S. wants to keep them in the game. And so they're quite willing to up the ante, so to speak, and, you know, promise to give them assistance so that they'll play, so that they'll do something this time, as they've never done before. At the same time, of course, the U. S. has to derate this language very carefully because they have to take it home. And if it does look like they're giving away the store, then, of course, they're going to face a lot of resistance to the idea that the taxpayers in the United States are paying for developing countries to do whatever they want. So they've added language by which they can watch and monitor and verify what developing countries are doing with the money that we're going to give them over the next two or three decades so that they can pay attention and be sure that the money's not wasted. INSKEEP: And so there's an effort to have an assurance that developing nations will do something. JOYCE: Yes, but the language is extremely delicate. This is what the diplomats are fighting over now, today, tomorrow, the day after, is exactly what kind of language is going to guarantee that. INSKEEP: OK, that's NPR's Ari Shapiro and Christopher Joyce. Thanks to you both. SHAPIRO: Good to talk to you. JOYCE: You're welcome. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  Here's a complexity for the United States. U. S. negotiators in Paris are trying to lead the world toward a climate agreement. They're doing that while American politicians debate whether climate change is happening at all. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Just yesterday, Republic Sen. Ted Cruz highlighted his doubts. And we hear his case in an interview elsewhere in this program.

Space travel has long been a staple of science-fiction. And now some of the biggest names in the genre are trying to imagine what it would actually take to send humans to another planet. One movie back in the theaters now, \"The Martian,\" is drawn from a self-published sci-fi book that taps into this trend towards realism. Wisconsin Public Radio's Steve Paulson has the story. STEVE PAULSON, BYLINE: The blockbuster movie \"The Martian\" is a white-knuckle thriller, so you might not see story as a series of science and math puzzles. But that's precisely why novelist Andy Weir first dreamed up the book that inspired the movie. ANDY WEIR: I'm a space dork. I'm a big fan of manned and unmanned spaceflight. And I was sitting around at home imagining how can we do a manned Mars mission? Not for the purposes of telling a story, but just how could we do it, just a thought experiment. PAULSON: So Weir tried to work out the science of how an astronaut stranded on Mars could get enough oxygen and water and food to survive. His book is what's known as hard science fiction - a story based on existing or plausible science. And the thing about science fiction that separates it from just about every other kind of fiction is that some of these imaginary stories actually become real. CALLA COFIELD: It is very well documented that people who work for NASA have been inspired by science fiction. PAULSON: Calla Cofield is a reporter for space. com, who covers the space industry. COFIELD: And there's always, you know, a back and forth between science fiction and reality. All of this is about dreaming about what's going on off the surface of the Earth. PAULSON: One of the best-known writers of hard science fiction is Kim Stanley Robinson. He wrote an acclaimed series of Mars novels in the 1990s, and he's just come out with a new book called of \"Aurora. \" Unlike Andy Weir's near-future story, his novel is set 500 years from now. It's about a space voyage to Tau Ceti, which Robinson believes could be the nearest habitable star system outside our own. KIM STANLEY ROBINSON: I guess my working principle was what would it really be like? So no hyperspace, no warp drive, no magical thing that isn't going to really happen to get us there. PAULSON: Over the years, the idea of a space voyage to Tau Ceti has attracted some of the biggest names in science fiction, from Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein to Ursula Le Guin. Robinson figures it would take about 200 years to get there. That means the journey would span several generations. ROBINSON: What becomes interesting is to think about the people born on this starship who didn't make the choice to be there. And for two or three generations, you're born on the ship, you die on the ship. You're just in between the stars, so it turned into a bit of a prison novel, like you spend your whole life in a Motel 6. PAULSON: But suppose you had to go out into space to survive because the Earth's ecosystem suddenly crashed? That's the premise of a new book by another science fiction heavyweight, Neal Stephenson. In his novel \"Seveneves,\" a flotilla of ships is launched into space. Stephenson's novel comes at a time when there have been no human space missions for decades - at least not beyond the International Space Station. He believes we've largely lost the will to pursue the really big projects of previous generations, like the massive government initiatives that sent people to the moon and built the interstate highway system. He says the tech industry didn't help matters when it became so lucrative and attractive to young people with technical savvy. NEAL STEPHENSON: And so for the last few decades, the kinds of really smart geeks, who, in the '50s and '60s would've been building rockets or something, have been, you know, moving to Silicon Valley and creating startups to make little apps. PAULSON: Stephenson says there's an underlying problem. We often have trouble imagining what a positive future would look like. And here's where science fiction comes in. If we want a better future, maybe we need better stories. What we don't need, he says, are more dystopian stories of civilization in ruins. STEPHENSON: It's just tired. They take the stuff that we have now - the buildings, the cities, the vehicles - and they kind of throw dirt on them and beat them up and break the windows. And then that's the future in which these things are all set. PAULSON: By contrast, the science fiction writers who've tried to imagine plausible scenarios for getting to another planet tend to be hopeful about the future. There is a danger though, says Kim Stanley Robinson. A fantasy that if humans could just start over on another planet, we could escape all the problems we have here on Earth. ROBINSON: So the idea of a utopia happening on another planet is a story space that you go into. Some in that sense, on Mars we can do things right, and it will serve as an illustration or an example for people back on Earth. I mean, I love Mars, and I'm interested in Mars. But we don't need to go anywhere because this planet is our one-and-only home. PAULSON: And no matter how much we dream, it's where we're actually going to have to live.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)STEVE INSKEEP, BYLINE: We're learning more at this hour about a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. , about an hour east of Los Angeles. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: We have two suspects, both dressed in black. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BARACK OBAMA: It is clear that the two of them had gone down the dark path of radicalization, embracing a perverted interpretation of Islam that calls for war against America and the West. They had stockpiled assault weapons, ammunition and pipe bombs. So this was an act of terrorism designed to kill innocent people. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST: Every time there's a terrorist attack, we ask ourselves, what motivates people to do this? The attacks seem barbaric, nihilistic. But is it that simple? Is that what's really going on? On this week's podcast, we explore the psychology of international terrorist organizations and why so many young people join them. Battlefield experiments conducted with fighters for ISIS and al-Qaida reveal patterns in the mental makeup of terrorists. We'll use the lens of anthropologist Scott Atran to explore the strange hold these organizations have on young minds. SCOTT ATRAN: Once you lock into these values, they're immune to social pressures. They're not norms. That is, even if your best friends, your family, your loved ones are against you, you will not see an exit strategy. VEDANTAM: We'll also examine the phenomenon President Obama calls radicalization. Is it driven by shadowy recruiters or by what Israeli psychologist Ariel Merari would describe as peer pressure in university cafeterias? ARIEL MERARI: In the university's cafeteria, he says, hey, you know, I'm also willing to debate. I would also carry out the attack. VEDANTAM: And we'll explore the psychology of violence - what happens when brutality is practiced as a form of theater. ATRAN: The spilling of blood - the brutality - accomplishes two things. First of all, it binds people together who are doing it. And the second thing it does is it scares the hell out of enemies and fence-sitters. VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedanta. Regularly on this podcast, we present counterintuitive thinking - researchers with analyses that challenge popular beliefs - well-held views or notions. This episode is no different. I first came by the work of Scott Atran and Ariel Merari several years ago. I found their research on terrorism counterintuitive. Where some think brainwashing is the sole cause of people being recruited to ISIS and like-minded terror organizations, Atran and Merari suggest that peer networks matter more - much more. In the popular imagination, it is religious extremism that drives terrorists. But these social scientists argue that religion is often a secondary factor. Where many of us might say that terrorists are morally warped or purely evil, Atran and Merari would point to the role of hidden psychological forces. I should say the views of these researchers are not universally shared, but especially in the aftermath of the San Bernardino shootings, I felt their views might be useful to hear. ATRAN: I got a call from the medical school in Khartoum the other day, where a professor at the medical school said that her best students have just gone on to found a medical unit for the Islamic State. And this was completely unexpected. And what should she do about it? What should the school about it? VEDANTAM: This is Scott Atran. He's an anthropologist who works at the University of Oxford, the University of Michigan and the French National Center For Scientific Research. He has traveled to the frontlines of war zones - to cafes in Morocco and housing projects in the Paris suburbs. He has spent many years trying to understand why people are drawn to join groups such as ISIS, which is also known as the Islamic State. ATRAN: So I get a call saying, will you talk to us? Our students - we don't understand this. They were our best students, our brightest students. And they went off to establish a medical clinic, we found out, with the Islamic State. Their parents are hysterical. We don't know what to tell them. Can you tell us what's going on? VEDANTAM: The students were of Sudanese ancestry and most had British passports. They came from well-to-do families. They had promising careers ahead of them. Families of the medical students were dumbstruck. The heartbroken sister of one student spoke to the Daily Mail in Britain. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: And we just want her home. We want her safe. Her family, we love her more than anybody else in this world can. Nobody in this world can love her more than we do. My little sister, she's an A star student. They're preying on young, innocent girls and it's just - it's not right. VEDANTAM: Atran said he told the teachers of the medical school the same thing he has been preaching for years to governments and more recently at the United Nations. ATRAN: I said, listen, I can't give you the solution. The solution has to be for you to pay attention, to listen to what they're telling you. I mean, obviously, if you had listened to them and engaged with them, you would have had indications of what was happening. And you would have been able to talk to them. But like parents, the older authorities, again, know nothing and again, are preaching nonsense things like moderation or this isn't true Islam, or whatever bologna they're giving them today. And of course, it means nothing. VEDANTAM: Meaning it isn't effective. It's falling on deaf ears. Atran believes these messages won't be effective because they fundamentally misunderstand why the young medical students were drawn to the Islamic State. The authorities painted the recruits as drawn to nihilism. Atran thinks it has more to do with a twisted idealism. ATRAN: The Islamic State Revolution is a revolution. There really isn't much difference I see in the impulse, or the impetus, to the Islamic State Revolution than to the French Revolution or to the Bolshevik Revolution or to the National Socialist Revolution. And it appeals to the same sorts of people. VEDANTAM: Comparing the Islamic State to the French Revolution or the Bolshevik Revolution doesn't mean it will succeed. Lots of revolutions fail. But if Atran is right, it does mean that it would be a big mistake to underestimate the draw of the Islamic State. In one ISIS video, a young British man looks into the camera. He has a stethoscope around his neck. He leans in with an earnest expression. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: All the people in England, I ask you again. All the Muslims over there, taqwallah, leave the land of England and come here to make hijra here in wilayat al-khayr and in dawlat al-Islam. And help your brothers and sisters out here. Wallahi, there is a great cause being fought here, and the caravan is leaving. ATRAN: George Orwell, in his review of \"Mein Kampf\" back in 1939 - I'm not crazy about ad Hitleriums but this was a particularly insightful piece - he said, what is it about Mr. Hitler that appeals? What is the essence of the problem? Look at our societies. Capitalist societies offer their people ease, avoidance of risk and pain, security - in short, the good life. And what is the result? Well, the Oxford Student Union, the cream of our intellectuals, votes they will never fight again. And Mr. Hitler, what is he offering his people? Glory, adventure, even death and destruction, but most of all transcendence and a feeling of self-sacrifice. So Mr. Hitler has understood the essence of human beings. Human beings need not just short working hours and comfort and security and avoidance of pain. They need, at least intermittently, a feeling of transcendence and self-sacrifice. And so 80 million people now fall down at his feet. And in fact, the German soldiers in World War II outfought on any measure the Allied soldiers, be they Russian or American or Brits. VEDANTAM: Scott Atran says he sees the same conviction among Islamic State fighters. He was recently talking with Kurdish and Iraqi soldiers a short distance from the front lines in the battle with ISIS. ATRAN: The Islamic State came in June of 2014 in about 80 trucks of four to five people a truck, about 350 people, to free a prison, Badush prison, because freeing prisoners gains you recruits. They also massacred 600 Shia in that prison. But the Iraqi army, trained by the United States, armed by the United States to the tune of billions of dollars, simply ran away. Now there was one unit on the Machmore (ph) front in a place called Garamelli (ph), where we had a few Iraqi soldiers embedded with the Peshmerga. And the reason they stayed was because their families actually lived in villages close by. And I asked them, why is it that your fellow soldiers simply ran away or melted into the city? And one said to me, they simply didn't want their heads cut off. VEDANTAM: When we hear reports of beheadings or prisoners being set on fire, the Islamic State's seemingly indiscriminate violence shock us. But the shock can keep us from seeing that such theatrical displays of brutality actually serve psychological goals. ATRAN: The spilling of blood, the brutality, accomplishes two things and usually has done that throughout the human history and across cultures. First of all, it binds people together who are doing it. And the second thing it does it scares the hell out of enemies and fence-sitters.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. When British engineer Ahmed Muthana realized his medical student son had left the family home in Cardiff in the United Kingdom to join the Islamic State, he was enraged. Police came to his home and showed him a video of his son, Nasser, trying to recruit others to join ISIS. I feel sick and devastated that my son is caught up in this, he told the Daily Mail. He was brought up to love and respect my country, which is Britain. I am his father, and naturally, I am worried about his safety while he's out there, but I am also worried about the evil messages he is spreading in this video. Muthana said he rid his house of photographs of Nasser saying, it's a Muslim thing. You don't keep the devil in your house. Atran thinks it's understandable that parents would express shock, disbelief and anger. But he thinks a more productive approach is to look at the young people drawn to terrorist groups with a measure of empathy. ATRAN: By empathizing, I mean, listening to people, trying to understand where they're coming from, why they believe what they do and act the way they do, without necessarily sympathizing in the sense that you don't have to agree with them, in fact, you may have to fight them, but it's always better to understand where they're coming from, even in order to fight them. VEDANTAM: Atran says his approach was inspired by the great anthropologist Margaret Mead and the dictum of an ancient Roman playwright. In recent testimony that you provided at the United Nations, you talked about something that you had learned from Margaret Mead, whom you worked with in New York many years ago. What exactly did Margaret Mead teach you? ATRAN: Well, she taught me that anthropology is basically a response, at least it was then, basically, a response to Terence's dictum, nothing human is alien to me. Violent people are - members of a militant political groups and religious groups are people just like everyone else. VEDANTAM: I want to take you back to something you told me a second ago. I just want to go back to this issue of empathizing versus sympathizing because when I look at the behavior of the Islamic State - and you sort of see this wanton disregard for human life, the deliberate cruelty, the beheadings, the rape, the enslavements of people - it's hard to bring yourself to think about empathizing with people who do this. ATRAN: Yes, it is. And that's why being an anthropologist often requires a special commitment to that sort of empathy. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: In the conventional narrative of how young people get recruited to groups such as ISIS, shadowy recruiters go in search of vulnerable people. Atran and psychologist Ariel Merari think this isn't the way it usually happens. In a study he has conducted in Israel among captured prisoners, Merari has interviewed a number of would-be suicide bombers. For various reasons, these recruits didn't carry out their missions. Their equipment didn't work, or they were caught before they could carry out an attack. Merari finds religious extremism is rarely a central motivator for these young people. He says most are driven by the political goal of ending the Israeli occupation. Now the political goals of Palestinian recruits fighting the Israeli occupation are different than the political goals of ISIS recruits. But, Merari's research shows there are underlying similarities in the psychological appeal of these groups. As in the case of ISIS, many Palestinian recruits report they are radicalized not in mosques but in university cafeterias. MERARI: Well, just imagine a young Palestinian, 16, 17, 18, 20 years old. He sits with his friends in the university's cafeteria. They're talking about yesterday's suicide attack that took place in Jerusalem. And everybody's saying, what a great guy that did it, how brave he was, how patriotic, a hero. And one of the guys there, or perhaps more than one, is, I'm in talking to young men, marginal in his own social circle. But he wants to be recognized as somebody. He wants to be appreciated. So he says, hey, you know, I would also carry out this suicide attack. VEDANTAM: Someone overhears the boast, and word gets back to the commander of a group looking for recruits. The commander sends for the young man. MERARI: He's 17, 18, 19 years old, youngster, stands in front of this elder commander, revered, famous, admired commander. And the commander asks him, I hear that you were willing to carry out a suicide attack. They don't call it suicide, of course. They call it martyrdom. Is that true? Now what would the other young guys say? No, I was just bragging. He says, oh, yes, of course. And he thinks, well, perhaps something will happen, and I won't have to carry it out eventually. VEDANTAM: The single best predictor of whether someone gets involved in a terrorist organization is if their friends and peers are also involved. In the case of the medical students, waves of British-Sudanese students have headed out to Syria. Atran told me that ISIS has explicitly laid out a path to gaining young recruits from around the world. ATRAN: And the strategy of the Islamic State is quite simple and very well-spelled out. And it is, first of all, take advantage wherever there is chaos in the world. Create chaos wherever the enemy allows us to do. And how do we do that? Well, in places like Europe, what we're going to do is attack tourist centers, cafes, theaters, stadiums. Why? Because these types of places cannot possibly be defended. There are just too many of them. There are too few security agencies in law enforcement, so it will terrorize the population and cause the states against us to disperse their resources in reckless ways that cannot possibly help them in the end. Second, we will appeal to the youth, the rebelliousness, the idealism, the adventure, the search for glory, the desire for change that youth have, while the fools, they say, will preach moderation, wasatiyyah, which is exactly what's been happening. We will offer them something great. And so what the Islamic State does - and this explains why many of those people in Europe, young people, are coming and from many other countries in the world, including the United States - is we will find out who in our enemy populations have grievances, have frustrated personal aspirations, have a need for something glorious, something that transcends themselves. We will draw that out, and we will whet it to the story we have of how the world should change and why. VEDANTAM: Over and over, Atran says, he finds that foreign recruits to the Islamic State are often marginal members of their own societies, people who feel like outsiders. ATRAN: Again, the Islamic State's message, why they are so good at it, is they take each of these personal stories, which they'll invest hundreds of hours in, and try to show why my personal frustration, your personal frustration, at this moment in your life, it's not because you couldn't get this job or that you failed in this or your team lost or whatever. The reason that happened, you see, is because of this larger set of factors, of this larger world set of forces that have been arrayed against you of which this is just a trivial part. And forget about the trivial parts that are affecting your life. Go now and deal with the real causes of the unhappiness, not only of you but of people like you around the world, the oppressed. VEDANTAM: When families of students who join the Islamic State appeal to them to come to their senses, the pleas are often ineffective because the young people have found a cause they think is greater than their parents, greater than their families - greater, even, than themselves. You can see the same behavior among followers in other groups and not just terrorist organizations - even nonviolent groups fighting for social justice. ATRAN: What we find - and this is not just true for the Islamic State, this is true for people who are willing to sacrifice their lives and kill others at the same time across the board. And it's also true for movements that are peaceful, but where the people who are driving these movements are willing to shed their own blood, for example, the Civil Rights Movement or movements like Gandhi's movement in India. They are committed to a set of values which are sacred. That means values which are immune to trade-offs. For example, you would not trade your children or your religion - probably - or your country for all the money in China. And when you have these kinds of values, which you will not trade off and which are not subject to the standard constraints of material life, things that occurred in the distant past or in distant places that are sacred are actually more important than things in the here and now. They're also oblivious to quantity. It doesn't matter if I kill one or I attract one or 1,000 or no one as long as my intention is good and righteous. And once you lock into these values, they're immune to social pressures. They're not norms. That is, even if your best friends, your family, your loved ones are against you, you will not see an exit strategy. VEDANTAM: Scott Atran has conducted psychological experiments with captured Islamic State fighters on the battlefield. ATRAN: We were in Kirkuk. So there's a front there - mud walls that extend for 1,000 kilometers. And about every kilometer there's a mud turret with about 20 fighters inside. And that's where we were working. And we got a hold of some captured Islamic State fighters, and we ran these experiments. VEDANTAM: In one set of experiments, Atran evaluated how much a fighter had adopted the identity of the group over all the other identities the person might have. Atran and his colleagues found that when a fighter's identity fuses with the identity of the group, there is a psychological change that occurs. ATRAN: We have many identities. We may be American or Indian or Red Sox fans or Yankee fans or lawyers or doctors or whatever we are today or tomorrow. But they have only one identity. And they will fight and die, not just for that group but for every single individual in that group. And once this happens, we also have other measures which show they develop a sense of invincibility and actually perceive themselves, their own bodies, to be much bigger than they actually are. And they perceive the other group to be much weaker. VEDANTAM: This idea has a lot of support elsewhere in the social sciences. In some ways, being part of a group is a way of creating an immortal version of yourself. When you remind people of their mortality, for example, they express stronger support for the groups to which they belong. You may die, but your identity in the group will outlive you. I asked Atrin and Merari about how they would apply what they have learned to doing battle with the Islamic State. MERARI: I think it's very important, if you want to fight effectively against militant Islam, you have first of all to defeat it physically despite what people say about hearts and minds. You know, in the Second World War, there was a Russian Soviet ambassador in London. His name was Maisky - Ivan Maisky. And once, somebody asked, Ambassador Maisky, what is a good psychological warfare - talking about hearts and minds - what's a good psychological warfare? And Maisky replied, a good psychological warfare is facts and figures - facts being victories and figures being dead Germans. And I think in a bit more moderate sense, this applies also to the current situation. If you want to effectively fight ISIS, first of all defeat ISIS in the territory that it has occupied successfully. That's the first thing you have to do. And I don't understand why the West hasn't done it yet. VEDANTAM: Atran says psychological weapons might also be needed to fight ISIS. Preaching the virtues of moderation isn't going to work. ATRAN: They think things will work out. And telling them again and again this isn't true Islam - that alone isn't going to do it. You've got to get into their networks. You've got to befriend them. You've got to get the friends - it's like smoking. It's not showing them pictures of cancerous esophagi that are going to stop people from smoking. It's young people getting other young people to stop smoking. Of course, there can be constraining laws and barriers to smoking. But what will really stop them is if their friends have stopped. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Two brothers, Ibrahim and Mohamed Ageed, are thought to be among the British medical students who left Sudan to join the Islamic State in Syria. They left right before they were supposed to take their final exams in their last year of medical school. The last post on Mohamed's Facebook page is from December 30, 2014. Most of his posts are of funny videos, pictures of his brother and friends, and soccer teams. Mohamed has 480 friends, likes Coldplay and \"The Fresh Prince Of Bel Air. \" Ibrahim has 546 friends. He likes Manchester United, Beyonce and Eminem, and the TV shows, \"The Boondocks\" and \"Everybody Hates Chris. \" News reports show that recruits are not allowed to leave the Islamic State if they dislike what they find when they get to Syria. The disloyal are often executed. The British medical students who left Sudan are in touch with their parents through social media apps. They offer few details of what they're doing except to say they're using their medical training. Sometimes they send texts with short audio messages. To their waiting families, these messages feel terse and uninformative. They don't sound like the young people they used to be. Their parents say they sound different.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEVE INSKEEP, BYLINE: We're learning more at this hour about a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. , about an hour east of Los Angeles. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: We have two suspects, both dressed in black. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BARACK OBAMA: It is clear that the two of them had gone down the dark path of radicalization, embracing a perverted interpretation of Islam that calls for war against America and the West. They had stockpiled assault weapons, ammunition and pipe bombs. So this was an act of terrorism designed to kill innocent people. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST:  Every time there's a terrorist attack, we ask ourselves, what motivates people to do this? The attacks seem barbaric, nihilistic. But is it that simple? Is that what's really going on? On this week's podcast, we explore the psychology of international terrorist organizations and why so many young people join them. Battlefield experiments conducted with fighters for ISIS and al-Qaida reveal patterns in the mental makeup of terrorists. We'll use the lens of anthropologist Scott Atran to explore the strange hold these organizations have on young minds. SCOTT ATRAN: Once you lock into these values, they're immune to social pressures. They're not norms. That is, even if your best friends, your family, your loved ones are against you, you will not see an exit strategy. VEDANTAM: We'll also examine the phenomenon President Obama calls radicalization. Is it driven by shadowy recruiters or by what Israeli psychologist Ariel Merari would describe as peer pressure in university cafeterias? ARIEL MERARI: In the university's cafeteria, he says, hey, you know, I'm also willing to debate. I would also carry out the attack. VEDANTAM: And we'll explore the psychology of violence - what happens when brutality is practiced as a form of theater. ATRAN: The spilling of blood - the brutality - accomplishes two things. First of all, it binds people together who are doing it. And the second thing it does is it scares the hell out of enemies and fence-sitters. VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedanta. Regularly on this podcast, we present counterintuitive thinking - researchers with analyses that challenge popular beliefs - well-held views or notions. This episode is no different. I first came by the work of Scott Atran and Ariel Merari several years ago. I found their research on terrorism counterintuitive. Where some think brainwashing is the sole cause of people being recruited to ISIS and like-minded terror organizations, Atran and Merari suggest that peer networks matter more - much more. In the popular imagination, it is religious extremism that drives terrorists. But these social scientists argue that religion is often a secondary factor. Where many of us might say that terrorists are morally warped or purely evil, Atran and Merari would point to the role of hidden psychological forces. I should say the views of these researchers are not universally shared, but especially in the aftermath of the San Bernardino shootings, I felt their views might be useful to hear. ATRAN: I got a call from the medical school in Khartoum the other day, where a professor at the medical school said that her best students have just gone on to found a medical unit for the Islamic State. And this was completely unexpected. And what should she do about it? What should the school about it? VEDANTAM: This is Scott Atran. He's an anthropologist who works at the University of Oxford, the University of Michigan and the French National Center For Scientific Research. He has traveled to the frontlines of war zones - to cafes in Morocco and housing projects in the Paris suburbs. He has spent many years trying to understand why people are drawn to join groups such as ISIS, which is also known as the Islamic State. ATRAN: So I get a call saying, will you talk to us? Our students - we don't understand this. They were our best students, our brightest students. And they went off to establish a medical clinic, we found out, with the Islamic State. Their parents are hysterical. We don't know what to tell them. Can you tell us what's going on? VEDANTAM: The students were of Sudanese ancestry and most had British passports. They came from well-to-do families. They had promising careers ahead of them. Families of the medical students were dumbstruck. The heartbroken sister of one student spoke to the Daily Mail in Britain. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: And we just want her home. We want her safe. Her family, we love her more than anybody else in this world can. Nobody in this world can love her more than we do. My little sister, she's an A star student. They're preying on young, innocent girls and it's just - it's not right. VEDANTAM: Atran said he told the teachers of the medical school the same thing he has been preaching for years to governments and more recently at the United Nations. ATRAN: I said, listen, I can't give you the solution. The solution has to be for you to pay attention, to listen to what they're telling you. I mean, obviously, if you had listened to them and engaged with them, you would have had indications of what was happening. And you would have been able to talk to them. But like parents, the older authorities, again, know nothing and again, are preaching nonsense things like moderation or this isn't true Islam, or whatever bologna they're giving them today. And of course, it means nothing. VEDANTAM: Meaning it isn't effective. It's falling on deaf ears. Atran believes these messages won't be effective because they fundamentally misunderstand why the young medical students were drawn to the Islamic State. The authorities painted the recruits as drawn to nihilism. Atran thinks it has more to do with a twisted idealism. ATRAN: The Islamic State Revolution is a revolution. There really isn't much difference I see in the impulse, or the impetus, to the Islamic State Revolution than to the French Revolution or to the Bolshevik Revolution or to the National Socialist Revolution. And it appeals to the same sorts of people. VEDANTAM: Comparing the Islamic State to the French Revolution or the Bolshevik Revolution doesn't mean it will succeed. Lots of revolutions fail. But if Atran is right, it does mean that it would be a big mistake to underestimate the draw of the Islamic State. In one ISIS video, a young British man looks into the camera. He has a stethoscope around his neck. He leans in with an earnest expression. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: All the people in England, I ask you again. All the Muslims over there, taqwallah, leave the land of England and come here to make hijra here in wilayat al-khayr and in dawlat al-Islam. And help your brothers and sisters out here. Wallahi, there is a great cause being fought here, and the caravan is leaving. ATRAN: George Orwell, in his review of \"Mein Kampf\" back in 1939 - I'm not crazy about ad Hitleriums but this was a particularly insightful piece - he said, what is it about Mr. Hitler that appeals? What is the essence of the problem? Look at our societies. Capitalist societies offer their people ease, avoidance of risk and pain, security - in short, the good life. And what is the result? Well, the Oxford Student Union, the cream of our intellectuals, votes they will never fight again. And Mr. Hitler, what is he offering his people? Glory, adventure, even death and destruction, but most of all transcendence and a feeling of self-sacrifice. So Mr. Hitler has understood the essence of human beings. Human beings need not just short working hours and comfort and security and avoidance of pain. They need, at least intermittently, a feeling of transcendence and self-sacrifice. And so 80 million people now fall down at his feet. And in fact, the German soldiers in World War II outfought on any measure the Allied soldiers, be they Russian or American or Brits. VEDANTAM: Scott Atran says he sees the same conviction among Islamic State fighters. He was recently talking with Kurdish and Iraqi soldiers a short distance from the front lines in the battle with ISIS. ATRAN: The Islamic State came in June of 2014 in about 80 trucks of four to five people a truck, about 350 people, to free a prison, Badush prison, because freeing prisoners gains you recruits. They also massacred 600 Shia in that prison. But the Iraqi army, trained by the United States, armed by the United States to the tune of billions of dollars, simply ran away. Now there was one unit on the Machmore (ph) front in a place called Garamelli (ph), where we had a few Iraqi soldiers embedded with the Peshmerga. And the reason they stayed was because their families actually lived in villages close by. And I asked them, why is it that your fellow soldiers simply ran away or melted into the city? And one said to me, they simply didn't want their heads cut off. VEDANTAM: When we hear reports of beheadings or prisoners being set on fire, the Islamic State's seemingly indiscriminate violence shock us. But the shock can keep us from seeing that such theatrical displays of brutality actually serve psychological goals. ATRAN: The spilling of blood, the brutality, accomplishes two things and usually has done that throughout the human history and across cultures. First of all, it binds people together who are doing it. And the second thing it does it scares the hell out of enemies and fence-sitters.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. When British engineer Ahmed Muthana realized his medical student son had left the family home in Cardiff in the United Kingdom to join the Islamic State, he was enraged. Police came to his home and showed him a video of his son, Nasser, trying to recruit others to join ISIS. I feel sick and devastated that my son is caught up in this, he told the Daily Mail. He was brought up to love and respect my country, which is Britain. I am his father, and naturally, I am worried about his safety while he's out there, but I am also worried about the evil messages he is spreading in this video. Muthana said he rid his house of photographs of Nasser saying, it's a Muslim thing. You don't keep the devil in your house. Atran thinks it's understandable that parents would express shock, disbelief and anger. But he thinks a more productive approach is to look at the young people drawn to terrorist groups with a measure of empathy. ATRAN: By empathizing, I mean, listening to people, trying to understand where they're coming from, why they believe what they do and act the way they do, without necessarily sympathizing in the sense that you don't have to agree with them, in fact, you may have to fight them, but it's always better to understand where they're coming from, even in order to fight them. VEDANTAM: Atran says his approach was inspired by the great anthropologist Margaret Mead and the dictum of an ancient Roman playwright. In recent testimony that you provided at the United Nations, you talked about something that you had learned from Margaret Mead, whom you worked with in New York many years ago. What exactly did Margaret Mead teach you? ATRAN: Well, she taught me that anthropology is basically a response, at least it was then, basically, a response to Terence's dictum, nothing human is alien to me. Violent people are - members of a militant political groups and religious groups are people just like everyone else. VEDANTAM: I want to take you back to something you told me a second ago. I just want to go back to this issue of empathizing versus sympathizing because when I look at the behavior of the Islamic State - and you sort of see this wanton disregard for human life, the deliberate cruelty, the beheadings, the rape, the enslavements of people - it's hard to bring yourself to think about empathizing with people who do this. ATRAN: Yes, it is. And that's why being an anthropologist often requires a special commitment to that sort of empathy. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: In the conventional narrative of how young people get recruited to groups such as ISIS, shadowy recruiters go in search of vulnerable people. Atran and psychologist Ariel Merari think this isn't the way it usually happens. In a study he has conducted in Israel among captured prisoners, Merari has interviewed a number of would-be suicide bombers. For various reasons, these recruits didn't carry out their missions. Their equipment didn't work, or they were caught before they could carry out an attack. Merari finds religious extremism is rarely a central motivator for these young people. He says most are driven by the political goal of ending the Israeli occupation. Now the political goals of Palestinian recruits fighting the Israeli occupation are different than the political goals of ISIS recruits. But, Merari's research shows there are underlying similarities in the psychological appeal of these groups. As in the case of ISIS, many Palestinian recruits report they are radicalized not in mosques but in university cafeterias. MERARI: Well, just imagine a young Palestinian, 16, 17, 18, 20 years old. He sits with his friends in the university's cafeteria. They're talking about yesterday's suicide attack that took place in Jerusalem. And everybody's saying, what a great guy that did it, how brave he was, how patriotic, a hero. And one of the guys there, or perhaps more than one, is, I'm in talking to young men, marginal in his own social circle. But he wants to be recognized as somebody. He wants to be appreciated. So he says, hey, you know, I would also carry out this suicide attack. VEDANTAM: Someone overhears the boast, and word gets back to the commander of a group looking for recruits. The commander sends for the young man. MERARI: He's 17, 18, 19 years old, youngster, stands in front of this elder commander, revered, famous, admired commander. And the commander asks him, I hear that you were willing to carry out a suicide attack. They don't call it suicide, of course. They call it martyrdom. Is that true? Now what would the other young guys say? No, I was just bragging. He says, oh, yes, of course. And he thinks, well, perhaps something will happen, and I won't have to carry it out eventually. VEDANTAM: The single best predictor of whether someone gets involved in a terrorist organization is if their friends and peers are also involved. In the case of the medical students, waves of British-Sudanese students have headed out to Syria. Atran told me that ISIS has explicitly laid out a path to gaining young recruits from around the world. ATRAN: And the strategy of the Islamic State is quite simple and very well-spelled out. And it is, first of all, take advantage wherever there is chaos in the world. Create chaos wherever the enemy allows us to do. And how do we do that? Well, in places like Europe, what we're going to do is attack tourist centers, cafes, theaters, stadiums. Why? Because these types of places cannot possibly be defended. There are just too many of them. There are too few security agencies in law enforcement, so it will terrorize the population and cause the states against us to disperse their resources in reckless ways that cannot possibly help them in the end. Second, we will appeal to the youth, the rebelliousness, the idealism, the adventure, the search for glory, the desire for change that youth have, while the fools, they say, will preach moderation, wasatiyyah, which is exactly what's been happening. We will offer them something great. And so what the Islamic State does - and this explains why many of those people in Europe, young people, are coming and from many other countries in the world, including the United States - is we will find out who in our enemy populations have grievances, have frustrated personal aspirations, have a need for something glorious, something that transcends themselves. We will draw that out, and we will whet it to the story we have of how the world should change and why. VEDANTAM: Over and over, Atran says, he finds that foreign recruits to the Islamic State are often marginal members of their own societies, people who feel like outsiders. ATRAN: Again, the Islamic State's message, why they are so good at it, is they take each of these personal stories, which they'll invest hundreds of hours in, and try to show why my personal frustration, your personal frustration, at this moment in your life, it's not because you couldn't get this job or that you failed in this or your team lost or whatever. The reason that happened, you see, is because of this larger set of factors, of this larger world set of forces that have been arrayed against you of which this is just a trivial part. And forget about the trivial parts that are affecting your life. Go now and deal with the real causes of the unhappiness, not only of you but of people like you around the world, the oppressed. VEDANTAM: When families of students who join the Islamic State appeal to them to come to their senses, the pleas are often ineffective because the young people have found a cause they think is greater than their parents, greater than their families - greater, even, than themselves. You can see the same behavior among followers in other groups and not just terrorist organizations - even nonviolent groups fighting for social justice. ATRAN: What we find - and this is not just true for the Islamic State, this is true for people who are willing to sacrifice their lives and kill others at the same time across the board. And it's also true for movements that are peaceful, but where the people who are driving these movements are willing to shed their own blood, for example, the Civil Rights Movement or movements like Gandhi's movement in India. They are committed to a set of values which are sacred. That means values which are immune to trade-offs. For example, you would not trade your children or your religion - probably - or your country for all the money in China. And when you have these kinds of values, which you will not trade off and which are not subject to the standard constraints of material life, things that occurred in the distant past or in distant places that are sacred are actually more important than things in the here and now. They're also oblivious to quantity. It doesn't matter if I kill one or I attract one or 1,000 or no one as long as my intention is good and righteous. And once you lock into these values, they're immune to social pressures. They're not norms. That is, even if your best friends, your family, your loved ones are against you, you will not see an exit strategy. VEDANTAM: Scott Atran has conducted psychological experiments with captured Islamic State fighters on the battlefield. ATRAN: We were in Kirkuk. So there's a front there - mud walls that extend for 1,000 kilometers. And about every kilometer there's a mud turret with about 20 fighters inside. And that's where we were working. And we got a hold of some captured Islamic State fighters, and we ran these experiments. VEDANTAM: In one set of experiments, Atran evaluated how much a fighter had adopted the identity of the group over all the other identities the person might have. Atran and his colleagues found that when a fighter's identity fuses with the identity of the group, there is a psychological change that occurs. ATRAN: We have many identities. We may be American or Indian or Red Sox fans or Yankee fans or lawyers or doctors or whatever we are today or tomorrow. But they have only one identity. And they will fight and die, not just for that group but for every single individual in that group. And once this happens, we also have other measures which show they develop a sense of invincibility and actually perceive themselves, their own bodies, to be much bigger than they actually are. And they perceive the other group to be much weaker. VEDANTAM: This idea has a lot of support elsewhere in the social sciences. In some ways, being part of a group is a way of creating an immortal version of yourself. When you remind people of their mortality, for example, they express stronger support for the groups to which they belong. You may die, but your identity in the group will outlive you. I asked Atrin and Merari about how they would apply what they have learned to doing battle with the Islamic State.

Harvard Business School researcher Dylan Minor calls this kind of person the toxic worker. He's written a new paper on the impact of these people on the workplace, and he joins us now. Welcome to the show. DYLAN MINOR: Thank you for having me. SHAPIRO: You looked at employment data from more than 50,000 workers across 11 companies. What did you find that toxic workers all have in common? MINOR: I found several things. So it's not that literally every toxic worker is the same, but there certainly are some command traits. One thing I found is, on average, they tend to be much more productive. I also found that toxic workers tend to be more selfish than the average worker, tend to be more overconfident. And lastly and, I think, interestingly, surprisingly, to me, they also self-profess to follow the rules. SHAPIRO: So some of those things don't seem to fit with the others - more productive than average, for example. You found that toxic workers are harmful to the workplace. How do you reconcile that with the idea that they're more productive than the average worker? MINOR: Well, they're - presents itself a trade-off. So one area in particular is overconfidence. It turns out that those workers that are overconfident do indeed tend to be quite a bit more productive. However, those workers that are overconfident also are more likely to be toxic. And so fortunately, in this setting, we actually had the data that we could look at the effects of profits. And if you look at those two features together - that is, increased likelihood of productivity and increased likelihood of toxicity - you're actually still taking on a net thousand-dollar loss per worker that has greater confidence. SHAPIRO: A net $1,000 loss per worker. So you're actually able to quantify how bad for business a toxic worker is. MINOR: Correct. And in the most extreme version, I did a comparison of a toxic worker - the average toxic worker - to a superstar. We do a lot of work both in practice and in academia looking for the next superstar, how to find. . . SHAPIRO: That's a technical term - a superstar. MINOR: . . . How to find them, how to motive them. The superstar - exactly. So in this particular paper, I define a superstar as - simply as the person that's in the top 1 percent of all productivity, and I find that individual, on average, saves the firm or increases profit about $5,000 per (unintelligible). The way we think about that is - what a superstar's doing is producing more things than the average worker. And so we can essentially look at how much they're saving us in wages. We have to pay them a bit more, but there still are some savings because they're so productive. So we can compare that to the toxic worker. In one area they have good measures - these companies I studied - is the cost of turnover. And so a toxic worker, as it turns out, as they enter a team, the turnover goes up, and so we can measure, what is that increased cost? And so that increased cost of turnover tends to be about $12,000 for a toxic worker. SHAPIRO: Well, Dylan Minor, what advice do you have for employees or for bosses who are in the workplace with one of these toxic workers? MINOR: So several things. Just stepping back one step - of course, the ideal is avoid them altogether. But once they're currently there, it's very important to look at workers in more of a multidimensional basis. I find that many managers are focused on the productivity end. And just like that example of overconfidence, if you just choose on overconfidence when you look at productivity, you would hire that person. But if you look at both dimensions, you're also worried about potential toxicity and you want to hire someone that's a greater corporate citizen, then, in that case, you probably wouldn't hire the more confident worker. SHAPIRO: That's Dylan Minor, a researcher at Harvard Business School on the subject of the toxic worker - great talking to you. Thanks for joining us. MINOR: Thank you. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  Every workplace has them, maybe even NASA - the coworker who steals pens and pencils, the bully everyone avoids, the big shot who brags about golfing with the boss. Harvard Business School researcher Dylan Minor calls this kind of person the toxic worker. He's written a new paper on the impact of these people on the workplace, and he joins us now. Welcome to the show. DYLAN MINOR: Thank you for having me. SHAPIRO: You looked at employment data from more than 50,000 workers across 11 companies. What did you find that toxic workers all have in common? MINOR: I found several things. So it's not that literally every toxic worker is the same, but there certainly are some command traits. One thing I found is, on average, they tend to be much more productive. I also found that toxic workers tend to be more selfish than the average worker, tend to be more overconfident. And lastly and, I think, interestingly, surprisingly, to me, they also self-profess to follow the rules. SHAPIRO: So some of those things don't seem to fit with the others - more productive than average, for example. You found that toxic workers are harmful to the workplace. How do you reconcile that with the idea that they're more productive than the average worker? MINOR: Well, they're - presents itself a trade-off. So one area in particular is overconfidence. It turns out that those workers that are overconfident do indeed tend to be quite a bit more productive. However, those workers that are overconfident also are more likely to be toxic. And so fortunately, in this setting, we actually had the data that we could look at the effects of profits. And if you look at those two features together - that is, increased likelihood of productivity and increased likelihood of toxicity - you're actually still taking on a net thousand-dollar loss per worker that has greater confidence. SHAPIRO: A net $1,000 loss per worker. So you're actually able to quantify how bad for business a toxic worker is. MINOR: Correct. And in the most extreme version, I did a comparison of a toxic worker - the average toxic worker - to a superstar. We do a lot of work both in practice and in academia looking for the next superstar, how to find. . . SHAPIRO: That's a technical term - a superstar. MINOR: . . . How to find them, how to motive them. The superstar - exactly. So in this particular paper, I define a superstar as - simply as the person that's in the top 1 percent of all productivity, and I find that individual, on average, saves the firm or increases profit about $5,000 per (unintelligible). The way we think about that is - what a superstar's doing is producing more things than the average worker. And so we can essentially look at how much they're saving us in wages. We have to pay them a bit more, but there still are some savings because they're so productive. So we can compare that to the toxic worker. In one area they have good measures - these companies I studied - is the cost of turnover. And so a toxic worker, as it turns out, as they enter a team, the turnover goes up, and so we can measure, what is that increased cost? And so that increased cost of turnover tends to be about $12,000 for a toxic worker. SHAPIRO: Well, Dylan Minor, what advice do you have for employees or for bosses who are in the workplace with one of these toxic workers? MINOR: So several things. Just stepping back one step - of course, the ideal is avoid them altogether. But once they're currently there, it's very important to look at workers in more of a multidimensional basis. I find that many managers are focused on the productivity end. And just like that example of overconfidence, if you just choose on overconfidence when you look at productivity, you would hire that person. But if you look at both dimensions, you're also worried about potential toxicity and you want to hire someone that's a greater corporate citizen, then, in that case, you probably wouldn't hire the more confident worker.

ADAM COLE, BYLINE: For Charlie Bolden, it started in seventh grade. He'd hurry home after school to catch his favorite show. CHARLIE BOLDEN: \"Men Of Annapolis\" - it was a regular program on television. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MEN OF ANNAPOLIS\")UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Yes, this is Annapolis, the United States Naval Academy. BOLDEN: That's where I wanted to go to college. COLE: But Bolden was a black teenager from the segregated South, and his congressman wouldn't give him the required nomination. An Illinois congressman opened the way to the academy instead, and Bolden began his military career. He flew in Vietnam, became a test pilot, was selected to become an astronaut in 1980, the beginning of the space shuttle era. For Mike Massimino, it started with a different broadcast. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NEIL ARMSTRONG: That's one small step for man. . . MIKE MASSIMINO: I was six years old when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon and wanted to be an astronaut, dressed up like an astronaut for Halloween, played astronaut in my back yard with my little astronaut Snoopy. COLE: But growing up in Franklin Square, Long Island, that dream started to seem ridiculous. MASSIMINO: I didn't know anybody that was an astronaut. COLE: So Massimino went to Columbia to become an engineer. There were lots of engineers in Long Island, but 16 years later, in 1996, he was accepted to the Astronaut Corps. Maria Banks is applying this year. In college, she studied harp performance. And when she graduated, she found a job playing on a cruise ship that traveled all over the world. MARIA BANKS: I would take soil samples and rock samples and hide them in my suitcase and (laughter) every day I would try to find the most geologically interesting thing I could do - climb a volcano or hike a desert, hike on glaciers. COLE: That sent her back to school, where she studied the fingerprints of glaciers on Mars. Different backgrounds, different eras - but these three people - a pilot, an engineer and a planetary geologist - all felt the same way about applying. BOLDEN: I was convinced that I did not stand any chance. MASSIMINO: I thought there was no way they were going to pick me. BANKS: I guess I didn't believe it was maybe an attainable goal. COLE: But they still applied. The process hasn't changed much in the past 35 years. Everyone submits an application proving their basic qualifications. Astronauts need a degree in a scientific field and three years of experience. They need vision that's correctable to 20-20, and they can't be taller than 6-foot-4. But most of all. . . BOLDEN: If you're not tops at what you're doing now, you're not going to be selected. COLE: Charles Bolden was tops. He went on to pilot two shuttle missions and commanded two more. He helped put the Hubble Telescope into orbit. Today, he's the head of NASA. Mike Massimino was tops, too, but it took him four tries to get accepted. He first applied in 1989. MASSIMINO: And I was told, no. COLE: Then 1991. MASSIMINO: No again a second time. COLE: In 1994, he made it to the interview round. MASSIMINO: And then you go back and wait. And I was told, no. COLE: Finally, in 1996, he was accepted. He flew on two shuttle missions and helped repair the Hubble Telescope. Today, he's a professor at Columbia. This round will be Maria Bank's third attempt. BANKS: Just keep trying. Those are the words I kept hearing from all of the astronauts I talked with. COLE: But if she's accepted, what will her mission be? The shuttle program ended in 2011, and since then, NASA has been accused of lacking clear goals. But Bolden says future astronauts have a lot to look forward to. BOLDEN: They are going to be the trailblazers for our ventures to Mars. COLE: He says they'll fly new spacecraft and return to lunar orbit for the first time since 1972. BANKS: It all sounds fantastic to me. I would be happy doing just about anything. COLE: She's preparing to submit her application before the February 18 deadline. Adam Cole, NPR News.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: As I look back on this year, one thing I see is that so much of our steady, persistent work over the years is paying off for the American people in big tangible ways. MONTAGNE: This was a year when Obama finally reached a nuclear deal with Iran and a climate deal with most of the world. Those agreements took years. Obama's supporters argue he's playing the long game. An even longer game begins soon. The president discussed it with Steve Inskeep during a year-end interview. STEVE INSKEEP, BYLINE: That longer game comes after the president is gone. We discussed this on the red carpet of the White House Cabinet room where a new president will preside in just over a year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)INSKEEP: Whoever takes over this office after you might be a Democrat, might be a Republican. There may be a Republican Congress again. There likely will be a majority of Republican governors across the country, Republican state legislatures because Democrats have lost so very many elections in the last several years. How much risk is there that they will undo large parts of your legacy as many Republicans actually have promised to do? OBAMA: Well, first of all, I'm confident that a Democrat will win the White House. And I think when you look at the quality of our Democratic candidates and what the Republican Party seems to be offering up, I think we'll do well. Second of all, I think we've got a good chance of winning back the Senate. INSKEEP: Democrats are given a chance of gaining ground in 2016, but they have suffered profound election defeats during Obama's tenure. The president blames this in part on redistricting. Democrats had a terrible year in 2010, allowing Republicans more power in drawing up election district maps soon after. The president dismisses the idea that his policies are to blame. He's hoping Democrats will run on his record. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)OBAMA: And I think we've got a great track record of real progress on a whole range of fronts. And if we make those arguments clearly and forthrightly and aren't defensive, then I'm actually confident we'll do just fine. INSKEEP: Have you insulated the climate deal, for example, which is so important to your legacy, from being undone by a future president, given that many of the commitments you made in Paris are not legally binding? OBAMA: Well, keep in mind that the Republican Party in the United States is perhaps literally the only major party in the developed world that is still engaging in climate denial. Even far-right parties in other places acknowledge that the science shows that temperatures are going up, and that that is a really dangerous thing, and we've got to do something about it. And the deal that we struck in Paris was an example of American leadership at its best. We were able to mobilize 200 countries to make serious commitments that are transparent, where every country is going to be held accountable, where everybody chips in. And it doesn't solve the entire problem, but it puts the world on track to deal with a problem that could be monumental in its effect if we don't do something about it. Now the Republican Party right now is still resistant to it, but I'm confident that given the progress we can make with the clean power plant rule that reduces carbon emissions through our power plants. . . INSKEEP: Which dozens of Republican governors are suing. OBAMA: Well, they opposed, but it's under the Clean Air Act, and we're confident that it's within our power. I think that the signal that we're sending to the private sector, that will in turn invest heavily in solar and wind and battery technologies, the doubling of fuel efficiency standards on cars, all these things start taking on a momentum of their own. INSKEEP: The president contends the use of clean energy is soaring. Solar power, for example, still provides only a tiny percentage of U. S. energy, though Obama says it is 20 times greater than it was when he took office. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)OBAMA: And the reason is is because people started adapting, and it turns out, hey, Americans know how to innovate. And what we decide. . . INSKEEP: So they can't stop you? OBAMA: What it means is that by the time that even a Republican president came into office, what you would have seen would be a growing realization that not only should we do something about climate change, but it's not only a challenge, it's also an opportunity, that it's creating jobs, that it's making a difference in people's lives, that consumers are saving money. INSKEEP: In other words, the president contends his programs will survive any election results. The political reality may be more complex. Democrats believe they have an advantage on this issue. Hillary Clinton, for example, is planning to make climate change a major theme if nominated. That could give her a mandate to move beyond Obama's record if she wins. Of course, if Democrats lose, that would create a different political landscape on climate. In the end, Obama is counting on his achievements to sell themselves. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)OBAMA: When I doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars, that puts money in people's pockets. When you retrofit a building so that it's got better temperature control and you cut your light bill by 20 percent, 30 percent, you know what? Even consumers or even Republican consumers end up saying, that's not a bad deal. In fact, when it comes to solar power, you've got this weird coalition between environmentalists and tea partiers in some Western states because the traditional dirty fuel industry is trying to prevent a greater utilization of solar power. And so a lot of these things get institutionalized not just through government policy but through the impact that it has on the marketplace and the private sector. INSKEEP: President Obama in a year-end interview, reflecting on how much of his legacy will outlast him. MONTAGNE: And there is more of Steve's conversation to come. Next Monday, the president poses a question to his successor. At npr. org, you can find video of the president's remarks on ISIS, race and Donald Trump.

This simple action has been critical to the science of weather forecasting for decades. In Alaska, John Ryan of member station KUCB in the town of Unalaska tagged along with a scientist at one of America's most remote weather stations. JOHN RYAN, BYLINE: Three-hundred miles off Alaska's West Coast is St. Paul Island, and William Wells mans the weather station there. It's a few miles outside the village of 700 people who call the island home. Each afternoon, he walked from his office to a two-story cavernous garage. That's where he fills up a 6-foot-wide balloon. Helium is too expensive in the middle of the Bering Sea, so Wells uses explosive hydrogen that's generated right there in the garage. WILLIAM WELLS: But we're under no threat right now 'cause it's contained safely within that latex. RYAN: Once the big latex balloon is inflated, Wells ties a string and a small electronic gadget to the balloon. WELLS: It tracks the temperature, relative humidity and wind speed and wind direction as it goes up through the atmosphere, and it's supposed to give us a relative atmospheric profile. RYAN: He opens up a double-tall garage door. Then he grabs the balloon string. When the clock strikes 3. . . WELLS: I'm going to run out. RYAN: He sprints onto the tundra toward a gravel road. As the balloon clears the door, a 30-knot wind whips it to the east. The balloon is pummeled into a shape kind of like a 3-D comma. Once Wells reaches the road, he releases the balloon. It takes off more sideways than up. The gadget dangling below knocks his Carolina Panthers ski cap right of his head. He grabs his hat and returns to the garage. WELLS: Now, I'm going to apologize to you, but I'm going to take off almost at full-bore sprint. RYAN: He dashes a hundred yards back to his office to make sure the balloon is sending data. WELLS: We are such a remote location. Our data is pretty precious. RYAN: It gets used within the hour in the 4 p. m. forecast that mariners in the Bering Sea rely on. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: K-J-Y-73 on St Paul Island - tonight, west wind, 30 knots - sea, 16 feet, snow showers. RYAN: Wells is a continent away from his native North Carolina, but he says he couldn't be happier. WELLS: I feel privileged to be doing this. RYAN: He says his two-and-a-half years on the outer limits of the last frontier have been good for him. WELLS: I lost 25 pounds after I moved up here because I didn't have the temptations of fast food restaurants. RYAN: It's a different career path from his fellow meteorologists who put on makeup and sweep their arms in front of weather maps. WELLS: They can have the TV and the radio. I'm stick with this. RYAN: But Wells' gig might not last long. The National Weather Service is testing a device that would automatically launch the balloons. Soon, at weather stations across the country, machines could replace human balloon launchers. For NPR News, I'm John Ryan in St. Paul, Alaska.

It takes off more sideways than up. The gadget dangling below knocks his Carolina Panthers ski cap right of his head. He grabs his hat and returns to the garage. WELLS: Now, I'm going to apologize to you, but I'm going to take off almost at full-bore sprint. RYAN: He dashes a hundred yards back to his office to make sure the balloon is sending data. WELLS: We are such a remote location. Our data is pretty precious. RYAN: It gets used within the hour in the 4 p. m. forecast that mariners in the Bering Sea rely on. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: K-J-Y-73 on St Paul Island - tonight, west wind, 30 knots - sea, 16 feet, snow showers. RYAN: Wells is a continent away from his native North Carolina, but he says he couldn't be happier. WELLS: I feel privileged to be doing this. RYAN: He says his two-and-a-half years on the outer limits of the last frontier have been good for him. WELLS: I lost 25 pounds after I moved up here because I didn't have the temptations of fast food restaurants. RYAN: It's a different career path from his fellow meteorologists who put on makeup and sweep their arms in front of weather maps. WELLS: They can have the TV and the radio. I'm stick with this. RYAN: But Wells' gig might not last long. The National Weather Service is testing a device that would automatically launch the balloons. Soon, at weather stations across the country, machines could replace human balloon launchers.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. The holiday season is a time of giving to our friends and loved ones, but also to strangers in the form of donations or charity. On this week's episode, we'll explore the psychology of giving. We look at what motivates us to give to charities. . . JOHN LIST: Once they see that there's a solicitor at the door, they say, oh my God, I wish I would have stayed on the couch watching the football game. VEDANTAM: . . . Why it's okay to be a re-gifter and why sometimes lying to small children can be a gift. DANIEL PINK, BYLINE: Fair point. But I just think you've totally lost our 8-and-under demographic. VEDANTAM: Finally, well-known philanthropist Adam Cole is back. He's going to give us the gift of music and tie the episode together with a song. . . ADAM COLE, BYLINE: . . . Inspired by those really cheesy Christmas specials in which children dance around in brightly-colored sweaters. VEDANTAM: Lots of us make charitable donations of the holiday season. Maybe you write a few checks; maybe you donate online; or maybe you can ask directly at a shopping mall or the grocery store. But what motivates you to give? And does it change with the situation? One of our producers, Maggie Penman, and our news assistant, Max Nesterak, went to investigate. MAGGIE PENMAN, BYLINE: So Max and I went to the Giant in Silver Spring, Md. It's a big, suburban grocery store - very busy on a Saturday afternoon. But we came not to shop, but for another reason. MAX NESTERAK, BYLINE: Right, we waited in front of the Salvation Army collection. We met a nice woman there named Lisa Ingram (ph) with a Santa hat on that said naughty. She was ringing her bell and people were dropping in their loose change, a few dollar bills. I saw someone put a ten in. We really wanted to know why. PENMAN: And the first person we talked to was Charles J. Barber, Jr. He seemed like a really popular guy - even in our very short interview he kept getting interrupted by his friends walking by. CHARLES J. BARBER JR. : But - hey, how are you doing? PENMAN: But he said for him it's about being able to empathize with people who are in need. BARBER: Some of us are just a stone's throw away from, you know, being, you know, in a bad place too. So hopefully this helps people who need it. NESTERAK: Next, there was Gerald Backton (ph). GERALD BACKTON: Extra change that I have - I mean, every little bit counts. I mean, every penny counts. Whatever you can do is just be able to reach out and help. PENMAN: Stella Laure (ph) was at the store with a friend. STELLA LAURE: She bought me some tea that costs almost $4. So I said, well, I just saved $4. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Pay it forward. LAURE: Exactly, so I'm just going to pay it forward. NESTERAK: Next, we talked to Lee Schenecker (ph). LEE SCHENECKER: I just give in general. I had loose change, simple as that. PENMAN: Does it make you feel good when you give? SCHENECKER: Oh, I suppose so. PENMAN: And finally, we talked to Bonnie Scott (ph). NESTERAK: So why did you put a dollar in the bucket? BONNIE SCOTT: Why, I like to see people being helped, so why not give them a dollar when I see them? NESTERAK: Do you give every time you see the Salvation Army bucket? SCOTT: Yes, I'm guilty (laughter). I do. NESTERAK: And why do you - why do you think you always, like - every time you go to the store around this time of year, why do you feel like you have to give a dollar? SCOTT: Well, people need right now. So why not? PENMAN: And so there you have it, Shankar. NESTERAK: People give because they want to help. . . PENMAN: . . . Because it makes them feel good. . . NESTERAK: . . . And because they want to pay it forward. VEDANTAM: That was Maggie Penman and Max Nesterak with a lot of very sweet people at the grocery store showing us the positive side of generosity. But there's also a more cynical take. And that was summarized in a recent episode of \"South Park\" where Stan's dad, Randy Marsh, gets pressured to donate a dollar at the checkout line at a very socially-conscious Whole Foods. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SOUTH PARK\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Cashier) OK, sir, looks like your total is 37. 83. TREY PARKER: (As Randy Marsh) All right. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Cashier) OK, and would like to add a dollar donation to help hungry kids around the world? PARKER: (As Randy Marsh) Oh, no, that's OK. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Cashier) Sorry? PARKER: (As Randy Marsh) I'm good. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Cashier) I'm sorry, you don't want to give the dollar to hungry kids? PARKER: (As Randy Marsh) Not today, thank you. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Cashier) OK, no problem. Window's going to come up and ask if you're helping the hungry kids. Just hit, no, I'm not. PARKER: (As Randy Marsh) Come on. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Cashier) Try hitting it again. It's the box below the one that says, sure, I'd love to help however I can. Darn thing - sorry, most people give the dollar. I can do this manually. PARKER: (As Randy Marsh) Look, I give money to charity a lot, OK? UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Cashier) Oh, sure you do. PARKER: (As Randy Marsh) I do. I just don't want to every time I shop for food. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Cashier) That's completely understandable. Have customers speak - OK, if you can speak into the voice decoder and say, I'm not giving anything to the hungry kids. PARKER: (As Randy Marsh) I'm not giving anything to the hungry kids. VEDANTAM: So which version of generosity is right - the positive, life-affirming people that Maggie and Max talked with or the guilt-tripped philanthropist at the checkout line? I recently had a conversation about this with All Things Considered host Audie Cornish. We talked about why the reasons you think you give may not actually be the real reason. AUDIE CORNISH, BYLINE: So this is the time of year, as they say, when people are perceived as being more charitable. But is it all altruistic? VEDANTAM: Well, when you ask people why they're generous, they will tell you that it is all about altruism - that they love a cause or they like to give. But scientists have increasingly sought to test these claims, Audi. I spoke with economist John List - he's at the University of Chicago. He's conducted a number of experiments into why people give. And he explained to me why he thinks this is important to do. LIST: Anytime you ask someone, why did you give to this charitable cause, the typical response is, I gave because I really want to help another person. But when you actually dig down deeper, that's not the true motive for why they gave. And that's exactly why we need field experiments to try to disentangle reasons why people give. CORNISH: And I understand, Shankar, one of the reasons may be social pressure, right? And he does some experiments to try to make that case. VEDANTAM: That's right. So List thinks that social pressure might be playing a very powerful role. And he asked me to think about a scenario that's going to be familiar to lots of us. Here he is again. LIST: You're sitting on the couch watching a football game, and you hear somebody knocking on the door. And you think, OK, should I get up or should I stay watching the football game? Of course, a lot of people get up and answer the door. But once they see that there's a solicitor at the door, they say, oh my God, I wish I would have stayed on the couch watching the football game. CORNISH: Right. So basically, you feel like you've been put on the spot. VEDANTAM: Exactly. And List realized that this scenario provides the perfect mechanism for an experiment that tries to find out how much social pressure plays a role in altruism. List sent volunteers into various Chicago neighborhoods to solicit money for a children's hospital. But there was a catch, Audie. Some households just got a cold call - a knock on the door. Others were alerted ahead of time that someone was going to be knocking on their door and asking for money. A third group was told that the knock was coming and given the choice to opt out. They could say they didn't want to be disturbed. Now, if people were giving only because of altruism, it shouldn't matter whether they know ahead of time that a knock is coming. But List finds that when households are alerted ahead of time, the number of people who answer that knock on the door - it falls by a quarter. When people are given a choice to opt out and say they don't want to be disturbed, donations fall by nearly half. And what List says this shows is how much social pressure shapes generosity. LIST: What you find is that roughly three-quarters of the dollars given are due to social pressure and a quarter of the dollars given is actually due to altruism. VEDANTAM: Now, of course, Audie, we should mention this was one experiment and one setting. There're lots of other reasons why people might want to give. People write checks in the privacy of their own homes where there's no social pressure. But in this kind of situation - and there are many like it, you know, you encounter somebody at the door of a store as you're leaving, or maybe you're at church and people are passing the collection plate - in situations like that where social pressure probably plays an enormous role. CORNISH: So the idea that you're basically uncomfortable saying no to someone's face, right? VEDANTAM: Exactly. So in this experiment, you don't want the person at the door to think that you're a jerk for not wanting to help a children's hospital. The dilemma, Audie, is that for charities, putting people on the spot is effective, but it might be effective only in the short term because people don't like to be pressured, and they're going to find ways to dodge it. List, in fact, believes charities need to focus on the 25 percent of people who are genuinely motivated by altruism because this is the group of people who are likely to be your long-term supporters. CORNISH: So what are some of the other strategies that charities and others have found to get us to open our wallets? VEDANTAM: You know, Audie, there are literally dozens of different things that people have tried. One of them is that when a charity sends you a gift - maybe they send you a calendar - the norm of reciprocity dictates that you send something back to them in exchange. Another idea is that if you can get people to donate their time to a cause, they're more likely to follow up with donations because people's wallets follow their feet. CORNISH: So I'm feeling a little guilty now for my introduction, right? The norms of the holiday season, right? This is the time of year to give. Does that also create a form of social pressure? VEDANTAM: You can think about social norms exactly as a larger example of social pressure at work. If you're at a workplace and everyone's writing checks to charities or doing things that are charitable, you feel kind of obliged to do the same. CORNISH: Shankar, thanks so much for explaining it. VEDANTAM: Thank you so much, Audie. After this short break, Dan Pink is back for another round of Stopwatch Science. We'll give you some tips on how to be more generous and give better gifts.

We have more ideas about charity and gift giving in our next Stopwatch Science segment. I'm joined as usual by senior Stopwatch Science correspondent Daniel Pink. Hi, Dan. PINK: Hey, Shankar. VEDANTAM: As we've heard in the previous segment, altruism is a complicated thing. It makes people feel warm and happy, but it's also driven by social pressure and public norms. On this edition of Stopwatch Science, Dan and I will present two ideas each from social science research looking at the signs of generosity. We get 60 seconds to present each idea, and as we approach the 60-second mark, our producers will gently bring up the music like they do at the Oscars. Dan, if you're ready, your first 60 seconds starts now. PINK: OK, let's say you're choosing a holiday gift for a friend, and you're deciding between two video games. Now one game is high-end and super cool, but it takes a while to learn. The other is more ordinary. It's easy to start playing, but the game is just medium quality and less nifty. Which gift would you rather give, and which would your friend rather receive? Now those questions are at the heart of a fascinating paper last year in the Journal of Consumer Research. Over eight experiments, researchers found that givers consistently chose desirability, special gifts even if they're a hassle, like that turbocharged video game or a gift certificate to a great Italian restaurant that's an hour away. But receivers consistently valued feasibility just as much. They were equally happy with that easy-to-play video game or a gift card to an OK Italian restaurant around the corner. When we select gifts for people, we often aim for desirability. We want to pick something special, unique, unforgettable. But it turns out that the people on the receiving end. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)PINK: . . . They don't much care. They're just as happy with gifts that are easy, convenient and practical. VEDANTAM: I love that, Dan. And I think this speaks to something that you've brought up before on Stopwatch Science, which is that we are often really bad at reading other people's minds. PINK: We're terrible at it, and we don't know it, so there are some workarounds that we can do. For instance, Francesca Gino, who is a friend of the show, has a great paper from a few years ago showing that the best way to select a gift for someone is to ask them what they want rather than try to divine it through telepathy. VEDANTAM: All right, I get the message. PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: Dan, what do you want for Christmas? PINK: Let's see. Well, actually, my coffee maker broke, so I really just - I just need a coffee maker pretty badly and not a fancy one with special little valves and things that steam and whir things around, just a regular workingman's coffee maker. VEDANTAM: All right, consider it done. PINK: All right, Shankar, your 60 seconds starts right now. VEDANTAM: Many of us think that learning a musical instrument or becoming a gymnast are skills that can be learned or improved with practice. But we don't think of generosity and altruism the same way. We don't think of compassion as a skill when, in fact, there's evidence that you can train yourself to be more compassionate. Helen Weng and Richard Davidson at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, along with other researchers, they trained volunteers to think kindly about others to cultivate compassion both for loved ones as well as for strangers. They find in a study published in the journal Psychological Science that when you do this for 30 minutes a day for two weeks, volunteers become more likely to act compassionately towards strangers who are in need of help. In other words, mental training alone can change your ability to respond to the suffering of others. They also find very interestingly, there's evidence, using fMRI scanners, that there are changes in the brain areas of volunteers who get the training, and these brain areas include the inferior parietal cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)PINK: That's fascinating and heartening. And, you know, Martin Seligman years ago wrote a book called \"Learned Optimism\" based on his research in learned helplessness. So what we're talking here is learned compassion, which would be no joke, a really great gift in the holidays. VEDANTAM: I think that's right. And it's part of a larger body of work known as positive psychology, looking at how psychology can help us understand the best of ourselves, not just the worst of ourselves. But, Dan, I'm going to turn it over to you for your second study. Your next 60 seconds starts right now. PINK: OK, here's a less exalted scenario, all right? Someone gives me a present, say a watch. I open it and think, it's not my style. So I stick it in a new box, rewrap it, and give it to my brother. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: It's called regifting. And it's offensive, right, a social taboo. Well, a set of studies by Gabrielle Adams at the London Business School says maybe not. Adams and colleagues at Harvard and Stanford set up several experiments in which some people were gift givers and others were gift receivers. Then they had some of the receivers repackage their gifts and give them to someone else. Turns out, over and over again, the regifters overestimated how much the givers of the original gift would be offended. They thought the givers would be shocked, hurt, appalled by their regifting, but most givers said, hey, it's your gift now. The title is essentially passed to you. Do whatever you want. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)PINK: The stigma of regifting wasn't much of a stigma at all. VEDANTAM: Dan, I want to thank you for sanctioning my inner regifter. PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: I feel completely liberated now in ways that should be very interesting to watch over the next few weeks. PINK: Well, that's great because I got a really special present for you. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: High in desirability but really difficult to use, so you just give it to somebody else and you'll feel better. VEDANTAM: Will do. PINK: All right, now your 60 seconds for your study, Shankar, starts right now. VEDANTAM: All right, this is also a study that looks at altruism, except, Dan, it looks at the downside of altruism. It's a study by friend of the show Francesca Gino at the Harvard Business School. You just mentioned her a moment ago. Along with Shahar Ayal and Dan Ariely, Gino found that people are more likely to cheat when their behavior is hidden. That's not surprising. Here is the part of her study that caught my eye. When people feel that their cheating can help another person as well as themselves, cheating goes up substantially. When being dishonest can help an entire group, cheating goes up even more. What's fascinating to me here, Dan, is how the hidden brain weaves together these different motives. Wanting to help others is a good thing. In this case, people use a positive motive to justify being dishonest. Now I know it's the holiday season, Dan, but I'm going to make a little editorial statement here. PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: One of the things that many of us do is we lie to children about the existence of Santa Claus. We perpetrate this act of mass dishonesty. PINK: (Laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: But we do it because we say it's in the common good. PINK: Fair point, but I just think you've totally lost our 8 and under demographic. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) All right, there you have it. Give gifts that are useful, train yourself to be more compassionate, beware of the downside of altruism, and regift shamelessly. PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: If you get caught, tell people Dan Pink told you to do it. Dan, thank you so much for joining us. PINK: My pleasure, I think. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: That was Daniel Pink, our senior Stopwatch Science correspondent and ace gift giver. Can't wait to see what you got me for Christmas, Dan. We have one last segment for you this holiday. Adam Cole is back to tie this episode together with a song. Adam, welcome back to HIDDEN BRAIN. COLE: Thanks so much for having me. VEDANTAM: Did you put in hours and hours of work to create this original song for us, Adam? COLE: Well, I put in a lot of hours listening to the episode, and I put in a lot of hours listening to holiday music to get inspiration since this is a holiday episode. So yeah, I put together a little piece sort of inspired by those really cheesy Christmas specials. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). COLE: . . . In which children dance around in brightly colored sweaters. VEDANTAM: Wonderful, and did you do this all by yourself, Adam, or did you have help? COLE: Well, you know, I actually got some help from your producer, Maggie Penman. She sings on this song. VEDANTAM: Oh, cool. COLE: And there's also a special guest appearance by someone you said doesn't exist. VEDANTAM: I can't wait to hear this. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG)COLE: (Singing) The chestnuts are roasting, and Shankar's stopped hosting so he could go out and sled. There's jingle bells belling, and our hearts are swelling. COLE AND PENMAN: (Singing) And Dan Pink is yelling about something he read. We're full of Christmas cheer, but let's make one thing very clear. COLE: (Singing) The gifts you give are thoughtful. PENMAN: (Singing) But they're also often awful. COLE AND PENMAN: (Singing) Just give us what we asked for this year. No espresso machine, they're hard to clean, no five-star dinner in Paris. But we'll take your coffee maker and a piece of pizza down the street. If we open a gift and we don't like what we find, we'll just regift it. You won't mind. But it would be terrific if you gave us the specific things that we asked for this Christmas time. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (As Santa Claus) Now hold on a minute. COLE AND PENMAN: Santa Claus. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (As Santa Claus) Well, yes, it's me. And I'm here to tell you you're terrible. This isn't the season of receiving. It's the season of altruism. PENMAN: Altruism, sounds lame, Santa. COLE: Yeah, what do you know? You're just an act of mass dishonesty we perpetrate annually for the sake of children. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (As Santa Claus) Nonsense, I'm the living embodiment of the spirit of giving. But I wasn't always that way. (Singing) Before my current role way up at the North Pole, I was a mean old elf. Just like the Grinch, my heart it was pinched, and I only thought of myself. But then I practiced caring 30 minutes every day, and my dorsolateral prefrontal cortex slowly began to change. PENMAN: I don't know, Santa. Practicing empathy, sounds like a lot of work. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (As Santa Claus) Oh, yes, a lot of people don't practice compassion. They're only generous when they think people are watching. (Singing) That's why I watch from my sleigh both night and day, a jolly one man at NSA. So if someone poor is at your door, I'll see if you turn them away. If you don't help people with their problems, you'll make my list and not the nice column. It's my duty and my pleasure to apply the social pressure so people will be selfless this Christmas time. PENMAN: (Singing) Christmas time. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (As Santa Claus) Merry Christmas, Maggie. Merry Christmas, Adam. COLE AND PENMAN: Merry Christmas, Santa. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (As Santa Claus) Merry Christmas, listeners. I'm watching you. VEDANTAM: That was fantastic, Adam. COLE: Well, thank you so much. VEDANTAM: I clearly stand corrected. For all you kids out there, you clearly heard two different voices. Santa is on the episode on tape, so, Santa Claus exists, and I was wrong. COLE: That's right. I'm glad that you are a big enough man to admit that. VEDANTAM: Adam, thank you so much for joining me. COLE: Thanks for having me.

SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST:  This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. The holiday season is a time of giving to our friends and loved ones, but also to strangers in the form of donations or charity. On this week's episode, we'll explore the psychology of giving. We look at what motivates us to give to charities. . . JOHN LIST: Once they see that there's a solicitor at the door, they say, oh my God, I wish I would have stayed on the couch watching the football game. VEDANTAM: . . . Why it's okay to be a re-gifter and why sometimes lying to small children can be a gift. DANIEL PINK, BYLINE: Fair point. But I just think you've totally lost our 8-and-under demographic. VEDANTAM: Finally, well-known philanthropist Adam Cole is back. He's going to give us the gift of music and tie the episode together with a song. . . ADAM COLE, BYLINE: . . .

PENMAN: Does it make you feel good when you give? SCHENECKER: Oh, I suppose so. PENMAN: And finally, we talked to Bonnie Scott (ph). NESTERAK: So why did you put a dollar in the bucket? BONNIE SCOTT: Why, I like to see people being helped, so why not give them a dollar when I see them? NESTERAK: Do you give every time you see the Salvation Army bucket? SCOTT: Yes, I'm guilty (laughter). I do. NESTERAK: And why do you - why do you think you always, like - every time you go to the store around this time of year, why do you feel like you have to give a dollar? SCOTT: Well, people need right now. So why not? PENMAN: And so there you have it, Shankar. NESTERAK: People give because they want to help. . . PENMAN: . . . Because it makes them feel good. . . NESTERAK: . . . And because they want to pay it forward. VEDANTAM: That was Maggie Penman and Max Nesterak with a lot of very sweet people at the grocery store showing us the positive side of generosity. But there's also a more cynical take. And that was summarized in a recent episode of \"South Park\" where Stan's dad, Randy Marsh, gets pressured to donate a dollar at the checkout line at a very socially-conscious Whole Foods. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SOUTH PARK\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Cashier) OK, sir, looks like your total is 37. 83. TREY PARKER: (As Randy Marsh) All right. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Cashier) OK, and would like to add a dollar donation to help hungry kids around the world? PARKER: (As Randy Marsh) Oh, no, that's OK. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Cashier) Sorry? PARKER: (As Randy Marsh) I'm good. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Cashier) I'm sorry, you don't want to give the dollar to hungry kids? PARKER: (As Randy Marsh) Not today, thank you. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Cashier) OK, no problem. Window's going to come up and ask if you're helping the hungry kids. Just hit, no, I'm not. PARKER: (As Randy Marsh) Come on. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Cashier) Try hitting it again. It's the box below the one that says, sure, I'd love to help however I can. Darn thing - sorry, most people give the dollar. I can do this manually. PARKER: (As Randy Marsh) Look, I give money to charity a lot, OK? UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Cashier) Oh, sure you do. PARKER: (As Randy Marsh) I do. I just don't want to every time I shop for food. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Cashier) That's completely understandable. Have customers speak - OK, if you can speak into the voice decoder and say, I'm not giving anything to the hungry kids. PARKER: (As Randy Marsh) I'm not giving anything to the hungry kids. VEDANTAM: So which version of generosity is right - the positive, life-affirming people that Maggie and Max talked with or the guilt-tripped philanthropist at the checkout line? I recently had a conversation about this with All Things Considered host Audie Cornish. We talked about why the reasons you think you give may not actually be the real reason. AUDIE CORNISH, BYLINE: So this is the time of year, as they say, when people are perceived as being more charitable. But is it all altruistic? VEDANTAM: Well, when you ask people why they're generous, they will tell you that it is all about altruism - that they love a cause or they like to give. But scientists have increasingly sought to test these claims, Audi. I spoke with economist John List - he's at the University of Chicago. He's conducted a number of experiments into why people give. And he explained to me why he thinks this is important to do. LIST: Anytime you ask someone, why did you give to this charitable cause, the typical response is, I gave because I really want to help another person. But when you actually dig down deeper, that's not the true motive for why they gave. And that's exactly why we need field experiments to try to disentangle reasons why people give. CORNISH: And I understand, Shankar, one of the reasons may be social pressure, right? And he does some experiments to try to make that case. VEDANTAM: That's right. So List thinks that social pressure might be playing a very powerful role. And he asked me to think about a scenario that's going to be familiar to lots of us. Here he is again. LIST: You're sitting on the couch watching a football game, and you hear somebody knocking on the door. And you think, OK, should I get up or should I stay watching the football game? Of course, a lot of people get up and answer the door. But once they see that there's a solicitor at the door, they say, oh my God, I wish I would have stayed on the couch watching the football game. CORNISH: Right. So basically, you feel like you've been put on the spot. VEDANTAM: Exactly. And List realized that this scenario provides the perfect mechanism for an experiment that tries to find out how much social pressure plays a role in altruism. List sent volunteers into various Chicago neighborhoods to solicit money for a children's hospital. But there was a catch, Audie. Some households just got a cold call - a knock on the door. Others were alerted ahead of time that someone was going to be knocking on their door and asking for money. A third group was told that the knock was coming and given the choice to opt out. They could say they didn't want to be disturbed. Now, if people were giving only because of altruism, it shouldn't matter whether they know ahead of time that a knock is coming. But List finds that when households are alerted ahead of time, the number of people who answer that knock on the door - it falls by a quarter. When people are given a choice to opt out and say they don't want to be disturbed, donations fall by nearly half. And what List says this shows is how much social pressure shapes generosity. LIST: What you find is that roughly three-quarters of the dollars given are due to social pressure and a quarter of the dollars given is actually due to altruism. VEDANTAM: Now, of course, Audie, we should mention this was one experiment and one setting. There're lots of other reasons why people might want to give. People write checks in the privacy of their own homes where there's no social pressure. But in this kind of situation - and there are many like it, you know, you encounter somebody at the door of a store as you're leaving, or maybe you're at church and people are passing the collection plate - in situations like that where social pressure probably plays an enormous role. CORNISH: So the idea that you're basically uncomfortable saying no to someone's face, right? VEDANTAM: Exactly. So in this experiment, you don't want the person at the door to think that you're a jerk for not wanting to help a children's hospital. The dilemma, Audie, is that for charities, putting people on the spot is effective, but it might be effective only in the short term because people don't like to be pressured, and they're going to find ways to dodge it. List, in fact, believes charities need to focus on the 25 percent of people who are genuinely motivated by altruism because this is the group of people who are likely to be your long-term supporters. CORNISH: So what are some of the other strategies that charities and others have found to get us to open our wallets? VEDANTAM: You know, Audie, there are literally dozens of different things that people have tried. One of them is that when a charity sends you a gift - maybe they send you a calendar - the norm of reciprocity dictates that you send something back to them in exchange. Another idea is that if you can get people to donate their time to a cause, they're more likely to follow up with donations because people's wallets follow their feet. CORNISH: So I'm feeling a little guilty now for my introduction, right? The norms of the holiday season, right? This is the time of year to give. Does that also create a form of social pressure? VEDANTAM: You can think about social norms exactly as a larger example of social pressure at work. If you're at a workplace and everyone's writing checks to charities or doing things that are charitable, you feel kind of obliged to do the same. CORNISH: Shankar, thanks so much for explaining it. VEDANTAM: Thank you so much, Audie. After this short break, Dan Pink is back for another round of Stopwatch Science. We'll give you some tips on how to be more generous and give better gifts.

We have more ideas about charity and gift giving in our next Stopwatch Science segment. I'm joined as usual by senior Stopwatch Science correspondent Daniel Pink. Hi, Dan. PINK: Hey, Shankar. VEDANTAM: As we've heard in the previous segment, altruism is a complicated thing. It makes people feel warm and happy, but it's also driven by social pressure and public norms. On this edition of Stopwatch Science, Dan and I will present two ideas each from social science research looking at the signs of generosity. We get 60 seconds to present each idea, and as we approach the 60-second mark, our producers will gently bring up the music like they do at the Oscars. Dan, if you're ready, your first 60 seconds starts now. PINK: OK, let's say you're choosing a holiday gift for a friend, and you're deciding between two video games. Now one game is high-end and super cool, but it takes a while to learn. The other is more ordinary. It's easy to start playing, but the game is just medium quality and less nifty. Which gift would you rather give, and which would your friend rather receive? Now those questions are at the heart of a fascinating paper last year in the Journal of Consumer Research. Over eight experiments, researchers found that givers consistently chose desirability, special gifts even if they're a hassle, like that turbocharged video game or a gift certificate to a great Italian restaurant that's an hour away. But receivers consistently valued feasibility just as much. They were equally happy with that easy-to-play video game or a gift card to an OK Italian restaurant around the corner. When we select gifts for people, we often aim for desirability. We want to pick something special, unique, unforgettable. But it turns out that the people on the receiving end. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) PINK: . . . They don't much care. They're just as happy with gifts that are easy, convenient and practical. VEDANTAM: I love that, Dan. And I think this speaks to something that you've brought up before on Stopwatch Science, which is that we are often really bad at reading other people's minds. PINK: We're terrible at it, and we don't know it, so there are some workarounds that we can do. For instance, Francesca Gino, who is a friend of the show, has a great paper from a few years ago showing that the best way to select a gift for someone is to ask them what they want rather than try to divine it through telepathy. VEDANTAM: All right, I get the message. PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: Dan, what do you want for Christmas? PINK: Let's see. Well, actually, my coffee maker broke, so I really just - I just need a coffee maker pretty badly and not a fancy one with special little valves and things that steam and whir things around, just a regular workingman's coffee maker. VEDANTAM: All right, consider it done. PINK: All right, Shankar, your 60 seconds starts right now. VEDANTAM: Many of us think that learning a musical instrument or becoming a gymnast are skills that can be learned or improved with practice. But we don't think of generosity and altruism the same way. We don't think of compassion as a skill when, in fact, there's evidence that you can train yourself to be more compassionate. Helen Weng and Richard Davidson at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, along with other researchers, they trained volunteers to think kindly about others to cultivate compassion both for loved ones as well as for strangers. They find in a study published in the journal Psychological Science that when you do this for 30 minutes a day for two weeks, volunteers become more likely to act compassionately towards strangers who are in need of help. In other words, mental training alone can change your ability to respond to the suffering of others. They also find very interestingly, there's evidence, using fMRI scanners, that there are changes in the brain areas of volunteers who get the training, and these brain areas include the inferior parietal cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) PINK: That's fascinating and heartening. And, you know, Martin Seligman years ago wrote a book called \"Learned Optimism\" based on his research in learned helplessness. So what we're talking here is learned compassion, which would be no joke, a really great gift in the holidays. VEDANTAM: I think that's right. And it's part of a larger body of work known as positive psychology, looking at how psychology can help us understand the best of ourselves, not just the worst of ourselves. But, Dan, I'm going to turn it over to you for your second study. Your next 60 seconds starts right now. PINK: OK, here's a less exalted scenario, all right? Someone gives me a present, say a watch. I open it and think, it's not my style. So I stick it in a new box, rewrap it, and give it to my brother. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: It's called regifting. And it's offensive, right, a social taboo. Well, a set of studies by Gabrielle Adams at the London Business School says maybe not. Adams and colleagues at Harvard and Stanford set up several experiments in which some people were gift givers and others were gift receivers. Then they had some of the receivers repackage their gifts and give them to someone else. Turns out, over and over again, the regifters overestimated how much the givers of the original gift would be offended. They thought the givers would be shocked, hurt, appalled by their regifting, but most givers said, hey, it's your gift now. The title is essentially passed to you. Do whatever you want. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) PINK: The stigma of regifting wasn't much of a stigma at all. VEDANTAM: Dan, I want to thank you for sanctioning my inner regifter. PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: I feel completely liberated now in ways that should be very interesting to watch over the next few weeks. PINK: Well, that's great because I got a really special present for you. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: High in desirability but really difficult to use, so you just give it to somebody else and you'll feel better. VEDANTAM: Will do. PINK: All right, now your 60 seconds for your study, Shankar, starts right now. VEDANTAM: All right, this is also a study that looks at altruism, except, Dan, it looks at the downside of altruism. It's a study by friend of the show Francesca Gino at the Harvard Business School. You just mentioned her a moment ago. Along with Shahar Ayal and Dan Ariely, Gino found that people are more likely to cheat when their behavior is hidden. That's not surprising. Here is the part of her study that caught my eye. When people feel that their cheating can help another person as well as themselves, cheating goes up substantially. When being dishonest can help an entire group, cheating goes up even more. What's fascinating to me here, Dan, is how the hidden brain weaves together these different motives. Wanting to help others is a good thing. In this case, people use a positive motive to justify being dishonest. Now I know it's the holiday season, Dan, but I'm going to make a little editorial statement here. PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: One of the things that many of us do is we lie to children about the existence of Santa Claus. We perpetrate this act of mass dishonesty. PINK: (Laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: But we do it because we say it's in the common good. PINK: Fair point, but I just think you've totally lost our 8 and under demographic. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) All right, there you have it. Give gifts that are useful, train yourself to be more compassionate, beware of the downside of altruism, and regift shamelessly. PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: If you get caught, tell people Dan Pink told you to do it. Dan, thank you so much for joining us. PINK: My pleasure, I think. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: That was Daniel Pink, our senior Stopwatch Science correspondent and ace gift giver. Can't wait to see what you got me for Christmas, Dan. We have one last segment for you this holiday. Adam Cole is back to tie this episode together with a song. Adam, welcome back to HIDDEN BRAIN. COLE: Thanks so much for having me. VEDANTAM: Did you put in hours and hours of work to create this original song for us, Adam? COLE: Well, I put in a lot of hours listening to the episode, and I put in a lot of hours listening to holiday music to get inspiration since this is a holiday episode. So yeah, I put together a little piece sort of inspired by those really cheesy Christmas specials. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). COLE: . . . In which children dance around in brightly colored sweaters. VEDANTAM: Wonderful, and did you do this all by yourself, Adam, or did you have help? COLE: Well, you know, I actually got some help from your producer, Maggie Penman. She sings on this song. VEDANTAM: Oh, cool. COLE: And there's also a special guest appearance by someone you said doesn't exist. VEDANTAM: I can't wait to hear this. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG) COLE: (Singing) The chestnuts are roasting, and Shankar's stopped hosting so he could go out and sled. There's jingle bells belling, and our hearts are swelling. COLE AND PENMAN: (Singing) And Dan Pink is yelling about something he read. We're full of Christmas cheer, but let's make one thing very clear. COLE: (Singing) The gifts you give are thoughtful. PENMAN: (Singing) But they're also often awful. COLE AND PENMAN: (Singing) Just give us what we asked for this year. No espresso machine, they're hard to clean, no five-star dinner in Paris. But we'll take your coffee maker and a piece of pizza down the street. If we open a gift and we don't like what we find, we'll just regift it. You won't mind. But it would be terrific if you gave us the specific things that we asked for this Christmas time. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (As Santa Claus) Now hold on a minute. COLE AND PENMAN: Santa Claus. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (As Santa Claus) Well, yes, it's me. And I'm here to tell you you're terrible. This isn't the season of receiving. It's the season of altruism. PENMAN: Altruism, sounds lame, Santa. COLE: Yeah, what do you know? You're just an act of mass dishonesty we perpetrate annually for the sake of children. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (As Santa Claus) Nonsense, I'm the living embodiment of the spirit of giving. But I wasn't always that way. (Singing) Before my current role way up at the North Pole, I was a mean old elf. Just like the Grinch, my heart it was pinched, and I only thought of myself. But then I practiced caring 30 minutes every day, and my dorsolateral prefrontal cortex slowly began to change. PENMAN: I don't know, Santa. Practicing empathy, sounds like a lot of work. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (As Santa Claus) Oh, yes, a lot of people don't practice compassion. They're only generous when they think people are watching. (Singing) That's why I watch from my sleigh both night and day, a jolly one man at NSA. So if someone poor is at your door, I'll see if you turn them away. If you don't help people with their problems, you'll make my list and not the nice column. It's my duty and my pleasure to apply the social pressure so people will be selfless this Christmas time. PENMAN: (Singing) Christmas time. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (As Santa Claus) Merry Christmas, Maggie. Merry Christmas, Adam. COLE AND PENMAN: Merry Christmas, Santa. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (As Santa Claus) Merry Christmas, listeners. I'm watching you. VEDANTAM: That was fantastic, Adam. COLE: Well, thank you so much. VEDANTAM: I clearly stand corrected. For all you kids out there, you clearly heard two different voices. Santa is on the episode on tape, so, Santa Claus exists, and I was wrong. COLE: That's right. I'm glad that you are a big enough man to admit that. VEDANTAM: Adam, thank you so much for joining me. COLE: Thanks for having me.

Just earlier this week, SpaceX successfully landed a 15-story tall section of one of their rockets back on Earth. And joining me to discuss what's been going on off our planet during 2015 is NPR science correspondent Geoff Brumfiel. So explain exactly what happened that a part of the rocket returned. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: In some sense, this was just another rocket launch for SpaceX. You know, they sent 11 communication satellites into orbit. What really makes this special is what happened to the big first stage of the rocket. Now, normally this would just fall back to Earth. But this time, SpaceX flipped it around and then flew it back to near the launch site and actually landed it. They fired the engines a second time and it sort of floated down onto the pad. It was pretty spectacular to watch. WERTHEIMER: The space pad looks big when you're looking at it on the Earth. But from space, it must be a tiny dot. BRUMFIEL: Yeah, I mean SpaceX describes it as trying to shoot a pencil over the Empire State Building, have it turn around and land in a shoebox vertically. That's how hard this is. WERTHEIMER: There were also exciting developments billions of miles away. This year, we got our first look at Pluto. Do we think Pluto is a planet? What do we think Pluto is? BRUMFIEL: Well, Pluto's official designation is a dwarf planet. And I have to tell you the people who sent this probe all the way out to Pluto are a little angry about that because when they launched it a decade ago, Pluto was still a planet. WERTHEIMER: (Laughter). BRUMFIEL: It got downgraded in the intervening years. WERTHEIMER: That seems so unfair. BRUMFIEL: I know, I know. Well, they will talk your ear off about how unfair it is. But this was still a huge achievement, one of the biggest highlights of the year. This probe, called New Horizons, sort of swept past Pluto and gave us our first real up-close pictures. And, I mean, I've got to say, it's not at all what you would expect. It's not sort of a cratered dead world. It's got huge mountains, it's got glaciers, there's a lot going on down there. WERTHEIMER: There appears to be ice and water and whatnot. BRUMFIEL: That's right. WERTHEIMER: We get very excited about that when we think that might exist on Mars. BRUMFIEL: Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I mean, we do excited about it. And in the case of Pluto, we're excited about it because Pluto could be a remnant from the early solar system. It could really tell us a lot about how we all got here. So, for me, this was really the highlight of the year, personally. I mean, we - you know, humanity sends a probe from more than three billion miles away, so far away it took four and a half hours just for the photos to make their way back at the speed of light. And, you know, this little probe gets these great pictures, sends them back and we learn just an enormous amount. It was very cool. WERTHEIMER: Now, I don't want to leave without talking about space cuisine. I understand there were important advances in the grub you get in space. BRUMFIEL: That's right. Space food is notoriously horrible to eat. It's all this vacuum-packed, freeze-dried stuff. It's sort of - they - they extrude it out of these packages and it comes out as a paste. It looks awful. But this year, they managed to grow some lettuce up there. And so for the first time, astronauts were actually allowed to eat it. They brought up a little balsamic vinaigrette to put on it. You know, this sounds kind of trivial. It is a little silly, but it's not as easy as it sounds. I mean, remember, plants, you know, grow on Earth and. . . WERTHEIMER: Well, we've all seen the movie where they had a hell of a time trying to grow potatoes on Mars. BRUMFIEL: That's right. \"The Martian,\" exactly. But this is even harder 'cause it's zero gravity so you have to get the water, which is just floating around, to go in the roots. I mean, it's a trick. But if you go to space, I mean, you're not going for the food, let's face it. WERTHEIMER: (Laughter) OK. Geoff Brumfiel, thank you very much. BRUMFIEL: Thank you.

The film stars Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu, the forensic pathologist who has done as much as anyone to sound the alarm about the effect of repeated head trauma on football players, effects that have now become part of the national conversation about America's most-watched sport. We actually have the real Dr. Bennet Omalu with us now from the studios of Georgia Public Broadcasting in Atlanta. Hello, Dr. Omalu, welcome. BENNET OMALU: Hi, how are you? Thank you having me. MARTIN: The film opens with a very sobering story - the story of the Pittsburgh Steeler Mike Webster. He was called Iron Mike. When he died of cardiac arrest back in 2002, it made national headlines because here's a guy who had had multiple Super Bowl rings, and then at the time of his death, he was living in his truck. He had this history of erratic behavior. He had just had a very sad end. So what made you look at his brain? OMALU: So when I heard about the story of Mike Webster - his life after retirement, his destitution - I empathized with him. I thought he was suffering from a psychological ailment, that he was obviously misunderstood, just like I was misunderstood because I suffered major depression in medical school. I was expecting his brain to look like dementia pugilistica patient or Alzheimer's disease. But when I opened up his skull, his brain looked normal (laughter). I remember that moment very vividly. I was so downcast, totally confused. And I felt I had let down Mike Webster. So I went back and searched and searched the literature, and I ever saw any report of something like dementia pugilistica on a football player. MARTIN: So let me stop you there. You are credited with identifying and describing what we now call CTE, which is chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Tell me if you would why it is that this repeated head trauma produces such negative results in human beings. OMALU: OK. Like it said in the movie - I hope I'm not giving out too much - Will Smith said God did not create man to play football. The human brain floats freely inside the human skull. So when you have an impact, the so-called sub-concussive blows cause microscopic injuries in your brain. Over time, after you've sustained hundreds to thousands of these blows, there is permanent brain damage. The brain begins to accumulate abnormal proteins, and it will eventually strangle or kill the cells, like it said in the movie. And in some time - it may take weeks, months, years, decades, sometimes up to 40 years later - and you now begin to manifest with symptoms like mood disorders, major depression, suicidal attempts, disinhibition. MARTIN: There's a scene in the movie, which has now become famous from the trailer, where you meet with this neurologist who's on the NFL's side. And you demand that he tell the truth - that, you know, tell the truth about this. But his response is what I want to play because what he talks about is how important this game is. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"CONCUSSION\")WILL SMITH: (As Dr. Bennet Omalu) Tell the truth. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) The truth. SMITH: (As Dr. Bennet Omalu) The truth. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) The truth is that the NFL is a blessing and a salvation, my friend. We employ hundreds of thousands of people. We send the thousands and thousands of poor kids to school. The ownership of this football club has donated millions of dollars to countless charities. Do you want me to go on? MARTIN: How you feel about that argument? OMALU: This movie is not anti-football. It is about our lives as Americans. Whatever you do in life, no matter what your intentions or motivations may be, if you do not accept the truth - because there can only be one truth - you will have problem. MARTIN: But you really thought that the NFL would welcome your work, that they would be happy to know that you had solved this puzzle. Is that true? OMALU: Yes, I thought it had a proposition of value. It was a product that would enhance football and enhance the lives and the safety and health of the players. MARTIN: And when did you realize that it wasn't actually going to be that way, and in fact, it was going to be the opposite? OMALU: I got a call from one of the editors of the journal. I remember that day vividly. The NFL made a very calculated, mean attempt to decapitate me professionally. If your scientific paper is retracted, you are finished in that profession. I could have as well gone back to Nigeria to become a massage therapist. MARTIN: Did you ever consider retracting it? OMALU: No. I had spent hundreds of hours researching this subject, and I had met the families of the sufferers of this disease. They were suffering in silence. They were suffering in obscurity. And it offended my sense of America. I ran away from corruption in Nigeria because my country, Nigeria, is one of the 10 most corrupt countries in the world. To come here, what I was seeing in this place, in my opinion, I thought was un-American. MARTIN: You must feel vindicated. OMALU: I think the players and their families are vindicated. This has never been about me. Now. . . MARTIN: Do you feel though, speaking of the players, that football is doing enough to minimize harm? OMALU: Well, I'm not an expert in football or an expert in the NFL. Those are above my pay grade. But I will share with you real-life event and let you make up your mind. In the settlement with the players, I don't know if people are aware, the NFL excluded CTE diagnosis as a justification for settlement. MARTIN: I think you're referring to the fact that in 2013, they NFL settled a lawsuit with former players. . . OMALU: But they excluded CTE as a qualifying disease for settlement, OK? MARTIN: What is the implication of that? OMALU: Is this an indication of an organization that has taken serious steps about CTE? Let the people watch the movie. In fact, what I challenge us to do as a family, let us all go and watch the movie. Let us all make up our own minds. MARTIN: OK. So before we let you go - and thank you - and are congratulations in order? Are you pleased with it? OMALU: I think Will Smith's acting reaffirms my belief in the American perfection. Will Smith epitomizes that perfection. MARTIN: How do you feel about his accent? OMALU: He did well. In fact, my wife heard it the first he came to our house - so my wife had her back turned. I think she was going to get something. But he started speaking, and my wife turned, said yes, Bennet, what do you want? And she turned, said excuse me. Who - where's Bennet? And so. . . MARTIN: (Laughter) Did you really? OMALU: Yeah. (LAUGHTER)MARTIN: Dr. Bennet Omalu's life and work on brain injuries in football players is the subject of the new film \"Concussion. \" Dr. Omalu, thank you so much for speaking with us. OMALU: Thank you so much. God bless you. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  If you are one of the millions of people who loves football or if you are one of the millions of people who plans to catch up on the big movies over the Christmas holidays, then you probably have the movie \"Concussion\" on your must-see list. The film stars Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu, the forensic pathologist who has done as much as anyone to sound the alarm about the effect of repeated head trauma on football players, effects that have now become part of the national conversation about America's most-watched sport. We actually have the real Dr. Bennet Omalu with us now from the studios of Georgia Public Broadcasting in Atlanta. Hello, Dr. Omalu, welcome. BENNET OMALU: Hi, how are you? Thank you having me. MARTIN: The film opens with a very sobering story - the story of the Pittsburgh Steeler Mike Webster. He was called Iron Mike. When he died of cardiac arrest back in 2002, it made national headlines because here's a guy who had had multiple Super Bowl rings, and then at the time of his death, he was living in his truck. He had this history of erratic behavior. He had just had a very sad end. So what made you look at his brain? OMALU: So when I heard about the story of Mike Webster - his life after retirement, his destitution - I empathized with him. I thought he was suffering from a psychological ailment, that he was obviously misunderstood, just like I was misunderstood because I suffered major depression in medical school. I was expecting his brain to look like dementia pugilistica patient or Alzheimer's disease. But when I opened up his skull, his brain looked normal (laughter). I remember that moment very vividly. I was so downcast, totally confused. And I felt I had let down Mike Webster. So I went back and searched and searched the literature, and I ever saw any report of something like dementia pugilistica on a football player. MARTIN: So let me stop you there.
