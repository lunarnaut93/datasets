You packed it into balls. And if you're in Daytona Beach, Florida, this week, you even got a tiny taste of it. But have you ever look really closely at snow? That's this week's Science Out of the Box. (Soundbite of music) SEABROOK: Discover magazine ran a list just a few weeks ago of 20 facts you didn't know about snow. For instance, snow is a mineral like diamonds or salt. To dig a little deeper into this drift, we called up Dr. Matthew Sturm. He's a senior research scientist and snow expert with the Army's Cold Regions Research Laboratory. That's in Fairbanks, Alaska. How are you, Dr. Sturm? Dr. MATTHEW STURM (Snow Expert; Senior Research Scientist, U. S. Army Cold Regions Research Laboratory): I'm fine. SEABROOK: Good. How cold is it up there today? Dr. STURM: It's about 10 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. SEABROOK: Eek. So tell me, Dr. Sturm, how can snow be a mineral? Dr. STURM: Basically, we're used to water as being a liquid that comes out of the tap. But once the temperature drops below 32 degrees and, of course, water is a solid, and just like any other mineral, it has a molecular structure and properties. If you took a hunk of ice, it feels a lot like a rock, acts a lot like a rock in many ways, has material properties and it is effectively a mineral. SEABROOK: Now, I also read in this list on Discover magazine that each snowflake has a tiny mote of dust at its center, something it can be volcanic ash, it can space dust. Dr. STURM: What happens is where there is a cloud in which snowflakes are forming, water doesn't like to freeze. It's very hard for very minute sort of single molecule level amounts of water to freeze and so that the water can actually super cool. And under some conditions, water can stay liquid down to about minus 40 degrees. But if we introduce a piece of dust, a piece of sea salt that's in the atmosphere, that helps the water to freeze. And so what happens is where there are these little moats in the cloud, the water begins to freeze more rapidly. And those become the little hearts or insipient pieces of the snowflakes. SEABROOK: Is it true that really there are no two snowflakes that are alike if you look at them carefully? Or is it just because there is no two of anything that are just\u2026 Dr. STURM: There are no two of anything that are alike. That would be the basic thing. The second thing is that at least those snowflakes that are fairly ornate, these won't even be visually alike under a microscope. The only hope we find for finding two snowflakes that are absolutely alike at least visually would be the simpler forms, which would be simple hexagonal plates with no arms or branches. If we could search all the snowflakes on Earth in the simpler forms, we might someday find, too, that for all intents and purposes would look close enough to be the same. SEABROOK: So there's - there are - how many basic patterns of snowflakes are there? Dr. STURM: There's prisms, low squat prisms. There're plates - always hexagonal, everything is on a hexagonal base. There're dendrites, which what everyone thinks of, they're the Christmas decoration snowflake, kind of a branching thing, capped columns, needles and bullets. When all is said and done, we probably can come up with 30 or 40 general types but probably about six basic forms. SEABROOK: Dr. Sturm, I understand that you're an expert on what happens to snowflakes once they hit the ground. Dr. STURM: Yes. Strangely, the world of the cloud where the snowflake forms is a very dynamic world. It's very moist. When they finally fall to the ground, they've been immersed in a new world, totally different temperature and vapor pressure. In other words, how moist it is. And so they immediately start to change. You can see this actually with a hand lens. If you look the day after a snow fall, you won't see the beautiful pristine snowflakes that fell the day before. They're already breaking up and rounding over. They can change in one of two ways. They can either become very rounded type snow crystals now in the snow pack, or very angular sort of ornate hollow crystals, which is we called kinetic or temperature-gradient forms. SEABROOK: Any kinds that's best for snowballs? (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. STURM: Typically the rounded ones, and the snow needs to be warm because the thing that makes a good snowball is that the snow sticks together. SEABROOK: Dr. Matthew Sturm of the Army's Cold Regions Research Lab. Thank you so much for talking to us. Dr. STURM: Thank you for having me on. SEABROOK: And Dr. Sturm, we have a little parting gift for playing along with us today. Here's a little story about snow from Stanley McNeal(ph) in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. Mr. STANLEY McNEAL: These two old guys, it was in the Gaelic days, I guess. And they were in this old general store over in Scottsville. And these two old fellows were in and they were busy talking Gaelic. And all of a sudden, it started to get rough outside, snowing, blowing, first snow of the year, you know? And one old fellow said in Gaelic, well, I hope to have - we won't get the snow we had last winter. And the other old fellow answered him, there's no way we'll get that. That's melted. SEABROOK: That's melted. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. STURM: That's very good.  ANDREA SEABROOK, host:  You've shoveled it. You packed it into balls.

But within six years, medicines were developed. A drug called AZT became available in '87. So let's fast forward some 20 years. Several advancements in antiretroviral drugs, people with HIV and AIDS are living longer than ever before. But perhaps their quality of life, well, has very little quality. And this was a subject of a recent enterprise piece in the New York Times titled \"AIDS Patients Face Downside of Living Longer. \" It explored how the drugs used to treat the disease can lead to premature cases of cancer, kidney failure, diabetes and other severe ailments. In our series of stories we wish we thought of first, Ripped Off\u2026 (Soundbite of \"Law and Order\" transition sound) \u2026from the Headlines, we wanted to talk to someone who'd actually gone through this. Joining us now is Richard Kelso. At 65 years old, he's been living with AIDS for 20 years. Good morning, Richard. Mr. RICHARD KELSO: Good morning, Alison. STEWART: So I'm going to ask you a whole bunch of questions, some of which are really, really personal. And if I get too close and you don't feel like answering something, please just say so. Okay? Mr. KELSO: Okay. STEWART: When you were diagnosed in 1987, did you think you'd make it to see 2008? Mr. KELSO: No, absolutely not. At the time, people that I knew were infected and had actually died by 1987, and it was clearly, to me, a death sentence. I think it - as well to anybody else who was infected at the time. STEWART: Well, at what point did you realize that, wow, maybe my life will continue on? Maybe there will be a next year and the next year and the next year? Mr. KELSO: Frankly, not until maybe three years ago. So that's like 17 years of living in fear of thinking that, you know, maybe there's not going to be the next year. You know, and having survived this for 20 years, I could say that there are very few days when I really felt like, you know, am I going to make it? Because there's always the fear of something happening. Just because I've made it, there've been so many people that I've known throughout the 20 years who haven't made it. And you always think, well, maybe I'm next. Maybe I'm next. Maybe tomorrow I'll get some kind of opportunistic infection, or this drug is not going to work or some other kind of factor like that that throws a lot of fear into the equation. STEWART: I want to talk about the various regimens - drug regimens that you're on. But you bring up an interesting point. And I was going to talk about it later, but let's jump to it now. In that New York Times article, they discussed that depression was quite a big issue\u2026 Mr. KELSO: Yeah. STEWART: \u2026and over the extended amount of time, that people tend to become more depressed. Did you ever experience that? Mr. KELSO: Oh, absolutely. STEWART: Yeah. Mr. KELSO: I would say most of the time, because you really, with this, the nature of the disease, you really had no sense that there was much of a future. And also, given the fact that my friends were dying, people, acquaintances were dying and so on and so forth, it's - I think depression was almost logical, if you will, under the circumstances. STEWART: Of all the medications that you've taken over the past 20 years, which ones have had an ill-effect on your quality to life and the way you've lived your life - made your life maybe more difficult? Mr. KELSO: Well, AZT did for a while. That was one of the first drugs that I took. There'd been a couple of others, and the nucleoside and nucleotide analog categories that I've had adverse reactions to. In some cases, I just stopped the drug and moved on to something else if something else was available. The regimen I'm on now has been pretty tolerable, except that I do have something called osteopenia. I do have lipodystrophy. I do have side effects of the drugs that are not immediately debilitating, but they slow me down. They give me fatigue, headaches\u2026 STEWART: Hmm. Ms. KELSO: \u2026various kinds of, you know, problems that are not bad enough for me to stop taking the drug, but, you know, are really not making me feel like I'm, you know, 25 again. STEWART: Lipodystrophy is when fat deposits, they change and shift in your body as a result of\u2026 Mr. KELSO: Exactly. STEWART: \u2026of the drug. Mr. KELSO: Or you lose fat. I've lost fat in my cheeks and my temporal areas and my buttocks. And, you know, and other people, it affects some differently. They can accumulate fat in different places, and it's not the ordinary kind of fat that you think of. They get a buffalo hump, and it's just like a humpback. STEWART: Hmm. Mr. KELSO: In my case, as I said, I've lost, say, fat in my face\u2026 STEWART: So Richard, if I\u2026 Mr. KELSO: \u2026and my legs. STEWART: \u2026if I looked at you, if I looked at you, I could tell you were, perhaps, ill? Mr. KELSO: You might be. What has happened is that there's a treatment that you can take for this kind of facial wasting, which is an injection. It goes under the cheeks and in the temples, and it sort of flushes you out. But it doesn't last. STEWART: Hmm. Mr. KELSO: And it's more noticeable among people who are HIV. So you sort of pick up this - you know, if you see it in yourself, you can - it's easier to see in somebody else. STEWART: Sure. Mr. KELSO: Whereas if you're not HIV-infected, you might not notice it, you know? STEWART: We're speaking with Richard Kelso, who has been living with AIDS for 20 years. And he's not alone. The CDC reports that since the millennium, a number of folks over 50 living with AIDS has more than doubled. I actually - Richard, I want you to listen in and respond on the other side. This is a little bit of sound from Time. com. It's a 74-year-old woman and a 58-year-old man who are both living with AIDS. Unidentified Man: If only people realized how sick this medicine made you, they would never have sex again. Unidentified Woman: When I first started taking protease inhibitors, that was 1997, those things made me so sick. Oh, I was sick as a dog. My T-cell count was fabulous. My viral load was fabulous. But I couldn't walk. Unidentified Man: My kidneys are gone. My liver's shot. You know, I had it like 16 years. I thank God he keep me around all that time. STEWART: So Richard, even though we've talked about the numbers doubling, it must be a lonely feeling. I'm wondering if you're part of any support group. Mr. KELSO: Yes, I actually am. I have been in a support group. I've been in support groups on and off for 20 years, I would say, as soon as I found out that I was HIV-infected. Currently, I am in a support group that's run by SAGE, which is the Support and Advocacy for Gay and Lesbian Elders. And that is specifically for people who are over 50 years of age and HIV-infected. STEWART: Before I let you go, though, I do need to ask this question. The happy-to-be-alive question comes to mind. That without these drugs, you and others likely wouldn't have made it today. Has the trade-off been worth it? Mr. KELSO: I would say definitely, it has. I mean, I'm certainly very grateful that I'm alive. And there's no question that I'm happy to be alive. But there is a trade-off. There is a trade-off. As the guy said, these drugs make you sick. And there's always a fear that something else is going to happen, the next shoe is going to drop. The path is not clear. And especially once you get over a certain age, you realize that what you're looking forward to is just more debilitation. You're not looking to a bounce back or comeback period with these drugs. And I think that something that younger people need to be aware of is that, you know, you take this risk of getting infected thinking that\u2026 STEWART: Yeah. Mr. KELSO: \u2026well, you know, I'll take the pills and I'll be okay. But you\u2026 STEWART: There's a lot more to it, right? Mr. KELSO: Absolutely. STEWART: Richard Kelso, 65 years old and living with AIDS. Good luck to you, Richard. Mr. KELSO: Thank you.

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. More than two million of us get around in wheelchairs. To learn more about what their everyday lives are like, filmmaker Gretchen Berland gave three people video cameras to give us a look at life from their point of view. A documentary edited from their footage shows minor annoyances - why does everything you want in a grocery store seem to be on the top shelf - and outrages, too. Endless struggles with bureaucracy that in one case left a woman stranded in a broken wheelchair 10 feet outside the door to her house. Gretchen Berland is also a doctor who teaches at Yale University School of Medicine. In 2004, she was awarded a MacArthur fellowship, a so-called genius grant, for her research on the relationship between physicians and patients. And part of her hopes in this project is to teach doctors about their patients' lives outside of clinics and hospitals. Later in the hour, we'll talk with the husband of Ingrid Betancourt, who's been held hostage in Columbia for almost six years now. Earlier today, Columbia's main guerilla group, the FARC, released two other women hostages. But first, the everyday lives of Americans in wheelchairs.

Filmmaker and physician Gretchen Berland joins us now from the studio at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. And thanks very much for being with us today. Dr. GRETCHEN BERLAND (Director, \"Rolling\"; Professor, Yale School of Medicine): Thank you for inviting me, Neal. CONAN: And let me get back to that scene I just mentioned. One of your stars, a woman named Vicki Elman has a series of problems with her wheelchair. In her case, she has is a powered wheelchair. She's coming back home from an appointment, the chair fails. The driver of the van she uses is not allowed to take her inside her house and she's left 10 feet from the door. (Soundbite of film \"Rolling\") Ms. Vicki Elman (Associate Director, \"Rolling\"): (As Herself) I was in the (unintelligible) calling 911, but my cell phone doesn't have a signal here, so I can't call anybody, either. So I'm just stuck here. CONAN: If you have trouble hearing that Vicki couldn't get a signal on her cell phone to call 911 and begins to worry that she's going to have to spend the night there in her chair. And, Gretchen Berland, in the face of incredible frustrations like that and other indignities, Vicki also tells us how she fights to keep her independence. Gretchen. Dr. BERLAND: Neal, are\u2026 CONAN: Yes. Dr. BERLAND: Yes. CONAN: I'm asking you about that. Dr. BERLAND: I'm sorry. CONAN: It's okay. You know, we're working to play another cut of tape there. Dr. BERLAND: You know, she - you are going to or you're asking me. CONAN: No. We weren't. No, we were asking you. Dr. BERLAND: You weren't - she - you know, Vicki is just extraordinary. I mean, I think the scene that you just played - when you watch that the first time it's just - you're absolutely speechless. And yet, in spite of this, in spite of sort of the - every day, there was something in Vicki's life that is difficult to do. And yet, she continues to live independently and want to live her own life. And half of the footage that all of three participants filmed was about, really, life in a wheelchair. It wasn't about some of the stereotypes about how hard it is, and there's plenty of that in the film. But Vicki is a very avid disability rights advocate. She is out of her house every day. She is going to the gym. But I think that scene, in particular, is just so - particularly when you watch the sunset as she's waiting outside, hoping that someone would drive by and bring her in her house, to me was - when you watch it the first time, it's just - you can't believe that this is happening in the United States today. CONAN: And the frustrations - we've all had frustrations dealing with insurance companies and government bureaucracies, but this seems to build to impossible level. Dr. BERLAND: Well, yes. There was one time when Vicki's wheelchair had broken and she has been back in a nursing home. And her insurance company didn't order or authorize the appropriate chair for her. They authorized a chair that was $4,000 cheaper than the wheelchair that she needed and that chair ended up actually giving her a decubitus ulcer, which put her back into the nursing home. So I remember I called the insurance company and asked them, I hope that they - that the phone conversation that they were having with me that they were actually recording it, because at that point, it's just like beating your head against the wall. I mean, you're so frustrated that it's almost tough to ask that you're trying to get help from a system that in theory is designed to help you and you get nowhere, and I don't have to live this every day. I'm - you know, I get to go home. I get to walk home. I get to walk into my car, and watching Vicki continues to fight and not become angry or bitter was an extraordinary learning experience for me. But it made me - I felt that oftentimes, Vicki's life - what happened or how she lived her life was in spite of the health care system not what we were doing for her in any way, shape or form. CONAN: If you get around in a wheelchair, call us and tell us what you see that we don't. 800-989-8255. E-mail is talk@npr. org. And let's begin with - I'm sorry, what's your first name? Tail(ph)? Ted(ph) - excuse me. Ted in Columbia in South Carolina. I was going for something obscure and turned out to be Ted. TED (Caller): It's Ted. CONAN: Yes, go ahead please. TED: Well, I just wanted to point out the avoidance that I tend to get from people, of course, looking away, tend to feel a distance between people. It's just seemed - to be a part of the human race, so to speak. But that's the biggest concern I have. Mostly more are extremely helpful or try to be. But there is that distance between a lot of people, particularly in a crowd. It seemed to be an annoyance. CONAN: How long have you been in a wheelchair, Ted? TED: Nine years. CONAN: So you're - do you ever get used to it? TED: You tolerate it. I don't know about getting used to it. But, you know, you make the best of things. CONAN: Do you ever feel like sending up a rocket flare or something like that and saying, I'm here. Would you pay attention to me? TED: Yes, I do, at times. It's rather frustrating to be ignored or avoided, so to speak. CONAN: And when people don't look at you, what do you think when that happens? TED: Well, it's really - yeah, I guess it's embarrassing more than anything. It's - they don't recognize you as being a person like they are. CONAN: Mm-hmm. Well, thanks very much for the call, Ted. TED: Thank you. Bye. CONAN: Bye-bye. Good luck to you. TED: Bye. CONAN: And Gretchen Berland, I have to say one of the more affecting parts of your show is that when we see these three people in wheelchairs in various settings and, indeed, you can see people not looking at them. Dr. BERLAND: You're right. I mean, it's called - the official term for it is gaze avoidance. And it happened in - the three participants filmed over 200 hours of footage and I spent two years in the field with them. So I got to see it and I think any family member or any person in a chair will tell you about this that there's something that - and Galen has written about this. There's the notion that somehow people don't make eye contact with you, they avoid you. And I've watched it in footage and it's, you know - how you can change society behavior, how you can get society to see that they're doing this. And what Ted described, I understand completely and the three people in the film showed us that. CONAN: She just referred to Galen. That's Galen Buckwalter, another of the stars of \"Rolling\" and also, like the others, listed as an associate director of the film. He joined us now from the studios of KPCC in Pasadena, California. And Galen Buckwalter, nice to have you on TALK OF THE NATION today. Dr. GALEN BUCKWALTER (Associate Director, \"Rolling\"; Research Psychologist; Vocalist, Siggy): My pleasure. Thanks. CONAN: And you've been in a wheelchair over 30 years? Dr. BUCKWALTER: Yes. CONAN: And I wonder that effect that we were just talking about with Ted, looking over the top of the person in the wheelchair. That's something we see in the film over and over again. Dr. BUCKWALTER: Yeah. It's part of the experience and actually it's one of the motivating factors for me to get involved in this film. You know, I thought that if - by just showing people our lives day in, day out that that knowledge would hopefully kind of, you know, desensitize people to the experience. I mean, you know, that we are essentially, you know, the same. We just have a different, you know - some differences. CONAN: Some differences and we see them much more even if we are among those people who do look at people in wheelchairs. We don't often see them as we see you, struggling to get in and out of your car. There's a scene where the fuse that adjusts the seat in your car is broken. And it's been set for your five-foot tall wife. And you're trying to get in and drive. Dr. BUCKWALTER: That actually wasn't my scene but\u2026 CONAN: Oh, I apologize. Dr. BUCKWALTER: Those types of inconveniences are - I mean, we're dependent on technology day in, day out. You know, for our chairs, you know, the vehicles, the equipment adds a layer of, you know, dependence that most people don't have to deal with. CONAN: Mm-hmm. And as you went through this project, were there parts of this that you would rather not have included? Dr. BUCKWALTER: I saw parts of myself that I was entirely comfortable with, I think. You know, I saw how I'd - at times, I think, have let the fact that, you know, I have been exposed to, you know - been expected to act disable then. I kind of take the role of a disabled person on and kind of act like, you know, like I had think people want me to act. CONAN: Hmm. Dr. BUCKWALTER: Which is, you know, kind of an odd experience to see. CONAN: See yourself disembodied like that or, again, from another perspective. Yeah. Dr. BUCKWALTER: Yeah. Just that, you know, I'm acting in a way. Particularly, it was apparent to me when I was dealing with my physician that I tend to act like a, you know, the good patient and not, you know, be more forceful on letting him know what my issues are. And because I think physicians don't necessarily have a lot of exposure to disabled people either. And they may not be aware of the specific issues. They may not take the time to make themselves aware of the issues that we face. CONAN: We'll talk more about that in just a couple of minutes. But I also wanted to mention there are some things that people would not expect from you. In fact, you're the lead singer in a rock 'n' roll band. Dr. BUCKWALTER: Yes, indeed. Siggy, with an S. CONAN: Siggy with an S. And there's a scene of you rehearsing. And well, we're going to go out at this segment, listening to a tune from Siggy's album, which we see you in the film getting the first CD presses from a triumphant moment from you. This is Galen Buckwalter's band, Siggy. Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan. This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. Over two million people in this country use wheelchairs to get around. We're talking about life from their point of view this hour. There's a new documentary about life in wheelchair, it's called \"Rolling. \" And it consists mostly of footage filmed by three participants with video cameras mounted on their wheelchairs. You can watch clips from \"Rolling\" at our Web site at npr. org/talk. Galen Buckwalter, as we mentioned, one of the participants in the film. He's with us today. Also, the director of the film, Gretchen Berland, who's also a doctor. And, of course, we want to hear from you, especially those of you in wheelchairs. What do you see that we don't? 800-989-8255. E-mail us: talk@npr. org. And you can check out our blog at npr. org/blogofthenation. And let's see if we can get another caller on the line. This is Sandy(ph). Sandy with us from Cleveland, Ohio. SANDY (Caller): Hi, thank you for taking my call. I'm both a physician with many patients in wheelchairs and a mother of a son in a wheelchair. He is a beautiful 11-year-old boy and has been in the wheelchair since birth. My comment is this. It's actually the adults that have the avoidance. My children don't have that same avoidance technique. Children are very curious about him. He's cute. And they want to come up and talk to him. And parents are so concerned about political correctness or not hurting so much feeling. And they actually scare their children away from asking questions. And I just wish they would have that same openness that their children do, to come and ask why is he in a wheelchair, why is he different. CONAN: Hmm. SANDY: He would love that interaction. CONAN: Galen Buckwalter, have you experienced? Dr. BUCKWALTER: Oh, that's a great point. Kids are so refreshing. You know, there is no fear. There is no, you know, viewing me as some - well, they recognize the differences but they just put it out on the table. And that's all that we can ask for. Just honest interchange. SANDY: Exactly. CONAN: Here's an e-mail we got on the same point from Daniel(ph) in St. Louis. When I see someone in a wheelchair, I look away only because I don't want to seem like I'm staring. I don't think any less of handicapped people. And I fear many people feel the same way. Dr. BUCKWALTER: I mean, you don't need to stare. But don't avoid either. You know, we know that there are differences. We have to negotiate. It's much easier if we can do it openly. CONAN: Sandy, let me ask you. Just before the break, Galen said something I thought was quite interesting. He said he didn't think a lot of doctors had experience with people in wheelchairs. And obviously, you're a little a bit different from that. But would you agree with him? SANDY: You know, it's interesting. I have a lot of patients who - I'm an internist - and who have MS. And maybe it's because - interestingly to have referred other people to me who have MS. Maybe it's because I'm so comfortable with them. And I can talk to them about how to manage problems with the wheelchair. We have an expensive wheelchair, and sometimes at the hardware store, buying parts to make modifications to it, wheelchairs, particularly because insurance would never approve of the smallest things. So I think I'd probably have more experience with patients with wheelchairs than other people and I think it's just because I have them referred to me because of my comfort level. CONAN: Okay. Thanks very much for the call, Sandy. I appreciate it. SANDY: Thank you. CONAN: And we wish you and your son the best of luck. SANDY: Thank you. CONAN: I wanted to ask you, Gretchen Berland, to what degree did you hope that physicians would learn something from this film? Dr. BERLAND: I - you know, I think that any person can learn something just from this film. But, you know, physicians, we don't - most medical schools don't have formal curriculums related to caring for disabled persons. Most patients who are in wheelchairs, and Sandy said - Sandy's an internist like myself - many patients who are in chairs don't see physical med rehab programs, which is a specialty that is - that are trained for taking care of disabled persons. So I think physicians - I think every physician tries to do their best by their patients, but it's clear that what the three participants filmed were there are times that we really - there were big gaps in terms of how we were interacting with them that we can do a lot better. And it's not about - a lot of it is not technology, some of it is just simple common courtesy - sitting down, taking a time and thinking about what someone might be experiencing before they come and see you. So the film in some ways is directed towards a number of audiences. It's for health care professionals and that extends beyond physicians - that's physical therapists, nurses, nursing aides, a whole group of people. But I think there also - all of us can learn something from what these three people showed me. CONAN: Let's see if we can get Wesley(ph) on the line. Wesley, with us from Lapeer in Michigan. WESLEY (Caller): Yes. Yes. I'm here. CONAN: Yep. WESLEY: And my comment is I often have trouble finding doctors who will listen to what I have to say rather than taking a look, making an assumption and the diagnosis before I've even finished talking. CONAN: Can you give us quick for instance? WESLEY: Just recently, I needed to go in for - I had a medical problem. And I tried to make an appointment only to find out the current doctor I had, which I haven't seen for six months, had moved their office to another town. So I was attempting to get assigned to a different doctor in our local area. I got into his office; he took one look at me and said, oh, you're diabetic. Your problem is so, so, so. And I am not diabetic. I've never had any of that type of problem. But that was his automatic assumption with what my diagnosis was before any test have even been run. CONAN: And, again, Galen Buckwalter, I wanted to ask you if that sounds familiar. Dr. BUCKWALTER: Yeah, all too familiar. And I think, you know, there - to find a physician that sees patients with specific disabilities can be so helpful. But that's not often the case in managed care. And, you know, you end up, you know, seeing a physician who doesn't see, you know, the complexity - I mean, typically, people with disabilities have comorbidities where, you know - I mean, I'm a spinal-cord-injured patient, I have high blood pressure. And my high blood pressure is very volatile. It's not like typical high blood pressure. And, you know, there's literature available for physicians if they take the time to look at that. But, you know, I mean, with the managed care and, you know, the pressure that insurance companies put on physicians, you know, it's really hard for them to, you know, take the time to look at the complexities of the issues that are often there with disabled people. CONAN: Thanks for the call. WESLEY: Thank you. CONAN: All right. Bye-bye. We - Galen Buckwalter just mentioned he's in a wheelchair as a result of his spinal cord injury. Vicki Elman, we heard from earlier, has multiple sclerosis. And the third participant in the film, the third star, if you will, the third associate director is a man named Ernie Wallengren, who is diagnosed with ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease, and that confronted him with very different problems than the other two. (Soundbite of film \"Rolling\") Mr. ERNIE WALLENGREN (Associate Director, \"Rolling\"; Writer and Part-time Basketball Coach): I have (unintelligible), so what? This is going to suck. All right. This is a tape about what's it's like to have ALS. What it's like to live in a wheelchair. What it's like to live inside the walls of my house. When - the son who plays his drums. CONAN: And Gretchen Berland, that mordant sense of humor\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. BUCKWALTER: He's got to be. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. BERLAND: Yeah. CONAN: Timing. Dr. BERLAND: You know, Ernie\u2026 CONAN: It's all timing. You know. Dr. BERLAND: Yeah. You know - and Ernie is, you know, part of the process of making \"Rolling\" as we - this interactive(ph) process so we screen the footage with the participants and their family members. And when Ernie's mother saw this clip, she said, Ernie, you were born bored. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. BERLAND: But, you know, Ernie, as you were right, Neal, his trajectory from sort of living the experience of being in a wheelchair became very quickly within probably the first six weeks given what was happening with his ALS, became mostly about ALS. And many of the decisions that he was wrestling with around choices in terms of care. And he did those mostly in his bathroom, in front of the bathroom mirror which you'll see if you watch, as you've seen if you watched the film. CONAN: Hmm. Dr. BERLAND: But, you know, Ernie - I think each Galen, Vicki and Ernie, and Ernie in particular, really talks about the balance between living independently and what it means to be human and burden. And that was a pendulum for him. It wasn't a static concept that would - it would swing back and forth depending on what was going on. And that was something that he wrestled with. And then would always see as humorous as the foil, the sort of just when you thought he couldn't take it, he would come back with: the son who plays his drums. CONAN: Let's see if we can get another caller on the line. And this is Derek(ph). Derek with us from San Francisco. DEREK (Caller): Yeah, hi. I'm an able-bodied person. But I have a really fantastic learning experience about this taking a course in wheelchair designing construction at San Francisco State University. So I just wanted to share that and explain to you what it was like. So we were designing wheelchairs that are intended to be built in developing countries where they don't really have a wheelchair industry. And so, you know, try to introduce wheelchairs basically in some parts of the world where they are not available. And so each semester, the class tries to optimize the design and get it a little bit cheaper. And so they built sort of another iteration on their prototype. And then the project of the class is to build that prototype. And so, you know, we're learning about, sort of, the ergonomics and what's comfortable and what's, you know, what breaks easily and, you know, we spend the first half of the class during this semester actually sitting in the chairs - going, you know, and then going around campus. We all go like have dinner together riding the same chairs that are like, you know, chairs that exists in China or chairs from 50 years ago or 20 years ago. CONAN: That's interesting. DEREK: Yeah. CONAN: What did you - what was your most important lesson as you rode around in a wheelchair as a person who's abled? DEREK: Well, so the - I think it was called gaze avoidance. CONAN: Yes, we've mentioned that before. DEREK: Like you guys mentioned before. I experienced that tremendously. And I felt that, you know, people - passersby would be so self-conscious about the appropriateness of their reaction. That they would be just sort of uncomfortable and not uncomfortable on my account but uncomfortable because they were sort of - they were embarrassed to see - they were embarrassed about whether they might be acting sort of appropriately. Like\u2026 CONAN: Yeah. DEREK: I think people wanted to accommodate me, but they felt\u2026 CONAN: Embarrassed. DEREK: \u2026(unintelligible). CONAN: Yeah. Galen\u2026 DEREK: (Unintelligible) with me. CONAN: Galen Buckwalter, I wonder, do you have any advice for wheelchair manufacturers? DEREK: The manufacturers\u2026 CONAN: Hold on. Go ahead, Galen. Dr. BUCKWALTER: I think the approach of the caller is right on. To spend time in chairs and, you know, expose yourself to our needs. And, you know, it seems like that, you know, the experience of the caller in actually, you know, being in a chair, kind of, you know, desensitized him. And I mean, basically, that's the goal of this film. It's to see what we, you know, experienced and, I mean, we're not living another life, we just have different issues to deal with. And people, you know, it's not things that you want to have to deal with, but, hey, you know, stuff happens. And everybody, at some point in their life, is going to have some degree of disability to confront. CONAN: Thanks very much for the call, Derek. DEREK: Yeah. If I can make one comment of what I learned, you know, what I thought came to prefer as the best reaction from an able-bodied person was to just say something like - like, say, someone's struggling to get you to get up a ramp or something - to say something like you let me know if you need a hand rather than to kind of stare at me and wait to help or to like effusively offer help. CONAN: Okay. Thanks very much for the call. Again, appreciate it. DEREK: Thanks. CONAN: We're talking about the film \"Rolling\" with one of its participants, Galen Buckwalter, and with its director, Dr. Gretchen Berland. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And let's see if we can get - this is Brenda(ph). Brenda is with us from Rockford, Illinois. BRENDA (Caller): Hi and thanks for taking my call. And thank you Gretchen for making this film. I think this is something people definitely need to see. I wanted to tell you about an experience I had while I was employed at a Center for Independent Living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I was visiting a resident of a local group. And I started to feel ill and had chest pains. And so they called the paramedics to take me to the hospital. But the paramedics spent 15 minutes arguing over who was responsible for me before they would even put me in the ambulance. So the problems that physicians have with us are sometimes life-threatening. CONAN: Yes. I can understand that. And I can hear Gretchen Berland apologizing for her profession. Dr. BERLAND: Yeah. You know, it's - I would - I'm hoping that there are aspects of the stories that we've heard today and what we've heard on - Galen and I had been looking at some of the blogs where - that these will be something that, five years from now, we won't hear about anymore. BRENDA: Right. Dr. BERLAND: These will become\u2026 BRENDA: I know there's been a trend where people have had difficulty realizing that I'm responsible for myself. And I know that it's affected friends and consumers that I work with. And so I'm here to just say to everybody who's in that situation, worry about - worry less about whether or not people are competent to make those decisions when they're telling you they are. CONAN: Yeah. Dr. BERLAND: Yeah. BRENDA: It was probably the most disempowering experience of my life. And I hope that it never happens again. Dr. BERLAND: I hope it never happens again as well. CONAN: Thanks very much for the call, Brenda. And again\u2026 BRENDA: Thank you. CONAN: \u2026yeah. Well, amen to that. So\u2026 BRENDA: Thanks. CONAN: Galen Buckwalter, I wanted to ask you, toward the end of the film, as it follows you over these two years, you've been having problems with your shoulders throughout. Indeed, there's a scene where you're waiting for 40 minutes in a doctor's office for an appointment, which is telling. But in another context, how are you doing? How are the shoulders? Are you still able to your manual wheelchair? And just to - also an informational question - why do you prefer the manual wheelchair over a powered model? Dr. BUCKWALTER: Well, I had lived in a manual wheelchair for, you know, 30 years. And wheelchairs are actually very efficient and fun modes of transportation. I mean, you know, when you, you know, get used to it. I mean, you kind of floating down an incline is a great way to, you know - it's a great feeling. I really enjoyed being in a manual chair. You know, as weird as that may sound, you know, it was good exercise. But, you know, I'm - as a quadriplegic, you know, it took a lot of strain on my shoulders. And I did have to move to a powerchair a year, a year and a half ago. And you know, with that comes increased dependence and, you know, and now, I have to worry about the chair breaking down. I have to worry about insurance. You know, as you saw with Vicky in the film, it's a nightmare to get insurance to keep a chair in working condition, even. So you know, I mean, it was a loss. But you know, it's also, you know - now, I'm, you know, getting around town and, you know. I also got a van, you know, that I will take my powerchair. So you know, it's give and take. You win some, lose some. CONAN: Galen Buckwalter, hope you're getting around town and making trouble for a lot of people. Dr. BUCKWALTER: Thanks. CONAN: Thanks very much. Galen Buckwalter is featured in \"Rolling,\" a documentary by Gretchen Berland that will premier on PBS stations this month. He was with us from KPCC. And Gretchen Berland, thank you so much for your time today, too. Dr. BERLAND: Thank you. CONAN: Gretchen Berland teaches at the Yale University School of Medicine. And her new film is \"Rolling. \" Stay with us. It's TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  NEAL CONAN, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington.  More than two million of us get around in wheelchairs. To learn more about what their everyday lives are like, filmmaker Gretchen Berland gave three people video cameras to give us a look at life from their point of view. A documentary edited from their footage shows minor annoyances - why does everything you want in a grocery store seem to be on the top shelf - and outrages, too. Endless struggles with bureaucracy that in one case left a woman stranded in a broken wheelchair 10 feet outside the door to her house.  Gretchen Berland is also a doctor who teaches at Yale University School of Medicine. In 2004, she was awarded a MacArthur fellowship, a so-called genius grant, for her research on the relationship between physicians and patients. And part of her hopes in this project is to teach doctors about their patients' lives outside of clinics and hospitals.  Later in the hour, we'll talk with the husband of Ingrid Betancourt, who's been held hostage in Columbia for almost six years now. Earlier today, Columbia's main guerilla group, the FARC, released two other women hostages.  But first, the everyday lives of Americans in wheelchairs. If you're in a wheelchair, what do you see that most people don't? Our number is 800-989-8255. E-mail us talk@npr. org. And you can join the conversation on our blog at npr. org/blogofthenation.  Filmmaker and physician Gretchen Berland joins us now from the studio at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.  And thanks very much for being with us today.  Dr. GRETCHEN BERLAND (Director, \"Rolling\"; Professor, Yale School of Medicine): Thank you for inviting me, Neal.  CONAN: And let me get back to that scene I just mentioned. One of your stars, a woman named Vicki Elman has a series of problems with her wheelchair. In her case, she has is a powered wheelchair. She's coming back home from an appointment, the chair fails. The driver of the van she uses is not allowed to take her inside her house and she's left 10 feet from the door.  (Soundbite of film \"Rolling\")  Ms. Vicki Elman (Associate Director, \"Rolling\"): (As Herself) I was in the (unintelligible) calling 911, but my cell phone doesn't have a signal here, so I can't call anybody, either. So I'm just stuck here.  CONAN: If you have trouble hearing that Vicki couldn't get a signal on her cell phone to call 911 and begins to worry that she's going to have to spend the night there in her chair.  And, Gretchen Berland, in the face of incredible frustrations like that and other indignities, Vicki also tells us how she fights to keep her independence. Gretchen.  Dr. BERLAND: Neal, are\u2026  CONAN: Yes.  Dr. BERLAND: Yes.  CONAN: I'm asking you about that.  Dr. BERLAND: I'm sorry.  CONAN: It's okay. You know, we're working to play another cut of tape there.  Dr. BERLAND: You know, she - you are going to or you're asking me.  CONAN: No. We weren't. No, we were asking you.  Dr. BERLAND: You weren't - she - you know, Vicki is just extraordinary. I mean, I think the scene that you just played - when you watch that the first time it's just - you're absolutely speechless. And yet, in spite of this, in spite of sort of the - every day, there was something in Vicki's life that is difficult to do. And yet, she continues to live independently and want to live her own life.  And half of the footage that all of three participants filmed was about, really, life in a wheelchair. It wasn't about some of the stereotypes about how hard it is, and there's plenty of that in the film. But Vicki is a very avid disability rights advocate. She is out of her house every day. She is going to the gym. But I think that scene, in particular, is just so - particularly when you watch the sunset as she's waiting outside, hoping that someone would drive by and bring her in her house, to me was - when you watch it the first time, it's just - you can't believe that this is happening in the United States today.  CONAN: And the frustrations - we've all had frustrations dealing with insurance companies and government bureaucracies, but this seems to build to impossible level.  Dr. BERLAND: Well, yes. There was one time when Vicki's wheelchair had broken and she has been back in a nursing home. And her insurance company didn't order or authorize the appropriate chair for her. They authorized a chair that was $4,000 cheaper than the wheelchair that she needed and that chair ended up actually giving her a decubitus ulcer, which put her back into the nursing home.  So I remember I called the insurance company and asked them, I hope that they - that the phone conversation that they were having with me that they were actually recording it, because at that point, it's just like beating your head against the wall. I mean, you're so frustrated that it's almost tough to ask that you're trying to get help from a system that in theory is designed to help you and you get nowhere, and I don't have to live this every day.  I'm - you know, I get to go home. I get to walk home. I get to walk into my car, and watching Vicki continues to fight and not become angry or bitter was an extraordinary learning experience for me. But it made me - I felt that oftentimes, Vicki's life - what happened or how she lived her life was in spite of the health care system not what we were doing for her in any way, shape or form.  CONAN: If you get around in a wheelchair, call us and tell us what you see that we don't. 800-989-8255. E-mail is talk@npr. org. And let's begin with - I'm sorry, what's your first name? Tail(ph)? Ted(ph) - excuse me. Ted in Columbia in South Carolina. I was going for something obscure and turned out to be Ted.  TED (Caller): It's Ted.  CONAN: Yes, go ahead please.  TED: Well, I just wanted to point out the avoidance that I tend to get from people, of course, looking away, tend to feel a distance between people. It's just seemed - to be a part of the human race, so to speak. But that's the biggest concern I have. Mostly more are extremely helpful or try to be. But there is that distance between a lot of people, particularly in a crowd. It seemed to be an annoyance.  CONAN: How long have you been in a wheelchair, Ted?  TED: Nine years.  CONAN: So you're - do you ever get used to it?  TED: You tolerate it. I don't know about getting used to it. But, you know, you make the best of things.  CONAN: Do you ever feel like sending up a rocket flare or something like that and saying, I'm here. Would you pay attention to me?  TED: Yes, I do, at times. It's rather frustrating to be ignored or avoided, so to speak.  CONAN: And when people don't look at you, what do you think when that happens?  TED: Well, it's really - yeah, I guess it's embarrassing more than anything. It's - they don't recognize you as being a person like they are.  CONAN: Mm-hmm. Well, thanks very much for the call, Ted.  TED: Thank you. Bye.  CONAN: Bye-bye. Good luck to you.  TED: Bye.  CONAN: And Gretchen Berland, I have to say one of the more affecting parts of your show is that when we see these three people in wheelchairs in various settings and, indeed, you can see people not looking at them.  Dr. BERLAND: You're right. I mean, it's called - the official term for it is gaze avoidance. And it happened in - the three participants filmed over 200 hours of footage and I spent two years in the field with them. So I got to see it and I think any family member or any person in a chair will tell you about this that there's something that - and Galen has written about this. There's the notion that somehow people don't make eye contact with you, they avoid you. And I've watched it in footage and it's, you know - how you can change society behavior, how you can get society to see that they're doing this. And what Ted described, I understand completely and the three people in the film showed us that.  CONAN: She just referred to Galen. That's Galen Buckwalter, another of the stars of \"Rolling\" and also, like the others, listed as an associate director of the film. He joined us now from the studios of KPCC in Pasadena, California.  And Galen Buckwalter, nice to have you on TALK OF THE NATION today.  Dr. GALEN BUCKWALTER (Associate Director, \"Rolling\"; Research Psychologist; Vocalist, Siggy): My pleasure. Thanks.  CONAN: And you've been in a wheelchair over 30 years?  Dr. BUCKWALTER: Yes.  CONAN: And I wonder that effect that we were just talking about with Ted, looking over the top of the person in the wheelchair. That's something we see in the film over and over again.  Dr. BUCKWALTER: Yeah. It's part of the experience and actually it's one of the motivating factors for me to get involved in this film. You know, I thought that if - by just showing people our lives day in, day out that that knowledge would hopefully kind of, you know, desensitize people to the experience. I mean, you know, that we are essentially, you know, the same. We just have a different, you know - some differences.  CONAN: Some differences and we see them much more even if we are among those people who do look at people in wheelchairs. We don't often see them as we see you, struggling to get in and out of your car. There's a scene where the fuse that adjusts the seat in your car is broken. And it's been set for your five-foot tall wife. And you're trying to get in and drive.  Dr. BUCKWALTER: That actually wasn't my scene but\u2026  CONAN: Oh, I apologize.  Dr. BUCKWALTER: Those types of inconveniences are - I mean, we're dependent on technology day in, day out. You know, for our chairs, you know, the vehicles, the equipment adds a layer of, you know, dependence that most people don't have to deal with.  CONAN: Mm-hmm. And as you went through this project, were there parts of this that you would rather not have included?  Dr. BUCKWALTER: I saw parts of myself that I was entirely comfortable with, I think. You know, I saw how I'd - at times, I think, have let the fact that, you know, I have been exposed to, you know - been expected to act disable then. I kind of take the role of a disabled person on and kind of act like, you know, like I had think people want me to act.  CONAN: Hmm.  Dr. BUCKWALTER: Which is, you know, kind of an odd experience to see.  CONAN: See yourself disembodied like that or, again, from another perspective. Yeah.  Dr. BUCKWALTER: Yeah. Just that, you know, I'm acting in a way. Particularly, it was apparent to me when I was dealing with my physician that I tend to act like a, you know, the good patient and not, you know, be more forceful on letting him know what my issues are. And because I think physicians don't necessarily have a lot of exposure to disabled people either. And they may not be aware of the specific issues. They may not take the time to make themselves aware of the issues that we face.  CONAN: We'll talk more about that in just a couple of minutes. But I also wanted to mention there are some things that people would not expect from you. In fact, you're the lead singer in a rock 'n' roll band.  Dr. BUCKWALTER: Yes, indeed. Siggy, with an S.  CONAN: Siggy with an S. And there's a scene of you rehearsing. And well, we're going to go out at this segment, listening to a tune from Siggy's album, which we see you in the film getting the first CD presses from a triumphant moment from you. This is Galen Buckwalter's band, Siggy. Stay with us.  I'm Neal Conan. This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington.  Over two million people in this country use wheelchairs to get around. We're talking about life from their point of view this hour. There's a new documentary about life in wheelchair, it's called \"Rolling. \" And it consists mostly of footage filmed by three participants with video cameras mounted on their wheelchairs. You can watch clips from \"Rolling\" at our Web site at npr. org/talk.  Galen Buckwalter, as we mentioned, one of the participants in the film. He's with us today. Also, the director of the film, Gretchen Berland, who's also a doctor. And, of course, we want to hear from you, especially those of you in wheelchairs. What do you see that we don't? 800-989-8255. E-mail us: talk@npr. org. And you can check out our blog at npr. org/blogofthenation.  And let's see if we can get another caller on the line. This is Sandy(ph). Sandy with us from Cleveland, Ohio.  SANDY (Caller): Hi, thank you for taking my call. I'm both a physician with many patients in wheelchairs and a mother of a son in a wheelchair. He is a beautiful 11-year-old boy and has been in the wheelchair since birth.  My comment is this. It's actually the adults that have the avoidance. My children don't have that same avoidance technique. Children are very curious about him. He's cute. And they want to come up and talk to him. And parents are so concerned about political correctness or not hurting so much feeling. And they actually scare their children away from asking questions. And I just wish they would have that same openness that their children do, to come and ask why is he in a wheelchair, why is he different.  CONAN: Hmm.  SANDY: He would love that interaction.  CONAN: Galen Buckwalter, have you experienced?  Dr. BUCKWALTER: Oh, that's a great point. Kids are so refreshing. You know, there is no fear. There is no, you know, viewing me as some - well, they recognize the differences but they just put it out on the table. And that's all that we can ask for. Just honest interchange.  SANDY: Exactly.  CONAN: Here's an e-mail we got on the same point from Daniel(ph) in St. Louis. When I see someone in a wheelchair, I look away only because I don't want to seem like I'm staring. I don't think any less of handicapped people. And I fear many people feel the same way.  Dr. BUCKWALTER: I mean, you don't need to stare. But don't avoid either. You know, we know that there are differences. We have to negotiate. It's much easier if we can do it openly.  CONAN: Sandy, let me ask you. Just before the break, Galen said something I thought was quite interesting. He said he didn't think a lot of doctors had experience with people in wheelchairs. And obviously, you're a little a bit different from that. But would you agree with him?  SANDY: You know, it's interesting. I have a lot of patients who - I'm an internist - and who have MS. And maybe it's because - interestingly to have referred other people to me who have MS. Maybe it's because I'm so comfortable with them. And I can talk to them about how to manage problems with the wheelchair. We have an expensive wheelchair, and sometimes at the hardware store, buying parts to make modifications to it, wheelchairs, particularly because insurance would never approve of the smallest things. So I think I'd probably have more experience with patients with wheelchairs than other people and I think it's just because I have them referred to me because of my comfort level.  CONAN: Okay. Thanks very much for the call, Sandy. I appreciate it.  SANDY: Thank you.  CONAN: And we wish you and your son the best of luck.  SANDY: Thank you.  CONAN: I wanted to ask you, Gretchen Berland, to what degree did you hope that physicians would learn something from this film?  Dr. BERLAND: I - you know, I think that any person can learn something just from this film. But, you know, physicians, we don't - most medical schools don't have formal curriculums related to caring for disabled persons. Most patients who are in wheelchairs, and Sandy said - Sandy's an internist like myself - many patients who are in chairs don't see physical med rehab programs, which is a specialty that is - that are trained for taking care of disabled persons.  So I think physicians - I think every physician tries to do their best by their patients, but it's clear that what the three participants filmed were there are times that we really - there were big gaps in terms of how we were interacting with them that we can do a lot better. And it's not about - a lot of it is not technology, some of it is just simple common courtesy - sitting down, taking a time and thinking about what someone might be experiencing before they come and see you.  So the film in some ways is directed towards a number of audiences. It's for health care professionals and that extends beyond physicians - that's physical therapists, nurses, nursing aides, a whole group of people. But I think there also - all of us can learn something from what these three people showed me.  CONAN: Let's see if we can get Wesley(ph) on the line. Wesley, with us from Lapeer in Michigan.  WESLEY (Caller): Yes. Yes. I'm here.  CONAN: Yep.  WESLEY: And my comment is I often have trouble finding doctors who will listen to what I have to say rather than taking a look, making an assumption and the diagnosis before I've even finished talking.  CONAN: Can you give us quick for instance?  WESLEY: Just recently, I needed to go in for - I had a medical problem. And I tried to make an appointment only to find out the current doctor I had, which I haven't seen for six months, had moved their office to another town. So I was attempting to get assigned to a different doctor in our local area. I got into his office; he took one look at me and said, oh, you're diabetic. Your problem is so, so, so. And I am not diabetic. I've never had any of that type of problem. But that was his automatic assumption with what my diagnosis was before any test have even been run.  CONAN: And, again, Galen Buckwalter, I wanted to ask you if that sounds familiar.  Dr. BUCKWALTER: Yeah, all too familiar. And I think, you know, there - to find a physician that sees patients with specific disabilities can be so helpful. But that's not often the case in managed care. And, you know, you end up, you know, seeing a physician who doesn't see, you know, the complexity - I mean, typically, people with disabilities have comorbidities where, you know - I mean, I'm a spinal-cord-injured patient, I have high blood pressure. And my high blood pressure is very volatile. It's not like typical high blood pressure.  And, you know, there's literature available for physicians if they take the time to look at that. But, you know, I mean, with the managed care and, you know, the pressure that insurance companies put on physicians, you know, it's really hard for them to, you know, take the time to look at the complexities of the issues that are often there with disabled people.  CONAN: Thanks for the call.  WESLEY: Thank you.  CONAN: All right. Bye-bye. We - Galen Buckwalter just mentioned he's in a wheelchair as a result of his spinal cord injury. Vicki Elman, we heard from earlier, has multiple sclerosis. And the third participant in the film, the third star, if you will, the third associate director is a man named Ernie Wallengren, who is diagnosed with ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease, and that confronted him with very different problems than the other two.  (Soundbite of film \"Rolling\")  Mr. ERNIE WALLENGREN (Associate Director, \"Rolling\"; Writer and Part-time Basketball Coach): I have (unintelligible), so what? This is going to suck. All right. This is a tape about what's it's like to have ALS. What it's like to live in a wheelchair. What it's like to live inside the walls of my house. When - the son who plays his drums.  CONAN: And Gretchen Berland, that mordant sense of humor\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. BUCKWALTER: He's got to be.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. BERLAND: Yeah.  CONAN: Timing.  Dr. BERLAND: You know, Ernie\u2026  CONAN: It's all timing. You know.  Dr. BERLAND: Yeah. You know - and Ernie is, you know, part of the process of making \"Rolling\" as we - this interactive(ph) process so we screen the footage with the participants and their family members. And when Ernie's mother saw this clip, she said, Ernie, you were born bored.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. BERLAND: But, you know, Ernie, as you were right, Neal, his trajectory from sort of living the experience of being in a wheelchair became very quickly within probably the first six weeks given what was happening with his ALS, became mostly about ALS. And many of the decisions that he was wrestling with around choices in terms of care. And he did those mostly in his bathroom, in front of the bathroom mirror which you'll see if you watch, as you've seen if you watched the film.  CONAN: Hmm.  Dr. BERLAND: But, you know, Ernie - I think each Galen, Vicki and Ernie, and Ernie in particular, really talks about the balance between living independently and what it means to be human and burden. And that was a pendulum for him. It wasn't a static concept that would - it would swing back and forth depending on what was going on. And that was something that he wrestled with. And then would always see as humorous as the foil, the sort of just when you thought he couldn't take it, he would come back with: the son who plays his drums.  CONAN: Let's see if we can get another caller on the line. And this is Derek(ph). Derek with us from San Francisco.  DEREK (Caller): Yeah, hi. I'm an able-bodied person. But I have a really fantastic learning experience about this taking a course in wheelchair designing construction at San Francisco State University. So I just wanted to share that and explain to you what it was like. So we were designing wheelchairs that are intended to be built in developing countries where they don't really have a wheelchair industry. And so, you know, try to introduce wheelchairs basically in some parts of the world where they are not available.  And so each semester, the class tries to optimize the design and get it a little bit cheaper. And so they built sort of another iteration on their prototype. And then the project of the class is to build that prototype. And so, you know, we're learning about, sort of, the ergonomics and what's comfortable and what's, you know, what breaks easily and, you know, we spend the first half of the class during this semester actually sitting in the chairs - going, you know, and then going around campus. We all go like have dinner together riding the same chairs that are like, you know, chairs that exists in China or chairs from 50 years ago or 20 years ago.  CONAN: That's interesting.  DEREK: Yeah.  CONAN: What did you - what was your most important lesson as you rode around in a wheelchair as a person who's abled?  DEREK: Well, so the - I think it was called gaze avoidance.  CONAN: Yes, we've mentioned that before.  DEREK: Like you guys mentioned before. I experienced that tremendously. And I felt that, you know, people - passersby would be so self-conscious about the appropriateness of their reaction. That they would be just sort of uncomfortable and not uncomfortable on my account but uncomfortable because they were sort of - they were embarrassed to see - they were embarrassed about whether they might be acting sort of appropriately. Like\u2026  CONAN: Yeah.  DEREK: I think people wanted to accommodate me, but they felt\u2026  CONAN: Embarrassed.  DEREK: \u2026(unintelligible).  CONAN: Yeah. Galen\u2026  DEREK: (Unintelligible) with me.  CONAN: Galen Buckwalter, I wonder, do you have any advice for wheelchair manufacturers?  DEREK: The manufacturers\u2026  CONAN: Hold on. Go ahead, Galen.  Dr. BUCKWALTER: I think the approach of the caller is right on. To spend time in chairs and, you know, expose yourself to our needs. And, you know, it seems like that, you know, the experience of the caller in actually, you know, being in a chair, kind of, you know, desensitized him. And I mean, basically, that's the goal of this film. It's to see what we, you know, experienced and, I mean, we're not living another life, we just have different issues to deal with. And people, you know, it's not things that you want to have to deal with, but, hey, you know, stuff happens. And everybody, at some point in their life, is going to have some degree of disability to confront.  CONAN: Thanks very much for the call, Derek.  DEREK: Yeah. If I can make one comment of what I learned, you know, what I thought came to prefer as the best reaction from an able-bodied person was to just say something like - like, say, someone's struggling to get you to get up a ramp or something - to say something like you let me know if you need a hand rather than to kind of stare at me and wait to help or to like effusively offer help.  CONAN: Okay. Thanks very much for the call. Again, appreciate it.  DEREK: Thanks.  CONAN: We're talking about the film \"Rolling\" with one of its participants, Galen Buckwalter, and with its director, Dr. Gretchen Berland. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  And let's see if we can get - this is Brenda(ph). Brenda is with us from Rockford, Illinois.  BRENDA (Caller): Hi and thanks for taking my call. And thank you Gretchen for making this film. I think this is something people definitely need to see. I wanted to tell you about an experience I had while I was employed at a Center for Independent Living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I was visiting a resident of a local group. And I started to feel ill and had chest pains. And so they called the paramedics to take me to the hospital. But the paramedics spent 15 minutes arguing over who was responsible for me before they would even put me in the ambulance. So the problems that physicians have with us are sometimes life-threatening.  CONAN: Yes. I can understand that. And I can hear Gretchen Berland apologizing for her profession.  Dr. BERLAND: Yeah. You know, it's - I would - I'm hoping that there are aspects of the stories that we've heard today and what we've heard on - Galen and I had been looking at some of the blogs where - that these will be something that, five years from now, we won't hear about anymore.  BRENDA: Right.  Dr. BERLAND: These will become\u2026  BRENDA: I know there's been a trend where people have had difficulty realizing that I'm responsible for myself. And I know that it's affected friends and consumers that I work with. And so I'm here to just say to everybody who's in that situation, worry about - worry less about whether or not people are competent to make those decisions when they're telling you they are.  CONAN: Yeah.  Dr. BERLAND: Yeah.  BRENDA: It was probably the most disempowering experience of my life. And I hope that it never happens again.  Dr. BERLAND: I hope it never happens again as well.  CONAN: Thanks very much for the call, Brenda. And again\u2026  BRENDA: Thank you.  CONAN: \u2026yeah. Well, amen to that. So\u2026  BRENDA: Thanks.  CONAN: Galen Buckwalter, I wanted to ask you, toward the end of the film, as it follows you over these two years, you've been having problems with your shoulders throughout. Indeed, there's a scene where you're waiting for 40 minutes in a doctor's office for an appointment, which is telling. But in another context, how are you doing? How are the shoulders? Are you still able to your manual wheelchair? And just to - also an informational question - why do you prefer the manual wheelchair over a powered model?  Dr. BUCKWALTER: Well, I had lived in a manual wheelchair for, you know, 30 years. And wheelchairs are actually very efficient and fun modes of transportation. I mean, you know, when you, you know, get used to it. I mean, you kind of floating down an incline is a great way to, you know - it's a great feeling. I really enjoyed being in a manual chair. You know, as weird as that may sound, you know, it was good exercise. But, you know, I'm - as a quadriplegic, you know, it took a lot of strain on my shoulders. And I did have to move to a powerchair a year, a year and a half ago.  And you know, with that comes increased dependence and, you know, and now, I have to worry about the chair breaking down. I have to worry about insurance. You know, as you saw with Vicky in the film, it's a nightmare to get insurance to keep a chair in working condition, even. So you know, I mean, it was a loss. But you know, it's also, you know - now, I'm, you know, getting around town and, you know. I also got a van, you know, that I will take my powerchair. So you know, it's give and take. You win some, lose some.  CONAN: Galen Buckwalter, hope you're getting around town and making trouble for a lot of people.  Dr. BUCKWALTER: Thanks.  CONAN: Thanks very much. Galen Buckwalter is featured in \"Rolling,\" a documentary by Gretchen Berland that will premier on PBS stations this month. He was with us from KPCC.  And Gretchen Berland, thank you so much for your time today, too.  Dr. BERLAND: Thank you.  CONAN: Gretchen Berland teaches at the Yale University School of Medicine.

Long, beautiful hair. Shining, gleaming, streaming, flaxen, waxen. Give me down to there hair. Shoulder-length or longer\u2026 ALISON STEWART, host: Phil McCrory started cutting hair in '71. And after spending 18 years sweeping the shear and locks up the floor, he tried to figure out what he could do with all those ringlets and curls. And he came up with not one, but two great inventions. One involves environmental cleanup. The other might have helped make your salad last night. BILL WOLFF, host: Eew. STEWART: That's right, using human hair on crops. Get ready to meet a guy who has about 15 tons of hair in a warehouse in Florida somewhere. Joining us on the phone right now is inventor of SmartGrow, Phil McCrory. Hi, Phil. Mr. PHIL McCRORY (Inventor, SmartGrow): Good morning. STEWART: So you wanted to make a product from human hair. When you had this ah-hah moment watching the Exxon Valdez oil spill, explain how you took the mental leap from watching oil floating on the water on your TV to human hair. Mr. McCRORY: Well, it was the otter that triggered the thought. The otter, being saturated and (unintelligible). STEWART: An otter, like the little animal that floats on its back and is kind of cute? Mr. McCRORY: Right. Kind of cute. STEWART: Okay. Mr. McCRORY: But it was saturated with oil. And I was thinking, well, the otter was, you know, getting saturated with oil, then the hair that I sweep up should do the same thing. So basically, I took the hair home, put it in my wife's pantyhose, created a little imaginary spill there with - in my little pool, and cleaned the water up. Within a minute and a half, I had the water crystal clear, and all the oil was in the pantyhose loaded with hair. STEWART: How did you talk to your wife out of the pantyhose? Not in that way. Mr. McCRORY: Well\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) STEWART: Giving up her pantyhose, I should say. WOLFF: That's a little personal, don't you think? Mr. McCRORY: Yeah, well, yeah. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. McCRORY: But, no, she thought it was funny when I called her then. She was at work and I called her. I said, where is your pantyhose? I need it - what are you doing? But, no. She flipped out. STEWART: So once you figured this out, you're looking at the pantyhose with the oil absorbed into the human hair, who did you go to? Who did you, say, bring this invention to and say, hey, this can help you out? Mr. McCRORY: Well, actually, what I did and I've had patents prior to that, but - and other things. But what I did is a lot of research for four years. It was '93 before I applied for the patent\u2026 STEWART: Wow. Mr. McCRORY: \u2026because I wanted to know what was being used and how effective it was and the cost studied because the cost is a factor when you go to the market. And so I realized that hair would be, you know, very inexpensive. But, anyway, there's a lot of research done and then when I applied for the patent in '93, I received that patent in '95 on a pillow. I was a nylon mesh pillow. And 2000, February of 2000, I took hair to Auburn University and had them put in a needle-punch machine and basically productized the Hairmat. STEWART: All right. So the Hairmat, what is the Hairmat? Mr. McCRORY: The Hairmat is made up of 100 percent human hair. There's nothing there but hair. No chemicals, nothing. But what happens is you put this into a needle-punch machine, which was initially designed to make carpet and carpet padding, which they still use it for - carpet padding. And so the hair goes into the machines, goes to a hopper, it blows it up and then lays it out on a conveyor, runs it through the machine of about 6,000 needles and it just makes it into a mat. It resembles a doormat. STEWART: Now\u2026 WOLFF: Gives new meaning to the phrase, nice rug. (Soundbite of laughter. Mr. McCRORY: Right. Right. STEWART: So how did you come to realize these hairmats, which, I guess, initially, you thought about as soaking up oil, could be used for helping grow crops? Mr. McCRORY: Well, you know, I was sitting on my patio in the spring of 2000. Now, I have a mat in my hand, you know? And I thought, well, you know, I've given a lot of hair away in my salons for people for the gardens to deter rodents and deer. And some say it will make their plants grow. And I thought, well, it's protein. So let me try it. I'd had rosebush that I planted in '96, been there four years that never produced a rose. My wife bought it and told me to plant it. I did. But it never grew. It never produced a rose in four years. So I - in the spring of 2000, I dug up where the roots was exposed and put the hair there, covered it back up. And in 90 days, that rosebush grew 15 feet -this is a true story, it's bizarre but true - 15 feet and was loaded with Seven Sisters bouquets. I mean, just absolutely loaded. And all I did was put the hair there. STEWART: All right. Everybody's mouth is open in our studio. We're going to ask you to hang on, Phil, because we want to talk about the science of it why your rosebush would grow to that kind of size. Aaron Palmateer is a plant pathologist in University of Florida who studied SmartGrow. And we want to add to make sure that Aaron has no financial ties to the product. Aaron, can you explain to me what it is about hair that would make Phil's rosebush grow like that? Dr. AARON PALMATEER (Plant Pathologist, University of Florida): You know, really I wish I could give you a, you know, 100 percent, I guess, confident approach or\u2026 STEWART: Oh, give me a guesstimate. Go for it. Dr. PALMATEER: You know, really, we don't know. This is really is a preliminary area. We've done trials with containerized ornamental plants. And we are seeing increased growth and promotion with that particular treatment - with the hairmat as opposed to not having the hairmat. You know, at this time, I can only give you my opinion. I think that there's a couple of things going on. I think that, first of all, the mat does act as an outstanding mulch. It retains moisture, it deters weeds. In some instances, it can actually reduce soil erosion. And from another standpoint, I think that the mat - the hair - is actually creating a favorable environment for beneficial microorganisms. I think that there's a really good possibility that it's - that these beneficial microbes - plant-beneficial microbes - are accumulating in the areas associated with the hair. And that's where we're seeing, subsequently, growth promotion of the plant. STEWART: So, Phil, here's a question - for both Phil and for Aaron - from our control room. One of the ladies wants to know, does it matter if the hair is permed or colored? Does that affect its ability to help the plants grow? Phil, you're a guy who used to have a salon. Mr. McCRORY: Well, yeah. And this is strictly my opinion - no scientific data to back this up. STEWART: That's okay. Mr. McCRORY: I know when you perm hair or you color hair, you - I believe that you actually reduce the nutrients in the hair because it breaks down. And so\u2026 STEWART: Because you'd strip the hair, right? Mr. McCRORY: Right. Right. And so I don't think chemical-treated hair would be near as effective as what we'd call virgin hair - hair that's never been chemical-treated. It's well taken care of, which - we get the hair from the wig manufacturers out of China, and which is the best hair in the world because wigs are expensive. They want the best hair they can get. And the girls over there grow their hair to sell so they maintain that hair because the quality matters when they go to sell the hair to the wig manufacturers. STEWART: It's their product. Aaron, what do you think about that idea of permed hair or colored hair might not do as well? Dr. PALMATEER: Well, I have a tendency to agree with him. However, I -personally, I don't believe that the hair is actually a fertilizer. I think that it's creating, again, a more favorable environment for the microorganisms. Being a plant pathologist, I have a tendency to, you know, to look at the microbes and focus from that aspect. WOLFF: Any evidence that if you use blond hair, the plants have more fun? Mr. McCRORY: Well, I will say this. Blond hair is on the average of 12 percent nitrogen. Black hair is 15 to 18 percent nitrogen. WOLFF: So the plants aren't as smart. STEWART: Aaron Palmateer, plant pathologist in the University of Florida, and Phil McCrory, inventor of SmartGrow. You're good sports. Thanks for giving us all the information. Dr. PALMATEER: Thank you. Mr. McCRORY: All right. Thank you. WOLFF: Next up on the THE BRYANT PARK PROJECT, the case of a Missouri teenager who committed suicide after being rejected by a boy on MySpace. It turned out the boy was created by an adult neighbor. That case is going to a grand jury, and we have the latest twist in this tragic story. This is THE BRYANT PARK PROJECT from NPR News.  (Soundbite of song, \"Hair\")  THE COWSILLS (Singing Group): (Singing) Gimme head with hair. Long, beautiful hair. Shining, gleaming, streaming, flaxen, waxen.  Give me down to there hair. Shoulder-length or longer\u2026  ALISON STEWART, host:  Phil McCrory started cutting hair in '71. And after spending 18 years sweeping the shear and locks up the floor, he tried to figure out what he could do with all those ringlets and curls. And he came up with not one, but two great inventions. One involves environmental cleanup. The other might have helped make your salad last night.  BILL WOLFF, host:  Eew.  STEWART: That's right, using human hair on crops. Get ready to meet a guy who has about 15 tons of hair in a warehouse in Florida somewhere. Joining us on the phone right now is inventor of SmartGrow, Phil McCrory.  Hi, Phil.  Mr. PHIL McCRORY (Inventor, SmartGrow): Good morning.  STEWART: So you wanted to make a product from human hair. When you had this ah-hah moment watching the Exxon Valdez oil spill, explain how you took the mental leap from watching oil floating on the water on your TV to human hair.  Mr. McCRORY: Well, it was the otter that triggered the thought. The otter, being saturated and (unintelligible).  STEWART: An otter, like the little animal that floats on its back and is kind of cute?  Mr. McCRORY: Right. Kind of cute.  STEWART: Okay.  Mr. McCRORY: But it was saturated with oil. And I was thinking, well, the otter was, you know, getting saturated with oil, then the hair that I sweep up should do the same thing. So basically, I took the hair home, put it in my wife's pantyhose, created a little imaginary spill there with - in my little pool, and cleaned the water up. Within a minute and a half, I had the water crystal clear, and all the oil was in the pantyhose loaded with hair.  STEWART: How did you talk to your wife out of the pantyhose? Not in that way.  Mr. McCRORY: Well\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  STEWART: Giving up her pantyhose, I should say.  WOLFF: That's a little personal, don't you think?  Mr. McCRORY: Yeah, well, yeah.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. McCRORY: But, no, she thought it was funny when I called her then. She was at work and I called her. I said, where is your pantyhose? I need it - what are you doing? But, no. She flipped out.  STEWART: So once you figured this out, you're looking at the pantyhose with the oil absorbed into the human hair, who did you go to? Who did you, say, bring this invention to and say, hey, this can help you out?  Mr. McCRORY: Well, actually, what I did and I've had patents prior to that, but - and other things. But what I did is a lot of research for four years. It was '93 before I applied for the patent\u2026  STEWART: Wow.  Mr. McCRORY: \u2026because I wanted to know what was being used and how effective it was and the cost studied because the cost is a factor when you go to the market. And so I realized that hair would be, you know, very inexpensive.  But, anyway, there's a lot of research done and then when I applied for the patent in '93, I received that patent in '95 on a pillow. I was a nylon mesh pillow. And 2000, February of 2000, I took hair to Auburn University and had them put in a needle-punch machine and basically productized the Hairmat.  STEWART: All right. So the Hairmat, what is the Hairmat?  Mr. McCRORY: The Hairmat is made up of 100 percent human hair. There's nothing there but hair. No chemicals, nothing. But what happens is you put this into a needle-punch machine, which was initially designed to make carpet and carpet padding, which they still use it for - carpet padding. And so the hair goes into the machines, goes to a hopper, it blows it up and then lays it out on a conveyor, runs it through the machine of about 6,000 needles and it just makes it into a mat. It resembles a doormat.  STEWART: Now\u2026  WOLFF: Gives new meaning to the phrase, nice rug.  (Soundbite of laughter.  Mr. McCRORY: Right. Right.  STEWART: So how did you come to realize these hairmats, which, I guess, initially, you thought about as soaking up oil, could be used for helping grow crops?  Mr. McCRORY: Well, you know, I was sitting on my patio in the spring of 2000. Now, I have a mat in my hand, you know? And I thought, well, you know, I've given a lot of hair away in my salons for people for the gardens to deter rodents and deer. And some say it will make their plants grow. And I thought, well, it's protein. So let me try it. I'd had rosebush that I planted in '96, been there four years that never produced a rose. My wife bought it and told me to plant it. I did. But it never grew. It never produced a rose in four years.  So I - in the spring of 2000, I dug up where the roots was exposed and put the hair there, covered it back up. And in 90 days, that rosebush grew 15 feet -this is a true story, it's bizarre but true - 15 feet and was loaded with Seven Sisters bouquets. I mean, just absolutely loaded. And all I did was put the hair there.  STEWART: All right. Everybody's mouth is open in our studio.

I'm Andrea Seabrook. People whose hearts are failing have a couple of options. They can get a mechanical device, but artificial hearts don't last forever. They can get a heart transplant, if someone donates an organ in time. Now, someday doctors may be able to offer something else - a real heart grown in a lab. It sounds like science fiction, but one group in Minnesota has figured out a way to grow a heart and make it beat. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce has the story. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE: It's no big deal to grow heart cells in a little dish. But take a second and picture your heart beating away in your chest. It's a round meaty muscle the size of your fist with four chambers and a complicated network of blood vessels. Dr. DORIS TAYLOR (Director of the Center for Cardiovascular Repair, University of Minnesota): The heart is a beautiful, complex organ. And we realized pretty quickly that we weren't going to be able to figure out how to build that in a dish. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Doris Taylor runs a lab at the University of Minnesota. She says when nature builds a heart, the cells attach to a kind of scaffold or frame made of things like proteins. Dr. TAYLOR: It's basically what's underneath all of the cells, the tough part that the cells make to hold each other together. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Taylor and her colleagues thought, okay, what if we took a dead heart and found some way to remove all of the old cell, leaving the scaffold behind? They could then use the scaffold to construct a new heart out of young healthy cells. Harold Ott worked in Taylor's lab, and he took this on as kind of side project, something to fiddle with. He started treating rat hearts with a bunch of chemicals. Dr. HAROLD OTT (Massachusetts General Hospital): We had a big chemical shelf in the lab, from A to Z, right? So I started using all sorts of chemicals starting at A and every day perfused a rat heart with some sort of solution. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He tried enzymes - they dissolved the heart. Other chemicals made the heart swell and change shape. Then, one day, Ott grabbed a chemical known as SDS. Dr. OTT: It's a regular component of shampoo. It's a soap. GREENFIELDBOYCE: At first, it seemed like nothing was happening. Then, patches on the heart began to turn white. The red part, the meaty part, was disappearing. Dr. OTT: You can see the detergent working and making the heart literally translucent. So it turns into a jellyfish sort of appearance. Really, I mean, when you ever saw a jellyfish on the beach, that's exactly how it looks like. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Except this jellyfish was shaped just like a heart. All of the organ's 3-D structure was still there. Then Ott and his colleagues took heart cells from newborn rats and put them onto the scaffold. The cells stuck, started to grow, and the heart became red again. But it didn't beat until the researchers added a tiny pacemaker. Then the heart began to rhythmically wiggle. After several days, it kept beating even without the pacemaker. Taylor says it was an amazing thing to see. Dr. TAYLOR: Our reaction was, yes. It was the best we could possibly hope for. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The heartbeat wasn't that strong, just 2 percent of the pumping action of an adult heart. Still, Taylor thinks they can improve on this work, reported in the journal Nature Medicine. And she's started working with pig hearts, which are about the size of human ones. Dr. TAYLOR: One possibility is that we could take a pig heart scaffold and then use your cells to repopulate that. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And since cells are always slowly replacing their scaffold, eventually the heart would be entirely yours. Taylor says this approach could also work for other organs. Her group has shown that they can get a similar kind of scaffold from the liver, lungs and kidneys. William Wagner thinks the idea has potential. He's a scientist at the University of Pittsburgh who studies ways of trying to restore heart function. Dr. WILLIAM WAGNER (Scientist, University of Pittsburgh): This approach does address some of the major challenges that one faces in thinking about how to generate a functional heart that really has the structure and function of the native heart. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Still, he says, this is just a first step. There's lots of work to do before people could get organs grown in a lab. For example, you'd have to find a human cell that's very good at growing into new heart tissue. That's something that lots of scientists are looking for. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

Mr. BOB SCHAUF (Dairy Farmer): She was kind of a - one of those once in a lifetime individuals. She had tremendous worldwide demand for her genetics. COHEN: So what's your reaction now? The FDA says it's - you know, they don't see any safety hazards with drinking the milk or eating the meat of cloned cows. And up until now you had to keep Black Rose's cloned milk separate. Now you might not have to. What's your reaction? Mr. SCHAUF: You know, these animals, people have to understand the process of cloning. I mean, there's been some great documentaries done that have dug into depth and explained this. And it's really unfortunate that education wasn't made known to everyone in the media and the public. There been an over-reaction. I think there's other things worse. Hormones and milk and things are much worst than the cloning issue. I think as far as the FDA - you know, they have had stand for a while. We know the milk is safe, but it's the public's perception of milk from a clone, you know? They've been fed I don't know what. They (unintelligible) idea that this is some weird animal from outer space or something, I'm not sure. COHEN: Well, I think, you know, the line that I keep hearing is messing with Mother Nature. I think there is kind of this feeling of, you know what, that is not within our hands to be kind of playing around with nature in this way. So how do you get people to overcome that kind of icky feeling in their gut that, eh, this isn't right? Mr. SCHAUF: I understand the cloning procedure. I say that - I always say that God gave man dominion over the animals, and that's where it ends. I mean I obviously do not believe that it's meant for humans and to take it any further. But it's research, it's a viable option to keep something special in a genetic pool, to improve the Holstein breed or Jersey breed or whatever breed of cattle you're working with to enhance a product that ultimately is used for our betterment - human consumption or whatever. COHEN: Have you taken any - you know, personally - any steps to try to sell this? Have you gone to your local supermarket with freshly baked cookies and some cloned cow milk to try to help sell the product?

And you know, before these people are gone, I can't think of one of them that hasn't drank milk out of our refrigerator, that we keep the milk from the clones for our own use and our hired help and so on. They - that's the table milk we drink. I think after people are introduced to our clones, they - we talk about how all these clones is actually made. They understand the whole process. I mean, like I said, they're drinking milk and eating meat before they leave the place. I can't think of one interview or people from wherever they came from haven't tried it.

That's at npr. org/blogofthanation. So if you'd like to answer the trivia question you haven't heard yet, go to our blog at npr. org/blogofthanation. And Ken, I'm sorry. Over the past few months, we've been hearing more about a type of bacteria that's resistant to a number of antibiotics. The official name is MRSA, M-R-S-A - a highly drug-resistant staph infection that's challenged researchers for most of this decade. Now, according to a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, a new variant of the strain is resistant to even more antibiotics and it's spreading among gay and bisexual populations in San Francisco, Boston, New York and Los Angeles. There's been a lot of talk about MRSA recently, and even more questions. NPR's health editor Joe Neel joins us to talk about MRSA in general and about this new variant in particular. If you'd like to know more about what it is, how it's spread, and how you may be able to protect yourself, our number is 800-989-8255. E-mail us, talk@npr. org. You can also join the conversation on our blog. That's at npr. org/blogofthenation. And Joe Neel is NPR's health editor and he's with us here in Studio 3A. Nice to have you on the program, Joe. JOE NEEL: Nice to be here, Neal. CONAN: So what is MRSA? What are those initials stand for? NEEL: MRSA stands for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which is - which basically means it's a staph germ that is resistant to methicillin and several related antibiotics - penicillin, oxacillin, amoxicillin. It's been out there for at least seven years, maybe 10 years, mainly in hospitals. And we've started hearing about it more now because it's starting to spread out of hospitals into the community. CONAN: And two different variants there as well. NEEL: Well, several different variants. The one that we heard about this week was a new variant in gay men that seems to be circulating in several cities. This variant is resistant to even more antibiotics. Not just the three or four that I just mentioned, but also to Bactrim - a very commonly-used antibiotic and possibly vancomycin and - I'm forgetting the other one. I'll think of it in a second. But they're - clindamycin. And these are the drugs that are typically used to treat MRSA. So there's some concern that we're starting to lose treatment options for people who get MRSA. CONAN: Does that leave anything left for people with this variant of MRSA? NEEL: Yeah. There are several. I mean, the vancomycin-resistant - vancomycin is the antibiotic of last resort. Generally thought of, but there are a couple like that. That resistance hasn't been seen a whole lot. So that drug is still available. There are still several that are out there. But as you keep crossing drugs off the list, you know, there's concerned that there's not going to be anything left. CONAN: And as we hear about this most recent variant that's been identified active among gay populations in large cities, and everybody looks at that and says, hmm, AIDS. NEEL: Well, yeah. I mean, that's obviously the parallel that you would draw. But there are a lot of distinctions here that we should talk about. First of all, if MRSA is caught early, it's completely curable with one of the antibiotics. If you don't get it quite so early, you'll still probably get cured from it. Right now, MRSA, in the general population, is killing about 19,000 people a year. The headline we saw back in October was MRSA kills more than people - than AIDS does. AIDS killed about 17,000 a year. But we know a lot more about how to control MRSA. We know a lot more about how to treat it. We have more drugs that are totally effective. In AIDS, the drugs can keep people alive for many years, but they are never cured. CONAN: And how is it contracted? NEEL: Well, it's - the study that came out this week had a lot of limitations. It didn't definitely show that sexual contact was the cause of these - the rise of these infections in gay men in these cities. But there were a lot of - there's a lot of circumstantial evidence. And it - we know that MRSA spread normally just through skin-to-skin contact, very casual skin-to-skin contact. So one would imagine that in any kind of sexual circumstance, where people are touching each other, whether it's sexual or not, that the infection might spread. CONAN: We're talking with NPR's health editor, Joe Neel. Again, if you'd like to join our conversation about MRSA, 800-989-8255. E-mail, talk@npr. org. Eli(ph) joins us from Midland, Texas. ELI (Caller): Hi. How are you doing, sir? CONAN: Very well. Thank you. ELI: Good. And now, my question is this, now people with HIV, their immune system is compromised, meaning that they're more susceptible to MRSA, right? NEEL: That's correct. ELI: Okay. So now - so you have HIV and then because their immune system is compromised that MRSA has the ability to take hold in the person with HIV more - it's more likely that the MRSA will take hold in the person with HIV than a non-HIV person, right? NEEL: Well, it depends on the person with HIV's immune status. If they're taking protease inhibitors and they're on their drugs and their immune system is fairly healthy, they're not going to be terribly susceptible to MRSA. We see MRSA infections when the immune system is pretty depleted, either in people with HIV or some other diseases. In the elderly, the elderly are more susceptible, and young children are susceptible because their immune systems aren't developed. But you're right, that if someone has HIV and they get a skin infection - if they see a pimple or a boil - and it doesn't go away, it gets redder, it gets - it grows very quickly, they should take some action and go see a doctor right away. CONAN: Is it possible - I think this may be, to some degree, be tying to Eli's phone question, is it possible that it's spreading in gay and bisexual communities in large cities in part because that's where a lot of people with HIV are? NEEL: Well, you could say that, but it hasn't been studied scientifically. We don't know that. CONAN: So that would be just supposition at this point. NEEL: Supposition. CONAN: Okay. ELI: Okay. CONAN: Eli, thanks\u2026 ELI: Thanks very much. CONAN: Thanks very much for the phone call. Is there anything you can do to prevent MRSA in any of its variants? ELI: Hand-washing, good hygiene. You should wash your hands for at least 15 seconds every time you are near - every time you come in contact with something that might possible have the germs on it. Fifteen seconds - a good thing to remember is you could sing \"Happy Birthday\" twice in that period of time. That is basically the main prevention method. Some - you know, in certain environments like health clubs or in schools where there are people who've known - where people have had MRSA who've come in - you know, have been in contact with various surfaces, probably want to clean those surfaces and maybe do that more regularly. You might want to use hand sanitizer more often. Make sure that the hand sanitizers got at least 60 percent alcohol in it. So\u2026 CONAN: Let's see if we can get another caller on the line. And this Sally([ph). Sally with us from Surfside in South Carolina. SALLY (Caller): Hi. CONAN: Hi, Sally. You're on the air. Go ahead, please. SALLY: Thank you for taking this question. I'm wondering if the MRSA virus - MRSA could be evolving into other forms of disease or unidentifiable because I happen to know two people right now who are trying to get help that have their thing, it's a staph infection, they're not really able to identify it, but it's really - it's almost like plague-like. And interestingly, when they're trying to get help, their - the hospitals seem to be turning them away because it's not an easy fix and they really don't want to be associated with having that kind of disease around them. NEEL: Well, MRSA is difficult to - can be difficult if diagnose. It - I know of two cases in the last year where it took between two and four days for the cultures to come back. And so hospitals are often scratching their heads about what could this be. Is it garden variety staph or is it the more resistant MRSA. The - but there are newer tests, rapid tests that can - that are - can make the diagnosis in just a few hours, which I think will be, you know, very helpful in detecting this much more often. As far as evolving into another disease, you know, staph is a - it's pretty easy to figure out what it is, when you can find it, when you can grow it. I don't think it would - it's not mutating into some new life form, it just  - what's happening here is it's evolving into more\u2026 CONAN: Drug-resistant. NEEL: \u2026more drug-resistant form that has more defenses. CONAN: Hmm. Thanks very much for the call, Sally. SALLY: Thank you for taking my call. CONAN: And we hope your friends - hope things work out for them, SALLY: All right. Bye-bye. CONAN: Thanks very much. We call - you know, the common name is flesh-eating bacteria. You said a pimple, something like that, does that what it looks like when you first get it? NEEL: Well, it's interesting. People start calling it flesh-eating bacteria, that a few years - maybe more than a decade ago, when Jim Henson, the Muppets creator died, that was actually strep, which is a different bacteria. But this form of staph is actually starting to look like the flesh-eating bacteria. It gets deep into the skin. It causes the skin to deteriorate, and it can go into bones, it gets into the bloodstream, can - in the worst cases, it causes pneumonia, blood infections. And as I think I said before, 19,000 people die each year from this. So it's a rather serious disease. CONAN: Here's an e-mail question from Lucia(ph). Please, if you can tell me, why the pharmaceutical companies have not been creating new and more powerful antibiotics. Heard they haven't been concentrating on antibiotics lately. NEEL: Well, I looked this up the other day, and there are something like 240 -I don't - I wouldn't want to be quoted as to the exact number. But there are more than 200 compounds under development by the drug companies. There was a period of time when there wasn't much emphasis put on antibiotics. I think that began to change several years ago. And that now, there is a lot more focus. But clinical trials to get drugs to people do take many years - you know, five, seven, 10 years. So what started a few years back, we won't really see on pharmacy shelves for a while. At the same time, you know, it's - there are drugs that make more money than antibiotics, so, you know, it is a fear question to ask, you know, where the priorities are. CONAN: Joe Neel is NPR's health editor, with us here in Studio 3A. We're talking about MRSA in its variant, including one reported this past week, highly drug-resistant and appears to be attacking gay and bisexual communities in large American cities. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And let's get Carrie(ph) on the line. Carrie with us from Ypsilanti in Michigan. CARRIE (Caller): Hello. How are you? How are you, Neal? CONAN: Very well. Thanks. CARRIE: I work at an AIDS service organization here in Michigan. And it's eerie how you keep referring to this MDR MRSA as a gay community disease or man who are bisexual disease. It's really the behavior that transmits the bacteria and not the identity of the individual. We really need to focus on trying to make sure that people don't stigmatize the community even further. Remember the AIDS epidemic? CONAN: Joe? NEEL: Yes. No, I absolutely agree with you. This study - we were concerned when we first saw this study for the exact same reason. CARRIE: Well, I think our language should positively reflect that by making sure that every time we mention communities that it affects, that we talk about the men who had sex with men, or MSM community, as opposed to the gay community. Because gay is a really stigmatized and polarizing word here in this country and we really need to be respectful of the community. NEEL: Okay. You're right, it has men who have sex with men, which include gay and bisexual men. But I'm very aware and share your concern about stigmatizing a group. I mean, this is a disease that does not have a preference for any particular group. The study showed that - you know, the - what the study found was that in the genital and buttocks area of gay men attending sexually transmitted disease clinics in Boston and San Francisco that they had a higher rate of infection in that area. So the conclusion was gay partnering, you know, male partnering was, to some extent, a cause for concern. That, you know, these infections do occur in that area in heterosexuals as well. I mean, it's the number of people - the percentage of men who have sex with men, who were having infections in that particular area of the body, versus heterosexuals was about double. So, you're concern is well taken. CONAN: Thanks very much. CARRIE: Well, thank you very much and let's really try to use the MSM terminology. CONAN: Thanks, Carrie. CARRIE: Thank you. CONAN: Let's talk now with Ben(ph). And Ben's calling us from Baltimore. BEN (Caller): Hello. How are you doing, Neal? CONAN: Fine, thanks. BEN: Thank you so much for taking our call. Basically, just a couple of comments. I'm actually an emergency medicine resident at a busy urban ER and we've been dealing with MRSA for quite a few years. So, just to have some reassuring comments. Number one, first of all, I think there was an increasing awareness among emergency medicine professionals and doctors in general as MRSA makes more of a headline that we tend to treat a lot more aggressively than we did before. And so, people that present to the emergency departments are much more likely to get the required treatment of MRSA. In other words, we tend to treat for it even before its tested for. So, the awareness is definitely spreading amongst the medical community. And the other thing is that I can't echo enough the importance of really good hygiene. So when people get something that they think is a pimple that doesn't go away, its generally not a good idea to poke and to try drain it yourself, but to certainly follow up with a doctor, because sometimes, what we found with MRSA as opposed to other regular bacteria, is that they may require some systemic antibiotics instead of just, you know, a simple drainage procedure. NEEL: Systemic, meaning, intravenous antibiotics. BEN: Meaning like you administer - yeah, by mouth. NEEL: I see. Right. CONAN: Okay. And as it presents, is it - are you having great success with these procedures? BEN: Well, I think so. The one thing is - as difficult as everyone has said, we don't always know based upon appearance what MRSA is and what MRSA is not. So, the conservative thing to do is you tend to treat for it. But the good news is if MRSA tends to form what's called abscesses, as you mentioned earlier, it can go into the deep tissues. And healthy individuals, as long as that abscess is drained, we do have good results in having that infection recur. But if does not drain and you see an abscess or temple that tends to get worse over time, especially coupled with fever and chills, that's something that needs to be followed up on, because that could indicate, as you were speaking about earlier, a more serious underlying infection. CONAN: Ben, thanks for that. Appreciate it. NEEL: Right, I think\u2026 BEN: So long. Thank you so much. CONAN: So long. NEEL: Sorry. Yeah, it's the rapidity of the - how fast it starts to spread and especially fevers and chills, he's correct. It's not just an everyday-pimple pimple. I mean, they are red bumps on the skin people have all the time. So now, you don't need to go into a panic over it. It's the rapid progression that is certainly the concern. CONAN: And quickly, a last e-mail question from T. Silva(ph). Can you MRSA from sweaty gym equipment? Should gyms be on high alert? NEEL: Well, this has been a controversy. The CDC, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recommend that you wipe down equipment after each use and perhaps, you want to use a barrier like a towel to sit on equipment. Although, it also - there is no evidence that its spreading this way in any large degree. So, the answer to your question is, the CDC says, yes, take precautions, but I don't know that there's cause for great concern. CONAN: Joe Neel, thanks very much. NEEL: Thank you.

So when people get something that they think is a pimple that doesn't go away, its generally not a good idea to poke and to try drain it yourself, but to certainly follow up with a doctor, because sometimes, what we found with MRSA as opposed to other regular bacteria, is that they may require some systemic antibiotics instead of just, you know, a simple drainage procedure.  NEEL: Systemic, meaning, intravenous antibiotics.  BEN: Meaning like you administer - yeah, by mouth.  NEEL: I see. Right.  CONAN: Okay. And as it presents, is it - are you having great success with these procedures?  BEN: Well, I think so. The one thing is - as difficult as everyone has said, we don't always know based upon appearance what MRSA is and what MRSA is not. So, the conservative thing to do is you tend to treat for it. But the good news is if MRSA tends to form what's called abscesses, as you mentioned earlier, it can go into the deep tissues. And healthy individuals, as long as that abscess is drained, we do have good results in having that infection recur. But if does not drain and you see an abscess or temple that tends to get worse over time, especially coupled with fever and chills, that's something that needs to be followed up on, because that could indicate, as you were speaking about earlier, a more serious underlying infection.  CONAN: Ben, thanks for that. Appreciate it.  NEEL: Right, I think\u2026  BEN: So long. Thank you so much.  CONAN: So long.  NEEL: Sorry. Yeah, it's the rapidity of the - how fast it starts to spread and especially fevers and chills, he's correct. It's not just an everyday-pimple pimple. I mean, they are red bumps on the skin people have all the time. So now, you don't need to go into a panic over it. It's the rapid progression that is certainly the concern.  CONAN: And quickly, a last e-mail question from T. Silva(ph). Can you MRSA from sweaty gym equipment? Should gyms be on high alert?  NEEL: Well, this has been a controversy. The CDC, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recommend that you wipe down equipment after each use and perhaps, you want to use a barrier like a towel to sit on equipment. Although, it also - there is no evidence that its spreading this way in any large degree. So, the answer to your question is, the CDC says, yes, take precautions, but I don't know that there's cause for great concern.  CONAN: Joe Neel, thanks very much.  NEEL: Thank you.  CONAN: NPR's health editor Joe Neel joined us here in Studio 3A. You could find a Q&A about Staph infections and advice on how to prevent them at npr. org/talk.

The U. S. Food and Drug Administration announced yesterday that meat and milk from cloned cattle, pigs, goats and their offspring are as safe to eat as food from animals bred the old-fashion way. And that's clearing the way for the products to hit supermarket shelves in the coming years. The decision comes after six years of research, and more than 700 studies looking at whether milk, organ or muscle tissue from cloned animals is harmful to ingest. Cloning for consumption has been a controversial topic. Scientists, farmers, food producers, consumers, animal rights groups, even the U. S. Senate have weighed in on this. And now that these cloned pigs and cows and goats will be headed to market, we're going to look at what's made this such a hotly debated issue, and the reaction to the FDA's decision. Rick Weiss is a reporter for The Washington Post. He's been following this story. Hi, Rick. Mr. RICK WEISS (Reporter, The Washington Post): Hi. How are you doing? MARTIN: I'm doing okay. Thanks for joining us this morning. I have an initial question. Rick, have you ever eaten cloned meat or ingested cloned milk? Mr. WEISS: Well, not to my knowledge\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. WEISS: \u2026although one of the things I found out yesterday is that a lot of us have probably been already eating meat from the offspring of clones, because they've been sort of leaking onto the market quietly over the last few years, despite FDA's request that they'd be kept off. MARTIN: Really? Mr. WEISS: But the clone themselves, I think, we're still waiting for those. ALISON STEWART, host: It's interesting, Rachel, though, that just in talking about it, the language used - ingested milk. Most people drink milk. MARTIN: Yeah. (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: You're right. You're right. STEWART: But I think the way you posed your question\u2026 MARTIN: You're right. STEWART: \u2026really speaks to one of the issues that people have. MARTIN: It feels - well, we'll just get right through it, Rick. What are some of the - I'll reveal my own biases, which are - clearly already been revealed. What - in your reporting, when you talk to people, consumers, about what they fear most about this or - see? My question revealed my bias again. (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: What's their reaction? What's their reaction to this issue? Mr. WEISS: Well, first of all, yeah, you're in the majority. The surveys in this country showed that, you know, maybe 15, 20 percent of the people in this country say they have a, quote, unquote, \"favorable impression\" of eating food from clones. It just seems to be one of those visceral - can I use the word? MARTIN: Sure. Mr. WEISS: Reactions that people have. And there's a couple of issues. One is that there's just something a little bit weird about thinking that an animal has been mass-produced in a way maybe, you know, pills are mass-produced and packaged in blister packs for human consumption. Food is a very emotional issue. We like to think it's unique and special. But there are also real sort of safety and animal welfare concerns, because the fact is that cloning is still an inefficient scientific process. A lot of clones that are grown don't make it even to birth, and a lot of the others die right after birth. And so there are animal welfare issues that people have raised with the government agencies, saying, you know, we shouldn't really turn this into a food production system till more of these animals can survive and have a happy life. And all that, of course, is separate from the issue of whether it's safe to eat it, which at least, scientifically, that's the one issue that really has been resolved now with the FDA's report yesterday saying every way they've looked at it - upside down, side ways, every kind of test they run - the stuff seems just identical to the food we're already eating. MARTIN: But Congress has weighed in on this, saying the opposite, right? Didn't they pass some legislation - not passed, but it had been to the table. They were trying to get the FDA to hold off on this approval, saying more testing needed to be done. Mr. WEISS: That's right. Although it's not necessarily safety that - safety is a concern that's raised. I think when you really look at what's behind Congress' moves, as it is often the case, are economic concerns. And that's something that the government has really acknowledged at this point. It was interesting yesterday, even as the FDA said we finished our six years of study, this stuff is safe, the USDA - the Agricultural Department - stepped right up to the stage with them and said, yes, but we'd really rather that none of these farmers send these animals to market yet, because we have a real economic concern here that as long as people don't want this food - and especially our international trading partners don't want it - it's only going to hurt our products on the market if people think there's cloned stuff in there. And why don't we wait a while so we can hammer out some deals and make sure everyone else is comfortable with it? MARTIN: So can I ask but it may come off as a very basic question, but is there a grand cattle shortage that I don't know about? (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: I mean, why are we cloning cows? Mr. WEISS: Right. No. There is no shortage of cattle, and there is certainly no shortage of milk in this country. There's great surpluses of it. But what there is a shortage of, in the opinion of the food - some parts of the food industry, is a real predictable consistency. You know, everyone knows what it's like to go buy an expensive steak and mm, you know what? This is a little tough. And what the meat producers are saying is wouldn't it be great to live in a world where every time you had a steak, it was just right and perfect? And the way to do that is to get your absolutely best double-muscled, perfectly marbled, you know, livestock out there and then clone them. Make thousands of them, maybe millions of them. MARTIN: This is a very brave new world. STEWART: But, you know, it's funny, that I think there's the old saying, you are what you eat. So when people think about eating cloned food, you sort of wonder, well, in 30 years, if I'm all of a sudden, you know, going to develop another - a cloned arm coming out of me because I ate cloned meat. Mr. WEISS: Well, you know, it's funny you bring that up, because although I'm not sure it would really turn you into a clone to eat this stuff, one of the other arguments that I am hearing from opponents is that the more animal cloning we do and the better the technology gets there, the easier it's going to be for scientists to clone people, which is something a lot of people don't think is a good idea, either. So maybe this is a technology we should just leave a little bit on the sidelines for a while. STEWART: What does this mean for ranchers and dairy farmers, now? Mr. WEISS: Well, for the three or four companies in this country that have been waiting to get into the cloning business that have made a few hundred of these animals now and have been waiting for the green light from the FDA, it's good news because they can start really ramping up production. And what they're going to do is not put the clones themselves on the market right now. They're just too valuable and too expensive. But they will be used as breeding stock, and their semen will be used for artificial insemination, and they'll be used for breeding offspring of clones. And those offspring will be presumably a little bit higher quality than the average cow or pig because they're - one of their parents will have been a perfect clone. And those are the kinds of things that you'll start seeing on the market in a few years, because it takes time for these animals to all grow up. But we're talking about meat from the offspring of clones and milk from dairy cows that are themselves the offspring of great dairy cow clones. MARTIN: Okay. Thank you, Rick Weiss\u2026 Mr. WEISS: Enjoy. MARTIN: \u2026reporter for The Washington Post. Cloned meat, coming to a grocery store near you. It'll be a few years I guess, though.

Christine Pulliam, you have seen a superior mirage phenomenon? Ms. CHRISTINE PULLIAM (Public Affairs Specialist, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics): Actually, everybody has. Anyone who has seen a sunrise or a sunset. The same phenomenon occurs to the sun every day and makes it appear to be above the horizon when it's actually slightly below it. SIEGEL: Well, the folks in Stephenville, Texas, whom Wade Goodwyn spoke with, described seeing a very large red light up in the sky 3,000 feet up, then lights like strobe lights.

Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion. According to a study released today by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, the number of abortions in 2005 fell to near 30-year lows. NPR health policy correspondent Julie Rovner is here to talk about the new study. And, Julie, what do the numbers show? JULIE ROVNER: Well, the numbers show that, pretty much, abortions went down by every conceivable measure. The actual number of abortions - 1. 2 million in 2005 was the lowest number since 1976. The abortion rate - that's the percentage of the female population between age 15 and 44 that had an abortion that year -was 1. 94 percent; that was the lowest since 1974. And the abortion ratio, which is the percent of pregnancies that end in abortion, was just over one in five; that was also the lowest since 1974. BLOCK: Now, were these numbers that came out a surprise? ROVNER: Well, yes and no. All of these numbers have been declining for several years. They peaked in 1990, so it's really just the continuation of a trend. But this is the first time that the numbers have dropped all the way back to the levels that we saw just after Roe was decided. BLOCK: Julie, what was the methodology for the study? This is done by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, and again, this was back in 2005 - these numbers. ROVNER: Yes, although they've been working on the same for the last two and a half years. The Guttmacher Institute has been doing this study really pretty much since Roe was decided. This is the 14th study that they've done. It's considered, really, the gold standard by those on both sides, even though Guttmacher is considered more of a reproductive right - a pro-choice-leaning organization, everybody trusts these numbers. They're actually better numbers than the government is able to get because several states, most notably California, doesn't collect abortion statistics. They actually send out surveys to every known abortion provider and work pretty hard to get some of those surveys back. I think that's part of what takes so long to get these numbers out. BLOCK: Is there an indication within these numbers, Julie, of why the number of abortions is going down? ROVNER: Well, it really is just a survey, so you can't tell that much from the numbers. You can tell who's doing abortions and how many abortions that they're doing, but that doesn't stop people on both sides of the debate from speculating. It could be fewer unintended pregnancies from better use of contraception, or less unprotected sex. It could be the state law restrictions that make it more difficult for women to get abortions. It could also be that women are caring more unintended pregnancies to term because they don't have access to abortion 'cause there are fewer providers. BLOCK: Julie, the survey also tells us - what percentage of abortions are carried out using the abortion pill. ROVNER: Yes, it found that 13 percent of abortions are now being conducted, not surgically, but medically, using the abortion pill - mostly the abortion pill RU486, which was approved in the year 2000. There's - I guess there's some mixed news on this score for people who had hoped that this would really expand access for women who live in areas where there is no surgical abortion provider. The survey found that 87 percent of counties in the U. S. , where more than a third of women live, do not have a surgical abortion provider. But what the survey found was that even though there is now a significant percentage of abortions being provided via the abortion pill, mostly that's going on in urban areas where there is also access to a surgical abortion provider. So it seems to be expanding the options for women, but not necessarily expanding the access to abortion. BLOCK: NPR's Julie Rovner, thanks so much. ROVNER: You're welcome.

The abortion rate - that's the percentage of the female population between age 15 and 44 that had an abortion that year -was 1. 94 percent; that was the lowest since 1974. And the abortion ratio, which is the percent of pregnancies that end in abortion, was just over one in five; that was also the lowest since 1974.  BLOCK: Now, were these numbers that came out a surprise?  ROVNER: Well, yes and no. All of these numbers have been declining for several years. They peaked in 1990, so it's really just the continuation of a trend. But this is the first time that the numbers have dropped all the way back to the levels that we saw just after Roe was decided.  BLOCK: Julie, what was the methodology for the study? This is done by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, and again, this was back in 2005 - these numbers.  ROVNER: Yes, although they've been working on the same for the last two and a half years. The Guttmacher Institute has been doing this study really pretty much since Roe was decided. This is the 14th study that they've done. It's considered, really, the gold standard by those on both sides, even though Guttmacher is considered more of a reproductive right - a pro-choice-leaning organization, everybody trusts these numbers.  They're actually better numbers than the government is able to get because several states, most notably California, doesn't collect abortion statistics. They actually send out surveys to every known abortion provider and work pretty hard to get some of those surveys back. I think that's part of what takes so long to get these numbers out.  BLOCK: Is there an indication within these numbers, Julie, of why the number of abortions is going down?  ROVNER: Well, it really is just a survey, so you can't tell that much from the numbers. You can tell who's doing abortions and how many abortions that they're doing, but that doesn't stop people on both sides of the debate from speculating. It could be fewer unintended pregnancies from better use of contraception, or less unprotected sex. It could be the state law restrictions that make it more difficult for women to get abortions. It could also be that women are caring more unintended pregnancies to term because they don't have access to abortion 'cause there are fewer providers.  BLOCK: Julie, the survey also tells us - what percentage of abortions are carried out using the abortion pill.  ROVNER: Yes, it found that 13 percent of abortions are now being conducted, not surgically, but medically, using the abortion pill - mostly the abortion pill RU486, which was approved in the year 2000. There's - I guess there's some mixed news on this score for people who had hoped that this would really expand access for women who live in areas where there is no surgical abortion provider. The survey found that 87 percent of counties in the U. S. , where more than a third of women live, do not have a surgical abortion provider.  But what the survey found was that even though there is now a significant percentage of abortions being provided via the abortion pill, mostly that's going on in urban areas where there is also access to a surgical abortion provider. So it seems to be expanding the options for women, but not necessarily expanding the access to abortion.  BLOCK: NPR's Julie Rovner, thanks so much.  ROVNER: You're welcome.

Dr. Barb Glenn is managing director of Animal Biotechnology at the Biotechnology Industry Organization. And Dr. Michael K. Hansen is a senior scientist with the Consumers Union. He works on biotech and other food safety issues. Welcome to you, both. Dr. BARB GLENN (Managing Director of Animal Biotechnology, Biotechnology Industry Organization): Thank you. Dr. MICHAEL HANSEN (Senior Scientist, Consumers Union): Glad to be here. Dr. GLENN: Yeah. Glad to be here as well. CHIDEYA: So, Barb\u2026 Dr. HANSEN: And hi, Barb. Dr. GLENN: Hi. How are you? CHIDEYA: You guys know each other? Do you guys arm wrestle sometimes? Dr. HANSEN: Yes. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. GLENN: Of course. Dr. HANSEN: Of course. CHIDEYA: Let me start with you, Barb. Cloning is something that a lot of people don't really know much about. Do you agree with the FDA's findings? And the research only involved two companies, so is that enough? Dr. GLENN: Well, Bio applauds the comprehensive science-based review that was done by the Food and Drug Administration. And indeed, they did confirm the safety of this technology for both the animals as well as for the foods we eat. They actually stated that the foods from livestock clones and their offspring are safe to eat as any other food. So, yes, we are behind this 110 percent. This is indeed the most comprehensive global scientific review of this technology. CHIDEYA: Michael, when some people think clones, they're thinking invasion of the body snatchers. And we've got a lot of traffic on our blog that really reflects the legitimate and well thought out questions of people about this. So is this panic or is this common sense that leads people to question this? And how do you feel about it? Dr. HANSEN: Well, I think it is common sense. All the surveys show that people are very concerned. We at Consumers Union actually did a large nationwide survey in June of this year and 69 percent of the people were concerned about consuming meat or milk from clones or their offspring, and 89 percent wanted it labeled. And I would say we also disagree with the science. They looked at too few animals for certain things, for example. They said that pig - meat from pigs are safe to eat from cloned pigs, and they looked at four pigs. I would also point out that Health Canada has actually had scientific concerns on this as well, and has told the Food and Drug Administration that they would consider this to be novel foods that would require rigorous safety testing and that the data are not there yet to show that they're safe. CHIDEYA: Now, Michael, is there a question about economics? We, for example, have talked to people about the marketing of fast food. And one of the arguments there is that, okay, people who are in tough economic shape living in neighborhoods that are in tough economic shape don't have as many choices. There's not grocery stores. Could there be a situation in the future where in the grocery stores, people have a choice if they go to whole foods, but not so much in other venues? Dr. HANSEN: If there's no labeling, that could be true. But I think the big potential - big economic impact of clones is that if they're not labeled, people could either stay away from these foods and there's the international issue. If we don't do something soon, for example, there'll probably be a number of countries that have not made the decision and so will not allow meat or milk from cloned animals into their markets. And unless we segregate that stuff, they could block exports from the U. S. That's why there's a real concern, and that's why there was a meeting in the White House last week with the U. S. Trade Representative and the FDA that were raising these international trade issues because we are very concerned about them. CHIDEYA: Barb\u2026 Dr. GLENN: Could I just follow on to that? CHIDEYA: Yeah. Dr. GLENN: Yeah. CHIDEYA: I'd like you to. And raise the issue of the E. U. stance as you do. Dr. GLENN: Yeah. Let's talk a little bit about - again about the science. As I've mentioned, it is indeed a safe technology. Now, this has been reaffirmed recently by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration, but also, last week, the European Food Safety Agency put out their dressed opinion that the foods are safe. This also aligns with risk assessments that have already been done by several countries in the world including New Zealand, France and Australia indicating that the technology is safe, the foods are safe. And indeed, I think most recognize that there really isn't a science question anymore. And in addition, let me add, with regard to consumer choice, I think consumer choice is extremely important. In December, the two major cloning companies in the United States announced the new program that will allow us to basically track clones in the marketplace. And for food retailers then, because their costumers, consumers might want to know where - whether there's clones in the food supply, we can actually track those animals. We can actually honestly supply a no-clone food supply line. So taken together, Michael, when you take the scientific assessment is clear, and we have an offering of choice using this process-based program, we've really got all - everything covered. We've got everything for you and I, for global trade and it's all available from this new breeding method. CHIDEYA: Michael, let me ask you once specific scientific question. As we spoke to our reporter, he mentioned that the government has looked at whether or not some of the anomalies in cloned animals is important - decided no, it's not. But Dolly, who was the cloned sheep, did show signs of premature aging before she died. Are you concerned that there are genetic anomalies, first of all, and secondly, that they would affect the meat? Dr. HANSEN: Absolutely. We do feel that. And part of the reason that the FDA said this is safe is they're playing a little verbal game because they admit that many of the animals that are - the clones that are born - many of them are sickly and have all sorts of health problems. What they argue with that is they said, oh, but those animals won't make it into the food supply because they'll be caught by inspection, and I don't really think that that's true. So in their analysis, they actually excluded animals that they considered sick because they just arbitrarily said those won't go into the food supply. So yes, there's\u2026 CHIDEYA: Barb\u2026 Dr. GLENN: Yes. CHIDEYA: Let me get Barb in very quickly. Dr. GLENN: Yeah, let's holler back on - first of all, it's a myth that Dolly died a premature death - that she aged quickly. That was never proven scientifically. So I wanted everyone to know that she lived a normal youth life and she was indeed euthanized, but she had a very bad viral condition. CHIDEYA: Barb, we need you to respond quickly on the larger question. Dr. GLENN: Okay. The FDA said animal health is not an issue, that there are no unique risks as compared to other animal breeding techniques. And so, these foods are safe based on the weight of the scientific evidence. And I trust my U. S. FDA. CHIDEYA: All right. I know that you, guys are going to continue to talk about these amongst yourselves. Thank you for sharing with us. Dr. GLENN: You're very welcome. Dr. HANSEN: Thank you. Dr. GLENN: Take care.

I'm Farai Chideya. How would you feel about eating a hamburger if you knew that the meat came from a cloned animal? Earlier this week, the Food and Drug Administration brought that day a little closer. It said that meat or milk from cloned animals is just as safe as what's on the shelf today. We've got NPR science correspondent Dan Charles with more. Hi. DAN CHARLES: Hi. Nice to be here. CHIDEYA: So the FDA said it had studies clones, decided that food from them was no different than what we get from other animals. Is there a consensus on that? CHARLES: Well, there is the narrow question of the food safety and then there's the broader question about how people feel about cloning and feel about eating food from clones or the offspring of clones. You know, there is no - you have to put it sort of the other way around. There's no strong evidence - there is no convincing evidence that there is any health issue with food from clones. Now, the clones themselves - you know, it's clear from - that the cloned animals, the ones that survive - and a lot don't survive - they are different in various ways. There has been some sort of messing around with their genetic machinery. But by the time they're adults, if they survived through that point, that all seems to have been sort of sorted out. And when it gets passed on to the next generation - according to the FDA, all of that sort of unexpected - all these unexpected phenomena that you see sometimes in cloned animals disappears and goes away. So, you know, it seemed - not too many people actually disagree really strongly with the conclusion that's just on the food safety. CHIDEYA: Now, the FDA asked the livestock industry to continue a voluntary moratorium on putting some of these meats and milks on the shelf. Why was that? CHARLES: Well, that's the interesting thing. The FDA says that it can only make decisions based on the data, on the science. And so that's why they say they have no authority to ask for or compel labeling of food from clones because they say the, you know, the food is identical. But at the same time, they made this recommendation that the livestock industry hold off on putting the actual food from the clones themselves, not the offspring, but just the clones, putting it on the market. That's basically because they worry about market reaction. A lot of people feel kind of queasy about it. And they worry about the reaction from foreign trade partners. CHIDEYA: Well, you mentioned an interesting thing. There's the clones and then there is the offspring of the clones. Are people actually going to be eating food soon from the offspring of clones? CHARLES: You know, it's pretty funny, some people already are. I talked to a farmer in Wisconsin who's had a cloned cow for many years now, and that clone has had calves, and the calves have been sold, and I'm sure those calves are producing milk somewhere and no one's really tracking them. So in very small numbers, they are already. Now, into - to build up to larger numbers to really be a significant part of the food supply, that would take some years. And it's not clear it's even going to happen because a lot of people in the food industry, you know, would rather not rock the boat too much. They do worry about consumer reaction. CHIDEYA: Well, Dan, thanks for the information. CHARLES: Thank you. CHIDEYA: Dan Charles is NPR science correspondent. He joined us from NPR studios in Washington, D. C.

We have a guest scheduled. His name is Jordan Wright. He's going to come by, show us presidential campaign memorabilia. You can't really convey some of this stuff over the phone. There's a bit of a problem getting him into the studios, some car trouble. We're going to put him off. He'll come in at a later date. So, what do we do now? That's right. We break out the Emergency Krulwich. (Soundbite of siren) PESCA: Apparently, the Emergency Krulwich is located on a Parisian street. How does that work? Anyway, when a guest falls out, we break out a radio gem from Robert Krulwich, sort of a disincentive to make every guest show up on time, given that Mr. Krulwich is what is known in the business as a genius. Today, take yourself back to your very first memory. Most people can remember things that happen when they were maybe three or four. But earlier than that, this next story asks, how far back can you go? ROBERT KRULWICH: This is the story of a woman - an older woman in her 80s who goes to sleep one night in her room in an old people's home in the Bronx in New York. And according to Dr. Oliver Sacks, the writer and neurologist\u2026 Dr. OLIVER SACKS (Writer, Neurologist): She has a dream. KRULWICH: In her dream, she hears a female voice singing, humming a song. (Soundbite of music) KRULWICH: It sounds like an Irish ballad. And as she told Dr. Sacks when he wrote about her years ago - he's updated her story in his new book \"Musicophilia\" - the first song she heard was followed by a second song. (Soundbite of music) KRULWICH: It was also Irish-sounding. And that one was followed by a third song. (Soundbite of music) KRULWICH: And then she wakes up. But even awake, her head is still filled with sound - those same songs keep going\u2026 (Soundbite of music) KRULWICH: \u2026and going and going - and not only that\u2026 Dr. OLIVER SACKS (Neurology, Oxford University): They are very loud, so loud that she's puzzled. KRULWICH: At first, this woman - and Dr. Sacks calls her Mrs. O. C. - at first, he thought, well, these voices have got to be coming from a radio somewhere. Dr. SACKS: Absolutely. I mean, she wandered around a bit and sort of looked for a radio, but there wasn't a radio on. Everyone else was asleep. KRULWICH: Strange. Now, if I were an 88-year-old woman in an old people's home in the middle of the night hearing music everywhere which no one else hears, that would frighten me. Dr. SACKS: Well, it's frightened her. KRULWICH: She must have thought, I guess I'm going crazy. Dr. SACKS: You know, hearing things? KRULWICH: Yeah. But later that morning, when she saw the house doctor\u2026 Dr. SACKS: He said, no, Mrs. O. C. You're not mad, and the mad don't hear music. They only hear voices. You must see a neurologist. KRULWICH: Who happens to be you? Dr. SACKS: Right. (Soundbite of music) KRULWICH: When they first met, Dr. Sacks had to yell over the noise inside Mrs. O. C. 's head. She could barely hear him. Dr. SACKS: She was now thoroughly rattled, and the music continued deafening. KRULWICH: So, Dr. Sacks asked her, could you hum these songs? Could you describe them? And she said, yup. They're Irish. They're sung by a female. and somehow, they're vaguely familiar. Dr. SACKS: They were associated for her with childhood and early childhood. KRULWICH: And then she asked, well, do you think maybe I had a stroke? Dr. SACKS: It could be, I said, although I've - I'm not sure that I've encountered a stroke like this. KRULWICH: So then what's your next move? What do you do? Dr. SACKS: I wanted to look at her brainwaves\u2026 KRULWICH: Which required an electro-encephalogram or an EEG machine, but they had to find the machine, which meant it was going to be a bit of a wait. And while they waited, the songs in Mrs. O. C. 's head, they start to fade, just a bit little. Dr. SACKS: Yeah, it's diminishing. It comes and goes. It's getting softer. KRULWICH: So when it was time for the exam\u2026 Dr. SACKS: We said sit, make yourself comfortable\u2026 KRULWICH: And when you hear music, whenever the song starts\u2026 Dr. SACKS: I want you to raise a finger\u2026 KRULWICH: Did she raise your finger? Dr. SACKS: She raised her finger several times, and each time, one saw some increase in voltage over the right temporal lobe. KRULWICH: So she wasn't crazy. There was a spasm of electrical activity in a very particular region of her brain. Dr. SACKS: Exactly. And those parts of the brain where music is perceived, imagined, hallucinated\u2026 KRULWICH: So maybe Mrs. O. C. had a stroke one night that affected the cells in her brain and produced music in her head - musical epilepsy, it was called, by a famous Canadian. Dr. SACKS: Wilder Penfield, the great Canadian neurosurgeon. KRULWICH: In the 1940s, Dr. Penfield operated on scores of patients. And when he had them on the table with their brains exposed, he would take a probe and very lightly touch different areas of their brains. You don't feel pain up there, so the patients could tell them in real time what they were experiencing: sounds, colors. But when he touched certain areas of the brain, his patients heard music. (Soundbite of music) KRULWICH: And the music they heard, Penfield reported, was generic -everybody's music. Christmas carols or famous songs\u2026 (Soundbite of song, \"Old Man River\") Mr. PAUL ROBESON (Actor, Singer): (Singing) Old man river\u2026 KRULWICH: So when you examined Mrs. O. C. , you knew about Dr. Penfield and his patients. You knew about the songs they heard. So what did you think? Dr. SACKS: I thought she was having musical seizures. KRULWICH: But in Mrs. O. C. 's case, there was a difference. (Soundbite of music) Dr. SACKS: I was struck by the nostalgia which seemed to attach to what the song she heard. KRULWICH: Mrs. O. C. 's songs, weren't the songs all of us hear. Hers seemed more personal, like real memories. So we asked her about her childhood and discovered that she was from Ireland, that her father had died before she was born and her mother had died when she was only 5 years old. Dr. SACKS: Her childhood had been rather desolate in a way - orphaned, alone. She was sent to America to live with a rather forbidding maiden aunt. She had no conscious memory in the first five years of her life. No memory of her mother, of Ireland, of home. (Soundbite of music) KRULWICH: So who was that singing to her? Scientists don't know really how a brain chooses the music that we keep in our heads. There's probably no secret vault of songs from early infancy - no scientific evidence, anyway. But Dr. Sacks could tell that Mrs. O. C. longed for some version of her missing mother. Dr. SACKS: She had always felt this is a keen and painful sadness - this lack of forgetting of the earliest, most precious years of her life. KRULWICH: And so, because he was her doctor, and because it might help\u2026 Dr. SACKS: I am something of a romantic at heart. KRULWICH: So Dr. Sacks gave Mrs. O. C. not a science paper. He gave her a short story by the writer H. G. Wells, which imagines a character who can magically open the secret door to his childhood memories. (Soundbite of music) KRULWICH: And he said to Mrs. O. C. , read this story and maybe your stroke -maybe you can think that it opened that door in you. Now, this is not orthodox science. Dr. SACKS: I sometimes depart from strict neurology. (Soundbite of laughter) KRULWICH: But if you want, he said, think of the stroke as a gift that allows you to glimpse - you're 80 years, 88 years old - to glimpse what happened at the very start of your life when you were a baby girl, you're hearing - singing you lullabies. Let's say that that's really your mother's voice, your missing mother. (Soundbite of music) KRULWICH: And Mrs. O. C. thought, well, yeah, that fits. Dr. SACKS: I'm an old woman with a stroke in an old people's home. But I feel I'm a child in Ireland again. I feel my mother's arms. I see her. I hear her voice singing. (Soundbite of music) KRULWICH: Was that really her mother? Dr. Sachs does not know. Dr. SACKS: I'm now more inclined to think that this is probably, you know, at least richly infused with fantasy and with longing. KRULWICH: The songs, though, they are real. Irish mothers 80 years earlier had indeed sung those songs to their children. In Mrs. O. C. 's case, however, the songs got weaker, and then weaker, and then they vanished. And once they'd gone - her brain had apparently healed itself. She discovered that she missed her disease. She missed those songs. And she missed that voice, especially the voice. (Soundbite of music) KRULWICH: Robert Krulwich, NPR News, New York.  MIKE PESCA, host:  So here's what happens. We have a guest scheduled. His name is Jordan Wright. He's going to come by, show us presidential campaign memorabilia. You can't really convey some of this stuff over the phone. There's a bit of a problem getting him into the studios, some car trouble. We're going to put him off. He'll come in at a later date.  So, what do we do now? That's right. We break out the Emergency Krulwich.  (Soundbite of siren)  PESCA: Apparently, the Emergency Krulwich is located on a Parisian street. How does that work?  Anyway, when a guest falls out, we break out a radio gem from Robert Krulwich, sort of a disincentive to make every guest show up on time, given that Mr. Krulwich is what is known in the business as a genius.  Today, take yourself back to your very first memory. Most people can remember things that happen when they were maybe three or four. But earlier than that, this next story asks, how far back can you go?  ROBERT KRULWICH: This is the story of a woman - an older woman in her 80s who goes to sleep one night in her room in an old people's home in the Bronx in New York. And according to Dr. Oliver Sacks, the writer and neurologist\u2026  Dr. OLIVER SACKS (Writer, Neurologist): She has a dream.  KRULWICH: In her dream, she hears a female voice singing, humming a song.  (Soundbite of music)  KRULWICH: It sounds like an Irish ballad. And as she told Dr. Sacks when he wrote about her years ago - he's updated her story in his new book \"Musicophilia\" - the first song she heard was followed by a second song.  (Soundbite of music)  KRULWICH: It was also Irish-sounding. And that one was followed by a third song.  (Soundbite of music)  KRULWICH: And then she wakes up. But even awake, her head is still filled with sound - those same songs keep going\u2026  (Soundbite of music)  KRULWICH: \u2026and going and going - and not only that\u2026  Dr. OLIVER SACKS (Neurology, Oxford University): They are very loud, so loud that she's puzzled.  KRULWICH: At first, this woman - and Dr. Sacks calls her Mrs. O. C. - at first, he thought, well, these voices have got to be coming from a radio somewhere.  Dr. SACKS: Absolutely. I mean, she wandered around a bit and sort of looked for a radio, but there wasn't a radio on. Everyone else was asleep.  KRULWICH: Strange. Now, if I were an 88-year-old woman in an old people's home in the middle of the night hearing music everywhere which no one else hears, that would frighten me.  Dr. SACKS: Well, it's frightened her.  KRULWICH: She must have thought, I guess I'm going crazy.  Dr. SACKS: You know, hearing things?  KRULWICH: Yeah. But later that morning, when she saw the house doctor\u2026  Dr. SACKS: He said, no, Mrs. O. C. You're not mad, and the mad don't hear music. They only hear voices. You must see a neurologist.  KRULWICH: Who happens to be you?  Dr. SACKS: Right.  (Soundbite of music)  KRULWICH: When they first met, Dr. Sacks had to yell over the noise inside Mrs. O. C. 's head. She could barely hear him.  Dr. SACKS: She was now thoroughly rattled, and the music continued deafening.  KRULWICH: So, Dr. Sacks asked her, could you hum these songs? Could you describe them? And she said, yup. They're Irish. They're sung by a female. and somehow, they're vaguely familiar.  Dr. SACKS: They were associated for her with childhood and early childhood.  KRULWICH: And then she asked, well, do you think maybe I had a stroke?  Dr. SACKS: It could be, I said, although I've - I'm not sure that I've encountered a stroke like this.  KRULWICH: So then what's your next move? What do you do?  Dr. SACKS: I wanted to look at her brainwaves\u2026  KRULWICH: Which required an electro-encephalogram or an EEG machine, but they had to find the machine, which meant it was going to be a bit of a wait. And while they waited, the songs in Mrs. O. C. 's head, they start to fade, just a bit little.  Dr. SACKS: Yeah, it's diminishing. It comes and goes. It's getting softer.

Knee socks from the Eisenhower campaign - we've got those. And Rachel Martin has the day's news, but first here's the BPP's Big Story. (Soundbite of music) MARTIN: America's abortion rate is at its lowest in 34 years, with 19 percent of pregnancies ending in abortion. That figure peaked in the early 1980s, when almost one in three pregnancies in the U. S. ended in abortion. Today, it's closer to one in five. PESCA: That statistic is from the Guttmacher Institute, a New York based non-profit organization that resources - that researches sexual and reproductive health issues. Even though the Guttmacher Institute supports abortion rights, it's considered the nation's best source of abortion statistics, and is often recognized even by abortion proponents - opponents. MARTIN: Today's report is the first new comprehensive data on the topic in five years, and these are statistics from 2005 - the most recent year available. And it comes just five days before the 35th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. PESCA: The report also says that while there is a decline, medical abortions are on the rise as a percentage of overall abortions. Medical abortion involves the drug RU-486 instead of surgery. MARTIN: Now the report does not offer a reason why abortions continue to decline. Rachel Jones, an author of the study, tells Newsweek magazine that many factors could be at play here. More access to birth control, less access to abortion clinics, emergency contraception options like plan B, or simply that more women are deciding against abortion. PESCA: But while the study doesn't take a position on what caused the decline, people on both sides of the abortion debate are offering theories, each side essentially saying, see, this proves what I've been saying all along. Randall O'Bannon, director of education and research for National Right to Life, says, quote, \"This data tells you that attitudes have changed. \" MARTIN: And on the other side, Plan Parenthood president Ms. Cecile Richards, points to a different type of education: sex education and birth control. She says the study shows that, quote, \"Prevention works. \" PESCA: That's THE BPP's Big Story. And now I have to search for this newscaster I've been hearing so much about. There she is - Rachel Martin, with even more news.  BILL WOLFF (Announcer): From NPR News in New York, this is THE BRYANT PARK PROJECT.

I'm Melissa Block. MICHELE NORRIS, host: And I'm Michele Norris. Scientists say they have reached an important milestone in their quest to actually build a life-form. They have synthesized a bacteria's entire chromosome from its chemical building blocks. Soon, they hope to activate those genes and create living, multiplying bacteria. Eventually, synthetic organisms may help produce fuels, chemicals and medicines. NPR's Richard Harris has this story. RICHARD HARRIS: There's a whole new field starting up called synthetic biology. The idea is to take biotechnology to the next level, by not just moving genes around but building biological machinery from scratch. Scientists have already assembled virus genomes from chemical building blocks. Now they're onto bacteria. A research team at the J. Craig Venter Institute outside Washington, D. C. , has set its sights on a bacterium called Mycoplasma genitalium. This simple organism has just a few hundred genes to begin with, and a complete genetic code that's about half a million letters long \u2014 more than a thousand times smaller than a human's. Venter says the idea was to synthesize this genome by assembling those half-million letters in gene-making machines. Mr. J. CRAIG VENTER (Founder, J. Craig Venter Institute): And this entire process started with four bottles of chemicals containing what's represented by A, C, G and T. HARRIS: That is the chemical building blocks of DNA. Gene machines turned out a hundred and one relatively small snippets of DNA, each representing about 1 percent of the genetic code of this bacterium. Venter's colleagues then put those snippets in bacteria, which multiplied like crazy and served as copy machines for those pieces. Then gradually, using bacteria and finally yeast cells, they stitched together those 101 pieces in the correct order. They then read back the genetic code to make sure they had made a true copy of the natural chromosome. They reported that success in the online edition of Science Magazine. But what they have not been able to do as yet is to put this chromosome into a cell and get the cell to use that genetic information to start functioning and reproducing. Venter says this is the next big hurdle in the research. Mr. VENTER: There are multiple barriers for this. It's not just a slam dunk or we would be announcing it today. HARRIS: But his lab has some ideas about how to do this. Venter says he'd be surprised and disappointed if he can't succeed sometime this year. And he has quite an impressive track record in science. Most famously, he was instrumental in the effort to sequence the human genome. Eventually, Venter wants to use this method to create radical new versions of this bacterium so he can ultimately understand how its genes all work. And if the Venter lab can do that, they can then start to build radically different organisms from the ground up. Mr. VENTER: We could enter into a new design phase of biology by actually constructing chromosomes of a more specific nature for a more specific purpose. HARRIS: Venter's lab, like others, is focusing now on designer bacteria that can help combat global warming by creating more environmentally friendly fuels from plant materials. George Church, at Harvard Medical School, is also interested in engineering bacteria that can do this. But he is not convinced that you need to build them from scratch. Professor GEORGE CHURCH (Genetics, Harvard Medical School): And in fact, most of the proposals on the table really involve somewhere less than a hundred changes. HARRIS: And making individual changes to the bacteria's genes isn't too tough, he says. Church sees a great deal of potential in synthetic biology. But he says that technologies also have risks, so we need to be sure this one doesn't end up being used for nefarious purposes such as engineering more deadly germs. Richard Harris, NPR News.

Scientists say they have reached an important milestone in their quest to actually build a life-form. They have synthesized a bacteria's entire chromosome from its chemical building blocks.  Soon, they hope to activate those genes and create living, multiplying bacteria. Eventually, synthetic organisms may help produce fuels, chemicals and medicines.  NPR's Richard Harris has this story.  RICHARD HARRIS: There's a whole new field starting up called synthetic biology. The idea is to take biotechnology to the next level, by not just moving genes around but building biological machinery from scratch. Scientists have already assembled virus genomes from chemical building blocks. Now they're onto bacteria.  A research team at the J. Craig Venter Institute outside Washington, D. C. , has set its sights on a bacterium called Mycoplasma genitalium. This simple organism has just a few hundred genes to begin with, and a complete genetic code that's about half a million letters long \u2014 more than a thousand times smaller than a human's. Venter says the idea was to synthesize this genome by assembling those half-million letters in gene-making machines.  Mr. J. CRAIG VENTER (Founder, J. Craig Venter Institute): And this entire process started with four bottles of chemicals containing what's represented by A, C, G and T.  HARRIS: That is the chemical building blocks of DNA. Gene machines turned out a hundred and one relatively small snippets of DNA, each representing about 1 percent of the genetic code of this bacterium. Venter's colleagues then put those snippets in bacteria, which multiplied like crazy and served as copy machines for those pieces.  Then gradually, using bacteria and finally yeast cells, they stitched together those 101 pieces in the correct order. They then read back the genetic code to make sure they had made a true copy of the natural chromosome. They reported that success in the online edition of Science Magazine.  But what they have not been able to do as yet is to put this chromosome into a cell and get the cell to use that genetic information to start functioning and reproducing. Venter says this is the next big hurdle in the research.  Mr. VENTER: There are multiple barriers for this. It's not just a slam dunk or we would be announcing it today.  HARRIS: But his lab has some ideas about how to do this. Venter says he'd be surprised and disappointed if he can't succeed sometime this year. And he has quite an impressive track record in science.

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. In the \"The Moral Instinct,\" an article published in The New York Times Magazine, Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker writes about a new sixth sense, what he called the moral sense - our ability to consider some questions as moral issues while others are addressed with the practicality of cost-benefit analysis. Take meat, for example. One person could be a vegetarian for ethical reasons to avoid causing pain to animals while someone else might be a vegetarian to lower cholesterol. For that person, it's a practical question of health, not morality. Today, psychologists, neurologists and biologists are trying to figure out how we make moral judgments and why, and why we newly elevate some issues to the plane of morality - smoking for instance - and learn to think of previously moral questions, like divorce, on a more pragmatic basis. And if this is a science, if the moral sense is hard-wired into our brains, does that reduce what many would regard as our best impulses to mere biology? If you'd like to talk with Steven Pinker about morality and how we categorize some issues as right and wrong but not others, our number here in Washington is 800-989-8255. The e-mail address is talk@npr. org, and you can weigh in on our blog at npr. org/blogofthenation. Later in the program, NPR's Howard Berkes joins us to explain how the Mormons will choose a new leader, but first, the moral instinct. Steven Pinker, the Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology at Harvard University, joins us now from a studio on the Harvard campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. And Steven Pinker, nice to have you with the show again. Professor STEVEN PINKER (Psychology, Harvard University): Thank you. CONAN: And why do you think there is a science of morality? Prof. PINKER: Morality is clearly a judgment that comes out of our emotions and our reason. It's a psychological phenomenon which may have objective counterparts but it certainly has psychological counterparts. The example that you raised of the two kinds of vegetarians, a phenomenon first discovered by Paul Rozin, is a wonderful example because the behavior is the same, avoiding meat, but the whole set of thoughts and emotions that go along with it very much depends on whether you think it's a moral decision or a practical one. To take one example, if a drop of meat broth falls into your vegetable soup, will you avoid even touching the soup? Well, if you're a health vegetarian, obviously, one drop is not going to raise your cholesterol levels. But if you avoid meat for moral purposes, then a mere drop is a contaminant and it compromises your identity even to taste it, and so you avoid it. Or you think, for example, that people who avoid meat are less aggressive and less animalistic, if you're a moral vegetarian. If you're a health vegetarian, you wouldn't make that kind of attribution. So it suggests that there's something in our psychology that goes along with being in a moral mindset, and so moral judgments are a topic in psychology and ultimately, biology just as color vision or smell is. CONAN: One of the new tools that scientists have to use to take a look at our brain is the functional MRI that can actually see the brain in operation while it's making decisions about various things, and what is that show about moral decisions as opposed to other kinds of decisions? Prof. PINKER: A nice example comes from the work of my colleague, Josh Greene, who looked at one of the favorite sandboxes for the new moral psychology, sometimes called the trolley problem. Namely, if you pose the following moral dilemma to people, a trolley is hurtling out of control, there are five workers on the track who are going to be killed as the trolley plows into them; they haven't seen the oncoming danger. You're standing at a switch; you can divert the trolley on to a sidetrack. Unfortunately, in the sidetrack there's a single man working who will be killed because he also hasn't noticed the danger - should you pull the switch? Saving five lives at the cost of one and just about everyone says yes all over the world. Now, if you change the physical terms of the problem, you say well, this time, you're standing on a bridge overlooking the tracks. You see the trolley hurtling out of control. The only way to stop it is to throw a heavy object in front of the trolley, and the only heavy object available is a fat man standing next to you - should you throw the fat man over the tracks? This time, people say it's not permissible to sacrifice one life in order to save five. Then you might think the mathematics are the same one - kill one, save five - why should it make so much of a difference how the physics work? Greene proposed the difference is that we have an innate revulsion, perhaps even rooted in evolution, to directly manhandling an innocent person. And so if you simply switch the track and then a chain of events occurs that will eventuate in a person getting killed, psychologically, that's different from doing it with your bare hands. And indeed, if you put people in a brain scan or while they're thinking through these dilemmas, that in the case of the fat man on the bridge problem, then an area in the frontal cortex that's associated with empathizing with other people lights up. And in the simpler problem where you simply have to divert the train onto a side track, that area does not light up. Also, in the fat man version of the problem, another part of the brain that's involved in conflict in weighing two things to decide which you should go with, lights up confirming that people are grappling in that case with a conflict between the calculus of one life versus five and the gut feeling that you can't hurl a struggling man over a bridge. CONAN: And why does evolution enter into this? Why would evolution play a factor? Prof. PINKER: The first suspicion is that some kind of moral intuitions are universal, not the same intuitions, of course, because in some cultures, it's considered moral to, say, kill your sister if she's had sex with someone you don't approve of, and in other cultures, it isn't. But the idea that there is a moral coloring to acts, that there are some acts that deserve to be punished, that ought to be discouraged, seems to be found in all cultures together with proscriptions against rape and murder and theft. A sense of empathy not always directed at every other human being, sometimes only to members of one's own clan. So the universality of morality is a hint that it might have an evolutionary basis, and models of how social cooperation can evolve point a finger at certain emotions like guilt and sympathy and gratitude and righteous anger as mechanisms to get people to cooperate without being exploited. And so the combination of the universality and the availability of a plausible mechanism by which moral sentiments could evolve suggest that it might be part of our evolved nature as is color vision or fear. CONAN: We're talking with Steven Pinker of the family, Perth Johnstone family professor of psychology at Harvard about his piece \"The Moral Instinct\" that was published in The New York Times Magazine. Again, if you'd like to join us, 800-989-8255, e-mail is talk@npr. org. John's(ph) on the line from San Francisco. JOHN (Caller): Hello? CONAN: Hi, John. You're on the air. Go ahead, please. JOHN: Yes. I'd like to thank Steve Pinker for all the work he's done. And my basic comment is that I think morality is closely connected to the survival of the group that one belongs to. As a young man, I thought often about morality of war and how one side could be fighting against the other side, and each side think that they're doing the moral, you know, doing the moral purpose. And I think as society changes, I think that the group the one belongs to changes so that the act is not - of course, the act that one does is very important, but the group that one belongs to is actually changing. Prof. PINKER: Yeah. Yes, we certainly - first of all, there certainly is a large amount of self-deception in the nobility of one's own group's cause. Both sides in a typical war believe that they are morally in the right and that the other side is a bunch of conniving, immoral psychopaths. And obviously, they can't both always be right. I suspect that we do have group feelings, although I think the easiest target for them is the clan or family, which is why nations and armies so often try to instill in their members a false sense of family belonging, kinship metaphors like the fatherland and the mother country and brothers in arms, communal meals - other ways of basically brainwashing individuals into thinking that they are in effect fighting for their clan or family, whereas, in fact, they're fighting for a much larger and more abstract entity called the nation state. CONAN: Thanks for the call, John. JOHN: Thank you. CONAN: And Steve, the other thing you raise is that there are different ways of thinking about this. If you regard something as a pragmatic issue - again, going back to that example we used of the two vegetarians - the health vegetarian and the anti-meat vegetarian, if you think about it on a pragmatic level, where you're going to make decisions certain ways. But if you think about it as a moral issue, well, then, it is wrong - capital W - to eat meat and you should try to persuade other people from eating meat. There are certain actions that making a moral judgment dictates. Prof. PINKER: Exactly. So even though I'm in favor of abortion rights, I've always objected to the bumper sticker that says if you're against an abortion, don't have one because that is equivalent to saying if you're against murder, don't kill someone. It misses the point that if abortion is a moral issue to anyone, then just agreeing not to do it yourself is not an option. It's like saying if you're against rape, don't rape someone. The very fact that it's considered moral by some people means that necessarily, it has to apply to everyone. Now, one could argue that, of course, in the case of abortion, the right of the woman trumps any right of the embryo or the fetus. And I think there is a legitimate argument to be made along those lines. But to trivialize it by saying it's just a matter of personal choice, I think, is to fail to engage the other side in a reasonable debate. CONAN: And then how does something - and you make the example of smoking - go from something which was, hey, you can smoke, you don't smoke, no big deal, to, all of a sudden, becoming a moral issue? Prof. PINKER: I think a lot of social and political and cultural change consists of moving behavior from the moral side of the page to the non-moral side or vice versa. For example, homosexuality is something that used to be considered to be immoral, as was almost every form of sex that didn't lead to children -contraception, pre-marital sex and so on. Now, we consider it just a matter of choice. Or divorce, atheism, homelessness, even, which used to have a moral taint when we would call someone a bum, which both implies that they have no home and that somehow they're responsible for it. Those are examples of behaviors that have become immoralized. On the other hand, things like, say, executive pay, which, a few years ago, would have been not a moral matter at all. If some corporation is stupid enough to pay exorbitant fees to some CEO who runs the company into the ground, that's none of my concern. But now, with concerns about inequality and of corporate mismanagement that leads to unemployment, it's everyone's business and it's considered a moral issue how much a CEO gets paid. CONAN: We're talking with author Steven Pinker about morality this hour. And what makes your moral compass spin? Nature or nurture? We're taking your calls. 800-989-8255. E-mail us, talk@npr. org. And stay with us. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. Morality is something that feels fixed. You might feel right and wrong in your very bones. But as we were just discussing, some issues are mutable - divorce, illegitimacy, even smoking - once regarded as moral issues are not so regarded anymore. Smoking, of course, gone from the other category, regarded as a pragmatic issue, now regarded by many as a moral issue. We're talking about the moral instinct and where it comes from with Steve Pinker this hour. He's the Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology at Harvard. You can find a link to his article about the moral instinct on our Web site at npr. org. And of course, we want your input as well. Where do you think our notions of right and wrong come from? You're invited to join the conversation, 800-989-8255. E-mail us, talk@npr. org. And you can check out our blog at npr. org/blogofthenation. Let's go to Brian(ph). Brian is with us from Fort Wayne, Indiana. BRIAN (Caller): Yeah. Hi. One question that I had was, it seems to me that morality tends over history to change a lot with the economic and political status of whatever is happening at the time. And the other thing I tend to have noticed just looking at history is that those non-pragmatic morality issues seem to be focused when a certain group has a problem in another area. And the perfect example is the homosexuality and divorce scenario you just talked about. Divorce, growing incredibly with the, you know, the Christian groups that used to not be, you know, nearly as prevalent as is now. All of a sudden, we've changed that. And we need to bash somebody else for their sin, which we think is more important. And it seems to take the concentration off our problems, which is, you know, this divorce rate which, historically, was a very conservative, and you just didn't do it, and it was a very small percentage. I'll take my thing off the air. CONAN: Okay, Brian. Thanks very much for the call. Prof. PINKER: Yes, there is a certain tendency, I think, to moralize the other guy's behavior as supposed to your own. So the - a gas-guzzling Hummer, for example, is considered a moral outrage among people who drive old, beat-up Volvos which might even - and get the same amount of pollutants. Or a Big Mac as opposed to creme brulee or tiramisu and vice versa often among more right wing groups. The kinds of practices that are characterized urban elites tend to have more of a moral taint than ones that go on in their own communities. So one of the things that go along with moralization is a certain amount of self-deception, namely, what I do is moral. What the other guy does deserves to be punished. CONAN: And you write that, in fact, this is - there are about five principles of morality. But prioritizing them from one culture to another can vary even within our own culture, left and right in the culture war, so-called, would prioritize those values differently. Prof. PINKER: That's right. If - I think, basically, any emotional reaction that we have to another person can become moralized. So we - if someone is dirty or contaminated, we obviously shun them. But we also tend to slide into thinking that there must be something wrong with them, any kind of behavior that we think of as repugnant to ourselves, we tend to moralize. And I think that's why, say, homosexuality, which is a bit of a puzzle why anyone should have ever thought it was immoral, given that it doesn't hurt anyone. You might even have thought that evolution would have favored not encouraging homosexuality, among others, because, you know, more women for me if everyone else is gay. But people do more - did, at least. In some cases, still do moralize homosexuality, I think, because if it's repugnant to themselves, it tends to blend in the brain with moral judgments. So there's a purity versus contamination mindset to moralization, which is also why we revere ascetic, spiritual leaders who dress in white and seem to be emotionally detached from the world as opposed to carnal, sensuous hotheads. There's also group loyalty and conformity to norms, which tends to get moralized. There is an avoidance of harming someone for no reason. There is fairness - the idea that you shouldn't take a benefit without paying for it. And that you shouldn't harm someone without getting punished. And then there is deference to authority, the idea that leaders should be revered and not challenged. Those are 5 different threads to morality. And the weighting that they get differs from culture to culture and even between the left and right in our own culture, where Jonathan Haidt first formulated this five-sphere theory of morality. He's noted that liberals tend to put almost all of the moral emphasis on avoiding harm and unfairness. Conservatives tend to give a somewhat lower weight to those two and a higher weight to group loyalty, deference to authority and purity. CONAN: Let's get another caller on the line. This is Chuck(ph). Chuck calling us from San Francisco. CHUCK (Caller): Thank you very much. I tend to - well, William James and a variety of religious experience talked about mystical religious experience as having a noetic quality, which is to say it's a - it gave you a sense of - there was a way of knowing. And I tend to think that aesthetic and religious experience, emotional, subjective experience, does give us access to a plane of truth that is quite apart from the material, scientific one and is no less true. But your theory, if I understand it - I read your article - says that emotions play a very key point in the process by which we come to moral decisions. And it seems to me that if - that the theory itself - which is to say that moral reasoning is the product of biology and evolution - affects the way we would approach, the way we understand the process of moral reasoning, which is to say if people don't think that the reason they do things is because it is transcendently, religiously, absolutely true but because it's the product of their biology and evolutionary process, doesn't this in a way interfere with the very foundation by which we come to a moral conclusion, which is an emotional one, by changing our view of the whole process of moral reasoning? Prof. PINKER: Well, I do deal with that in the article. Indeed, I think there's a third alternative to the idea that morality is dictated by religious texts and the idea that morality is just a product of the wiring of our brain. There is a certain logic to morality. One of them is the logic of non-zero sum games. The idea that two parties can both come out ahead by behaving in certain ways and not others, so if I refrain from stealing your property and you refrain from stealing mine, we're both better off than if we're constantly raiding each other and feuding like the Hatfields and the McCoys. Or if I give you some of my surplus when I've got more than I can eat and you're starving, and you decide to do the same thing when fortunes reverse, we're both better off. And part of the morality, which is valuing another person's interest like your own, therefore has an objective basis in any social and self-interested group of intelligent agents. The other is just the logic if intellectual discourse in the first place. If I'm discussing with you how you ought to behave, if I say you should get off my foot, it's hurting me. And there are good reasons for you to get off my foot. If I say you shouldn't run me down with your car as a shortcut to get to the grocery store but drive around me. Anything that I implore you to do has to apply to me as well. I can't - I have to get off your foot. I have to avoid running you down with my car if I want you to take me seriously. Otherwise, it's just an irrational thing for me to try to persuade you to believe. So the interchangeability of perspectives, the basis of the Golden Rule is a fact of logic that doesn't come from peculiarities of how evolution wired our brain. It doesn't come from the Bible or any other holy book. But it's just, in some sense, in the nature of things, in the nature of rationality. And I argue that that is why there is such a thing as morality separate from our evolved moral sense but that religion itself has nothing to do with it. I don't think it's just emotion either. These are both rational arguments that consulting moral emotions is, in general, not a good way to find the most defensible course of actions because people have done horrendous things in the throes of various emotions. The idea that black and white people could drink from the same water fountain, the idea that Jews and Germans could have sex, the idea of blood transfusions, the idea of consenting homosexual behavior. All of these were considered emotionally, deeply repugnant in their own time or place. Now, we can argue that there's nothing wrong with any of them despite whatever negative emotional reaction someone may have had at the time. CHUCK: Can I just say that - but it does seem that with gain theory and with the Golden Rule, even, as being kind of explained from a utilitarian perspective, it does rather undermine the notion of a kind of an ultimate abstract transcendence sort of moral principle being the basis or the foundation for our behavior. And as such, for example, you know, it may apply conveniently if we're talking about people standing on each other's foot. But what about the sort of altruism where, for example, the soldier that throws himself on the grenade? That is not going to benefit him. I mean, and you end up getting, you know, again, you can come up with a kind of, a sort, a game theory explanation but they always end up, to me at least, sounding kind of watered down and not nearly as morally powerful and persuasive as the traditional foundations of morality. Prof. PINKER: I guess I would have to disagree that ultimately basing it in a kind of reason that I can't wiggle out of and you can't wiggle out off is more persuasive than any kind of religious source, which not only depends on what religion you were born into but ultimately needs its own justification. Just because it's written down in some text, why should we treat it as a moral obligation, and how did it get there in the first place? CHUCK: I think\u2026 Prof. PINKER: If you believe that morality was handed down by God, what basis did he have for deeming certain acts moral and others immoral and if he had gone the other way, would we have have to obey him? If he said go ahead and torture a child, would we be compelled to obey and if not, what principles would we be appealing to in overriding an immoral divine edict? For that reason, I don't think that traditional religion is a viable source for morality and ultimately it does have to be rooted in some rational exploration of interchangeability of perspectives. CONAN: Chuck, thanks very much. CHUCK: It's super religious and it's not that - that perhaps that's a discussion for another day. Thank you very much. CONAN: Thanks for the call. Let's see if we can go now to Scott(ph), and Scott is on the line with us from Tulsa, Arizona - Oklahoma, excuse me. SCOTT (Caller): Yes. Well, I just am kind of commenting on the conversation you were having just a little bit ago. I think that a lot of, you know, what's true in the Bible about every man does what is right as it owns - in his own eyes kind of holds it absolutely, we end up going into a moral drift. And as society tends to put constraints on these but if everybody's out sacrificing people as an accepted societal standard even though we know now that it's wrong then wouldn't that also - didn't that - we have moral absolutes? Prof. PINKER: Well, I think we do have moral principles, I'm not sure they'd be absolutes because you can always think of a reason, extenuating a set of circumstances, in which any given principle might had to be trumped by another on. So it's wrong to kill someone but, of course if it's in self-defense or if it's in defense of somebody - other innocent person or in case, certain cases of justifiable war then of course it is permissible to kill someone else. CONAN: Well, presumably, the Aztec priest who tore the beating heart out of a sacrificial victim thought that they had, they were perfectly moral in doing so. SCOTT: Exactly. Prof. PINKER: Right. And they were wrong. They were not acting morally and we - although by their own lights, they were and that is, I would say, that it speaks a good illustration of the difference between moral psychology or moralization on the one hand and morality itself on the other. I think we do need principles, I'm just disputing that they ought to come from religion because you still have to choose which religion should give you your principles, which principles you choose and which ones you ignore. For example, the Bible says that anyone who disobeys his parents or blasphemes God should be stoned to death. We ignore that moral principle from the Bible and rightly concentrate on thou shall not kill. That suggests that we must be appealing to some standard as to which principles from the Bible we choose and which ones we reject, hence, that I think is actually proof that our standards of morality ultimately don't come from religion because they tell us which of those religious precepts we take seriously and which ones we try to ignore. CONAN: Scott, thank you. SCOTT: Well, I do agree to a certain extent with that but isn't it also in the New Testament that Jesus said he who is without sin let him cast the first stone in the same precept. CONAN: Thanks, again, for that Scott. We're talking with Steve Pinker and you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And, Steve, I heard you try to come in on that last thought. Prof. PINKER: Oh, yes, well, let me say, a wise directive against taking our own sanctimony too seriously, although, Jesus, of course, did accept everything in the Old Testament, he didn't abjure everything and - but I do agree that's a wise counsel. CONAN: Let's see if we can get another caller in. And this is David(ph), David with us from Manhattan in Kansas. DAVID (Caller): Yes. What I was wondering is if there is a biological basis to morality then there should be some people who are amoral. And I was wondering, are there any studies comparing people who are amoral because of some genetic defect to, you know, a moral person and seeing if there's any differences to try to find exactly what is the biological basis of morality? Prof. PINKER: It's an excellent question and there are - it is a - there is a promising lead. The people who are often diagnosed as psychopaths or the related condition of anti-social personality disorder seem to fall into that category, they show no empathy, they often show cruelty even from the time they were children. They bully smaller children and torture animals, they have a great deal of difficulty empathizing and some of them commit heinous acts like bilking elderly people out of their life savings or raping a succession of women. There are some kinds of people with anti-social personality disorder who do have differences in their brain, in particular, in the parts of the brain that seem to light up when people ponder throwing the fat man over the bridge to stop the runaway trolley. And although no one has identified a set of genes that contribute to psychopathy and in some cases it's caused by a brain damage rather than by genes. I suspect that in 10 years' time, there will be a set of genes that are associated with a lack of conscience and in the extreme case an absence of conscience, as we see in psychopaths. CONAN: Mm-hmm. David, thank you. DAVID: Well, thank you. Bye-bye. CONAN: And this last e-mail from Dave(ph). (Reading) Humans often seem unable to weigh life equally in moral situations, for example the uproar over the death of Princess Diana is wildly disproportionate to the hundreds of thousands brutally murdered in Darfur. I'd like Steve's comments on why people can't recognize this is one life versus hundreds of thousands and the outrage appropriate to the scale of the issue? And we're going to give you 30 seconds to answer that. Prof. PINKER: It's a great question. It partly reflects the fact that authority tends to be moralized and people who have high status and power tend to be given a moral free pass. It's also the effect of just firsthand experience. We feel more empathy to individuals that we see and know about than to statistics of hundreds of thousands of people who we don't personally see or form bonds to. CONAN: Steven Pinker, thank you very much for your time today. Prof. PINKER: Thanks for having me. CONAN: Steve Pinker is the Johnstone professor of psychology at Harvard University. He joined us from a studio there. And again, you can find a link to his article, \"The Moral Instinct,\" on our Web site at npr. org. Coming up, NPR's Howard Berkes explains how the Mormons will choose a new leader and Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy's endorsement of Barack Obama to be the next president of the United States. Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  NEAL CONAN, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington.  In the \"The Moral Instinct,\" an article published in The New York Times Magazine, Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker writes about a new sixth sense, what he called the moral sense - our ability to consider some questions as moral issues while others are addressed with the practicality of cost-benefit analysis. Take meat, for example. One person could be a vegetarian for ethical reasons to avoid causing pain to animals while someone else might be a vegetarian to lower cholesterol. For that person, it's a practical question of health, not morality.  Today, psychologists, neurologists and biologists are trying to figure out how we make moral judgments and why, and why we newly elevate some issues to the plane of morality - smoking for instance - and learn to think of previously moral questions, like divorce, on a more pragmatic basis. And if this is a science, if the moral sense is hard-wired into our brains, does that reduce what many would regard as our best impulses to mere biology?  If you'd like to talk with Steven Pinker about morality and how we categorize some issues as right and wrong but not others, our number here in Washington is 800-989-8255. The e-mail address is talk@npr. org, and you can weigh in on our blog at npr. org/blogofthenation.  Later in the program, NPR's Howard Berkes joins us to explain how the Mormons will choose a new leader, but first, the moral instinct.  Steven Pinker, the Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology at Harvard University, joins us now from a studio on the Harvard campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. And Steven Pinker, nice to have you with the show again.  Professor STEVEN PINKER (Psychology, Harvard University): Thank you.  CONAN: And why do you think there is a science of morality?  Prof. PINKER: Morality is clearly a judgment that comes out of our emotions and our reason. It's a psychological phenomenon which may have objective counterparts but it certainly has psychological counterparts. The example that you raised of the two kinds of vegetarians, a phenomenon first discovered by Paul Rozin, is a wonderful example because the behavior is the same, avoiding meat, but the whole set of thoughts and emotions that go along with it very much depends on whether you think it's a moral decision or a practical one.  To take one example, if a drop of meat broth falls into your vegetable soup, will you avoid even touching the soup? Well, if you're a health vegetarian, obviously, one drop is not going to raise your cholesterol levels. But if you avoid meat for moral purposes, then a mere drop is a contaminant and it compromises your identity even to taste it, and so you avoid it. Or you think, for example, that people who avoid meat are less aggressive and less animalistic, if you're a moral vegetarian. If you're a health vegetarian, you wouldn't make that kind of attribution. So it suggests that there's something in our psychology that goes along with being in a moral mindset, and so moral judgments are a topic in psychology and ultimately, biology just as color vision or smell is.  CONAN: One of the new tools that scientists have to use to take a look at our brain is the functional MRI that can actually see the brain in operation while it's making decisions about various things, and what is that show about moral decisions as opposed to other kinds of decisions?  Prof. PINKER: A nice example comes from the work of my colleague, Josh Greene, who looked at one of the favorite sandboxes for the new moral psychology, sometimes called the trolley problem. Namely, if you pose the following moral dilemma to people, a trolley is hurtling out of control, there are five workers on the track who are going to be killed as the trolley plows into them; they haven't seen the oncoming danger. You're standing at a switch; you can divert the trolley on to a sidetrack.  Unfortunately, in the sidetrack there's a single man working who will be killed because he also hasn't noticed the danger - should you pull the switch? Saving five lives at the cost of one and just about everyone says yes all over the world. Now, if you change the physical terms of the problem, you say well, this time, you're standing on a bridge overlooking the tracks. You see the trolley hurtling out of control. The only way to stop it is to throw a heavy object in front of the trolley, and the only heavy object available is a fat man standing next to you - should you throw the fat man over the tracks? This time, people say it's not permissible to sacrifice one life in order to save five. Then you might think the mathematics are the same one - kill one, save five - why should it make so much of a difference how the physics work? Greene proposed the difference is that we have an innate revulsion, perhaps even rooted in evolution, to directly manhandling an innocent person.  And so if you simply switch the track and then a chain of events occurs that will eventuate in a person getting killed, psychologically, that's different from doing it with your bare hands. And indeed, if you put people in a brain scan or while they're thinking through these dilemmas, that in the case of the fat man on the bridge problem, then an area in the frontal cortex that's associated with empathizing with other people lights up. And in the simpler problem where you simply have to divert the train onto a side track, that area does not light up. Also, in the fat man version of the problem, another part of the brain that's involved in conflict in weighing two things to decide which you should go with, lights up confirming that people are grappling in that case with a conflict between the calculus of one life versus five and the gut feeling that you can't hurl a struggling man over a bridge.  CONAN: And why does evolution enter into this? Why would evolution play a factor?  Prof. PINKER: The first suspicion is that some kind of moral intuitions are universal, not the same intuitions, of course, because in some cultures, it's considered moral to, say, kill your sister if she's had sex with someone you don't approve of, and in other cultures, it isn't. But the idea that there is a moral coloring to acts, that there are some acts that deserve to be punished, that ought to be discouraged, seems to be found in all cultures together with proscriptions against rape and murder and theft. A sense of empathy not always directed at every other human being, sometimes only to members of one's own clan. So the universality of morality is a hint that it might have an evolutionary basis, and models of how social cooperation can evolve point a finger at certain emotions like guilt and sympathy and gratitude and righteous anger as mechanisms to get people to cooperate without being exploited. And so the combination of the universality and the availability of a plausible mechanism by which moral sentiments could evolve suggest that it might be part of our evolved nature as is color vision or fear.  CONAN: We're talking with Steven Pinker of the family, Perth Johnstone family professor of psychology at Harvard about his piece \"The Moral Instinct\" that was published in The New York Times Magazine. Again, if you'd like to join us, 800-989-8255, e-mail is talk@npr. org.  John's(ph) on the line from San Francisco.  JOHN (Caller): Hello?  CONAN: Hi, John. You're on the air. Go ahead, please.  JOHN: Yes. I'd like to thank Steve Pinker for all the work he's done. And my basic comment is that I think morality is closely connected to the survival of the group that one belongs to. As a young man, I thought often about morality of war and how one side could be fighting against the other side, and each side think that they're doing the moral, you know, doing the moral purpose. And I think as society changes, I think that the group the one belongs to changes so that the act is not - of course, the act that one does is very important, but the group that one belongs to is actually changing.  Prof. PINKER: Yeah. Yes, we certainly - first of all, there certainly is a large amount of self-deception in the nobility of one's own group's cause. Both sides in a typical war believe that they are morally in the right and that the other side is a bunch of conniving, immoral psychopaths. And obviously, they can't both always be right. I suspect that we do have group feelings, although I think the easiest target for them is the clan or family, which is why nations and armies so often try to instill in their members a false sense of family belonging, kinship metaphors like the fatherland and the mother country and brothers in arms, communal meals - other ways of basically brainwashing individuals into thinking that they are in effect fighting for their clan or family, whereas, in fact, they're fighting for a much larger and more abstract entity called the nation state.  CONAN: Thanks for the call, John.  JOHN: Thank you.  CONAN: And Steve, the other thing you raise is that there are different ways of thinking about this. If you regard something as a pragmatic issue - again, going back to that example we used of the two vegetarians - the health vegetarian and the anti-meat vegetarian, if you think about it on a pragmatic level, where you're going to make decisions certain ways. But if you think about it as a moral issue, well, then, it is wrong - capital W - to eat meat and you should try to persuade other people from eating meat. There are certain actions that making a moral judgment dictates.  Prof. PINKER: Exactly. So even though I'm in favor of abortion rights, I've always objected to the bumper sticker that says if you're against an abortion, don't have one because that is equivalent to saying if you're against murder, don't kill someone. It misses the point that if abortion is a moral issue to anyone, then just agreeing not to do it yourself is not an option. It's like saying if you're against rape, don't rape someone. The very fact that it's considered moral by some people means that necessarily, it has to apply to everyone.  Now, one could argue that, of course, in the case of abortion, the right of the woman trumps any right of the embryo or the fetus. And I think there is a legitimate argument to be made along those lines. But to trivialize it by saying it's just a matter of personal choice, I think, is to fail to engage the other side in a reasonable debate.  CONAN: And then how does something - and you make the example of smoking - go from something which was, hey, you can smoke, you don't smoke, no big deal, to, all of a sudden, becoming a moral issue?  Prof. PINKER: I think a lot of social and political and cultural change consists of moving behavior from the moral side of the page to the non-moral side or vice versa.  For example, homosexuality is something that used to be considered to be immoral, as was almost every form of sex that didn't lead to children -contraception, pre-marital sex and so on. Now, we consider it just a matter of choice. Or divorce, atheism, homelessness, even, which used to have a moral taint when we would call someone a bum, which both implies that they have no home and that somehow they're responsible for it. Those are examples of behaviors that have become immoralized.  On the other hand, things like, say, executive pay, which, a few years ago, would have been not a moral matter at all. If some corporation is stupid enough to pay exorbitant fees to some CEO who runs the company into the ground, that's none of my concern. But now, with concerns about inequality and of corporate mismanagement that leads to unemployment, it's everyone's business and it's considered a moral issue how much a CEO gets paid.  CONAN: We're talking with author Steven Pinker about morality this hour. And what makes your moral compass spin? Nature or nurture? We're taking your calls. 800-989-8255. E-mail us, talk@npr. org. And stay with us.  I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington.  Morality is something that feels fixed. You might feel right and wrong in your very bones. But as we were just discussing, some issues are mutable - divorce, illegitimacy, even smoking - once regarded as moral issues are not so regarded anymore. Smoking, of course, gone from the other category, regarded as a pragmatic issue, now regarded by many as a moral issue.  We're talking about the moral instinct and where it comes from with Steve Pinker this hour. He's the Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology at Harvard. You can find a link to his article about the moral instinct on our Web site at npr. org.  And of course, we want your input as well. Where do you think our notions of right and wrong come from? You're invited to join the conversation, 800-989-8255. E-mail us, talk@npr. org. And you can check out our blog at npr. org/blogofthenation.  Let's go to Brian(ph). Brian is with us from Fort Wayne, Indiana.  BRIAN (Caller): Yeah. Hi. One question that I had was, it seems to me that morality tends over history to change a lot with the economic and political status of whatever is happening at the time. And the other thing I tend to have noticed just looking at history is that those non-pragmatic morality issues seem to be focused when a certain group has a problem in another area. And the perfect example is the homosexuality and divorce scenario you just talked about. Divorce, growing incredibly with the, you know, the Christian groups that used to not be, you know, nearly as prevalent as is now. All of a sudden, we've changed that. And we need to bash somebody else for their sin, which we think is more important. And it seems to take the concentration off our problems, which is, you know, this divorce rate which, historically, was a very conservative, and you just didn't do it, and it was a very small percentage. I'll take my thing off the air.  CONAN: Okay, Brian. Thanks very much for the call.  Prof. PINKER: Yes, there is a certain tendency, I think, to moralize the other guy's behavior as supposed to your own. So the - a gas-guzzling Hummer, for example, is considered a moral outrage among people who drive old, beat-up Volvos which might even - and get the same amount of pollutants. Or a Big Mac as opposed to creme brulee or tiramisu and vice versa often among more right wing groups. The kinds of practices that are characterized urban elites tend to have more of a moral taint than ones that go on in their own communities.  So one of the things that go along with moralization is a certain amount of self-deception, namely, what I do is moral. What the other guy does deserves to be punished.  CONAN: And you write that, in fact, this is - there are about five principles of morality. But prioritizing them from one culture to another can vary even within our own culture, left and right in the culture war, so-called, would prioritize those values differently.  Prof. PINKER: That's right. If - I think, basically, any emotional reaction that we have to another person can become moralized. So we - if someone is dirty or contaminated, we obviously shun them. But we also tend to slide into thinking that there must be something wrong with them, any kind of behavior that we think of as repugnant to ourselves, we tend to moralize. And I think that's why, say, homosexuality, which is a bit of a puzzle why anyone should have ever thought it was immoral, given that it doesn't hurt anyone. You might even have thought that evolution would have favored not encouraging homosexuality, among others, because, you know, more women for me if everyone else is gay.  But people do more - did, at least. In some cases, still do moralize homosexuality, I think, because if it's repugnant to themselves, it tends to blend in the brain with moral judgments. So there's a purity versus contamination mindset to moralization, which is also why we revere ascetic, spiritual leaders who dress in white and seem to be emotionally detached from the world as opposed to carnal, sensuous hotheads.  There's also group loyalty and conformity to norms, which tends to get moralized. There is an avoidance of harming someone for no reason. There is fairness - the idea that you shouldn't take a benefit without paying for it. And that you shouldn't harm someone without getting punished. And then there is deference to authority, the idea that leaders should be revered and not challenged. Those are 5 different threads to morality. And the weighting that they get differs from culture to culture and even between the left and right in our own culture, where Jonathan Haidt first formulated this five-sphere theory of morality.  He's noted that liberals tend to put almost all of the moral emphasis on avoiding harm and unfairness. Conservatives tend to give a somewhat lower weight to those two and a higher weight to group loyalty, deference to authority and purity.  CONAN: Let's get another caller on the line. This is Chuck(ph). Chuck calling us from San Francisco.  CHUCK (Caller): Thank you very much. I tend to - well, William James and a variety of religious experience talked about mystical religious experience as having a noetic quality, which is to say it's a - it gave you a sense of - there was a way of knowing. And I tend to think that aesthetic and religious experience, emotional, subjective experience, does give us access to a plane of truth that is quite apart from the material, scientific one and is no less true. But your theory, if I understand it - I read your article - says that emotions play a very key point in the process by which we come to moral decisions. And it seems to me that if - that the theory itself - which is to say that moral reasoning is the product of biology and evolution - affects the way we would approach, the way we understand the process of moral reasoning, which is to say if people don't think that the reason they do things is because it is transcendently, religiously, absolutely true but because it's the product of their biology and evolutionary process, doesn't this in a way interfere with the very foundation by which we come to a moral conclusion, which is an emotional one, by changing our view of the whole process of moral reasoning?  Prof. PINKER: Well, I do deal with that in the article. Indeed, I think there's a third alternative to the idea that morality is dictated by religious texts and the idea that morality is just a product of the wiring of our brain. There is a certain logic to morality. One of them is the logic of non-zero sum games. The idea that two parties can both come out ahead by behaving in certain ways and not others, so if I refrain from stealing your property and you refrain from stealing mine, we're both better off than if we're constantly raiding each other and feuding like the Hatfields and the McCoys. Or if I give you some of my surplus when I've got more than I can eat and you're starving, and you decide to do the same thing when fortunes reverse, we're both better off.  And part of the morality, which is valuing another person's interest like your own, therefore has an objective basis in any social and self-interested group of intelligent agents.  The other is just the logic if intellectual discourse in the first place. If I'm discussing with you how you ought to behave, if I say you should get off my foot, it's hurting me. And there are good reasons for you to get off my foot. If I say you shouldn't run me down with your car as a shortcut to get to the grocery store but drive around me. Anything that I implore you to do has to apply to me as well. I can't - I have to get off your foot. I have to avoid running you down with my car if I want you to take me seriously. Otherwise, it's just an irrational thing for me to try to persuade you to believe.  So the interchangeability of perspectives, the basis of the Golden Rule is a fact of logic that doesn't come from peculiarities of how evolution wired our brain. It doesn't come from the Bible or any other holy book. But it's just, in some sense, in the nature of things, in the nature of rationality. And I argue that that is why there is such a thing as morality separate from our evolved moral sense but that religion itself has nothing to do with it.  I don't think it's just emotion either. These are both rational arguments that consulting moral emotions is, in general, not a good way to find the most defensible course of actions because people have done horrendous things in the throes of various emotions.  The idea that black and white people could drink from the same water fountain, the idea that Jews and Germans could have sex, the idea of blood transfusions, the idea of consenting homosexual behavior. All of these were considered emotionally, deeply repugnant in their own time or place. Now, we can argue that there's nothing wrong with any of them despite whatever negative emotional reaction someone may have had at the time.  CHUCK: Can I just say that - but it does seem that with gain theory and with the Golden Rule, even, as being kind of explained from a utilitarian perspective, it does rather undermine the notion of a kind of an ultimate abstract transcendence sort of moral principle being the basis or the foundation for our behavior. And as such, for example, you know, it may apply conveniently if we're talking about people standing on each other's foot. But what about the sort of altruism where, for example, the soldier that throws himself on the grenade? That is not going to benefit him. I mean, and you end up getting, you know, again, you can come up with a kind of, a sort, a game theory explanation but they always end up, to me at least, sounding kind of watered down and not nearly as morally powerful and persuasive as the traditional foundations of morality.  Prof. PINKER: I guess I would have to disagree that ultimately basing it in a kind of reason that I can't wiggle out of and you can't wiggle out off is more persuasive than any kind of religious source, which not only depends on what religion you were born into but ultimately needs its own justification. Just because it's written down in some text, why should we treat it as a moral obligation, and how did it get there in the first place?  CHUCK: I think\u2026  Prof. PINKER: If you believe that morality was handed down by God, what basis did he have for deeming certain acts moral and others immoral and if he had gone the other way, would we have have to obey him? If he said go ahead and torture a child, would we be compelled to obey and if not, what principles would we be appealing to in overriding an immoral divine edict? For that reason, I don't think that traditional religion is a viable source for morality and ultimately it does have to be rooted in some rational exploration of interchangeability of perspectives.  CONAN: Chuck, thanks very much.  CHUCK: It's super religious and it's not that - that perhaps that's a discussion for another day. Thank you very much.  CONAN: Thanks for the call.  Let's see if we can go now to Scott(ph), and Scott is on the line with us from Tulsa, Arizona - Oklahoma, excuse me.  SCOTT (Caller): Yes. Well, I just am kind of commenting on the conversation you were having just a little bit ago. I think that a lot of, you know, what's true in the Bible about every man does what is right as it owns - in his own eyes kind of holds it absolutely, we end up going into a moral drift. And as society tends to put constraints on these but if everybody's out sacrificing people as an accepted societal standard even though we know now that it's wrong then wouldn't that also - didn't that - we have moral absolutes?  Prof. PINKER: Well, I think we do have moral principles, I'm not sure they'd be absolutes because you can always think of a reason, extenuating a set of circumstances, in which any given principle might had to be trumped by another on. So it's wrong to kill someone but, of course if it's in self-defense or if it's in defense of somebody - other innocent person or in case, certain cases of justifiable war then of course it is permissible to kill someone else.  CONAN: Well, presumably, the Aztec priest who tore the beating heart out of a sacrificial victim thought that they had, they were perfectly moral in doing so.  SCOTT: Exactly.  Prof. PINKER: Right. And they were wrong. They were not acting morally and we - although by their own lights, they were and that is, I would say, that it speaks a good illustration of the difference between moral psychology or moralization on the one hand and morality itself on the other. I think we do need principles, I'm just disputing that they ought to come from religion because you still have to choose which religion should give you your principles, which principles you choose and which ones you ignore.  For example, the Bible says that anyone who disobeys his parents or blasphemes God should be stoned to death. We ignore that moral principle from the Bible and rightly concentrate on thou shall not kill. That suggests that we must be appealing to some standard as to which principles from the Bible we choose and which ones we reject, hence, that I think is actually proof that our standards of morality ultimately don't come from religion because they tell us which of those religious precepts we take seriously and which ones we try to ignore.  CONAN: Scott, thank you.  SCOTT: Well, I do agree to a certain extent with that but isn't it also in the New Testament that Jesus said he who is without sin let him cast the first stone in the same precept.  CONAN: Thanks, again, for that Scott.  We're talking with Steve Pinker and you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  And, Steve, I heard you try to come in on that last thought.  Prof. PINKER: Oh, yes, well, let me say, a wise directive against taking our own sanctimony too seriously, although, Jesus, of course, did accept everything in the Old Testament, he didn't abjure everything and - but I do agree that's a wise counsel.  CONAN: Let's see if we can get another caller in. And this is David(ph), David with us from Manhattan in Kansas.  DAVID (Caller): Yes. What I was wondering is if there is a biological basis to morality then there should be some people who are amoral. And I was wondering, are there any studies comparing people who are amoral because of some genetic defect to, you know, a moral person and seeing if there's any differences to try to find exactly what is the biological basis of morality?  Prof. PINKER: It's an excellent question and there are - it is a - there is a promising lead. The people who are often diagnosed as psychopaths or the related condition of anti-social personality disorder seem to fall into that category, they show no empathy, they often show cruelty even from the time they were children. They bully smaller children and torture animals, they have a great deal of difficulty empathizing and some of them commit heinous acts like bilking elderly people out of their life savings or raping a succession of women. There are some kinds of people with anti-social personality disorder who do have differences in their brain, in particular, in the parts of the brain that seem to light up when people ponder throwing the fat man over the bridge to stop the runaway trolley. And although no one has identified a set of genes that contribute to psychopathy and in some cases it's caused by a brain damage rather than by genes. I suspect that in 10 years' time, there will be a set of genes that are associated with a lack of conscience and in the extreme case an absence of conscience, as we see in psychopaths.  CONAN: Mm-hmm. David, thank you.  DAVID: Well, thank you. Bye-bye.  CONAN: And this last e-mail from Dave(ph).  (Reading) Humans often seem unable to weigh life equally in moral situations, for example the uproar over the death of Princess Diana is wildly disproportionate to the hundreds of thousands brutally murdered in Darfur. I'd like Steve's comments on why people can't recognize this is one life versus hundreds of thousands and the outrage appropriate to the scale of the issue?  And we're going to give you 30 seconds to answer that.  Prof. PINKER: It's a great question. It partly reflects the fact that authority tends to be moralized and people who have high status and power tend to be given a moral free pass. It's also the effect of just firsthand experience. We feel more empathy to individuals that we see and know about than to statistics of hundreds of thousands of people who we don't personally see or form bonds to.  CONAN: Steven Pinker, thank you very much for your time today.  Prof. PINKER: Thanks for having me.  CONAN: Steve Pinker is the Johnstone professor of psychology at Harvard University.

It's called bird flu. The disease first appeared 10 years ago in Hong Kong. And in 2006, it was all over the news - how bird flu spread to humans and how, in some cases, people spread bird flu to other people. We haven't heard much about it in the past several months. This week, there have been reports of new cases of bird flu in humans in Indonesia, in India, in Saudi Arabia. And in Bangladesh, the world's most densely populated country, H5N1 spread among the poultry population has reached crisis levels. What level of danger does the virus currently pose to humans worldwide? Joining us to talk about this is Dr. Robert Webster, member of the Infectious Diseases Department at St. Jude's Children Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. He recently returned from an international congress about bird flu in Bangkok, Thailand. Dr. Webster, thank you for joining us. Dr. ROBERT WEBSTER (Director, World Health Organization Collaborating Center on the Ecology of Influenza Viruses in Lower Animals and Birds; Recipient of Rose Marie Thomas Chair in Virology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital): Good morning. WOLFF: What can you share with us about the conference in Bangkok? What were the big topics on the agenda at the conference? Dr. WEBSTER: The big topics were the continued circulation of H5N1 bird flu in so many countries. And that we have to realize that there is a pandemic going on in the domestic poultry in Eurasia. The point was made by several people, that for every human infected, a million chickens die. And so, this is ongoing, and the risk to humans is still there. WOLFF: How would you describe that risk to humans? I can recall, in 2006, the federal government - the United States government - alerted media outlets. They had special meetings with media outlets to talk about what to do when the bird flu pandemic started to affect humans in wide swaths worldwide. That hasn't happened yet. What would you say the risk to humans is, as we speak? Dr. WEBSTER: I think the - your point is well taken. It hasn't happened yet. But scientifically, we don't know if it will happen or when it will happen. This is the great difficulty. And when we realize that 60 percent of those humans that get infected die, it's one of those you're-damned-if-you-do and you're-damned-if-you-don't situations. We must prepare for it. It's like the Katrina situation or a tsunami. You've simply got to prepare for it. And it's - these warnings out there, that it is happening - and we don't know enough about this virus to be able to make the prediction that it will not happen\u2026 WOLFF: Even if\u2026 Dr. WEBSTER: \u2026if we could. WOLFF: \u2026but, in any case, as regards human-to-human transmission, can you talk about the crisis to populations because the poultry population is so widely affected - that is, are people's sustenance levels dropping because of bird flu? Are people going hungry because of bird flu? Dr. WEBSTER: I think you've touched on one of the very serious aspects in the lower income areas of the world - in Bangladesh, now, in India, Indonesia. It's the underprivileged poor people of the world that are really affected. These people eat chickens when they become sick and die. And these are the only protein sources they have. The other difficulty is that if you are a small backyard poultry farmer, and your chickens or ducks or geese start to look a little sick, what do you do? You take them to the market so that you'll get some money to live on. And these are the things that are happening. WOLFF: And\u2026 Dr. WEBSTER: And we don't have this under control. WOLFF: And in 2006, finally, you said that you had a three-month supply of food and water at home in case of the pandemic. Do you still have that stock pile, and do you still recommend that to be? Dr. WEBSTER: I absolutely do, of course. It could still happen. We hope to God it does not. WOLFF: Dr. Robert Webster, thank you very kindly for joining us. Dr. Webster works at Saint Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Thank you, Dr. Dr. WEBSTER: You're welcome. STEWART: Coming up on THE BRYANT PARK PROJECT, the most e-mailed, commented on and viewed stories on the Web. We will be collating the Internet, so to speak. WOLFF: That's a very involved process, to collate the entire Internet. STEWART: Well, you know, we're involved people here at The BRYANT PARK PROJECT. All right, producers, get your Most ready. Head on down to the studio. Stay with us. We'll be back in about 60 seconds. WOLFF: this is the THE BRYANT PARK PROJECT from NPR News.  BILL WOLFF, host:  You may remember this H5N1 or avian influenza. It's called bird flu. The disease first appeared 10 years ago in Hong Kong. And in 2006, it was all over the news - how bird flu spread to humans and how, in some cases, people spread bird flu to other people. We haven't heard much about it in the past several months.  This week, there have been reports of new cases of bird flu in humans in Indonesia, in India, in Saudi Arabia. And in Bangladesh, the world's most densely populated country, H5N1 spread among the poultry population has reached crisis levels. What level of danger does the virus currently pose to humans worldwide?  Joining us to talk about this is Dr. Robert Webster, member of the Infectious Diseases Department at St. Jude's Children Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. He recently returned from an international congress about bird flu in Bangkok, Thailand.  Dr. Webster, thank you for joining us.  Dr. ROBERT WEBSTER (Director, World Health Organization Collaborating Center on the Ecology of Influenza Viruses in Lower Animals and Birds; Recipient of Rose Marie Thomas Chair in Virology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital): Good morning.  WOLFF: What can you share with us about the conference in Bangkok? What were the big topics on the agenda at the conference?  Dr. WEBSTER: The big topics were the continued circulation of H5N1 bird flu in so many countries. And that we have to realize that there is a pandemic going on in the domestic poultry in Eurasia. The point was made by several people, that for every human infected, a million chickens die. And so, this is ongoing, and the risk to humans is still there.  WOLFF: How would you describe that risk to humans? I can recall, in 2006, the federal government - the United States government - alerted media outlets. They had special meetings with media outlets to talk about what to do when the bird flu pandemic started to affect humans in wide swaths worldwide. That hasn't happened yet. What would you say the risk to humans is, as we speak?  Dr. WEBSTER: I think the - your point is well taken. It hasn't happened yet. But scientifically, we don't know if it will happen or when it will happen. This is the great difficulty. And when we realize that 60 percent of those humans that get infected die, it's one of those you're-damned-if-you-do and you're-damned-if-you-don't situations. We must prepare for it. It's like the Katrina situation or a tsunami. You've simply got to prepare for it. And it's - these warnings out there, that it is happening - and we don't know enough about this virus to be able to make the prediction that it will not happen\u2026  WOLFF: Even if\u2026  Dr. WEBSTER: \u2026if we could.

You - I've asked you at the beginning of the segment at the beginning of the hour to write us. Send us your e-mail. They are flooding in with the issues that you think the presidential candidates - what topic should be under discussion that are not being under discussion in this election season? You know, in recent polls, asking what issues people consider most important when deciding to vote for, the economy and the war in Iraq are usually at the top of the list but there are a lot of other topics that should be discussed. What about science? There are growing number of academic scientists, business leaders and government officials, journalists, yours truly included, and organizations and several Nobel laureates, that say that science issues should be on that list. They're asking the presidential candidates to participate in a science debate called Science Debate 2008? If they were to, what issues should they be talking about? Even if they're not going to, what issues should we have Wolf Blitzer and the other folks who conducted these debates ask them to do. Give us a call, our number is 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK. And joining me now to talk about some of these issues and make a case for a science debate is David Baltimore, winner of the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. He's the new president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and he is professor of biology at CalTech in Pasadena. And he joins us today by phone from his office at CalTech. Welcome back to the program, Dr. Baltimore. Doctor DAVID BALTIMORE (President, American Association for the Advancement of Science; Biology Professor, California Institute of Technology; Winner, 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine): Hi, Ira. It's been a while. FLATOW: It's been awhile, yeah. I know that you're very vocal, you're very active in trying to get this, the debate going. If there even, if there is not - no debate, I'm sure you still believe that the candidates should be talking about science. Dr. BALTIMORE: Of course. FLATOW: And anything at the top of the list there? A short list of things that are not being talked about? Dr. BALTIMORE: Well, I think one of the things that has to be at the top of the list is the integrity of the whole process of scientific advice to the government. We have to go back to the time when scientists were respected in government and respected for their independence as well as for their, you know, laboratory expertise. And I'm looking forward to an administration that will treat science with more respect. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. 1-800-989-8255 is our number if you'd like to talk about what should be at the top of the list. In that vein, we got some mail in already. And this e-mail comes from Brian Shiro(ph). And he writes, a top issue of concern everyone is protecting our planet's environment through sound policies that curb pollution, encourage recycling. He says, personally, the issue I get most excited about is space. I haven't heard any candidate speaking seriously about how they plan to enable Bush's vision for space exploration to the moon and maybe send humans to Mars. He says he also works for NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and have many colleagues who work for the U. S. Geological Survey and NASA. The story is the same for everyone: budgets keep getting cut while more demands are placed on the scientists. If the U. S. is to compete with the rest of the world in science and technology, we must give our scientists the funding they need to do their jobs properly. David, I don't think any scientist would ever say we don't have enough money. Dr. BALTIMORE: No, of course not. But I think the people who are monitoring our planet, particularly from space, have a very good argument that they are not getting the funds that are necessary for them to do their job. I think there has been an avoidance in the present administration of providing sufficient funds for Earth monitoring. And Earth monitoring is one of the things that we can do from space particularly well and follow climate change, follow very important elements like cloud cover, like ocean temperatures, ocean activity, El Nino and whatever. And we are losing that capability as spacecraft age, and we're not replacing it with the new spacecraft that we need, which, of course, will have higher sensitivities and greater ability to give us information. FLATOW: Talking about science issues this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm talking with David Baltimore, and taking your suggestions. Let's go to the phones. To Heidi(ph) in Nashville. Hi, Heidi. HEIDI (Caller): Hi there. I have a question that's a very unpopular subject especially amongst politicians for obvious reasons. And that is the issue of population because I think it's the root of a lot of our environmental and scientific issues, is population. Nobody ever talks about sort of the elephant in the room and I just wonder what your guest have to say about that. FLATOW: David, any comment? Dr. BALTIMORE: Yeah. I'm no expert on population but it is my impression that as countries develop economically that they start - people start having fewer and fewer children for a variety of reasons. And so many countries today - developed countries - are in negative population growth. The United States is just about even if I understand correctly. And so I think your caller is correct that population has been a major driving force. We've seen huge increases in population in the last couple of decades. But I think it is in better control than in has been and if we can bring Africa and the other poor nations of the world up to a level of development, that problem will, in a sense, take care of itself. FLATOW: Let's look at some more of the mail that came in here, to our vote@gmail address. Ann Holm(ph) says the - brings up an old issue. The science issue that should be discussed by the candidates is the metric system. Remember that one. Should the U. S. convert to the metric system, it's important because of education and global trade. We talked about that in what - the late 70s, the early 80s? (Unintelligible)\u2026 Dr. BALTIMORE: Yeah, we've talk about it forever. FLATOW: It's never happened and I don't think it's going to happen very soon. Dr. BALTIMORE: There's a tremendous resistance in the general population against the - it seems like there are more important things to worry about. FLATOW: Someone else says that I'd like to see a discussion about how we treat the domestic and farm animals - on welfare of horses and other kinds of animals. We'll take some more of your e-mails and your questions on the phone. What do you think the candidates should talk about? We'll have to take a short break. We'll be right back with David Baltimore, so stay with us. We'll be right back. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking about - taking your questions, your ideas about what the presidential candidates should debate or talk about. When they talk about science issues, a lot of science issues that are never getting talked about in presidential debates that are happening. We're seeing a lot of questions talking about people suggesting climate change, stem cell research, to talk about those. If you'd like to go to our blog, I have a blog up on sciencefriday. com. You can log on there and leave your suggestion for what we should be talking about, or you could send us an e-mail at vote@gmail. com. Vote - I'm sorry, vote@sciencefriday. com, and we will get your stuff sent over the air, vote@sciencefriday. com Also, David Baltimore, what do you think stem cell research, one which is certainly, I know you know about and it certainly one of the topic of discussion here, looking at all the e-mails. Certainly, it's not gone away as an issue? Dr. BALTIMORE: No, stem cells is not going away as an issue where there still a ban on using any stem cells that were generated before August of 2001, in using - you can't use federal funds to investigate them. We really need a much more open stem cell policy. I think all of the major candidates now are in favor of that. Well, I'm treating McCain as if he is one, I guess, but McCain as well as Democratic candidates. And so I'm hopeful that we will be in a different climate and come the next administration, and there'll be freedom for scientists to operate in the stem cell area and to make their own decisions about what they want to do instead of following a said government policy. FLATOW: All right. Let me see if I can bicycle quickly through some of these questions here, and let you get - let our listeners get on the air. Barbara(ph) in Kalamazoo. Hi. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. BARBARA (Caller): Hi. Thank you, Ira. Speaking of openness, I'd like our current administration to do something, which they absolutely refuse to do and I hope the next one will address the issue of whether there really are extraterrestrials around. All the other governments of countries are talking about it. We are not and we're giving this information about things which has supposedly happened. I'd like a much more open discussion as whether there are or there not. FLATOW: All right. Let's go now to Michael(ph) in - oh, I missed him. Michael's gone, in Reading in Pennsylvania. Let's go to Bill(ph) in Berkeley. Hi, Bill. BILL (Caller): Hi, Ira. Thank you. FLATOW: Yes. BILL: On all discussions of global concerns, I'm concerned that it's almost never that people talk about the United Nations' angle of this activity or that activity or how can the U. N. support or how can we as nations with problems look to the U. N. as supportive and I think I heard you mention U. N. in some connection earlier but it's like, I think economic people and scientific people and military people all skip the possible inclusion or value of the United Nations. FLATOW: All right. BILL: And I hope you can say something relative to that. FLATOW: David, any comment on the U. N. ? Dr. BALTIMORE: I don't have any particular comment about that. FLATOW: Yeah. Well, there are U. N. science organizations that exist. BILL: Absolutely. Dr. BALTIMORE: Sure. FLATOW: Yeah. BILL: But then, I would love to see the scientists in U. N. organizations lead all of us into seeing there are U. N. -related answers to all the problems, technical, scientific, political, economic. There are U. N. -related parts of solutions that hardly ever get mentioned on programs or whatever. FLATOW: All right. Good luck. We'll see what we can do for you. Carol(ph) in St. Louis. Hi, Carol. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. CAROL (Caller): Thank you. I'd like to bring up the issue of brain development rates between boys and girls, and elementary school and secondary education and No Child Left Behind. Unfortunately, in its current form, does not take this into account. And unfortunately, early elementary years turn a lot of boys off to school, so I mean, part of the reason why college is becoming female dominant is because a lot of boys just hate school. And unfortunately, once you get into high school, girls' brain development isn't, you know, as compatible with the curriculum and so we get fewer females going into science than we would if our curricula took brain development into account. FLATOW: Good topic. David, if you want to jump in on any of these? Please, feel free. 1-800-989-8255. One interesting topic I think that we need to talk about more that we talked about here on SCIENCE FRIDAY a few weeks ago was the study by The Urban Institute that showed that contrary to what we believe about college - science and engineering graduates in colleges and doctoral candidates who are getting their PhD's, this study show that there are three times as many qualified graduates as there are jobs for them when they get out of school. And the question was, you know, why do we see so many foreign students coming in to take the jobs that these graduates are capable of taking themselves? And there was no - there was only anecdotes - the study was not created to answer that question but just to come up with a statistical basis for talking about it. And the anecdotal evidence that the researcher was willing to share was that he pointed out that somewhere along the line, these graduate students and these engineering students are not taking jobs in their fields. They're being lost in the cracks some place. And they're going into other higher paying jobs, perhaps. So if it is true that there are all of these qualified students able to take these jobs, where are they going? And I think that's something we should look into. Yeah. Dr. BALTIMORE: There is a funny disconnect between the statistical discussions of available personnel and the experience that people who are trying to hire. And I don't know what the difference is, but you've highlighted it there. FLATOW: Yeah, I mean, there's something if - let's deal with some, you know, what's the truth here are, you know? Are we putting the blame on the wrong place? We're talking about, you know, bringing graduate students out of the country in here or are we not? There was also some interesting NSF data that's out that I was reading in science - in your magazine, that talked about that foreign students are hanging around a lot longer than we think they are. They're not going back to their countries once they come over here. Dr. BALTIMORE: That is certainly my impression. We have a system of development of young people through assistant associates, full professors in universities and equivalent positions in research institutes, which is very attractive to young people from foreign countries who've come here for training and then see that we really nurture young talent, whereas back in their countries, they've got to fight to get on a rung of a ladder. And so they stay here and - the very best of them go up to our hierarchy and then they have a choice, because now they're wanted back in their country, but at a very higher level. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. BALTIMORE: And you get an offer from the Max Planck Institute in Germany. It's hard to turn down. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Hi, Debbie(ph) in Alva, Florida. Did I get that right? DEBBIE (Caller): Hi, there. Yes, you got that right. Alva, Florida. It's near North Fort Myers, so nobody's ever heard of it. But it's Thomas Alva Edison's middle name. FLATOW: Maybe he came to Florida quite a bit, didn't he? DEBBIE: He sure - he spent a lot - he slept here. (Soundbite of laughter) DEBBIE: Okay, but anyway, I was really, really concerned because I do know that Barack Obama supports - I know supported by coal, ethanol and nuclear power, and Hillary prefers renewables, which I do, too, maybe some tariff on fossil fuels and a cap and trade system. I think McCain supports nuclear, I'm not sure. But what I like to see is I like to see exactly - I like to see them talk about this, because I feel we have 10 years to turn this thing around with the global warming. And we need to get serious about things like the solar that you discussed in your other program. I was so relived to hear it so doable. FLATOW: You know, you see snippets; they've all talked about alternative energies. But they have not discussed them in a good debate. Ms. DEBBIE: Right. FLATOW: You've seen snippets on television of\u2026 Ms. DEBBIE: Right. FLATOW: \u2026you know, when they're speaking to small crowds. And I've heard Hillary and Barack and McCain - I'll share a little secret with you. I once met John McCain at a meeting, and I asked him - it was a couple of - a few years ago, why the president was on board with his carbon tax idea, and his idea of, you know, cap and trade or any of the carbon legislation he had, and he said to me, Tony Blair is working on them. MS. DEBBIE: Oh, really. FLATOW: It tells you how long ago that was. So, I mean, they're all talking. They're all talking about this stuff. And - but we don't have a long, you know, place where they can sit down and hear them discuss it in detail and that's - in one of those primary states. So\u2026 Ms. DEBBIE: Right. FLATOW: I agree with you. Dr. BALTIMORE: Yeah. I think that's one of the reasons why we need this science debate to talk about these nuances. And actually, your caller talks about a lot of different modes of alternative energy generation, and she's sort of right about everything. We need to look at everything. And whether one candidate prefers one or another, I think in the end, the important thing is that they're committed to looking for alternative energy sources and working out the details. They'll change over time as we get better and better technologies in particular for capturing solar. FLATOW: And the AAAS has recently signed on to the Science Debate 2008. Dr. BALTIMORE: Yes, the AAAS is a formal sponsor of the debate now. And let me get AAAS another plug here. If you want to know what the candidates' positions are on a range of science issues, if they have any position, then you can look on a website that AAAS run called election2008. aaas. org. And they're trying to keep up-to-date on the positions of the individual candidates. Of course, there are fewer candidates now. This is being done in association with the American - the association of American universities and supported by the Lounsbury Foundation. FLATOW: Good point there. That is a terrific site. Let's go to Jay(ph) in Maryland. Hi, Jay. Mr. JAY (Caller): Hi. I want to talk about something that has been discussed a little bit on the debates and that has been the focal point of the current administration - that's electronic medical records. Most of the physician community agree that electronic medical records would be a great boon to general medical practice. But the difficulty seems to be that there's a tremendous amount of balkanization(ph) in the creation of these records and a tremendous amount of resistance on the part of private physicians to use electronic medical record systems that are compatible so that records can be moved from physician to physician and so the information can be shared between specialists and general practice physicians in the hospitals. And the difficulty that seems to be the case here is that there's a great deal of requirement for standardization and government action in this arena, but not a great deal of incentive to do that because of the effects that it might have on the general medical business and general health care business in the United States. I wonder what kind of solutions you think would be appropriate and, you know, there is an interesting proposal on the floor of the house now for independent health record trust which would actually create independent businesses to keep medical records across these different health care providers. But it's getting very little attention from either the Democrats or the Republicans. FLATOW: Well, you gave it some attention today. Dr. BALTIMORE: Right. FLATOW: I would think that if - somewhere along the line, there's going to be some sort of medical legislation happening, and maybe this will become part of it. But medical records are certainly an issue when - and the privacy records are certainly the issue, an issue that we have been talking about, and I think you can see reflected that you, the public, think is very important. We're talking about what questions to ask the presidential candidates this hour in TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR News, talking with David Baltimore about these issues. David, you have been watching these things for decades and\u2026 Dr. BALTIMORE: Yes. FLATOW: You see any difference in the tenor? I know you said that at the top of your issue was - at the top of your list was to get science reforms in government policy. Some people say that this has been going on for years. Do you think it's been worst in the last seven years than before? Dr. BALTIMORE: I do think it's been worst in the last seven years. There's no question that it has gone on before. And that doesn't make it any better. But we seen a quantum leap in the attempt to control the kind of information that government scientist can provide to the population. And we really need to take off that model. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Let's see if we can get a caller, two more in here. Let's go to Brian(ph) in Jacksonville. Hi, Brian. BRIAN (Caller): Hi, how's it going? FLATOW: Hi there. Dr. BALTIMORE: Very nice. BRIAN: I was wondering - this might seem a little bit far off in the future when this problem will come about, but I noticed nobody really discusses the need for deep space migration and the fact that our sun will eventually die and with it, all of our future generations. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. So\u2026 BRIAN: And, you know, there have been programs, like, since the '60s and '70s, I think, Timothy Leary may have been trying to figure a way off the planet, but we'll eventually have to learn how to plan that up. And to get from this planet to the next, with possible a younger star that, as (unintelligible) heat source, but ours is going to die. And what are we going to do about it? I know, you know, maybe a 150 billion years or something like that\u2026 FLATOW: Well, it's not too early to wait. It could happen, though, for a different reason, a lot sooner than that, yeah. BRIAN: Right. FLATOW: We could just use the place up. There are people who suggest that we need to move because we're using up the - we're using up the planet, so to speak. BRIAN: Yeah. And I think they originally found a planet that, that seems to be kind of sustainable like we are. Another bluish planet somewhere off in the distance. FLATOW: Well, what doomsday scenario I worry more about is a rock hitting us, you know? BRIAN: Yeah, that's another one. (Unintelligible) FLATOW: The one that's got our name on it that we're not seeing, you know? BRIAN: I'm sorry? FLATOW: David, you know, that - looking for that rock. Dr. BALTIMORE: Well, we are looking for them. And again, we could be funding research in that area more effectively than we are so that we have a little more sense of confidence that there isn't something lurking out there. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. BALTIMORE: But I'm not particularly concerned about the sun giving out. That's billions of years off. And we've got to worry about renewable energy sources right now. The sun will be there for the next billions of years, providing all the energy that the earth needs. We just have to figure out how to capture it. FLATOW: And I think this election in particular offers a unique opportunity to talk about some of these issues. Dr. BALTIMORE: It does. And I think - when you say unique, you're right. Presidential elections in previous times have never had the kind of urgency of science issues that we have today, particularly with the renewable energy issues at the top of the list. And so I think there's every reason why we should be behaving differently in this campaign and taking science more into our discussions. FLATOW: Well, David, I want to thank you, as always. You're always been very eager and helpful to take time to talk with us. Dr. BALTIMORE: Good. I love the opportunity. FLATOW: You're welcome. Have a good weekend. And we'll keep watching about the Science Debate 2008. Dr. BALTIMORE: All right. We'll see everybody, I hope, at the AAAS meeting in Boston. FLATOW: We'll be there. We'll be broadcasting live from the AAAS meeting as we do every year in Boston in a couple of weeks. Dr. BALTIMORE: Okay. FLATOW: David Baltimore, winner of the 1975 Nobel Prize, president of the American Association for Advancement of Science, and professor of biology at Caltech in Pasadena.

Even if they're not going to, what issues should we have Wolf Blitzer and the other folks who conducted these debates ask them to do.  Give us a call, our number is 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK.  And joining me now to talk about some of these issues and make a case for a science debate is David Baltimore, winner of the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. He's the new president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and he is professor of biology at CalTech in Pasadena. And he joins us today by phone from his office at CalTech.  Welcome back to the program, Dr. Baltimore.  Doctor DAVID BALTIMORE (President, American Association for the Advancement of Science; Biology Professor, California Institute of Technology; Winner, 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine): Hi, Ira. It's been a while.  FLATOW: It's been awhile, yeah. I know that you're very vocal, you're very active in trying to get this, the debate going. If there even, if there is not - no debate, I'm sure you still believe that the candidates should be talking about science.  Dr. BALTIMORE: Of course.  FLATOW: And anything at the top of the list there? A short list of things that are not being talked about?  Dr. BALTIMORE: Well, I think one of the things that has to be at the top of the list is the integrity of the whole process of scientific advice to the government. We have to go back to the time when scientists were respected in government and respected for their independence as well as for their, you know, laboratory expertise. And I'm looking forward to an administration that will treat science with more respect.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. 1-800-989-8255 is our number if you'd like to talk about what should be at the top of the list.  In that vein, we got some mail in already. And this e-mail comes from Brian Shiro(ph). And he writes, a top issue of concern everyone is protecting our planet's environment through sound policies that curb pollution, encourage recycling. He says, personally, the issue I get most excited about is space. I haven't heard any candidate speaking seriously about how they plan to enable Bush's vision for space exploration to the moon and maybe send humans to Mars. He says he also works for NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and have many colleagues who work for the U. S. Geological Survey and NASA. The story is the same for everyone: budgets keep getting cut while more demands are placed on the scientists. If the U. S. is to compete with the rest of the world in science and technology, we must give our scientists the funding they need to do their jobs properly.  David, I don't think any scientist would ever say we don't have enough money.  Dr. BALTIMORE: No, of course not. But I think the people who are monitoring our planet, particularly from space, have a very good argument that they are not getting the funds that are necessary for them to do their job. I think there has been an avoidance in the present administration of providing sufficient funds for Earth monitoring. And Earth monitoring is one of the things that we can do from space particularly well and follow climate change, follow very important elements like cloud cover, like ocean temperatures, ocean activity, El Nino and whatever. And we are losing that capability as spacecraft age, and we're not replacing it with the new spacecraft that we need, which, of course, will have higher sensitivities and greater ability to give us information.  FLATOW: Talking about science issues this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  I'm talking with David Baltimore, and taking your suggestions. Let's go to the phones. To Heidi(ph) in Nashville.  Hi, Heidi.  HEIDI (Caller): Hi there. I have a question that's a very unpopular subject especially amongst politicians for obvious reasons. And that is the issue of population because I think it's the root of a lot of our environmental and scientific issues, is population. Nobody ever talks about sort of the elephant in the room and I just wonder what your guest have to say about that.  FLATOW: David, any comment?  Dr. BALTIMORE: Yeah. I'm no expert on population but it is my impression that as countries develop economically that they start - people start having fewer and fewer children for a variety of reasons. And so many countries today - developed countries - are in negative population growth. The United States is just about even if I understand correctly. And so I think your caller is correct that population has been a major driving force. We've seen huge increases in population in the last couple of decades. But I think it is in better control than in has been and if we can bring Africa and the other poor nations of the world up to a level of development, that problem will, in a sense, take care of itself.  FLATOW: Let's look at some more of the mail that came in here, to our vote@gmail address.  Ann Holm(ph) says the - brings up an old issue. The science issue that should be discussed by the candidates is the metric system. Remember that one. Should the U. S. convert to the metric system, it's important because of education and global trade. We talked about that in what - the late 70s, the early 80s? (Unintelligible)\u2026  Dr. BALTIMORE: Yeah, we've talk about it forever.  FLATOW: It's never happened and I don't think it's going to happen very soon.  Dr. BALTIMORE: There's a tremendous resistance in the general population against the - it seems like there are more important things to worry about.  FLATOW: Someone else says that I'd like to see a discussion about how we treat the domestic and farm animals - on welfare of horses and other kinds of animals.  We'll take some more of your e-mails and your questions on the phone. What do you think the candidates should talk about? We'll have to take a short break. We'll be right back with David Baltimore, so stay with us. We'll be right back.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  We're talking about - taking your questions, your ideas about what the presidential candidates should debate or talk about. When they talk about science issues, a lot of science issues that are never getting talked about in presidential debates that are happening. We're seeing a lot of questions talking about people suggesting climate change, stem cell research, to talk about those.  If you'd like to go to our blog, I have a blog up on sciencefriday. com. You can log on there and leave your suggestion for what we should be talking about, or you could send us an e-mail at vote@gmail. com. Vote - I'm sorry, vote@sciencefriday. com, and we will get your stuff sent over the air, vote@sciencefriday. com  Also, David Baltimore, what do you think stem cell research, one which is certainly, I know you know about and it certainly one of the topic of discussion here, looking at all the e-mails. Certainly, it's not gone away as an issue?  Dr. BALTIMORE: No, stem cells is not going away as an issue where there still a ban on using any stem cells that were generated before August of 2001, in using - you can't use federal funds to investigate them. We really need a much more open stem cell policy. I think all of the major candidates now are in favor of that. Well, I'm treating McCain as if he is one, I guess, but McCain as well as Democratic candidates.  And so I'm hopeful that we will be in a different climate and come the next administration, and there'll be freedom for scientists to operate in the stem cell area and to make their own decisions about what they want to do instead of following a said government policy.  FLATOW: All right. Let me see if I can bicycle quickly through some of these questions here, and let you get - let our listeners get on the air.  Barbara(ph) in Kalamazoo. Hi. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  BARBARA (Caller): Hi. Thank you, Ira. Speaking of openness, I'd like our current administration to do something, which they absolutely refuse to do and I hope the next one will address the issue of whether there really are extraterrestrials around. All the other governments of countries are talking about it. We are not and we're giving this information about things which has supposedly happened. I'd like a much more open discussion as whether there are or there not.  FLATOW: All right. Let's go now to Michael(ph) in - oh, I missed him. Michael's gone, in Reading in Pennsylvania. Let's go to Bill(ph) in Berkeley.  Hi, Bill.  BILL (Caller): Hi, Ira. Thank you.  FLATOW: Yes.  BILL: On all discussions of global concerns, I'm concerned that it's almost never that people talk about the United Nations' angle of this activity or that activity or how can the U. N. support or how can we as nations with problems look to the U. N. as supportive and I think I heard you mention U. N. in some connection earlier but it's like, I think economic people and scientific people and military people all skip the possible inclusion or value of the United Nations.  FLATOW: All right.  BILL: And I hope you can say something relative to that.  FLATOW: David, any comment on the U. N. ?  Dr. BALTIMORE: I don't have any particular comment about that.  FLATOW: Yeah. Well, there are U. N. science organizations that exist.  BILL: Absolutely.  Dr. BALTIMORE: Sure.  FLATOW: Yeah.  BILL: But then, I would love to see the scientists in U. N. organizations lead all of us into seeing there are U. N. -related answers to all the problems, technical, scientific, political, economic. There are U. N. -related parts of solutions that hardly ever get mentioned on programs or whatever.  FLATOW: All right. Good luck. We'll see what we can do for you.  Carol(ph) in St. Louis. Hi, Carol. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  CAROL (Caller): Thank you. I'd like to bring up the issue of brain development rates between boys and girls, and elementary school and secondary education and No Child Left Behind. Unfortunately, in its current form, does not take this into account. And unfortunately, early elementary years turn a lot of boys off to school, so I mean, part of the reason why college is becoming female dominant is because a lot of boys just hate school. And unfortunately, once you get into high school, girls' brain development isn't, you know, as compatible with the curriculum and so we get fewer females going into science than we would if our curricula took brain development into account.  FLATOW: Good topic.  David, if you want to jump in on any of these? Please, feel free.  1-800-989-8255.  One interesting topic I think that we need to talk about more that we talked about here on SCIENCE FRIDAY a few weeks ago was the study by The Urban Institute that showed that contrary to what we believe about college - science and engineering graduates in colleges and doctoral candidates who are getting their PhD's, this study show that there are three times as many qualified graduates as there are jobs for them when they get out of school. And the question was, you know, why do we see so many foreign students coming in to take the jobs that these graduates are capable of taking themselves?  And there was no - there was only anecdotes - the study was not created to answer that question but just to come up with a statistical basis for talking about it. And the anecdotal evidence that the researcher was willing to share was that he pointed out that somewhere along the line, these graduate students and these engineering students are not taking jobs in their fields. They're being lost in the cracks some place. And they're going into other higher paying jobs, perhaps. So if it is true that there are all of these qualified students able to take these jobs, where are they going? And I think that's something we should look into. Yeah.  Dr. BALTIMORE: There is a funny disconnect between the statistical discussions of available personnel and the experience that people who are trying to hire. And I don't know what the difference is, but you've highlighted it there.  FLATOW: Yeah, I mean, there's something if - let's deal with some, you know, what's the truth here are, you know? Are we putting the blame on the wrong place? We're talking about, you know, bringing graduate students out of the country in here or are we not? There was also some interesting NSF data that's out that I was reading in science - in your magazine, that talked about that foreign students are hanging around a lot longer than we think they are. They're not going back to their countries once they come over here.  Dr. BALTIMORE: That is certainly my impression. We have a system of development of young people through assistant associates, full professors in universities and equivalent positions in research institutes, which is very attractive to young people from foreign countries who've come here for training and then see that we really nurture young talent, whereas back in their countries, they've got to fight to get on a rung of a ladder. And so they stay here and - the very best of them go up to our hierarchy and then they have a choice, because now they're wanted back in their country, but at a very higher level.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. BALTIMORE: And you get an offer from the Max Planck Institute in Germany. It's hard to turn down.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255.  Hi, Debbie(ph) in Alva, Florida. Did I get that right?  DEBBIE (Caller): Hi, there. Yes, you got that right. Alva, Florida. It's near North Fort Myers, so nobody's ever heard of it. But it's Thomas Alva Edison's middle name.  FLATOW: Maybe he came to Florida quite a bit, didn't he?  DEBBIE: He sure - he spent a lot - he slept here.  (Soundbite of laughter)  DEBBIE: Okay, but anyway, I was really, really concerned because I do know that Barack Obama supports - I know supported by coal, ethanol and nuclear power, and Hillary prefers renewables, which I do, too, maybe some tariff on fossil fuels and a cap and trade system. I think McCain supports nuclear, I'm not sure. But what I like to see is I like to see exactly - I like to see them talk about this, because I feel we have 10 years to turn this thing around with the global warming. And we need to get serious about things like the solar that you discussed in your other program. I was so relived to hear it so doable.  FLATOW: You know, you see snippets; they've all talked about alternative energies. But they have not discussed them in a good debate.  Ms. DEBBIE: Right.  FLATOW: You've seen snippets on television of\u2026  Ms. DEBBIE: Right.  FLATOW: \u2026you know, when they're speaking to small crowds. And I've heard Hillary and Barack and McCain - I'll share a little secret with you. I once met John McCain at a meeting, and I asked him - it was a couple of - a few years ago, why the president was on board with his carbon tax idea, and his idea of, you know, cap and trade or any of the carbon legislation he had, and he said to me, Tony Blair is working on them.  MS. DEBBIE: Oh, really.  FLATOW: It tells you how long ago that was. So, I mean, they're all talking. They're all talking about this stuff. And - but we don't have a long, you know, place where they can sit down and hear them discuss it in detail and that's - in one of those primary states. So\u2026  Ms. DEBBIE: Right.  FLATOW: I agree with you.  Dr. BALTIMORE: Yeah. I think that's one of the reasons why we need this science debate to talk about these nuances. And actually, your caller talks about a lot of different modes of alternative energy generation, and she's sort of right about everything. We need to look at everything. And whether one candidate prefers one or another, I think in the end, the important thing is that they're committed to looking for alternative energy sources and working out the details. They'll change over time as we get better and better technologies in particular for capturing solar.  FLATOW: And the AAAS has recently signed on to the Science Debate 2008.  Dr. BALTIMORE: Yes, the AAAS is a formal sponsor of the debate now. And let me get AAAS another plug here. If you want to know what the candidates' positions are on a range of science issues, if they have any position, then you can look on a website that AAAS run called election2008. aaas. org. And they're trying to keep up-to-date on the positions of the individual candidates. Of course, there are fewer candidates now. This is being done in association with the American - the association of American universities and supported by the Lounsbury Foundation.  FLATOW: Good point there. That is a terrific site.  Let's go to Jay(ph) in Maryland. Hi, Jay.  Mr. JAY (Caller): Hi. I want to talk about something that has been discussed a little bit on the debates and that has been the focal point of the current administration - that's electronic medical records. Most of the physician community agree that electronic medical records would be a great boon to general medical practice. But the difficulty seems to be that there's a tremendous amount of balkanization(ph) in the creation of these records and a tremendous amount of resistance on the part of private physicians to use electronic medical record systems that are compatible so that records can be moved from physician to physician and so the information can be shared between specialists and general practice physicians in the hospitals.  And the difficulty that seems to be the case here is that there's a great deal of requirement for standardization and government action in this arena, but not a great deal of incentive to do that because of the effects that it might have on the general medical business and general health care business in the United States. I wonder what kind of solutions you think would be appropriate and, you know, there is an interesting proposal on the floor of the house now for independent health record trust which would actually create independent businesses to keep medical records across these different health care providers. But it's getting very little attention from either the Democrats or the Republicans.  FLATOW: Well, you gave it some attention today.  Dr. BALTIMORE: Right.  FLATOW: I would think that if - somewhere along the line, there's going to be some sort of medical legislation happening, and maybe this will become part of it. But medical records are certainly an issue when - and the privacy records are certainly the issue, an issue that we have been talking about, and I think you can see reflected that you, the public, think is very important.  We're talking about what questions to ask the presidential candidates this hour in TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR News, talking with David Baltimore about these issues. David, you have been watching these things for decades and\u2026  Dr. BALTIMORE: Yes.  FLATOW: You see any difference in the tenor? I know you said that at the top of your issue was - at the top of your list was to get science reforms in government policy. Some people say that this has been going on for years. Do you think it's been worst in the last seven years than before?  Dr. BALTIMORE: I do think it's been worst in the last seven years. There's no question that it has gone on before. And that doesn't make it any better. But we seen a quantum leap in the attempt to control the kind of information that government scientist can provide to the population. And we really need to take off that model.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Let's see if we can get a caller, two more in here. Let's go to Brian(ph) in Jacksonville. Hi, Brian.  BRIAN (Caller): Hi, how's it going?  FLATOW: Hi there.  Dr. BALTIMORE: Very nice.  BRIAN: I was wondering - this might seem a little bit far off in the future when this problem will come about, but I noticed nobody really discusses the need for deep space migration and the fact that our sun will eventually die and with it, all of our future generations.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. So\u2026  BRIAN: And, you know, there have been programs, like, since the '60s and '70s, I think, Timothy Leary may have been trying to figure a way off the planet, but we'll eventually have to learn how to plan that up. And to get from this planet to the next, with possible a younger star that, as (unintelligible) heat source, but ours is going to die. And what are we going to do about it? I know, you know, maybe a 150 billion years or something like that\u2026  FLATOW: Well, it's not too early to wait. It could happen, though, for a different reason, a lot sooner than that, yeah.  BRIAN: Right.  FLATOW: We could just use the place up. There are people who suggest that we need to move because we're using up the - we're using up the planet, so to speak.  BRIAN: Yeah. And I think they originally found a planet that, that seems to be kind of sustainable like we are. Another bluish planet somewhere off in the distance.  FLATOW: Well, what doomsday scenario I worry more about is a rock hitting us, you know?  BRIAN: Yeah, that's another one. (Unintelligible)  FLATOW: The one that's got our name on it that we're not seeing, you know?  BRIAN: I'm sorry?  FLATOW: David, you know, that - looking for that rock.  Dr. BALTIMORE: Well, we are looking for them. And again, we could be funding research in that area more effectively than we are so that we have a little more sense of confidence that there isn't something lurking out there.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. BALTIMORE: But I'm not particularly concerned about the sun giving out. That's billions of years off. And we've got to worry about renewable energy sources right now. The sun will be there for the next billions of years, providing all the energy that the earth needs. We just have to figure out how to capture it.  FLATOW: And I think this election in particular offers a unique opportunity to talk about some of these issues.  Dr. BALTIMORE: It does. And I think - when you say unique, you're right. Presidential elections in previous times have never had the kind of urgency of science issues that we have today, particularly with the renewable energy issues at the top of the list. And so I think there's every reason why we should be behaving differently in this campaign and taking science more into our discussions.  FLATOW: Well, David, I want to thank you, as always. You're always been very eager and helpful to take time to talk with us.  Dr. BALTIMORE: Good. I love the opportunity.  FLATOW: You're welcome. Have a good weekend. And we'll keep watching about the Science Debate 2008.  Dr. BALTIMORE: All right. We'll see everybody, I hope, at the AAAS meeting in Boston.  FLATOW: We'll be there. We'll be broadcasting live from the AAAS meeting as we do every year in Boston in a couple of weeks.  Dr. BALTIMORE: Okay.  FLATOW: David Baltimore, winner of the 1975 Nobel Prize, president of the American Association for Advancement of Science, and professor of biology at Caltech in Pasadena.

I'm Ira Flatow. We're now talking about those powerful storms that moved across the U. S. - southern U. S. , bringing several destructive tornadoes that resulted in over 50 deaths. They say that they are - were over 100, not confirmed, but reported, 100 reported tornadoes. Don't we think - is this just me, or do we not think of tornadoes, being a hundred of them in the tornado season in the dead of summer, not in the dead of winter. This is February, not August. How unusual is this? And to be so powerful as some of them were? Joining me now is Pam Knox, she's the assistant state climatologist for the state of Georgia and a researcher at the University of Georgia in Athens. Georgia was under a tornado watch this week after a tornado strike in Mississippi, in Arkansas, in Tennessee, in Kentucky and Alabama. And the state actually had to postpone a scheduled tornado drill this week because of the real potential for severe weather and tornadoes. Pam Knox, welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Dr. PAM KNOX (State Climatologist, Georgia): Thank you. It's good to be back. FLATOW: I think we have to tell our listeners in the spirit of full disclosure that before the turn of the century, you're an intern at SCIENCE FRIDAY. Dr. KNOX: I was, back in 1998. FLATOW: Wow, that was awhile. But - I didn't think, you know, get - so any alumni at SCIENCE FRIDAY could go so far. Dr. KNOX: Hey, you'll never know. FLATOW: Am I wrong in thinking this is unusual to have these many and such intense tornadoes in middle of the winter? Dr. KNOX: Well, it's not really the middle of the winter down in Georgia, you know? It's - in Georgia, we're probably past winter and now into early spring. In fact, you can look around and see crocuses blooming and daffodils and things like that. For those of the listeners who are from the farther north parts of the country, the most active tornado time of the year is really more April and May. But down here in Georgia, we can actually have tornadoes any time of the year, although usually not in this kind of quantity. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And so why do we think that there have been so many and that kind of quantity? Dr. KNOX: So the weather situation for this outbreak was just perfect. In fact, they had predicted a severe weather outbreak, up to five days ahead of time which is really unusual. And they put out forecasts well in advance. That's not the only time in history that we've had big outbreaks like this in the southeast. If you go back as far as 1884, there was another huge outbreak just a little further to the east. A lot of those tornadoes were in Georgia, and over 100 people were killed in that outbreak as well. So February tornadoes are a little bit more rare than, you know, later in the season for even Georgia, but certainly not the most rare time of the year for us down south. FLATOW: So you're not willing to say that perhaps global warming had something to do with the intensity or the number of tornadoes? Dr. KNOX: No, I don't really think that's true. I think it would be more likely that you could link it to the current La Nina that we're under, because we do know that in certain situations, La Nina can cause an increase to the number of tornadoes. But really, for this outbreak to occur, we had to have all the ingredients in just the right place. FLATOW: And this week's weather interrupted a tornado drill in your state. Dr. KNOX: That's right. We're under a severe weather awareness week in Georgia this week. And usually, that week in Wednesday, they have a tornado drill. And because of the potential for a severe weather on Wednesday morning, they had to reschedule that to this morning. And of course, today was perfectly sunny and nice and no worries about severe weather at all. FLATOW: Any portents for the upcoming summer from this kind of season beginning this way? Dr. KNOX: Well, tornado outbreaks like this are so rare it's really hard to use them to make any predictions. It could be an active season, though, and I think that'll be really interesting to watch. FLATOW: I want to thank you, Pam, for taking time to be with us. Dr. KNOX: It's a pleasure to be with you again.

And of course, today was perfectly sunny and nice and no worries about severe weather at all.  FLATOW: Any portents for the upcoming summer from this kind of season beginning this way?  Dr. KNOX: Well, tornado outbreaks like this are so rare it's really hard to use them to make any predictions. It could be an active season, though, and I think that'll be really interesting to watch.  FLATOW: I want to thank you, Pam, for taking time to be with us.  Dr. KNOX: It's a pleasure to be with you again.  FLATOW: Dr. Pam Knox, who is assistant state climatologist for the state of Georgia and a researcher at the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia.

I'm Ira Flatow. A little bit later in the hour, carbon electronics, tornadoes and getting your head wrapped around a trillion, how big is a trillion? But first, how many times have you found your cell phone, your iPod, your BlackBerry on its last few minutes of juice? No place to plug it in. Maybe you're out in the middle of a forest, some place or on a hike or even in your car. Now, imagine being able to supply that charge with energy from your own body, simply by walking. That's the idea behind a new energy-harvesting device unveiled this week in the journal Science. It's a little generator mounted on a knee brace that captures energy that's usually wasted when you walk. For you drivers of hybrid cars, well, it's like the same kind of concept as regenerative braking where your car captures energy that's usually wasted when you put on the brakes. Researchers still need to figure out how to store that energy or how to hook up to the device that needs charging. But once they do, they say their energy harvester could power more than personal electronics. It could be used to power portable medical devices, soldiers' instruments or even basic laptops in places far from traditional energy sources. And joining me now to talk about this invention, how it works and its potential applications is my guest Max Donelan, chief science officer at Bionic Power. He's the director of the locomotion laboratory at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia. He joins us today from his office. Welcome to Science Friday. Dr. MAX DONELAN (Chief Science Officer, Bionic Power; Director of Locomotion Laboratory, Simon Fraser University): Thanks very much, Ira. FLATOW: How do you get - don't you have to put work in to get work out? Dr. DONELAN: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, we're not violating any laws of thermodynamics. But the basic idea is that walking is inherently uneconomical. And so, when you're walking along, it's a bit like stop and go driving where the muscles of the body, even within a stride, are constantly accelerating and then decelerating your body. And hybrid electric cars take advantage of that stop and go driving that whenever you normally push on the brakes, you instead now brake with a generator. And that generator takes the energy that's in the car and turns it into electricity, unlike a traditional car which takes the energy in the car and just dissipates it as heat. So we took to the same sort of thing, but for walking, so that when the muscles at the knee are decelerating the leg, we help those muscles in doing the deceleration using a generator, and the generator, at the same time, produces electricity. FLATOW: So there's a period in your leg where you are decelerating, where you're not putting out the energy but trying to stop from walking. Dr. DONELAN: Yeah. Well, there's actually more than one period. If you just think about the body as sort of an arbitrary mechanical system, then if you're walking at a constant speed on the level, then you have no net change in your kinetic energy and you have no net change in your potential energy. So that means you have to have an equal amount of positive work that accelerates or lifts your body and negative work that slows down or lowers your body. And so - and all that positive work comes from muscles, and most of that negative work comes from muscles as well. So the muscles - the main part of their job is to, you know, a coordinated way slow your body down periodically and take the energy that it put in and take it away and dissipated as heat. And that happens on the level at a constant speed, but it may be easier to understand if you think about walking down a hill where the main job of your muscles in that case are to make sure you don't reach the bottom at the speed that gravity wants you to. FLATOW: Is there one muscle more than the other that you used for that? Dr. DONELAN: Yeah. In our case, we're targeting the muscles that cross the knee. And so in this case, it's the hamstring muscles, the ones that run down the back of your leg. And towards the end of the swing phase, which is when, you know, you take your foot from a backwards position, swing it forward to being another step. Towards the end there, those muscles turn on and their job is to slow down the extension of the knee. And if you - I mean, your muscle is doing it in normal walking but it could be done by something else, and in our case, it's a generator. And so the generator - part of the trick with this device - is to know when that phase occurs and engage the generator only at that time assisting the muscles in doing their - and slowing the leg down while generating electricity. And then once that phase is over, it disengages and tries to get out of the way of the muscles for the rest of the stride. FLATOW: So is there some sort of accelerometer on it to know when things are changing or changing direction? Dr. DONELAN: Yeah, there is. In our case, the sensor that we - that is described in this paper is just a simple potentiometer that measures knee angle. And then that signal sent back to a computer that runs a real time control system that senses the knee angle a thousand times a second. And it uses that signal to determine where in the gait cycle you are, where in the walking cycle you are. And when it determines that this is the right phase in which the hamstring muscles are normally dissipating that energy and engages the generator and then disengages it once it thinks that that period is over. And by engaging and disengaging the generator, what I mean is that it actually just opens and closes a switch between the circuit that allows it to generate power. And so whenever the knee's extending, it's always swinging the gear - it's always moving the gears and the generator. But only at that one period does the control system allow the generator to generate power. And now the consequence is a much bigger - well, there's a big back electromagnetic force that provides resistance to the knee, which is a consequence of allowing current to flow in that circuit. FLATOW: So how does it feel to wear one? Dr. DONELAN: Well, so if you compare normal walking without the device to walking with the device on so that you have the mass on or anything but it's not generating electricity, then you certainly know it's there. And, you know, it weighs about three pounds on each leg and you feel that mass. It's not super comfortable at this stage, but we do have people walking for four hours at a time. And the, you know, that mass is - the reason for - part of the reason for that heavy mass is because it's designed for a convenient experimentation that we pull gears\u2026 FLATOW: I see. Dr. DONELAN: \u2026in and out of the generator, in and out and so on. But one of the interesting things is if you ask many of the subjects how it feels, if they have it on and they're walking and they have the weight on but it's not generating any electricity, and they do that for, say, let's say 10 minutes. And then without telling them, you engage the control system, so now it's being smart and engaging the generator at the right time, they don't know that we've turned it on. So they've started to generate electricity without realizing it. Until we take it away and then they miss it. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: They miss it. Dr. DONELAN: And so what happens is is when you take it away, now they've actually, immediately start to swing their leg a little faster than they'd like to because the muscles that normally cause that deceleration have decreased their activity a little bit. In fact, we can measure that they've decreased their activity. And so it takes them, you know, three to 10 strides to readjust and increase the activity again back to normal so that their extension of their knee is more controlled. FLATOW: And so how much electricity can you get out of one of these? And can you just store them up - store the electricity up in a battery that you might use later for your laptop or something? Dr. DONELAN: Yeah. Right now, we don't store it in a battery, we're just dissipate it into resistors so we can measure it. And to store it in a battery, you know, we really need to hear from those who want to use this technology what sort of battery they want it in and how they want the power. But to give you some context about the amount of power, I think it's helpful to use the cell phone example. So in this mode where there's no additional increase in your effort to generate this electricity, we get about five watts total between the two legs. And five watts is enough to give you 10 minutes of talk time on a cell phone for one minute of walking. So a typical cell phone consumes about 500 milliwatts when you're using it, so 10 cell phones at the same time. And then there's a second mode where there is if you walk a bit faster and you allow for a moderate increase in your effort, you can get as much as 13 watts. And 13 watts will give you half an hour of talk time for one minute of walking. Now, I don't imagine in the near future that people are going to use their - use this device to charge their cell phones. But it just helps give some context about what sort of power we're talking about. FLATOW: What would they use the device for then? Dr. DONELAN: Well, I think the people who would really be interested in it are the people whose lives depend upon portable power. So, on the medical side of things, people who use power prosthetic limbs or powered orthoses. Orthoses are devices that help people walk after they're recovering from stroke or spinal cord injury. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. DONELAN: And these are basically robotic limbs these days, like the new - the future and the current cutting edge prosthetic limbs and orthoses are really these wearable robots. And incredible devices, but they require battery power. So if you could use this basic principle to help charge these devices, they could walk longer and further and faster. And there's also another kind of more subtle point. And it's not just about battery life. It's also about enabling new technologies that wouldn't normally be possible because of the constraints of batteries. Just like your desktop is more powerful than your BlackBerry, you know, medical devices have the same sort of limitations that the kind of devices you can get working in the lab aren't necessarily the devices that people are going to wear around. So that's one group that, you know, whose lives depend upon portable power. And if you think further into the future, this idea of going about energy harvesting, about joints and about taking advantage of the inherent economical nature of walking, it could also be implied - applied to a fully implantable device, to charge implanted medical devices like drug pumps and neuro-prostheses. Another group that depends critically on power is the military. Soldiers today treat batteries like they treat food and water. So they need it to power navigation and communication. Those things allow them to talk to each other and allow them to get back to base safely. And to do so, they can carry as much as 13 kilograms of batteries. Well, that's about 30 pounds for a 24-hour mission. So you can substantially lighten their load and power their devices by harnessing energy from their motion. FLATOW: Yeah. And if you've go - get in a situation where you've run out of batteries, you could\u2026 Dr. DONELAN: Exactly. I mean, in this case, it's - it's not exactly a wearable battery because, in our case, the battery is the person, right? FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. DONELAN: And you can think of least or as much energy in fat as a thousand kilogram battery. And - or another way to say that is that there's as much energy, chemical energy in a 35 gram granola bar as a 3. 5 kilogram of a lithium ion battery. So - I'm sorry for the metric. FLATOW: Well, listen, if you can start getting power out of fat, now we're talking. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. DONELAN: Yeah. Well, I mean, in the mode where I mention that it increases your effort a little bit. That's basically what's happening, right\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. DONELAN: \u2026is it's coming from your fat stores. In the mode where it doesn't increase your effort, then it's not like exercise at all. And you can imagine that would be really beneficial for the medical uses, where you don't want to make walking any harder. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. DONELAN: You want to make it easier, if you could. FLATOW: Well, Max, I want to thank you for taking time to talk with us. And good luck to you. We'll be following your progress. Dr. DONELAN: Oh, it's absolutely my pleasure, Ira. FLATOW: You're welcome. Max Donelan is chief science officer at bionic power. He's the director of the locomotion laboratory at Simon and Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia.

This past week a team of researchers announced that they've captured the excess energy generated by walking by strapping on a specialized three-and-a-half pound knee brace, then storing that energy in a battery. The battery can power all those electronic gadgets that seem to be taking over our lives. Professor ART KUO (University of Michigan): You can walk for one minute to get ten minutes of talk time for a current (unintelligible) cell phone. SEABROOK: That's Art Kuo. He's an associate professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan and he's one of the inventors. I asked him what this contraption looks like. Prof. KUO: It doesn't look too different from an athletic knee brace or something that you would wear after a knee injury. But what's different about it is that it has a small device added onto it that takes motion of the knee and it transforms that into electrical power. SEABROOK: What is going with walking that generates the energy? Prof. KUO: Well, there's all this motion going on and it would be easy to use as you drive a generator. But I think what's different about our device is that were looking for a point in walking where there's energy that's just being wasted. We found the best place so far to steal energy from the person is near the end of what we call the swing phase of walking, when one leg is off the ground and your knee is extending. There's a point where you're actually breaking the knee, you're slowing it down right before your foot hits the ground. SEABROOK: Okay. Hold on. I see. I think I see that. I'm trying to do it here. Okay, so you've picked your foot off the ground, picked up your foot, you've moved it forward to make a step but it's sort of in that moment before it's fully extended to take a step. Prof. KUO: Yes. And you may feel your hamstring pulling. That's the muscle that slows down your knee. SEABROOK: Wow. So does it work to put the brace on and, like, go shopping in the mall or stroll around? Or do you have to be constantly moving, sort of with purpose walking? Prof. KUO: It definitely works best when you're walking purposefully. But I would say that our current problem is that all we've done is produced a prototype, which is a proof of concept. And there's still a lot of development to be done to reduce the weight and the size, make it comfortable to wear, and then it's something that someone might not mind wearing while they're walking around. SEABROOK: What do you think this will be good for? I mean, these days we're all talking about having little solar panels to charge our cell phones and iPods. What do you envision this being used for? Prof. KUO: In the Western world it's true. Even though it is a hassle to deal with the battery in your cell phone, you don't mind carrying it around and you are able to charge it. But a quarter of the world's population actually does not have ready access to electricity. And for them battery power is part of their livelihood. And the military also, your typical soldier carries many pounds of batteries and their livelihood depends on batteries for navigation and communication. And we could imagine people like them using a device like this to reduce their battery load. SEABROOK: You've called this a cocktail napkin idea. Did you actually have it at a party and did you actually write it down on a cocktail napkin? Prof. KUO: My recollection was that we were at a conference somewhere. This is Max Donnelin(ph) and I. He's the principle investigator. And we were discussing something peripherally related and it came to us in a flash. And in fact we didn't even need the cocktail napkin. We were quite convinced that the principle made sense, but then there was still the problem of how to demonstrate that. This was an idea that came about very quickly and easily and then was followed by several years of hard work. SEABROOK: Art Kuo is a professor of a mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan. Thanks very much, professor. Prof. KUO: Thank you. That was fun.

But what's different about it is that it has a small device added onto it that takes motion of the knee and it transforms that into electrical power.  SEABROOK: What is going with walking that generates the energy?  Prof. KUO: Well, there's all this motion going on and it would be easy to use as you drive a generator. But I think what's different about our device is that were looking for a point in walking where there's energy that's just being wasted. We found the best place so far to steal energy from the person is near the end of what we call the swing phase of walking, when one leg is off the ground and your knee is extending. There's a point where you're actually breaking the knee, you're slowing it down right before your foot hits the ground.  SEABROOK: Okay. Hold on. I see. I think I see that. I'm trying to do it here. Okay, so you've picked your foot off the ground, picked up your foot, you've moved it forward to make a step but it's sort of in that moment before it's fully extended to take a step.  Prof. KUO: Yes. And you may feel your hamstring pulling. That's the muscle that slows down your knee.  SEABROOK: Wow. So does it work to put the brace on and, like, go shopping in the mall or stroll around? Or do you have to be constantly moving, sort of with purpose walking?  Prof. KUO: It definitely works best when you're walking purposefully. But I would say that our current problem is that all we've done is produced a prototype, which is a proof of concept. And there's still a lot of development to be done to reduce the weight and the size, make it comfortable to wear, and then it's something that someone might not mind wearing while they're walking around.  SEABROOK: What do you think this will be good for? I mean, these days we're all talking about having little solar panels to charge our cell phones and iPods. What do you envision this being used for?  Prof. KUO: In the Western world it's true. Even though it is a hassle to deal with the battery in your cell phone, you don't mind carrying it around and you are able to charge it. But a quarter of the world's population actually does not have ready access to electricity. And for them battery power is part of their livelihood. And the military also, your typical soldier carries many pounds of batteries and their livelihood depends on batteries for navigation and communication.  And we could imagine people like them using a device like this to reduce their battery load.  SEABROOK: You've called this a cocktail napkin idea. Did you actually have it at a party and did you actually write it down on a cocktail napkin?  Prof. KUO: My recollection was that we were at a conference somewhere. This is Max Donnelin(ph) and I. He's the principle investigator. And we were discussing something peripherally related and it came to us in a flash. And in fact we didn't even need the cocktail napkin. We were quite convinced that the principle made sense, but then there was still the problem of how to demonstrate that.  This was an idea that came about very quickly and easily and then was followed by several years of hard work.  SEABROOK: Art Kuo is a professor of a mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan. Thanks very much, professor.  Prof. KUO: Thank you. That was fun.

Well, for a while it was the corn, which has been genetically engineered to kill insects that want to eat it. Cotton, too, has been altered. Now, though, it looks like the caterpillar has learned some lessons.  NPR's Dan Charles reports. DAN CHARLES: The crops contain a gene that was extracted from an insect killing microbe called Bacillus thuringiensis or BT, so the genetically engineered corn and cotton are often called BT crops.

Professor BRUCE TABASHNIK (Zoology, University of Arizona): I thought we might see resistance to Bt crops in five years or less. CHARLES: It took twice as long as expected, but Tabashnik says he's now seen the first case of resistance in a caterpillar called the bollworm.  Professor TABASHNIK: It's a pest in cotton, corn and many other crops. It eats many different crops.  CHARLES: The evidence comes from another group of researchers at the University of Arkansas. Those scientists have been collecting bollworms and other pests from cotton fields in Mississippi and Arkansas. And some of the bollworms collected in recent years have been able to survive much higher doses of the BT poison in laboratory experiments.  Tabashnik published his analysis in the current issue of Nature Biotechnology. In an odd twist, though, the scientists in Arkansas who actually collected those bollworms and tested them aren't so sure the resistance is all that new. They say those hardy insects may have been living in cotton fields all along, scientists just happened to find them now.  In any case, if more bollworms are surviving on BT cotton, farmers haven't yet noticed much practical effect. Dan Charles, NPR News, Washington.  MADELEINE BRAND, host:   This is DAY TO DAY.

Celebrations, lectures, and a surprising amount of barbecues are being held in honor of the author of \"The Origin of the Species\" and the father of the theory of natural selection. Now, our guest in-studio is Richard Milner. He has Darwin Day off for the first time in many years, we understand. He's usually performing his one-man musical called \"Charles Darwin: Live and in Concert\" at some Darwin party or another. He did it last week in Brooklyn, and will be putting it on in Seattle on February 20th. He'll be back for a couple shows at the Botanical Gardens here in New York in May. Milner is author of the \"Encyclopedia of Evolution,\" and his study of Darwin is so extensive that he can pretty much channel Darwin, we understand, which we will ask you to do in a minute. First, though, happy Darwin Day, Richard Milner. Mr. RICHARD MILNER (Author, \"Encyclopedia of Evolution\"; Performer, \"Charles Darwin: Live and in Concert\"): Happy Darwin Day to you. MARTIN: Thank you for being with us. Mr. MILNER: A great pleasure. Now I'm speaking as Darwin, you want me as Richard Milner, first. MARTIN: Wow. We went right into it. (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: Well, one question as Richard. Mr. MILNER: Yes? MARTIN: How did this happen? Your interest in Darwin goes way back. How old were you when you started thinking about this man and his impact? Mr. MILNER: Well, he was a hero of mine as I was growing up. And I was a kid who was catching frogs in the Catskills in the summers. I was always looking for fossils. And I had a young friend named Stephen Jay Gould, who turned out to be one of the great evolutionists of the 20th century, and his heroes were Charles Darwin and Joe DiMaggio. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. MILNER: But when we honor Darwin, I was thinking about this last night, why just hero-worship this person, who's so contentious and still so controversial, after all this time? When we honor Darwin, we honor the spirit of science in ourselves. We honor the spirit of inquiry, the sprit of trying to apply the human mind to the mysteries of nature. And Darwin was well aware - he said it was like a dog trying to comprehend the mind of Newton. He tried to find a way to grasp the wonders. He had a sense of wonder, a sense of rapture. When he was in a rainforest, he said the mind is a chaos of delight, just looking at the birds, the plants and so-on. And there were so many Darwins. There was the young explorer, the sailor. There was the kid like myself, hunting frogs. There was the young scientist. Later, there was the sage, the philosopher, the icon. He's so many Darwins. Again, it's like, you know, the young Elvis, the old Elvis. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. MILNER: There's a Darwin for all seasons. ALISON STEWART, host: I'm laughing because my Mom taught biology for 35 years. So we had big Darwin discussions in our house. (unintelligible) yeah. So I'm just highly amused. (unintelligible) (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: Go ahead. Mr. MILNER: Another thing that was wonderful about Darwin is that he always collected any facts that were opposed to his theory. And he wasn't a dogmatic person like so many today that fight religion versus Darwinism, and each one takes a stand and digs their heel in the dirt. Darwin never fought religion. He said, let's just try to focus on positive achievements in science and maybe the light of reason will banish some of the shadows of superstition. He said you don't gain people's interest by telling them that they're just full of it and, you know, they must abandon their faith. It's just - let's concentrate on trying to understand the universe. MARTIN: Of all the ways you could have honored him\u2026 Mr. MILNER: Yes? MARTIN: \u2026why a musical? Mr. MILNER: Oh, because I've always loved musicals. (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: That makes sense. STEWART: There's got to be something in it for him. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. MILNER: And I love to perform, and my songs are in many styles, from Gilbert and Sullivan, to Lerner and Loewe, to the blues. And that's the fun of it, too, to try to translate these ideas and these personalities. In the show, I do Darwin, Huxley, Alfred Wallace, many - the Scopes trial, I have the blues for Mr. Scopes. (Soundbite of laughter) STEWART: Have you ever grown your beard as long as Mr. Darwin? You've got a little bit of white beard, but from the pictures I've seen, you should have a longish beard. Mr. MILNER: Yes, well, I - first of all, it makes me look too old. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. MILNER: And secondly\u2026 MARTIN: One-hundred and ninety-nine is old. You don't want to age yourself. Mr. MILNER: No, no, no, no. And secondly, during the show I do other characters. If I do young Darwin, then it wouldn't suit it to have the long beard. So\u2026 MARTIN: Before we get to a little - we do have a clip of some of the music from the musical, but we would like to ask a couple of questions to Charles Darwin. Is that possible? Mr. MILNER: Well, let's see. I think I hear his cane tapping as he walks along his path. (Soundbite of tapping) Mr. MILNER: Mr. Darwin? Could we speak with you? Certainly, what would you like to know? MARTIN: Oh, sir. Well, thank you for being with us. First of all, happy birthday. Mr. MILNER: Well, thank you so much. I appreciate the attention. That's very kind of you. MARTIN: I have to ask you. There are a lot of people who take issue with your theories and have made you out to be someone who is anti-religion. What do you think about the current modern controversy? (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. MILNER: It's not a modern controversy. This has been going on for hundreds of years. It's always amusing to me how the modern people think that they've invented everything, you know? In my day, the religious were very strong. You see, I was the rebel, I was the one who was on the outside. And there was a philosopher, a theologian called Paley that I studied when I was a lad. And Paley wrote a book saying that everything in nature pointed to design, to a designer. He was the one that made up the analogy, or the metaphor, of the watch. If you find a watch in a field, he said, and see all the intricate parts of this, well, it didn't get there by accident; it must imply that somewhere there is a designer. And, in fact, there was a 19th-century preacher, Henry Ward Beecher, here in Brooklyn, who was the greatest preacher, but a very liberal preacher of the 19th century. And he said, well, you know, the watch is remarkable, but I think it's much more remarkable when I see a watch in a field that there's a factory somewhere that turns out 100,000 watches a week. And a man had to design that and set up, you know, the processes by which these 100,000 watches would be produced, and the tools, and everything else, and train the people to make them. He said, so I think evolution is fine with religion, because it's just as grand in the wholesale as in the retail. MARTIN: Now, do you know that there is a man out there name Richard Milner who has made a musical about you and your life? Mr. MILNER: Oh, I've heard about him through my descendants. You know, Richard knows my great-grandson Randall Keynes and my great-great-granddaughter, the whole Darwin family has embraced Mr. Milner. So, yes, I do. MARTIN: And you've heard the music? You approve? Mr. MILNER: Well, it's not a matter of approving or disapproving. I mean, I did my thing. Mr. Milner does his thing. But I'm very pleased that there are Darwin Day celebrations all over the country, because -and really, I'm not an egotist and I never was. But that sprit of enquiry, you know, I always thought that by this time my theory would be either obsolete or disproved or have another better scientific theory built upon it. It has not so far. But that's the nature of science, that each good theory becomes the rubble upon which the next is built. But I would have never expected the tenacity of organized religion to be so persistent right up into the 21st century. And going back to your original question, there's nothing new I this at all. The astounding thing is that this has gone on for hundreds and thousands of years and no - shows of no abating, nothing new in it at all. MARTIN: Well, before we let you go, we do want to hear a little bit of this tribute that Richard Milner has crafted for you, part of his musical. This is a little bit from the musical. It's called \"Why Didn't I Think of That? \" from \"Darwin Live and in Concert. \" Mr. MILNER: Yes. Can I tell you something about that? MARTIN: We'll have it going on while you\u2026 (Soundbite of stage play, \"Darwin: Live and in Concert\") Mr. MILNER: (as Thomas Huxley) How incredibly stupid not to have thought of that myself. Mr. MILNER: It's Thomas Huxley, my champion, explaining that when he first read my book that he wished he'd thought of himself. (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: Richard Milner's one-man show is called Darwin: Live and in Concert. The man he channeled, Charles Darwin, would have been 199-years-old today. Thank you, both of you, for being with us today. Mr. MILNER: Thank you. Let's give Huxley a listen. (Soundbite of stage play, \"Darwin: Live and in Concert\") Mr. MILNER: (as Thomas Huxley) His hands have grown to flippers, and he has a fishy tail.

I'm Alex Cohen. MADELEINE BRAND, host: I'm Madeleine Brand. In a few minutes, New York and Los Angeles launch investigations into health insurance companies and we get the lowdown on the presidential candidates' health care proposals. COHEN: First though, to space. Sometime in the next two weeks the U. S. military will try to shoot down a crippled spy satellite that's about as big as a Chevy Suburban. The government says the satellite is dangerous because it's carrying toxic fuel. If left alone, it would likely crash back into the atmosphere sometime next month and could injure or possibly even kill people. We turn now to John Pike. He's director of the private national security Web site GlobalSecurity. org. Welcome back to the program, Mr. Pike. Mr. JOHN PIKE (GlobalSecurity. org): Glad to be here. COHEN: Can you tell us, first of all, how exactly do you shoot down a 5000-pound spacecraft? Mr. PIKE: Well, it's not so much a process of shooting it down the way you would shoot down an airplane as it is of shooting it up. That is to say, they're going to fire a missile that has a heat-seeking warhead on it that will collide with the satellite in orbit. And when the satellite runs into this kill vehicle at 17,000 miles-an-hour, the spacecraft will disintegrate into a lot of little pieces. The little pieces will be traveling at orbital velocity, and over a period of a week or ten days all those little pieces, they will reenter the Earth's atmosphere. COHEN: Now, here's what I don't get. If they're going to reenter the Earth's atmosphere, and apparently, you know, this spacecraft was carrying this toxic fuel called hydrazine, how do we know that some of these bits and pieces aren't going to have that too and still effect people? Mr. PIKE: Well, hydrazine is a liquid and the hydrazine would burn up on reentry. About half of the material on the spacecraft is expected to burn up on reentry; the other half of it is expected to reach the ground. COHEN: And wind up on eBay. Mr. PIKE: Well, wind up somewhere. In all probability, it's probably going to wind up in the bottom of the ocean. But there is that non-trivial possibility that it will fall on land. Souvenir hunters will pick it up and they'll sell it on eBay. COHEN: This is being called a test of  the nation's anti-ballistic missile systems.  How accurate an assessment will it provide for us of our capability? Mr. PIKE: Well, not particularly, because this spacecraft is significantly larger than a missile  or warhead target. The Aegis missile defense system has been tested over a dozen times over the last several years and most of those tests have been successful. So I think we already understand that the Aegis system is reasonably reliable. COHEN: Now, President Bush has insisted that this shoot-down is strictly for safety reasons, but it seems like there are some political implications here as well. Mr. PIKE: Well, I think the security implication is there's a reason this event is unusual, because normally when a spy satellite reaches the end of its life they will have a controlled reentry, they will cause it to come down over the Pacific Ocean so that there's no way that the Russians or the Chinese would be able to pick up any of the debris and learn anything about the spacecraft. Since they don't have control of this spacecraft, that's not possible here. COHEN: The U. S. criticized China last year when Chine tested its anti-satellite systems in a somewhat similar fashion. So how do you think China will react to this decision for us to shoot down a spacecraft? Mr. PIKE: Well, I don't know that the Chinese are in very much of a position to be critical of our activities here. One critical difference, of course, is that this intercept is going to be at an altitude of something like 100 miles; the Chinese intercept was at an altitude of 500 miles. The debris the Chinese test created would remain in Earth orbit for years; the debris that the American test in going to create, the American intercept is  going to create, will remain in orbit for hours or days at most. COHEN: Going back to the practicalities here, I'm just trying to picture what all of this is going to look like. You're on one of these Aegis ships. Is someone pressing a button? Are they launching something that looks almost like a gun? What does it look like? Mr. PIKE: Well, it looks like a missile. It's long and pointy and has little wings on it. And they launch them from a silo, a canister in the deck of the ship, and the thing flies up into the sky, gets up to an altitude of about 100 miles and there's a kill vehicle on it, I'd say the size of a TV set, that has a little camera on it that would see the heat being emitted by the spacecraft and home in on it. Mr. PIKE: Mr. Pike, do you buy the administration's word on this, that this is purely for safety reasons because of this toxic fuel? Or is there something else going on here? Mr. PIKE: Well, I'm skeptical that the toxic fuel is the only reason they're doing this intercept. I think that there have to be people in the government that would be concerned that an uncontrolled reentry could result in some of this advanced American technology winding up in the hands of the Chinese or the Russians. COHEN: John Pike is the director of the private national security website GlobalSecurity. org. Thank you. Mr. PIKE: Thank you.  ALEX COHEN, host:  This is DAY TO DAY. I'm Alex Cohen.  MADELEINE BRAND, host:  I'm Madeleine Brand. In a few minutes, New York and Los Angeles launch investigations into health insurance companies and we get the lowdown on the presidential candidates' health care proposals.  COHEN: First though, to space. Sometime in the next two weeks the U. S. military will try to shoot down a crippled spy satellite that's about as big as a Chevy Suburban. The government says the satellite is dangerous because it's carrying toxic fuel. If left alone, it would likely crash back into the atmosphere sometime next month and could injure or possibly even kill people. We turn now to John Pike. He's director of the private national security Web site GlobalSecurity. org.  Welcome back to the program, Mr. Pike.  Mr. JOHN PIKE (GlobalSecurity. org): Glad to be here.  COHEN: Can you tell us, first of all, how exactly do you shoot down a 5000-pound spacecraft?  Mr. PIKE: Well, it's not so much a process of shooting it down the way you would shoot down an airplane as it is of shooting it up. That is to say, they're going to fire a missile that has a heat-seeking warhead on it that will collide with the satellite in orbit. And when the satellite runs into this kill vehicle at 17,000 miles-an-hour, the spacecraft will disintegrate into a lot of little pieces. The little pieces will be traveling at orbital velocity, and over a period of a week or ten days all those little pieces, they will reenter the Earth's atmosphere.  COHEN: Now, here's what I don't get. If they're going to reenter the Earth's atmosphere, and apparently, you know, this spacecraft was carrying this toxic fuel called hydrazine, how do we know that some of these bits and pieces aren't going to have that too and still effect people?  Mr. PIKE: Well, hydrazine is a liquid and the hydrazine would burn up on reentry. About half of the material on the spacecraft is expected to burn up on reentry; the other half of it is expected to reach the ground.  COHEN: And wind up on eBay.  Mr. PIKE: Well, wind up somewhere. In all probability, it's probably going to wind up in the bottom of the ocean. But there is that non-trivial possibility that it will fall on land. Souvenir hunters will pick it up and they'll sell it on eBay.  COHEN: This is being called a test of  the nation's anti-ballistic missile systems.  How accurate an assessment will it provide for us of our capability?  Mr. PIKE: Well, not particularly, because this spacecraft is significantly larger than a missile  or warhead target. The Aegis missile defense system has been tested over a dozen times over the last several years and most of those tests have been successful. So I think we already understand that the Aegis system is reasonably reliable.  COHEN: Now, President Bush has insisted that this shoot-down is strictly for safety reasons, but it seems like there are some political implications here as well.

I'm Ira Flatow. Yesterday, several prominent scientists demanded that the federal government guaranteed basic research freedoms for scientists working within their ranks. They detailed instances of political interference with science in several federal agencies - the Consumer Products Safety Commission, the Food and Drug Administration, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Among their claims, reports being edited to misrepresent scientific findings. Agencies' reluctance to regulate products, scientific findings ignored in policy rulings and resistance to scientific appointments. Today we're broadcasting from the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Boston. And this hour, we're joined by scientists who will make the case for Congress and the next administration to set policies that will ensure the scientific freedom of federal scientists. We're going to talk about the ways to strengthen science in the federal government, from keeping politics out of political appointments, to protecting whistleblowers, to ensuring that scientists can present their findings to their peers and the public. And if you'd like to join the discussion, give us a call. Our number is 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK. And if you're here in the audience at the meeting, we invite you to step up to the mic with your questions. You can also join us in Second Life; just go to the SCIENCE FRIDAY island there with your avatar and you can pick up our free T-shirt and also ask a question of our avatar over there. As always, you can surf over to our Web Site at ScienceFriday. com for more information. Let me introduce my guests. Francesca Grifo is a senior scientist and director of the Scientific Integrity Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington. Welcome to the program, Dr. Grifo. Doctor FRANCESCA GRIFO (Senior Scientist; Director, Scientific Integrity Program, Union of Concerned Scientists): Thank you very much. FLATOW: David Goldston was chief of staff for the House Committee on Science from 2001 to 2006. He's a visiting lecturer in the Center for Environment at Harvard and right here in - across the river in Cambridge. They hate to mix that up, don't they? I want to mix up Boston and Cambridge in this area. Welcome to the program, David. Mr. DAVID GOLDSTON (Former Chief of Staff, House Committee on Science; Visiting Lecturer, Center for Environment, Harvard University): Thanks. FLATOW: Rosina Bierbaum was associate director for Environment in the Office of Science and Technology Policy from 1998 to 2001, and acting director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy from January to October 2001. She's a professor and dean of the School of Natural Resources and Environment at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Welcome to the program, Dr. Bierbaum. Doctor ROSINA BIERBAUM (Former Acting Director and Former Associate Director for Environment, Office of Science and Technology Policy; Professor and Dean, School of Natural Resources and Environment, University of Michigan): I'm very pleased to be here. Thank you. FLATOW: Thanks for taking that long journey. James McCarthy was a co-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - the famous IPCC - that was the Working Group II. He's president elect of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and professor of biological oceanography, at Harvard in Cambridge. Welcome to the SCIENCE FRIDAY. Mr. JAMES McCARTHY (President Elect, American Association for the Advancement of Science; Co-chair, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group II for the Third IPCC Assessment; Professor of Biological Oceanography, Harvard University): Thank you. FLATOW: Good to have you back. Let me begin with you, Dr. Grifo, because it was basically the Union of Concerned Scientists' statement that I was quoting at the top of the program. Give us an idea of - the report that you outlined all kinds of instances in which you think that science and politics were too - too many times interwoven. Dr. GRIFO: Yed, Ira, I mean, we've been documenting that for a number of years. We've been looking at these various examples and I would have people go to a very fun feature on our Web site, called the A to Z Guide to Abuses in Science. It's a permutated periodic table of the elements where each element is actually representing an abuse. And they're all very well documented there. But they range, you know, very broadly for all kinds of things. And you mentioned some of them but I think, you know, falsifying data, fabricating results, selectively editing documents, creating false uncertainty, tampering with the scientific procedures. I mean, it's a very long list of the ways. But I think it's not just those specific abuses of science, it's also the more systemic changes that we've seen, the way that insider, you know, games have been played with the rules that are really going to be very challenging to undo. FLATOW: And what are you calling for then? How are you calling to change all of this? Dr. GRIFO: Well, I think, essentially, we need to create a situation, to create conditions in the federal government where federal scientists can do their jobs. It's not that scientists are, you know, a special class or anything, but in fact, these are very important people in the federal government. They serve the American public. The work they do is important. And we need to give them conditions where they can be effective. Some parts of that are obviously giving them some basic protections. You mentioned whistleblower protections. Other parts of that have to do with transparency, increasing the, you know, we can't be everywhere. We can't be watching. So the point is if we open up the government, if we have these things more out in the open, then everyone can actually be a part of that conversation and part of the people watching. FLATOW: David Goldston, you worked in Congress, your congressman who you represented, Sherry Boehlert was very instrumental and very open in his ideas about science and shared very much his views about science and was never afraid to talk about science. Do you agree with the union's concern here about what happened in the past and what might we will have to watch out for in the future? Mr. GOLDSTON: Well, obviously, I'm not familiar with each case, but I think there have been problems in terms of abuses of science and efforts to squelch science - scientists. The most noted and documented example is probably Jim Hansen at NASA, where even NASA acknowledged that people there hadn't been abiding by the rules. And that may be also one of the few success stories because I think the rules, they were put in place after that incident, everybody including Hansen views as a model of what might be done to institute the kinds of policies that Francesca is calling for. I think the biggest problem is or at least as big a problem is self-censorship. The people now are worried that someone else will worry that someone else will worry that someone else will worry and that's much harder to root out. Every time we tried to figure out what was going on at NOAA, for example, where there have been some of these cases. A lot of them were sort of people worrying that the next person up the line was going to create a problem for them and so they censored themselves. So I think, creating a new atmosphere would be helpful beyond actually rooting out real problems but changing the atmosphere, which I think the reputation and the sense of what's happening is even worse than what was happening, and that's created its own set of problems. FLATOW: Do you think that any new administration whether it's Democratic or Republican will be different? Mr. GOLDSTON: I think so, but I also think some of these problems are going to continue regardless of what party is in power because some of them involve really policy disputes that are very close and intermingled to the science disputes. So everybody - scientists and policymakers tend to frame policy issues as - is the science on our side because that's easier than having a full-blown debate about the policy differences. And I think that's happened a lot. That's like that happened before this administration that's going to continue after it and I think as issues get more difficult as they have a basis in science, everyone tries to make it sound like the science has determinative that creates a lot of confusion. And that's likely to continue no matter who's in office. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Jim McCarthy, you served as co-chair of the IPCC and the Working Group II on climate change. Do you feel that U. S. policies on climate change, the U. S. policies on climate change are changing - are they evolving a little bit more now than when the day when President Bush said that a report put out by the State Department was something done by the bureaucracy? Mr. McCARTHY: Well, Ira, I think they are. And the disappointment is it has taken a long time and if we go back to 2001 when the IPCC report that I was involved in was released, it seemed to many of us that this was the first time the IPCC had identified unequivocally impacts of climate change. One could go back to the early report and say, well, there were a lot of hypothesis about future impacts. But for the first time, we could see impacts. Moreover, we could see that the negative aspect of those was far outweighing what some people had long thought, well, there'll be positives, as well. And so, just coming back, I think, to this point of the transparency of science, I think the scientists who were involved in studies of this sort are doing this because they believe that the best information should be on the table for the policy process to review. And if in the course of getting to the policy discussion that David was just referring to, there's a filtering, there's a selection. Now, we know that every administration - and I also, I liked your openning comment about the case for Congress and for the administration because I think we have a tendency to focus too much on the administration here. We need to keep in mind that the Congress has a very important role to play in this. And that if in the course of moving from the knowledge base - and we know in some cases if it's military intelligence or perhaps some of the economic information the government has - they would have a reason for not making that public. But that science should be transparent. We should all know what that science is and any science generated by our federal scientists should be available for all of us to see at all times. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. Bierbaum, you sort of had an insider's look at all of this, this year. Can you give us your perspective and how to look from there? Dr. BIERBAUM: Well, I stayed as the acting science advisor for the very long wait for Jack Marburger to show up on Halloween of 2001, and there's certainly was, unfortunately, I think, both a systemic distortion and a suppression of science during that time. That's why I signed as one of the 62 original scientists four years ago that there were problems in what was happening in terms of health science, in terms of climate science, in terms of national security science because five administrations' worth of advisors in these different areas compared notes and we felt it had never happened to this extent before. But to pick up on where Jim McCarthy led us in terms of 2001, so here it is Inauguration Day, 2001, I'm left holding the OSTP mantle, we gaveled down at exactly 12 noon, inauguration time, the sentence that says most of the warming in the last 50 years is due to humans. And we all thought we have a new president, we have a strong, clear science statement, we have a mandate to act, and of course, it was within weeks that the U. S. walked from the Kyoto Protocol. Also, the National Academy of Sciences was asked to critique, in a kind sense, the IPCC, but the science office which I was representing was not asked to help define those questions. The climate change science program was reorganized so that it reported through political channels, not to the Office of Science and Technology Policy. We were told we no longer needed to send in weekly science reports over to the West Wing. They would call us if they needed us. And so it was a very sharp sea change in sort of the attention to science in general and the attention to this very strong climate science that was coming through the community loud and clear. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. All right, we have to take a short break. We're going to come back and talk lots more about the science and the role of science in public policy and how we can get more and better science opinions without being filtered or censored out to the public or actually to be published. So stay with us. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. If you're here in the audience, you can go right here to the microphones sitting here waiting for you. Don't be shy and don't be afraid. We'll be right back after this short break. I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about strengthening science in the federal government, with my guests, Francesca Grifo of the Union of Concerned Scientists; David Goldston, former chief of staff for the House Committee on Science and visiting lecturer at Harvard; Rosina Bierbaum, a scientist who served in the Office of Science and Technology Policy in both the Clinton and Bush administration, and now a dean at the University of Michigan; James McCarthy, co-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group II and the new president elect of the AAAS. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Dr. Bierbaum, you're making some points about being on the inside of - I guess, what you might call the office of the science advisor. Dr. BIERBAUM: Mm-hmm. FLATOW: It's so also always informally. Does a science advisor or did it have much of an input on hardly anything in this administration, the last administration, in your experience? Dr. BIERBAUM: Well, I felt in the last administration it really did have a big impact. There were four associate directors who are all Senate confirmed, keeping their eye on different pieces of the environmental research budget as well as the policy development. But I think I would argue that every major decision that was made in the Clinton administration had a scientist at the table. And science was often not the loudest voice but it was a voice. And so whether it was regulations or whether it was a science input to treaties or whether it was what the federal and environmental budget should be or all of the science budget should be, there would be the scientists there arguing extensively for that. So Jack Gibbons and then Neal Lane were always central to all the decision making. All that changed, though, it was very hard to get a seat at any table in the 10 months that I was staying as the acting advisor. And so, for example, with CEQ - the Council on Environmental Quality - becoming really the default climate empire in the White House - that was very different. When energy policy was put together in the Bush administration, the National Economics Council was the lead on that, not the science advisor's office. FLATOW: David Goldston, did your boss have any better luck with getting attention for science? Let me just specifically - on this program last January, a year ago, you said that the climate change is one of the areas that the new Congress would make its mark on. Well, how would you grade that new Congress? Mr. GOLDSTON: Incomplete. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Now that you're a professor, you can give those grades. Mr. GOLDSTON: That's right. And I was familiar with that grade as a student too. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. GOLDSTON: I would say - what I said, I think, in January was the one science issue where the change in party control might make a difference is climate. And I think that actually has proven to be the case. There were very few hearings on climate, with Republicans in charge of the Congress, in the Senate where Senator Inhofe chaired the Environment Committee. There were mostly hearings about how climate was a quote/unquote, \"hoax. \" I think that's all changed. I think climate is very much on the agenda. There are bills in both Houses. The energy bill moved through less than what some of us would have liked, but certainly, a heck of a lot more than what have been done in recent years including the first increases in CAFE standards and fuel economy standards for several decades. So I think the - that did change because of the party control. And the other thing that's happening which Jim McCarthy indicated is that even within the Republican side, even within the administration, there's a little bit more movement about we have to talk about what to do about those. I think, the bulk of the Republicans are still not ready to go to mandatory controls which my boss thought was needed. FLATOW: And your boss was a Republican? Mr. GOLDSTON: Yes. And which the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party has supported right, so even though it's not what he's emphasizing right now. But - so, I think, the climate issue is far more fluid than it was a year ago, that's partly because of change in political control, and also partly because of the impact of the most recent IPCC report; even the press coverage of climate change significantly after that. All the - trying to balance with some quotes from the few scientists or former scientists who weren't part of the consensus on climate - a lot of it has fallen away, so I think that issue has really changed both because of the science and because of the politics. But, I think, there's a case where that means we're no longer hopefully going to be debating with science the kinds of things that the Bush administration did ask the academy to look into. But we are going to be debating what to do about it, and that's a policy question. There is no science position on whether you should have a carbon tax. There is no science position on the values question even if we - if this is a problem that's worth dealing with. I certainly think that it is, but I think what is going to happen now is we're moving past the science debate to a policy debate and the way scientists need to think about that and participate is different is from the place we have been stuck in for the last decade or so. FLATOW: In what way? Mr. GOLDSTON: In that before, there really was a debate about what is the science tell - it's a political debate about what the science tells us. And I think now there's going to be much - there is already much broader acceptance that we are facing human-induced climate change. And the question is what to do about it, that's largely a policy question. I would also say that many debates, many discussions about the way science and politics intersect that are held right now really view climate as the model issue. And I think it's really an unusual issue. It's rare that the political debate is centered on a purely scientific question which it was because there was this, at least, in Congress, a debate about whether climate change was real. And that there's a clear consensus answer usually scientists are more divided. Here, there's not only a clear consensus answer but a codified clear consensus answer in IPCC. And it's going to take a while for that to move through the system. Generally, the opening question is only partly science, if science at all, and the answer the community can give is much more variable. So climate's unusual that way and it's going to now be shifting, I think, to a much more policy-centered debate. FLATOW: Let me ask all of you. Let me begin with Dr. Grifo. Are there then issues because the environment has becoming as balloons, so to speak, as a bigger issue? Are there other important issues that are now under the radar screen with science policy? You know, I think about the situation with the FDA, for example, you know, it doesn't get talked about as much as it might have; other kinds of issues that are important but are not being discussed. Dr. GRIFO: Well, I'll just jump in, I mean, I think that there are these issues across the agencies. I mean, this not just about climate when we look at the political interference issues. We have survey results from nine different agencies where we have 1,191 scientists who have told us that they fear retaliation. So those are all not, you know, climate scientists. It's clearly much, much more broad than that. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. They're willing to speak up more now. Are they able to speak up more now than they used to be? Dr. GRIFO: Well, it's interesting because, I think, you know, you referred to the NASA example, and I think, that NASA and NOAA, particularly NOAA really tried after these events to change things. And unfortunately, shortly after that, a new media policy came down from the Department of Commerce that essentially was about 15 pages long all about you can do it but it's only in this condition and you have to, and it was a very, I think, frightening document for a federal - I mean, for a federal scientist. And only at the very end did it say, well, actually, you do have a few protections. So I think very good people in, you know, various agencies are trying to make things better, but unfortunately because we have the centralization top down, it's very difficult. FLATOW: Jim, you look like you want to jump in. Let me ask everybody here, if you'd like to get up to a mic and ask a question, there's a space for you to do that. Yes. Mr. McCARTHY: Actually, I was getting edgy when David was speaking. I think one way to interpret David's message would be that the case for really understanding the science of climate change is pretty much past and now we're talking about policy. And I really strongly disagree with that. I think the - if you just look at the last four or five years and say, well, where did we think we could possibly, realistically imagine policy measures taking us in terms of a altered course for the future, a reduced concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And when the science plays out when you look at our understanding of the system and the models that project various features, it's pretty clear that it would be - a world would be so different from what we have today. That it's interesting now to see that not only is it a sense among the scientific community who look at these things but even in the political realm. If you could have imagined just four years ago, the leading contenders in the primaries advocating a reduction of fossil fuel emissions by 80 percent, or these were greenhouse gases, by 80 percent by 2050, it was unthinkable. And yet, if you look and say, well, what would that world be like, there are many aspects of it that I think we'd be awfully uncomfortable with. So I think the policy has to be continually informed by what the science can tell us as to what the implications are particular to policy measures might be. It is an iterative process and that's what we need to work on. Mr. GOLDSTON: And I agree with that entirely. What I meant to say was before, there was an issue that was purely science being asked them with that. Now, we're at these issues where it is entangled and it is iterative and it had to be informed by policy but science can no longer be determinative. The issue, is climate change real, is an issue where science alone can and should and can speak to answer that question. The kinds of questions now - what level should we set greenhouse gas emissions at - that's an answer where science has to be one input and that input needs to be constantly refreshed and the research behind it needs to be constantly funded. But the science alone can't determine the answer to that policy question. So that that's where I think the distinction is but I don't differ with anything that Jim just said. FLATOW: So who should take the lead in these things? Should it be - should, I mean, should the science advisors - do the president's science advisor have some sort of autonomy to speak up when he or she would like to without feeling that their job is in jeopardy? I mean\u2026 Mr. GOLDSTON: That's, I would say, I mean, that's not the role the science advisor, I mean, the science advisors in the White House, they're - I mean, they should certainly feel free to speak to the president which has worked better in some administrations than others. But the science advisor is not a free standing civil service science office. The kinds of agencies that Francesca was listing are, and each agency has its own curious problems. So part of the problem with Commerce Department document was they put out a document that applied to the entire department - scientists and non-scientists. There was a lot of debate within the department and I assure you we suggested that that was not the way to do this. And so, they put out a document that refers to, you know, what some economists may say about economic policy and confuse that with what a scientist might say about their own scientific work, not a policy matter. And that's why the final policy came out so inadequately. FLATOW: So should Congress - should a strong Congress person have a voice in these things? I mean, who decides the direction of science? We never hear that debate coming up very much. It always sort of is an undercurrent when some problem. We don't talk about - we don't hear very much - there may be hearings going on, but we never hear very much about them. Mr. GOLDSTON: Well, I think both the - I mean, it gets to this issue of independence. I mean, that's one of those issues that's in between, so you want science director to, in part, to answer questions that are of interest to the policymakers. You also want it partly driven by the community. And so Congress is generally, by and large, there are exceptions, set broad guidance on this is a general area we should look at. Climate sciences - climate science, say, should be funded. But they're not getting into the specific areas in detail because that would be viewed as something that the community should look at by itself. But I think we do need some direction, I mean, in certain areas, for example, NASA inadequately funding remote sensing that we need for climate change. Congress has had to step in and say no, we need more of that. Dr. BIERBAUM: Well, I definitely\u2026 FLATOW: Go ahead. Dr. BIERBAUM: I definitely think that they're - we can't do all good science at once. And so we need to have some strategic planning exercises. The science community is actually very bad at setting priorities within a discipline - let alone across disciplines, but that's going to become increasingly important as these budgets get tighter and tighter. And so I think the effort that the National Science and Technology Council attempted under the previous president and under the science advisors of Clinton to kind of coordinate across the federal agencies to think about emerging areas, to figure out how much needed to be put as federal entities into high-risk longer term research as well as what kind of applied or near-term solutions we need was a very valuable exercise. I think we've lost some ground now but I think there does need to be a strategic planning process. And in those exercise, 13 agencies have kind of horse trade issues, databases and try to figure out what was knowable and what time frame. And just to come back to whether the climate science has settled for a second, I think yes, we know that climate's changing; and yes, we know, it's changing fast. But you know what? We don't know what to do about it, not just in terms of mitigation, but in terms of how to cope with climate change, because no matter what we do on the mission side, the changes are going to continue and that is a very rich and under-attended to research agenda coping with climate change. We've lost a decade in thinking about that. The first national assessment of the impacts of climate change in the U. S. mandated by Congress was effectively subverted by the Bush administration, sank like a stone except for UCS and a few others bringing back these pieces. And then 10-year plan that the Clinton administration was attempting to put forward would have addressed a lot of those issues of what can communities do, what are regional impacts, what are the socioeconomic solutions to climate change. And we've really got a very urgent research agenda there. FLATOW: Okay. We're talking about science this hour in TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News here in Boston at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting, talking about science and public policy and the directions - how the two may live better together, honestly. Let's go to the audience for a question here. Right - this young lady right here. Yeah. Unidentified Woman #1: Hi. I'm actually visiting from Southern California where we've recently been having a large policy issue with the greenhouse gas waiver that California tried to pass with the EPA denied. And I was wondering based on the policy end of it, the national standard would call for less greenhouse gas emissions four years earlier than Californians would. I was wondering if you think - this is sort of directed to anyone - if you think California's greenhouse gas emissions standard was reasonable. FLATOW: Anybody want to tackle that? Unidentified Man: It looks like you. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: David? Mr. GOLDSTON: Well, I think that the administration probably should have granted the waiver. There isn't the precedent to not grant a waiver, although there are some tricky legal issues because of the way that mileage is regulated rather than clean air standards. But on the specifics of whether it's the best number from a scientific point of view or what the implications are from the scientific point of view, I would turn to the scientists. FLATOW: I feel like it's a - if you remember that - I've got a secret but people would jockingly(ph) stand up but I don't want to stand up first. Yes. Mr. McCARTHY: I just like to point out and this is a really good example of leadership at a level where we wouldn't necessarily be expected of it that to see states now taking the positions that they are, to see communities taking the positions they are, to see the voice of people being heard locally and at the state level, and yet quite a disconnect when we get to the sort of issues that have been raised here with regard to the federal policy. FLATOW: This is unusual for states to stand up but they've doing in - and across the board in different issues. Could pollution must move from state to state, the car - you know, car regulations, things like that. Mr. McCARTHY: Yeah. We've seen in the leadership of governors\u2026 FLATOW: Governors. Mr. MCCARTHY: \u2026and the leadership of mayors have really been extraordinarily prominent in this area. FLATOW: And some them are banding together - they create little regional issues, right Francesca? Dr. GRIFO: I guess so. It's - I mean, I think that what we're seeing is when the federal government does not fulfill its responsibility when the conditions there are not such that these things can happen, the states are stepping into the void. FLATOW: All right. Mr. GOLDSTON: I think the states have done this in a lot of areas. The thing that makes it unusual in climate change is it's not a problem that just affects one region and the impact any state or region can make is limited and yet they're still doing it. I think it's a sign of, you know, the ideological polarization and stalemate in Washington which has caused everything to go further down. FLATOW: We'll talk more about that and your questions. Our number, 1-800-989-8255.  Stay with us. We'll be right back from Boston after the short break. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about science and public policy in the federal government. Our guests are Francesca Grifo, director of the Scientific Integrity Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists; David Goldston, former chief of staff for the House Committee on Science and he's visiting lecturer at Harvard; Rosina Bierbaum, former administrator in the Office of Science and Technology Policy in both the Clinton and Bush administrations, and now a dean of the School of Natural Resources and Environment at the University of Michigan; James McCarthy, co-chair of the IPCC Working Group II and professor of biological - oceanography at Harvard University. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Let's get a question from the phones here. Let's see if we can go to John(ph) or is it Don(ph) there? Hi Don. Are you there? No? Well, let's go to the audience and we'll go to the right side. Hi. Unidentified Woman #2: Since we've been talking about leadership and advice, I wanted to ask the panelists if they would nominate someone in particular they would like to see as a science advisor. FLATOW: Aha. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. GRIFO: Well, I don't have a name but I would dive in there and say that the important thing is that it is someone who comes in early. I mean, the fact that Rosina was saying that, you know, Dr. Marburger didn't come in until Halloween from January 20th or around that time for the inauguration, for there to be no one in place for those nine months or 10 - almost 10 months is just ridiculous. So I think the key thing is that we get someone who's at the table. FLATOW: Do you need someone who is a better organizer or a better scientist? What do you think, David? Is it someone who knows how to play politics or is going to stick to the hard science? Mr. GOLDSTON: Well, hopefully, those aren't too absolutely mutually exclusive personal traits, even though it should be someone who can tell the difference between when he's doing or she is doing one or the other. I think, you know, historically, the thing that's mattered most is the science advisor having a personal relationship of some sort with the president or at least the president being open to a setting up such a relationship. I mean, there have been lots of efforts by statutes and other ways to try to strengthen the science advisor. It's never worked because it's not a line office with a lot of responsibilities, the person either has the presidency or doesn't and so that's really the thing that you have to look at the most. FLATOW: Rosina, what would you say? Dr. BIERBAUM: I agree that you need someone who's both a good scientist but also a good synthesizer. It has to be someone who plays well with others and understands when science can be the loudest voice and explain the box that science puts you in as you develop regulations and policy around it but doesn't let anyone get out of the box. But I think it's also important that this person take advantage of the fact that you can have four Senate-confirmed associate directors because that's four very powerful people that cover areas of science. And very important, I think, we should revert to what the first President Bush did and that is make the head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy also truly the science advisor in that they're named a special assistant to the president. That's a separate reporting line. That does not exist now. And I think that's a great loss. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Frank(ph) in Yamhill. Hi, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. FRANK (Caller): Yes. Hello. FLATOW: Hi there. FRANK: Out here in Yamhill, Oregon. FLATOW: Hi. Go ahead. FRANK: I'm really very interested in asking your panelists - the great conversation here at the - perhaps talk about the relationship between science, religion, moral decision making and public policy. For example, the systematic efforts in recent years, I think, many people would agree that the efforts to raise all sorts of doubts about the science of global warming. We saw before that the efforts to raise doubts about the question of smoking. It seems to me that this isn't just a question of science and politics. In many cases, a question of science and perhaps versions of religion that are not quite so, I think, open-minded, and questions of the nature of moral decision making. So science and other disciplines and the cross, you know, fertilization that comes from that interaction, I'm looking hopefully to the future beyond this administration, I'm wondering if the panelists can speak to this. FLATOW: Frank, good question. How do we handle that? Dr. GRIFO: One thing I'd like to say is that, I think, all of the major religious groups of the world have actually made a statement now that climate change is a moral challenge. And I think it was very telling when the evangelicals came out with their very powerful statement a little more than a year ago that called for acting now. And I believe that the Catholic bishop's statement was very powerful saying we're not scientists, but we believe what the science says and we have a moral responsibility to those who follow us to leave them a sustainable planet. And we do have the possibility of being the first generation to leave the next, a truly irreversible problem. I think the promotion of giving up carbon for lent is a very interesting thing that some of the religious groups are talking about, too. So I actually think religion and climate change have found a useful pairing. FLATOW: Jim? Mr. McCARTHY: I would just echo that comment - every interaction I've had with religious groups over the last few years has led me to believe that there is no fundamental difference between our concern for the future of the planet whether we call it creation care or anything else, we're all talking about the same thing. I see no conflict at all with any religious group with which I have had an interaction. FLATOW: David? Mr. GOLDSTON: But I think we need to make a distinction between cases where religious groups are taking issue with the science - evolution, obviously, being that the most prominent case and most serious. And issues where they're taking issue with policy that around the science, say stem cells, where I think that's sometimes the way it's argued. Again, muddies the waters but fundamentally, that's not a debate over stem - the nature of stem cells and what we know scientifically, it's a religious debate - ethical debate about how we proceed and what we do research on and so forth, I think, that's legitimate. Obviously, groups weighing in on moral questions involving what we do about climate change. That's different from weighing in on the findings of the science itself, which is why the evolution controversy is so difficult. FLATOW: Well, while - because you brought up the word debate, you wrote something in Nature - an article in Nature - is it this week, in Nature, where you opposed the idea of having a Science Debate 2008 among the presidential candidates here. And I want to give you an opportunity for you state your reasons why. Mr. GOLDSTON: So I wouldn't quite say oppose. I'd say people are rushing into it without thinking about it, and that it - my guess is that it would do nothing to - either nothing or create a backlash, so that's close to oppose. But I raised a couple of issues\u2026 FLATOW: I can see your years on the Hill are paying off. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. GOLDSTON: The - a couple of issues. Number one is that some of the issues that have been slated for a science debate are again, policy issues, not science, and to send a message that this is about who's good on science is misleading. I would love to hear a debate about what the candidates think about climate change or energy policy that's not fundamentally a science issue. Secondly, I think, there's this sense that scientists have because the budget doesn't work out the way they would most prefer, and so forth that nobody's paying attention; they don't get respected and so forth, when actually, they have - are held actually in, fairly high esteem and so that some of the reasons the - behind the debate are suspect. There's an assumption that making something a higher profile political issue will necessarily pay off in financial dividends that hasn't always been the case, science agencies don't necessarily do better when they're public - in the public spotlight. And finally, given that there's all this concern about politicization of science that's one of the things behind the debate. Putting science in the middle of the most politicized kind of discussion you could possibly have doesn't seem to me to be the most likely or way to tamp down that concern. If you want a debate about what's politics, what's science - having it in a big, loud brash forum doesn't seem to be the way to settle that. So my point is not that science is separate from politics, not that scientists shouldn't be involved in politics, in fact, my fear is that they're trying to take a shortcut doing something that's largely show business and not get getting involved in sort of the day-to-day politics which is much more likely to pay off. And if we look at what's the way debates have worked so far and what kinds of issues they're good at, and what kinds of impressions they leave, I don't think that maps very well with what the advocates of the Science Debate are looking for. FLATOW: Okay. 1-800-989-8255. If anybody of our members want to rebut that? Mr. McCARTHY: Well, let me just say very briefly - and we're in an interesting situation\u2026 FLATOW: You're wearing your Science Debate 2008 button, for folks who can't see that at home. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. McCARTHY: And on the steering committee at that. FLATOW: And also, Francesca is also a supporter of\u2026 Mr. McCARTHY: And - so, Dave, you know, for the first time in my memory - you can correct me if you remember otherwise - we have statements on Web sites right now. There weren't Web sites way back when, but there are public statements by the leading contenders in the primaries right now saying where their interests are and what their priorities would be. And I've come back to what Rosina said that one of the roles of the federal government and certainly leadership of the highest level is to help guide this question of priorities, so - you know, I don't think a debate has to be loud and brash. I think to have a discussion to allow us to see. I mean, candidates who for the, you know, there was nothing like this four years ago. We saw nothing from the candidates. Four years earlier, just on the issue of climate change, you couldn't really tell the difference between Mr. Bush's and Mr. Gore's positions. They both said if they're elected, I would reduce CO2 emissions. But we have some really thoughtful statements from the candidates now. And I think it would be helpful for all of us to hear those articulated and see where some of the differences are. FLATOW: Okay. Let's go to the audience. Yes. Ms. LILIA GRAN (Audience Member): Thank you. Good afternoon. My name is Lilia Gran(ph). I'm a second year graduate student in technical and scientific communication at James Madison University in Virginia. And Ira, I wanted to go back to a question that you asked a few minutes ago about who controls the direction of science. That's actually something we've been discussing over the past couple of weeks in one of my classes, specifically, the science of climate and policy. And I wanted to ask the panelists how they feel about privately funded think tanks and their strong steering of legislature as opposed to the public opinion. Any man getting out in the street and saying this is what we're interested in. What do you feel about these privately funded think tanks controlling\u2026 FLATOW: Could you name a couple that you're thinking about, for example? Do you have one or two in mind? Ms. GRAN: I prefer not to. FLATOW: Okay. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: We're trying get a few facts in here. But that's okay. We'll - it's a good question. Mr. GOLDSTON: I mean\u2026 FLATOW: David, do you want to start? Mr. GOLDSTON: Sure. FLATOW: Someone who's been the target of these think tanks perhaps? Mr. GOLDSTON: Right. I think, think tanks are part of the process just like everyone else is. I think some think tanks do more thinking than others. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. GOLDSTON: And I think\u2026 FLATOW: Would another name be lobbyist for these people? Mr. GOLDSTON: Well, actually - so the concern is - a concern that I have about the think tank community is not them being involved. It's a couple of things. One is funding should be transparent, which it isn't. That doesn't mean that immediately because someone got funding from X, you should discount them, but you shouldn't have a chance to know. The other thing is there are think tanks on both sides of the ideological divide that I think do - tend to do open intellectually honest work and there are others that basically have become arms of a party or an industry where you can predict what they're going to do before you open it up. And they'll - if you go and check some of what's in there, it's not as convincing. And I think it's a marketplace of ideas. It's up to the people who are on the receiving end to make that distinction. But I don't see anything pernicious about the fact that think tanks are out there. There should be much more openness about where the funding is. But I think people have a sense of which ones are basically lobbying groups under another name and which ones are more broadly believed. And then there are honest broker organizations for disputes like the National Academy of Sciences, the Health Effects Institute, that even in this polarized environment, still are viewed as a place where people can generally go and get an opinion that is at least hard to dismiss without having looked at it closely. Ms. GRAN: National Research Council. Mr. GOLDSTON: Right, which is the arm of the academy, so I think we need very much to protect the reputation and credibility of those entities because honest brokers are few and far between these days. FLATOW: We're talking about science and public policy this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News here in Boston. Let's go to this side of the room. Yes. Doctor HOLLY GIVEN (Consortium for Ocean Leadership): Thank you. I'm Holly Given with Consortium for Ocean Leadership in Washington. And I'd like to ask the panel to what extent they feel agency funding in the interagency process had been used to influence policies informed or maybe as not informed by science. FLATOW: When you say agencies, what do you mean? Dr. GIVEN: Oh. Federal agencies that have employed the federal scientists that we began talking about today. Yeah. FLATOW: Go ahead, Francesca. Dr. GRIFO: Okay. I think there are two separate debates. There's this broad question of the overview levels of science for those agencies and I want to set that aside because that is certainly, you know, a conversation that takes place between Congress and the whole appropriations. But I think one of the things that we've observed is within agencies, that we have observed some programs being penalized, programs that were going to perhaps produce results, scientific results, that were going to be inconvenient for policy decisions that the administration wanted to make. And I think that is a pernicious kind of scary thing. I mean, I think there are big examples of that like the NASA Mission to Earth Satellite Systems, that the National Academies has documented some of those programs not being fully funded and being cut which will really interfere with our ability to observe the Earth and understand the Earth. But also smaller ones like the Toxic Release Inventory, which is a very important program. If you don't know about it, that really means that all you have to do is go, type in your zip code and you can find out what the various industries in your area are emitting. And that's an incredibly valuable tool. And there has been assault after assault on that particular program in this administration. So I think, it really there are two different bits about the funding there. Mr. GOLDSTON: But I think it's also\u2026 Dr. GRIFO: Very distinct. FLATOW: David. Mr. GOLDSTON: One of the things Francesca said just sort of underscores the problem with having a politicized atmosphere because then it taints the discussion of everything, so the NASA definitely cut back on Earth science. I was very involved in trying to reverse that. But I don't think that had anything to do with the politics of climate science. That had to do with internal issues in NASA and the interests of the administrator and the cost of the shuttle and so forth. And frankly, in the '09 budget, they've actually reversed that. They've reversed it by taking money from other stuff that I'd rather see funded as well. But I don't think that that was really a political decision. But the fact that someone can raise a question about whether it was or not shows the danger of when everything gets politicized, it's very hard to have those kinds of discussions. So it's an interesting case. FLATOW: Do you think we're entering - I have about a minute left - do you think we're entering a different era now - where we may - we may be able to have those discussions or are the waters so poisoned, it's going to take a long time? Mr. GOLDSTON: I think it really does partly depending on what happens in November regardless of which side wins, I think, it's - there'll be an effort to start again that any new administration has regardless of party and it will depend on whether they really try to directly address this concern. FLATOW: Rosina, do you think - how quickly a new science advisor gets appointed, well, tell us about the future? Dr. BIERBAUM: Absolutely. The Clinton administration appointed theirs by Christmas and he still got back to singing his Christmas choir. I think that's very important. You got to be part of the team that's building what's going to happen in this White House, setting this strategic direction and be a real player. Yes, early is better. Very important. Mr. GOLDSTON: Early is better, but the Clinton administration was almost unique in getting somebody in that quickly because of the connection that Vice President Gore had with science communities. So I would say, I wouldn't view that as an absolute indicator, although it would be great if someone were appointed that early. FLATOW: And there you have it. We've run out of time. I'd like thank all my guests: Francesca Grifo, director of the Scientific Integrity Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists; David Goldston, former chief of staff of the House Committee on Science. He's now visiting lecturer at Harvard University; Rosina Bierbaum, former administrator in the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and she is dean of the School of Natural Resources and Environment at the University of Michigan; and James McCarthy, co-chair of the IPCC Working Group II and now professor of biological oceanography at Harvard University. Thank you all for taking time to be with us today. Mr. McCARTHY: Thank you, Ira.

We're actually videoing this meeting today. It will be up there on our Web site with our other videos hoping that you'll also send us some of your videos that we might feature on SCIENCE FRIDAY. And we're also looking for blogging and your participation in anything we do on our Web site. I'm Ira Flatow in Boston.  IRA FLATOW, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  Yesterday, several prominent scientists demanded that the federal government guaranteed basic research freedoms for scientists working within their ranks. They detailed instances of political interference with science in several federal agencies - the Consumer Products Safety Commission, the Food and Drug Administration, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.  Among their claims, reports being edited to misrepresent scientific findings. Agencies' reluctance to regulate products, scientific findings ignored in policy rulings and resistance to scientific appointments.  Today we're broadcasting from the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Boston. And this hour, we're joined by scientists who will make the case for Congress and the next administration to set policies that will ensure the scientific freedom of federal scientists.  We're going to talk about the ways to strengthen science in the federal government, from keeping politics out of political appointments, to protecting whistleblowers, to ensuring that scientists can present their findings to their peers and the public.  And if you'd like to join the discussion, give us a call. Our number is 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK. And if you're here in the audience at the meeting, we invite you to step up to the mic with your questions. You can also join us in Second Life; just go to the SCIENCE FRIDAY island there with your avatar and you can pick up our free T-shirt and also ask a question of our avatar over there. As always, you can surf over to our Web Site at ScienceFriday. com for more information.  Let me introduce my guests. Francesca Grifo is a senior scientist and director of the Scientific Integrity Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington.  Welcome to the program, Dr. Grifo.  Doctor FRANCESCA GRIFO (Senior Scientist; Director, Scientific Integrity Program, Union of Concerned Scientists): Thank you very much.  FLATOW: David Goldston was chief of staff for the House Committee on Science from 2001 to 2006. He's a visiting lecturer in the Center for Environment at Harvard and right here in - across the river in Cambridge. They hate to mix that up, don't they? I want to mix up Boston and Cambridge in this area.  Welcome to the program, David.  Mr. DAVID GOLDSTON (Former Chief of Staff, House Committee on Science; Visiting Lecturer, Center for Environment, Harvard University): Thanks.  FLATOW: Rosina Bierbaum was associate director for Environment in the Office of Science and Technology Policy from 1998 to 2001, and acting director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy from January to October 2001. She's a professor and dean of the School of Natural Resources and Environment at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.  Welcome to the program, Dr. Bierbaum.  Doctor ROSINA BIERBAUM (Former Acting Director and Former Associate Director for Environment, Office of Science and Technology Policy; Professor and Dean, School of Natural Resources and Environment, University of Michigan): I'm very pleased to be here. Thank you.  FLATOW: Thanks for taking that long journey.  James McCarthy was a co-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - the famous IPCC - that was the Working Group II. He's president elect of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and professor of biological oceanography, at Harvard in Cambridge.  Welcome to the SCIENCE FRIDAY.  Mr. JAMES McCARTHY (President Elect, American Association for the Advancement of Science; Co-chair, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group II for the Third IPCC Assessment; Professor of Biological Oceanography, Harvard University): Thank you.  FLATOW: Good to have you back.  Let me begin with you, Dr. Grifo, because it was basically the Union of Concerned Scientists' statement that I was quoting at the top of the program. Give us an idea of - the report that you outlined all kinds of instances in which you think that science and politics were too - too many times interwoven.  Dr. GRIFO: Yed, Ira, I mean, we've been documenting that for a number of years. We've been looking at these various examples and I would have people go to a very fun feature on our Web site, called the A to Z Guide to Abuses in Science. It's a permutated periodic table of the elements where each element is actually representing an abuse. And they're all very well documented there. But they range, you know, very broadly for all kinds of things. And you mentioned some of them but I think, you know, falsifying data, fabricating results, selectively editing documents, creating false uncertainty, tampering with the scientific procedures. I mean, it's a very long list of the ways. But I think it's not just those specific abuses of science, it's also the more systemic changes that we've seen, the way that insider, you know, games have been played with the rules that are really going to be very challenging to undo.  FLATOW: And what are you calling for then? How are you calling to change all of this?  Dr. GRIFO: Well, I think, essentially, we need to create a situation, to create conditions in the federal government where federal scientists can do their jobs. It's not that scientists are, you know, a special class or anything, but in fact, these are very important people in the federal government. They serve the American public. The work they do is important. And we need to give them conditions where they can be effective. Some parts of that are obviously giving them some basic protections. You mentioned whistleblower protections.  Other parts of that have to do with transparency, increasing the, you know, we can't be everywhere. We can't be watching. So the point is if we open up the government, if we have these things more out in the open, then everyone can actually be a part of that conversation and part of the people watching.  FLATOW: David Goldston, you worked in Congress, your congressman who you represented, Sherry Boehlert was very instrumental and very open in his ideas about science and shared very much his views about science and was never afraid to talk about science. Do you agree with the union's concern here about what happened in the past and what might we will have to watch out for in the future?  Mr. GOLDSTON: Well, obviously, I'm not familiar with each case, but I think there have been problems in terms of abuses of science and efforts to squelch science - scientists. The most noted and documented example is probably Jim Hansen at NASA, where even NASA acknowledged that people there hadn't been abiding by the rules. And that may be also one of the few success stories because I think the rules, they were put in place after that incident, everybody including Hansen views as a model of what might be done to institute the kinds of policies that Francesca is calling for.  I think the biggest problem is or at least as big a problem is self-censorship. The people now are worried that someone else will worry that someone else will worry that someone else will worry and that's much harder to root out. Every time we tried to figure out what was going on at NOAA, for example, where there have been some of these cases. A lot of them were sort of people worrying that the next person up the line was going to create a problem for them and so they censored themselves.  So I think, creating a new atmosphere would be helpful beyond actually rooting out real problems but changing the atmosphere, which I think the reputation and the sense of what's happening is even worse than what was happening, and that's created its own set of problems.  FLATOW: Do you think that any new administration whether it's Democratic or Republican will be different?  Mr. GOLDSTON: I think so, but I also think some of these problems are going to continue regardless of what party is in power because some of them involve really policy disputes that are very close and intermingled to the science disputes. So everybody - scientists and policymakers tend to frame policy issues as - is the science on our side because that's easier than having a full-blown debate about the policy differences. And I think that's happened a lot. That's like that happened before this administration that's going to continue after it and I think as issues get more difficult as they have a basis in science, everyone tries to make it sound like the science has determinative that creates a lot of confusion. And that's likely to continue no matter who's in office.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Jim McCarthy, you served as co-chair of the IPCC and the Working Group II on climate change. Do you feel that U. S. policies on climate change, the U. S. policies on climate change are changing - are they evolving a little bit more now than when the day when President Bush said that a report put out by the State Department was something done by the bureaucracy?  Mr. McCARTHY: Well, Ira, I think they are. And the disappointment is it has taken a long time and if we go back to 2001 when the IPCC report that I was involved in was released, it seemed to many of us that this was the first time the IPCC had identified unequivocally impacts of climate change. One could go back to the early report and say, well, there were a lot of hypothesis about future impacts. But for the first time, we could see impacts. Moreover, we could see that the negative aspect of those was far outweighing what some people had long thought, well, there'll be positives, as well.  And so, just coming back, I think, to this point of the transparency of science, I think the scientists who were involved in studies of this sort are doing this because they believe that the best information should be on the table for the policy process to review. And if in the course of getting to the policy discussion that David was just referring to, there's a filtering, there's a selection.  Now, we know that every administration - and I also, I liked your openning comment about the case for Congress and for the administration because I think we have a tendency to focus too much on the administration here. We need to keep in mind that the Congress has a very important role to play in this. And that if in the course of moving from the knowledge base - and we know in some cases if it's military intelligence or perhaps some of the economic information the government has - they would have a reason for not making that public. But that science should be transparent. We should all know what that science is and any science generated by our federal scientists should be available for all of us to see at all times.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. Bierbaum, you sort of had an insider's look at all of this, this year. Can you give us your perspective and how to look from there?  Dr. BIERBAUM: Well, I stayed as the acting science advisor for the very long wait for Jack Marburger to show up on Halloween of 2001, and there's certainly was, unfortunately, I think, both a systemic distortion and a suppression of science during that time. That's why I signed as one of the 62 original scientists four years ago that there were problems in what was happening in terms of health science, in terms of climate science, in terms of national security science because five administrations' worth of advisors in these different areas compared notes and we felt it had never happened to this extent before.  But to pick up on where Jim McCarthy led us in terms of 2001, so here it is Inauguration Day, 2001, I'm left holding the OSTP mantle, we gaveled down at exactly 12 noon, inauguration time, the sentence that says most of the warming in the last 50 years is due to humans. And we all thought we have a new president, we have a strong, clear science statement, we have a mandate to act, and of course, it was within weeks that the U. S. walked from the Kyoto Protocol.  Also, the National Academy of Sciences was asked to critique, in a kind sense, the IPCC, but the science office which I was representing was not asked to help define those questions. The climate change science program was reorganized so that it reported through political channels, not to the Office of Science and Technology Policy. We were told we no longer needed to send in weekly science reports over to the West Wing. They would call us if they needed us.  And so it was a very sharp sea change in sort of the attention to science in general and the attention to this very strong climate science that was coming through the community loud and clear.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. All right, we have to take a short break. We're going to come back and talk lots more about the science and the role of science in public policy and how we can get more and better science opinions without being filtered or censored out to the public or actually to be published.  So stay with us. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. If you're here in the audience, you can go right here to the microphones sitting here waiting for you. Don't be shy and don't be afraid. We'll be right back after this short break.  I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  We're talking this hour about strengthening science in the federal government, with my guests, Francesca Grifo of the Union of Concerned Scientists; David Goldston, former chief of staff for the House Committee on Science and visiting lecturer at Harvard; Rosina Bierbaum, a scientist who served in the Office of Science and Technology Policy in both the Clinton and Bush administration, and now a dean at the University of Michigan; James McCarthy, co-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group II and the new president elect of the AAAS.  Our number, 1-800-989-8255.  Dr. Bierbaum, you're making some points about being on the inside of - I guess, what you might call the office of the science advisor.  Dr. BIERBAUM: Mm-hmm.  FLATOW: It's so also always informally. Does a science advisor or did it have much of an input on hardly anything in this administration, the last administration, in your experience?  Dr. BIERBAUM: Well, I felt in the last administration it really did have a big impact. There were four associate directors who are all Senate confirmed, keeping their eye on different pieces of the environmental research budget as well as the policy development. But I think I would argue that every major decision that was made in the Clinton administration had a scientist at the table. And science was often not the loudest voice but it was a voice. And so whether it was regulations or whether it was a science input to treaties or whether it was what the federal and environmental budget should be or all of the science budget should be, there would be the scientists there arguing extensively for that. So Jack Gibbons and then Neal Lane were always central to all the decision making.  All that changed, though, it was very hard to get a seat at any table in the 10 months that I was staying as the acting advisor. And so, for example, with CEQ - the Council on Environmental Quality - becoming really the default climate empire in the White House - that was very different. When energy policy was put together in the Bush administration, the National Economics Council was the lead on that, not the science advisor's office.  FLATOW: David Goldston, did your boss have any better luck with getting attention for science? Let me just specifically - on this program last January, a year ago, you said that the climate change is one of the areas that the new Congress would make its mark on. Well, how would you grade that new Congress?  Mr. GOLDSTON: Incomplete.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Now that you're a professor, you can give those grades.  Mr. GOLDSTON: That's right. And I was familiar with that grade as a student too.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. GOLDSTON: I would say - what I said, I think, in January was the one science issue where the change in party control might make a difference is climate. And I think that actually has proven to be the case. There were very few hearings on climate, with Republicans in charge of the Congress, in the Senate where Senator Inhofe chaired the Environment Committee. There were mostly hearings about how climate was a quote/unquote, \"hoax. \" I think that's all changed. I think climate is very much on the agenda. There are bills in both Houses. The energy bill moved through less than what some of us would have liked, but certainly, a heck of a lot more than what have been done in recent years including the first increases in CAFE standards and fuel economy standards for several decades. So I think the - that did change because of the party control.  And the other thing that's happening which Jim McCarthy indicated is that even within the Republican side, even within the administration, there's a little bit more movement about we have to talk about what to do about those. I think, the bulk of the Republicans are still not ready to go to mandatory controls which my boss thought was needed.  FLATOW: And your boss was a Republican?  Mr. GOLDSTON: Yes. And which the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party has supported right, so even though it's not what he's emphasizing right now. But - so, I think, the climate issue is far more fluid than it was a year ago, that's partly because of change in political control, and also partly because of the impact of the most recent IPCC report; even the press coverage of climate change significantly after that. All the - trying to balance with some quotes from the few scientists or former scientists who weren't part of the consensus on climate - a lot of it has fallen away, so I think that issue has really changed both because of the science and because of the politics.  But, I think, there's a case where that means we're no longer hopefully going to be debating with science the kinds of things that the Bush administration did ask the academy to look into.  But we are going to be debating what to do about it, and that's a policy question. There is no science position on whether you should have a carbon tax. There is no science position on the values question even if we - if this is a problem that's worth dealing with. I certainly think that it is, but I think what is going to happen now is we're moving past the science debate to a policy debate and the way scientists need to think about that and participate is different is from the place we have been stuck in for the last decade or so.  FLATOW: In what way?  Mr. GOLDSTON: In that before, there really was a debate about what is the science tell - it's a political debate about what the science tells us. And I think now there's going to be much - there is already much broader acceptance that we are facing human-induced climate change. And the question is what to do about it, that's largely a policy question. I would also say that many debates, many discussions about the way science and politics intersect that are held right now really view climate as the model issue.  And I think it's really an unusual issue. It's rare that the political debate is centered on a purely scientific question which it was because there was this, at least, in Congress, a debate about whether climate change was real. And that there's a clear consensus answer usually scientists are more divided. Here, there's not only a clear consensus answer but a codified clear consensus answer in IPCC. And it's going to take a while for that to move through the system.  Generally, the opening question is only partly science, if science at all, and the answer the community can give is much more variable. So climate's unusual that way and it's going to now be shifting, I think, to a much more policy-centered debate.  FLATOW: Let me ask all of you. Let me begin with Dr. Grifo. Are there then issues because the environment has becoming as balloons, so to speak, as a bigger issue? Are there other important issues that are now under the radar screen with science policy? You know, I think about the situation with the FDA, for example, you know, it doesn't get talked about as much as it might have; other kinds of issues that are important but are not being discussed.  Dr. GRIFO: Well, I'll just jump in, I mean, I think that there are these issues across the agencies. I mean, this not just about climate when we look at the political interference issues. We have survey results from nine different agencies where we have 1,191 scientists who have told us that they fear retaliation. So those are all not, you know, climate scientists. It's clearly much, much more broad than that.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. They're willing to speak up more now. Are they able to speak up more now than they used to be?  Dr. GRIFO: Well, it's interesting because, I think, you know, you referred to the NASA example, and I think, that NASA and NOAA, particularly NOAA really tried after these events to change things. And unfortunately, shortly after that, a new media policy came down from the Department of Commerce that essentially was about 15 pages long all about you can do it but it's only in this condition and you have to, and it was a very, I think, frightening document for a federal - I mean, for a federal scientist. And only at the very end did it say, well, actually, you do have a few protections. So I think very good people in, you know, various agencies are trying to make things better, but unfortunately because we have the centralization top down, it's very difficult.  FLATOW: Jim, you look like you want to jump in.  Let me ask everybody here, if you'd like to get up to a mic and ask a question, there's a space for you to do that.  Yes.  Mr. McCARTHY: Actually, I was getting edgy when David was speaking. I think one way to interpret David's message would be that the case for really understanding the science of climate change is pretty much past and now we're talking about policy. And I really strongly disagree with that. I think the - if you just look at the last four or five years and say, well, where did we think we could possibly, realistically imagine policy measures taking us in terms of a altered course for the future, a reduced concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  And when the science plays out when you look at our understanding of the system and the models that project various features, it's pretty clear that it would be - a world would be so different from what we have today. That it's interesting now to see that not only is it a sense among the scientific community who look at these things but even in the political realm.  If you could have imagined just four years ago, the leading contenders in the primaries advocating a reduction of fossil fuel emissions by 80 percent, or these were greenhouse gases, by 80 percent by 2050, it was unthinkable. And yet, if you look and say, well, what would that world be like, there are many aspects of it that I think we'd be awfully uncomfortable with.  So I think the policy has to be continually informed by what the science can tell us as to what the implications are particular to policy measures might be. It is an iterative process and that's what we need to work on.  Mr. GOLDSTON: And I agree with that entirely. What I meant to say was before, there was an issue that was purely science being asked them with that. Now, we're at these issues where it is entangled and it is iterative and it had to be informed by policy but science can no longer be determinative.  The issue, is climate change real, is an issue where science alone can and should and can speak to answer that question. The kinds of questions now - what level should we set greenhouse gas emissions at - that's an answer where science has to be one input and that input needs to be constantly refreshed and the research behind it needs to be constantly funded. But the science alone can't determine the answer to that policy question. So that that's where I think the distinction is but I don't differ with anything that Jim just said.  FLATOW: So who should take the lead in these things? Should it be - should, I mean, should the science advisors - do the president's science advisor have some sort of autonomy to speak up when he or she would like to without feeling that their job is in jeopardy? I mean\u2026  Mr. GOLDSTON: That's, I would say, I mean, that's not the role the science advisor, I mean, the science advisors in the White House, they're - I mean, they should certainly feel free to speak to the president which has worked better in some administrations than others. But the science advisor is not a free standing civil service science office. The kinds of agencies that Francesca was listing are, and each agency has its own curious problems.  So part of the problem with Commerce Department document was they put out a document that applied to the entire department - scientists and non-scientists. There was a lot of debate within the department and I assure you we suggested that that was not the way to do this.  And so, they put out a document that refers to, you know, what some economists may say about economic policy and confuse that with what a scientist might say about their own scientific work, not a policy matter. And that's why the final policy came out so inadequately.  FLATOW: So should Congress - should a strong Congress person have a voice in these things? I mean, who decides the direction of science? We never hear that debate coming up very much. It always sort of is an undercurrent when some problem. We don't talk about - we don't hear very much - there may be hearings going on, but we never hear very much about them.  Mr. GOLDSTON: Well, I think both the - I mean, it gets to this issue of independence. I mean, that's one of those issues that's in between, so you want science director to, in part, to answer questions that are of interest to the policymakers. You also want it partly driven by the community. And so Congress is generally, by and large, there are exceptions, set broad guidance on this is a general area we should look at. Climate sciences - climate science, say, should be funded. But they're not getting into the specific areas in detail because that would be viewed as something that the community should look at by itself.  But I think we do need some direction, I mean, in certain areas, for example, NASA inadequately funding remote sensing that we need for climate change. Congress has had to step in and say no, we need more of that.  Dr. BIERBAUM: Well, I definitely\u2026  FLATOW: Go ahead.  Dr. BIERBAUM: I definitely think that they're - we can't do all good science at once. And so we need to have some strategic planning exercises. The science community is actually very bad at setting priorities within a discipline - let alone across disciplines, but that's going to become increasingly important as these budgets get tighter and tighter. And so I think the effort that the National Science and Technology Council attempted under the previous president and under the science advisors of Clinton to kind of coordinate across the federal agencies to think about emerging areas, to figure out how much needed to be put as federal entities into high-risk longer term research as well as what kind of applied or near-term solutions we need was a very valuable exercise.  I think we've lost some ground now but I think there does need to be a strategic planning process. And in those exercise, 13 agencies have kind of horse trade issues, databases and try to figure out what was knowable and what time frame.  And just to come back to whether the climate science has settled for a second, I think yes, we know that climate's changing; and yes, we know, it's changing fast. But you know what? We don't know what to do about it, not just in terms of mitigation, but in terms of how to cope with climate change, because no matter what we do on the mission side, the changes are going to continue and that is a very rich and under-attended to research agenda coping with climate change.  We've lost a decade in thinking about that. The first national assessment of the impacts of climate change in the U. S. mandated by Congress was effectively subverted by the Bush administration, sank like a stone except for UCS and a few others bringing back these pieces. And then 10-year plan that the Clinton administration was attempting to put forward would have addressed a lot of those issues of what can communities do, what are regional impacts, what are the socioeconomic solutions to climate change. And we've really got a very urgent research agenda there.  FLATOW: Okay. We're talking about science this hour in TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News here in Boston at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting, talking about science and public policy and the directions - how the two may live better together, honestly.  Let's go to the audience for a question here. Right - this young lady right here. Yeah.  Unidentified Woman #1: Hi. I'm actually visiting from Southern California where we've recently been having a large policy issue with the greenhouse gas waiver that California tried to pass with the EPA denied. And I was wondering based on the policy end of it, the national standard would call for less greenhouse gas emissions four years earlier than Californians would. I was wondering if you think - this is sort of directed to anyone - if you think California's greenhouse gas emissions standard was reasonable.  FLATOW: Anybody want to tackle that?  Unidentified Man: It looks like you.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: David?  Mr. GOLDSTON: Well, I think that the administration probably should have granted the waiver. There isn't the precedent to not grant a waiver, although there are some tricky legal issues because of the way that mileage is regulated rather than clean air standards. But on the specifics of whether it's the best number from a scientific point of view or what the implications are from the scientific point of view, I would turn to the scientists.  FLATOW: I feel like it's a - if you remember that - I've got a secret but people would jockingly(ph) stand up but I don't want to stand up first.  Yes.  Mr. McCARTHY: I just like to point out and this is a really good example of leadership at a level where we wouldn't necessarily be expected of it that to see states now taking the positions that they are, to see communities taking the positions they are, to see the voice of people being heard locally and at the state level, and yet quite a disconnect when we get to the sort of issues that have been raised here with regard to the federal policy.  FLATOW: This is unusual for states to stand up but they've doing in - and across the board in different issues. Could pollution must move from state to state, the car - you know, car regulations, things like that.  Mr. McCARTHY: Yeah. We've seen in the leadership of governors\u2026  FLATOW: Governors.  Mr. MCCARTHY: \u2026and the leadership of mayors have really been extraordinarily prominent in this area.  FLATOW: And some them are banding together - they create little regional issues, right Francesca?  Dr. GRIFO: I guess so. It's - I mean, I think that what we're seeing is when the federal government does not fulfill its responsibility when the conditions there are not such that these things can happen, the states are stepping into the void.  FLATOW: All right.  Mr. GOLDSTON: I think the states have done this in a lot of areas. The thing that makes it unusual in climate change is it's not a problem that just affects one region and the impact any state or region can make is limited and yet they're still doing it. I think it's a sign of, you know, the ideological polarization and stalemate in Washington which has caused everything to go further down.  FLATOW: We'll talk more about that and your questions. Our number, 1-800-989-8255.  Stay with us. We'll be right back from Boston after the short break.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  We're talking this hour about science and public policy in the federal government. Our guests are Francesca Grifo, director of the Scientific Integrity Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists; David Goldston, former chief of staff for the House Committee on Science and he's visiting lecturer at Harvard; Rosina Bierbaum, former administrator in the Office of Science and Technology Policy in both the Clinton and Bush administrations, and now a dean of the School of Natural Resources and Environment at the University of Michigan; James McCarthy, co-chair of the IPCC Working Group II and professor of biological - oceanography at Harvard University.  Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Let's get a question from the phones here. Let's see if we can go to John(ph) or is it Don(ph) there?  Hi Don. Are you there? No? Well, let's go to the audience and we'll go to the right side.  Hi.  Unidentified Woman #2: Since we've been talking about leadership and advice, I wanted to ask the panelists if they would nominate someone in particular they would like to see as a science advisor.  FLATOW: Aha.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. GRIFO: Well, I don't have a name but I would dive in there and say that the important thing is that it is someone who comes in early. I mean, the fact that Rosina was saying that, you know, Dr. Marburger didn't come in until Halloween from January 20th or around that time for the inauguration, for there to be no one in place for those nine months or 10 - almost 10 months is just ridiculous. So I think the key thing is that we get someone who's at the table.  FLATOW: Do you need someone who is a better organizer or a better scientist?  What do you think, David? Is it someone who knows how to play politics or is going to stick to the hard science?  Mr. GOLDSTON: Well, hopefully, those aren't too absolutely mutually exclusive personal traits, even though it should be someone who can tell the difference between when he's doing or she is doing one or the other.  I think, you know, historically, the thing that's mattered most is the science advisor having a personal relationship of some sort with the president or at least the president being open to a setting up such a relationship. I mean, there have been lots of efforts by statutes and other ways to try to strengthen the science advisor. It's never worked because it's not a line office with a lot of responsibilities, the person either has the presidency or doesn't and so that's really the thing that you have to look at the most.  FLATOW: Rosina, what would you say?  Dr. BIERBAUM: I agree that you need someone who's both a good scientist but also a good synthesizer. It has to be someone who plays well with others and understands when science can be the loudest voice and explain the box that science puts you in as you develop regulations and policy around it but doesn't let anyone get out of the box.  But I think it's also important that this person take advantage of the fact that you can have four Senate-confirmed associate directors because that's four very powerful people that cover areas of science. And very important, I think, we should revert to what the first President Bush did and that is make the head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy also truly the science advisor in that they're named a special assistant to the president. That's a separate reporting line. That does not exist now. And I think that's a great loss.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Frank(ph) in Yamhill. Hi, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  FRANK (Caller): Yes. Hello.  FLATOW: Hi there.  FRANK: Out here in Yamhill, Oregon.  FLATOW: Hi. Go ahead.  FRANK: I'm really very interested in asking your panelists - the great conversation here at the - perhaps talk about the relationship between science, religion, moral decision making and public policy. For example, the systematic efforts in recent years, I think, many people would agree that the efforts to raise all sorts of doubts about the science of global warming. We saw before that the efforts to raise doubts about the question of smoking. It seems to me that this isn't just a question of science and politics. In many cases, a question of science and perhaps versions of religion that are not quite so, I think, open-minded, and questions of the nature of moral decision making.  So science and other disciplines and the cross, you know, fertilization that comes from that interaction, I'm looking hopefully to the future beyond this administration, I'm wondering if the panelists can speak to this.  FLATOW: Frank, good question.  How do we handle that?  Dr. GRIFO: One thing I'd like to say is that, I think, all of the major religious groups of the world have actually made a statement now that climate change is a moral challenge. And I think it was very telling when the evangelicals came out with their very powerful statement a little more than a year ago that called for acting now. And I believe that the Catholic bishop's statement was very powerful saying we're not scientists, but we believe what the science says and we have a moral responsibility to those who follow us to leave them a sustainable planet. And we do have the possibility of being the first generation to leave the next, a truly irreversible problem. I think the promotion of giving up carbon for lent is a very interesting thing that some of the religious groups are talking about, too. So I actually think religion and climate change have found a useful pairing.  FLATOW: Jim?  Mr. McCARTHY: I would just echo that comment - every interaction I've had with religious groups over the last few years has led me to believe that there is no fundamental difference between our concern for the future of the planet whether we call it creation care or anything else, we're all talking about the same thing. I see no conflict at all with any religious group with which I have had an interaction.  FLATOW: David?  Mr. GOLDSTON: But I think we need to make a distinction between cases where religious groups are taking issue with the science - evolution, obviously, being that the most prominent case and most serious. And issues where they're taking issue with policy that around the science, say stem cells, where I think that's sometimes the way it's argued. Again, muddies the waters but fundamentally, that's not a debate over stem - the nature of stem cells and what we know scientifically, it's a religious debate - ethical debate about how we proceed and what we do research on and so forth, I think, that's legitimate. Obviously, groups weighing in on moral questions involving what we do about climate change. That's different from weighing in on the findings of the science itself, which is why the evolution controversy is so difficult.  FLATOW: Well, while - because you brought up the word debate, you wrote something in Nature - an article in Nature - is it this week, in Nature, where you opposed the idea of having a Science Debate 2008 among the presidential candidates here. And I want to give you an opportunity for you state your reasons why.  Mr. GOLDSTON: So I wouldn't quite say oppose. I'd say people are rushing into it without thinking about it, and that it - my guess is that it would do nothing to - either nothing or create a backlash, so that's close to oppose.  But I raised a couple of issues\u2026  FLATOW: I can see your years on the Hill are paying off.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. GOLDSTON: The - a couple of issues. Number one is that some of the issues that have been slated for a science debate are again, policy issues, not science, and to send a message that this is about who's good on science is misleading. I would love to hear a debate about what the candidates think about climate change or energy policy that's not fundamentally a science issue.  Secondly, I think, there's this sense that scientists have because the budget doesn't work out the way they would most prefer, and so forth that nobody's paying attention; they don't get respected and so forth, when actually, they have - are held actually in, fairly high esteem and so that some of the reasons the - behind the debate are suspect.  There's an assumption that making something a higher profile political issue will necessarily pay off in financial dividends that hasn't always been the case, science agencies don't necessarily do better when they're public - in the public spotlight.  And finally, given that there's all this concern about politicization of science that's one of the things behind the debate. Putting science in the middle of the most politicized kind of discussion you could possibly have doesn't seem to me to be the most likely or way to tamp down that concern. If you want a debate about what's politics, what's science - having it in a big, loud brash forum doesn't seem to be the way to settle that. So my point is not that science is separate from politics, not that scientists shouldn't be involved in politics, in fact, my fear is that they're trying to take a shortcut doing something that's largely show business and not get getting involved in sort of the day-to-day politics which is much more likely to pay off.  And if we look at what's the way debates have worked so far and what kinds of issues they're good at, and what kinds of impressions they leave, I don't think that maps very well with what the advocates of the Science Debate are looking for.  FLATOW: Okay. 1-800-989-8255. If anybody of our members want to rebut that?  Mr. McCARTHY: Well, let me just say very briefly - and we're in an interesting situation\u2026  FLATOW: You're wearing your Science Debate 2008 button, for folks who can't see that at home.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. McCARTHY: And on the steering committee at that.  FLATOW: And also, Francesca is also a supporter of\u2026  Mr. McCARTHY: And - so, Dave, you know, for the first time in my memory - you can correct me if you remember otherwise - we have statements on Web sites right now. There weren't Web sites way back when, but there are public statements by the leading contenders in the primaries right now saying where their interests are and what their priorities would be.  And I've come back to what Rosina said that one of the roles of the federal government and certainly leadership of the highest level is to help guide this question of priorities, so - you know, I don't think a debate has to be loud and brash. I think to have a discussion to allow us to see. I mean, candidates who for the, you know, there was nothing like this four years ago. We saw nothing from the candidates. Four years earlier, just on the issue of climate change, you couldn't really tell the difference between Mr. Bush's and Mr. Gore's positions. They both said if they're elected, I would reduce CO2 emissions.  But we have some really thoughtful statements from the candidates now. And I think it would be helpful for all of us to hear those articulated and see where some of the differences are.  FLATOW: Okay. Let's go to the audience. Yes.  Ms. LILIA GRAN (Audience Member): Thank you. Good afternoon. My name is Lilia Gran(ph). I'm a second year graduate student in technical and scientific communication at James Madison University in Virginia. And Ira, I wanted to go back to a question that you asked a few minutes ago about who controls the direction of science. That's actually something we've been discussing over the past couple of weeks in one of my classes, specifically, the science of climate and policy. And I wanted to ask the panelists how they feel about privately funded think tanks and their strong steering of legislature as opposed to the public opinion. Any man getting out in the street and saying this is what we're interested in. What do you feel about these privately funded think tanks controlling\u2026  FLATOW: Could you name a couple that you're thinking about, for example? Do you have one or two in mind?  Ms. GRAN: I prefer not to.  FLATOW: Okay.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: We're trying get a few facts in here. But that's okay. We'll - it's a good question.  Mr. GOLDSTON: I mean\u2026  FLATOW: David, do you want to start?  Mr. GOLDSTON: Sure.  FLATOW: Someone who's been the target of these think tanks perhaps?  Mr. GOLDSTON: Right. I think, think tanks are part of the process just like everyone else is. I think some think tanks do more thinking than others.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. GOLDSTON: And I think\u2026  FLATOW: Would another name be lobbyist for these people?  Mr. GOLDSTON: Well, actually - so the concern is - a concern that I have about the think tank community is not them being involved. It's a couple of things. One is funding should be transparent, which it isn't. That doesn't mean that immediately because someone got funding from X, you should discount them, but you shouldn't have a chance to know.  The other thing is there are think tanks on both sides of the ideological divide that I think do - tend to do open intellectually honest work and there are others that basically have become arms of a party or an industry where you can predict what they're going to do before you open it up. And they'll - if you go and check some of what's in there, it's not as convincing. And I think it's a marketplace of ideas. It's up to the people who are on the receiving end to make that distinction.  But I don't see anything pernicious about the fact that think tanks are out there. There should be much more openness about where the funding is. But I think people have a sense of which ones are basically lobbying groups under another name and which ones are more broadly believed. And then there are honest broker organizations for disputes like the National Academy of Sciences, the Health Effects Institute, that even in this polarized environment, still are viewed as a place where people can generally go and get an opinion that is at least hard to dismiss without having looked at it closely.  Ms. GRAN: National Research Council.  Mr. GOLDSTON: Right, which is the arm of the academy, so I think we need very much to protect the reputation and credibility of those entities because honest brokers are few and far between these days.  FLATOW: We're talking about science and public policy this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News here in Boston.  Let's go to this side of the room. Yes.  Doctor HOLLY GIVEN (Consortium for Ocean Leadership): Thank you. I'm Holly Given with Consortium for Ocean Leadership in Washington. And I'd like to ask the panel to what extent they feel agency funding in the interagency process had been used to influence policies informed or maybe as not informed by science.  FLATOW: When you say agencies, what do you mean?  Dr. GIVEN: Oh. Federal agencies that have employed the federal scientists that we began talking about today. Yeah.  FLATOW: Go ahead, Francesca.  Dr. GRIFO: Okay. I think there are two separate debates. There's this broad question of the overview levels of science for those agencies and I want to set that aside because that is certainly, you know, a conversation that takes place between Congress and the whole appropriations.  But I think one of the things that we've observed is within agencies, that we have observed some programs being penalized, programs that were going to perhaps produce results, scientific results, that were going to be inconvenient for policy decisions that the administration wanted to make. And I think that is a pernicious kind of scary thing.  I mean, I think there are big examples of that like the NASA Mission to Earth Satellite Systems, that the National Academies has documented some of those programs not being fully funded and being cut which will really interfere with our ability to observe the Earth and understand the Earth.  But also smaller ones like the Toxic Release Inventory, which is a very important program. If you don't know about it, that really means that all you have to do is go, type in your zip code and you can find out what the various industries in your area are emitting. And that's an incredibly valuable tool. And there has been assault after assault on that particular program in this administration. So I think, it really there are two different bits about the funding there.  Mr. GOLDSTON: But I think it's also\u2026  Dr. GRIFO: Very distinct.  FLATOW: David.  Mr. GOLDSTON: One of the things Francesca said just sort of underscores the problem with having a politicized atmosphere because then it taints the discussion of everything, so the NASA definitely cut back on Earth science. I was very involved in trying to reverse that. But I don't think that had anything to do with the politics of climate science. That had to do with internal issues in NASA and the interests of the administrator and the cost of the shuttle and so forth.  And frankly, in the '09 budget, they've actually reversed that. They've reversed it by taking money from other stuff that I'd rather see funded as well. But I don't think that that was really a political decision. But the fact that someone can raise a question about whether it was or not shows the danger of when everything gets politicized, it's very hard to have those kinds of discussions. So it's an interesting case.  FLATOW: Do you think we're entering - I have about a minute left - do you think we're entering a different era now - where we may - we may be able to have those discussions or are the waters so poisoned, it's going to take a long time?  Mr. GOLDSTON: I think it really does partly depending on what happens in November regardless of which side wins, I think, it's - there'll be an effort to start again that any new administration has regardless of party and it will depend on whether they really try to directly address this concern.  FLATOW: Rosina, do you think - how quickly a new science advisor gets appointed, well, tell us about the future?  Dr. BIERBAUM: Absolutely. The Clinton administration appointed theirs by Christmas and he still got back to singing his Christmas choir. I think that's very important. You got to be part of the team that's building what's going to happen in this White House, setting this strategic direction and be a real player. Yes, early is better. Very important.  Mr. GOLDSTON: Early is better, but the Clinton administration was almost unique in getting somebody in that quickly because of the connection that Vice President Gore had with science communities. So I would say, I wouldn't view that as an absolute indicator, although it would be great if someone were appointed that early.  FLATOW: And there you have it. We've run out of time. I'd like thank all my guests: Francesca Grifo, director of the Scientific Integrity Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists; David Goldston, former chief of staff of the House Committee on Science. He's now visiting lecturer at Harvard University; Rosina Bierbaum, former administrator in the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and she is dean of the School of Natural Resources and Environment at the University of Michigan; and James McCarthy, co-chair of the IPCC Working Group II and now professor of biological oceanography at Harvard University.  Thank you all for taking time to be with us today.  Mr. McCARTHY: Thank you, Ira.

A bright green cable runs from the robot up to the second floor of a building on shore. That's the control room. On a computer screen, you can see what the robot sees: the underside of the ice. But something's wrong. Mr. BILL STONE (Head, Stone Aerospace): It's dead in the water as far as mobility. Everything else is up and running but it's like telling your feet to move and it don't want to move.

You are drifting a little bit on to the left-hand side of the ice, about a quarter of the vehicle is under the ice. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And soon the orange robot is gone, somewhere beneath our feet. Over the next couple of days, the team troubleshoots more glitches. Everything has to be working before the robot goes to Antarctica this fall. It's headed for Lake Bonney, a big body of water that's perpetually under 12 to 15 feet of ice. And if that effort goes well - who knows?

Lizard feet and the operating room may not seem to have much in common but for years, scientists have been fascinated by the way geckos are able to walk up walls and across ceilings held on by tiny textures on the pads of their toes. Writing this week in the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers describe how they've taken those toe structures and use them as inspiration for designing the surface of a surgical bandage. The team hopes that the bandages could be used to replace sutures, stitches in the operating room. Joining me now to talk about this work is Jeffrey M. Karp. He's the director of the Laboratory for Advanced Biomaterials and Stem-Cell-Based Therapeutics in the Harvard-MIT division of Health Sciences and Technologies. He's also in the Department of Medicine at Brigham & Women's Hospital and the Harvard Medical School. Any other titles that I've left out there? (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. JEFFREY M. KARP (Director, Laboratory for Advanced Biomaterials and Stem-Cell-Based Therapeutics, Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology): Oh, I think you got them all. PALCA: Okay. That's excellent. Thank you. Welcome to the program. Dr. KARP: You know, it's a pleasure to be here. PALCA: Well, okay, so, you know, one of the things that I've been - looking at the pictures and the article, it's a little unusual to think that simply the surface structure of something is what makes it sticky but I guess maybe we have rethink or become educated about what stickiness means. Dr. KARP: Yeah. It's remarkable how geckos are able to walk up the wall and, you know, hang from a single foot. I think people for years thought that the gecko must have some type of glue on their surface and during the last seven or eight years, people have elucidated the mechanisms and it turns out there's absolutely no glue on the surface, but that they have this hierarchal structure ending in these nano-pillars. And the nano-pillars make these typically insignificant interaction between two surfaces significant such as Van der Waals interactions and capillary forces. PALCA: Whoa. Van der Waals interactions. Now, remind us, for those of us whose physical chemistry was a few years further back. What are\u2026 Dr. KARP: The easiest way to think about it is any molecule at a certain point in time may have a buildup of positive charge on one side and negative charge on the other. And when these tend to line up, they can cause forces of attraction. PALCA: I got it. So it's - but it's a molecular kind of attraction. And I was thinking that Velcro was sort of a larger structured version of things that are not sticky but stick together very well. But I guess this is more on a molecular level? Dr. KARP: Yeah, exactly. It's almost, you know, completely different mechanism, whereas Velcro is a mechanical interlock mechanism that doesn't rely so much on these other types of forces, but the gecko has evolved to be able to use just millions of these nano-pillars to increase the surface area of contact and make the Van der Waals forces and capillary forces which are typically not significant, significant. PALCA: By the way, if you'd like to join this conversation about the gecko-based  or gecko-inspired surgical bandage, give us a call at 800-989-8255, that's 800-989-TALK. So what was the challenge here to recapitulate this design in something that could be put into a living person or what was the big challenge? Dr. KARP: Well, I think, you know, initially, we weren't even thinking about the gecko. We recognized that there was really a big need for biomedical adhesives, for internal applications that were tape-based, so something like the equivalent of an internal band-aid. And you know, we surveyed the literature, we looked at what was available in the clinic and we quickly realized that many of the glues just don't have strong adhesion. And the ones that do, such as the medical-grade crazy glues, elicit a very strong inflammatory response. And so we began thinking, you know, how can we apply what's out there to create the next generation of medical adhesives and we decided that chemistry was going to be really important because you could use it to crosslink to tissue to obtain very strong bonds. But we wanted to minimize that inflammation, so we thought, you know, then it occurred to us that geckos have this amazing ability, people were just elucidating at the time these types of mechanisms. And we thought, well, if we include types of morphology that the gecko uses on the surface of our - adhesive tapes, maybe we could reduce the requirement for chemistry and obtain strong adhesion. PALCA: So these tapes, what are they made of? Dr. KARP: So it's a great question. We had to create a completely new material because, you know, our thought was, the material - if we're going to make a tape, we want it to conform to the surface of a variety of different tissues. And tissues can have very irregular morphologies. So we designed a brand-new polymer or plastic that was biocompatible, biodegradable and had elastic properties so we could actually, you know, pull it and it'll elongate two to 300 percent. So we first - that was the very first thing that we did. PALCA: Wow. And - it's interesting, though, people don't typically think of plastics as biodegradable. Is it because of the microclimate inside the body where it's acidic or their enzymes are - why is this plastic breaking down when others don't? Dr. KARP: So, well, we just include ester groups which can be hydrolyzed by water and then in the case of, you know, acidic or basic conditions, this can either increase the rate of degradation. And further more, there are a variety of enzymes that cells can produce like neutrophils or monocytes which can speed up the degradation rates. So, you know, we're in an era now where there's a variety of different biodegradable polymers that have been approved by the FDA or in the clinic. And the best example is degradable sutures. PALCA: Really? And one of the things that, I guess, these are different from gecko - the properties that geckos have is the geckos usually do best on - as I understand it, on a dry, smooth surface, but you're talking about materials that adhere to a messy, wet surface. Dr. KARP: Yes. So geckos, about the pillars that the geckos have are made out of keratin which is a fairly hydrophobic material and thus it's believed that it can actually push water out of the way so it can interact specifically with surfaces. People have created a variety of different gecko-mimicking adhesives. But one of the greatest challenges in the field is that they tend not to work very well under wet conditions. In fact, what happens is they end up interacting with the water and not the surface. So we had to - instead of just mimicking how the gecko works, we had to go beyond this and actually coat a very thin layer of a glue that we created that would not only bond to the tissue but would bond strongly to the surface of our adhesive. PALCA: Well, let's take a quick call now and how about if we go to David(ph) in Scottsdale, Arizona. David, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. DAVID (Caller): Hi. Thanks for having me. PALCA: Sure. DAVID: I had question about this because I remember reading about this when I was in high school, a gecko tape. And at the time, they thought it was something completely different - almost like Velcro on a microscopic level. I'm just wondering if the professor or the doctor knew - has the research been updated. Have they been making new discoveries about this or is it just now getting more attention? Dr. KARP: Yeah. That's a great question. And in fact, people have now elucidated a completely different mechanism, in fact, if you take a gecko and place it on a completely flat surface, there's absolutely no mechanical interlocking that is occurring and it's all to do with the Van der Waals interactions and capillary forces. And just to - I'm sorry? PALCA: No, go ahead. DAVID: All right. Go ahead. Dr. KARP: I was just going to say that the capillary forces are particularly interesting because when you take these dry adhesives and you actually reduce the humidity in the environment, the adhesion ends up going down. So this is one of the key demonstrations that humidity or a monolayer of water on a surface can actually enhance - significantly enhance the level of adhesion. PALCA: David, thanks very much for that question. We're talking with Jeffrey Karp about a new surgical tape that is based on how a gecko holds onto surfaces and can hold on very tightly. I'm Joe Palca and this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. So Jeffrey Karp, how far along are we in the development of this, I mean, is this something that you're - it might go into patients in the foreseeable future? Dr. KARP: Now, we sure hope so and we believe it has a lot of potential to help improve the lives of many patients, to decrease complication rates. We've tested this now - the model in the laboratory we used was a pig intestine tissue as it's very thin and reproducible so we initially screened a wide variety of different morphologies and chemistries, and then we ended up placing this into the peritoneal cavity or the abdomen of a rat and demonstrated significant cumulative effects of chemistry and morphology on adhesion. And so the next step for us really is to target specific applications and then try to, you know, move this into the clinic. PALCA: All right. Let's take another call now and go to Chuck(ph) in Phoenix, Arizona. Chuck, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. CHUCK (Caller): Hi. Thank you very much. My question is that is this: How does the gecko let go? And does the bond of the gecko's foot - is it very, very strong? Does he have to pull hard to let go? Or is there some way he just releases it? And that's my question. PALCA: Okay, interesting. Dr. KARP: That's a superb question. And that's actually something that I have an answer for because other scientists have just figured this out within the last couple of years. So geckos have not only they have these nano-pillars but the pillars are in the shape of triangles. And so, you know, this just, you know, people at home want to try this, if you take a piece of tape and you cut it in the shape of a triangle, you try to peel at the point of the triangle versus the base of the triangle, the widest part, it's much more difficult to peel at the widest part than it is at the point. And so the gecko makes use of this principle which we refer to as contact line splitting. So what it does is it has all of the triangles essentially are pointed down towards the ground, so when the gecko wants to hang on the wall, it's the base of all of these triangles on the nano-pillars  which is allowing them to adhere and not de-adhere and fall off the wall. But when they want to start walking, they simply lift from the point of the triangles, which is the easiest point to start peeling from, and then they can essentially de-adhere. And that's another essential thing that I think, you know, I need to point out is that our strategy is more inspired from the gecko than we are mimicking the gecko because this very property - we don't think would be very useful in the clinic. We think the surgeons would want to be able to put this adhesive in and have it stay there and not move over time. PALCA: Okay. We have time for one more really quick question and I'll give it to Edward(ph)in River Falls, Wisconsin. A quick question please. EDWARD (Caller): Hi. Thanks for taking my call. PALCA: Sure. EDWARD: In using this tape as a suture, is it possible to include some kind of antibiotic or some kind of protein to speed the healing process as it dissolves? PALCA: Wow, interesting. What about it, Jeff? Dr. KARP: Yeah, absolutely. So we've designed this polymer so that it can be - we can actually tailor the degradation products and - tailor the degradation rates - sorry - and we can incorporate drugs such as antibiotics, anti-inflammatory  agents or even growth factors to promote healing. So we think that, in addition to using this, to seal wounds, or bring tissues together, this could be the equivalent of a transdermal patch which is typically a part on the skin, the equivalent for internal procedures. And now we have a drug delivery patch that can be applied to nearly any internal tissue. PALCA: Excellent. Great story. We're very glad we were able to hear about it. Thanks very much for coming on the program. Dr. KARP: Oh, thank you for inviting me. PALCA: Jeffrey Karp is the director of the Laboratory for Advanced Biomaterials and Stem-Cell-Based Therapeutics in the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology. He's also in the Department of Medicine at Brigham & Women's Hospital and at the Harvard Medical School.

For NPR News in New York, I'm Joe Palca.  JOE PALCA, host:  And now from a bit of basic biological research to a little bit of bioengineering.  Lizard feet and the operating room may not seem to have much in common but for years, scientists have been fascinated by the way geckos are able to walk up walls and across ceilings held on by tiny textures on the pads of their toes.  Writing this week in the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers describe how they've taken those toe structures and use them as inspiration for designing the surface of a surgical bandage. The team hopes that the bandages could be used to replace sutures, stitches in the operating room.  Joining me now to talk about this work is Jeffrey M. Karp. He's the director of the Laboratory for Advanced Biomaterials and Stem-Cell-Based Therapeutics in the Harvard-MIT division of Health Sciences and Technologies. He's also in the Department of Medicine at Brigham & Women's Hospital and the Harvard Medical School.  Any other titles that I've left out there?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. JEFFREY M. KARP (Director, Laboratory for Advanced Biomaterials and Stem-Cell-Based Therapeutics, Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology): Oh, I think you got them all.  PALCA: Okay. That's excellent. Thank you. Welcome to the program.  Dr. KARP: You know, it's a pleasure to be here.  PALCA: Well, okay, so, you know, one of the things that I've been - looking at the pictures and the article, it's a little unusual to think that simply the surface structure of something is what makes it sticky but I guess maybe we have rethink or become educated about what stickiness means.  Dr. KARP: Yeah. It's remarkable how geckos are able to walk up the wall and, you know, hang from a single foot. I think people for years thought that the gecko must have some type of glue on their surface and during the last seven or eight years, people have elucidated the mechanisms and it turns out there's absolutely no glue on the surface, but that they have this hierarchal structure ending in these nano-pillars. And the nano-pillars make these typically insignificant interaction between two surfaces significant such as Van der Waals interactions and capillary forces.  PALCA: Whoa. Van der Waals interactions. Now, remind us, for those of us whose physical chemistry was a few years further back. What are\u2026  Dr. KARP: The easiest way to think about it is any molecule at a certain point in time may have a buildup of positive charge on one side and negative charge on the other. And when these tend to line up, they can cause forces of attraction.  PALCA: I got it. So it's - but it's a molecular kind of attraction. And I was thinking that Velcro was sort of a larger structured version of things that are not sticky but stick together very well. But I guess this is more on a molecular level?  Dr. KARP: Yeah, exactly. It's almost, you know, completely different mechanism, whereas Velcro is a mechanical interlock mechanism that doesn't rely so much on these other types of forces, but the gecko has evolved to be able to use just millions of these nano-pillars to increase the surface area of contact and make the Van der Waals forces and capillary forces which are typically not significant, significant.  PALCA: By the way, if you'd like to join this conversation about the gecko-based  or gecko-inspired surgical bandage, give us a call at 800-989-8255, that's 800-989-TALK.  So what was the challenge here to recapitulate this design in something that could be put into a living person or what was the big challenge?  Dr. KARP: Well, I think, you know, initially, we weren't even thinking about the gecko. We recognized that there was really a big need for biomedical adhesives, for internal applications that were tape-based, so something like the equivalent of an internal band-aid. And you know, we surveyed the literature, we looked at what was available in the clinic and we quickly realized that many of the glues just don't have strong adhesion. And the ones that do, such as the medical-grade crazy glues, elicit a very strong inflammatory response.  And so we began thinking, you know, how can we apply what's out there to create the next generation of medical adhesives and we decided that chemistry was going to be really important because you could use it to crosslink to tissue to obtain very strong bonds. But we wanted to minimize that inflammation, so we thought, you know, then it occurred to us that geckos have this amazing ability, people were just elucidating at the time these types of mechanisms. And we thought, well, if we include types of morphology that the gecko uses on the surface of our - adhesive tapes, maybe we could reduce the requirement for chemistry and obtain strong adhesion.  PALCA: So these tapes, what are they made of?  Dr. KARP: So it's a great question. We had to create a completely new material because, you know, our thought was, the material - if we're going to make a tape, we want it to conform to the surface of a variety of different tissues. And tissues can have very irregular morphologies. So we designed a brand-new polymer or plastic that was biocompatible, biodegradable and had elastic properties so we could actually, you know, pull it and it'll elongate two to 300 percent. So we first - that was the very first thing that we did.  PALCA: Wow. And - it's interesting, though, people don't typically think of plastics as biodegradable. Is it because of the microclimate inside the body where it's acidic or their enzymes are - why is this plastic breaking down when others don't?  Dr. KARP: So, well, we just include ester groups which can be hydrolyzed by water and then in the case of, you know, acidic or basic conditions, this can either increase the rate of degradation. And further more, there are a variety of enzymes that cells can produce like neutrophils or monocytes which can speed up the degradation rates.

One of the things that make stem cells so interesting to scientists is their ability to shift forms becoming other cell types. Cancer tumor cells can do something similar and cancer cells and stem cells seem to share some of their inner mechanisms. So what makes these two types of cells different from other cells? Well, the good person to ask that question of is George Daley. He's an associate professor of biology, chemistry and molecular pharmacology at Harvard Medical School and an associate professor of pediatrics at Children's Hospital in Boston. And he's one of the authors of a paper this week in the journal, Science, reporting on his lab's investigations into the proteins and triggers that regulate how a stem cell operates. Welcome back to the program, George Daley. Doctor GEORGE DALEY (Stem Cell Researcher; Associate Professor, Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School; Associate Professor, Pediatrics, Children's Hospital Boston): Thank you, Joe. PALCA: So - and if you want to ask questions about this, you're welcome to join us. And just remind you, the number is 800-989-8255, that's 800-989-TALK. So, I mean, what's the premise here? Why are we talking about cancer cells and stem cells in the same breath? Dr. DALEY: Well, you know, both of these types of cells are generated a lot of real excitement recently. Stem cells have now been made from skin cells by simply introducing a small number of genes. And what we think is going on there is essentially a dedifferentiation process taking a highly specialized cell and reverting it back to its sort of primitive origins as a stem cell. Well, one of the proteins that's involved is called lin-28. And our group has recently shown that this protein is involved in regulating a class of small RNAs which don't actually make proteins themselves but regulate the expression of other proteins. Well, we were studying this protein lin-28 and we actually were thinking it was more relevant to cancer, and it turns out that it's relevant to both stem cells and cancer. PALCA: We're talking with George Daley about a protein that seems to be important to decide the fate of cells. I'm Joe Palca and this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And lin-28, if I remember right, was one of these magic factors that was able to take a normal skin cell and make it behave like an embryonic stem cell. Dr. DALEY: That's right. So Jamie Thomson's group discovered this and reported it in November. Our group, which involves one of my graduate students, Srini Viswanathan, and a very talented junior faculty member, Richard Gregory, was studying this tendency for RNAs to be blocked in processing in embryonic tissues. And we discovered this protein. We had no direct idea it might be the same kind of protein that would reprogram skin cells. And interestingly enough, that was a project going on in a different part of my lab. So when Jamie Thomson's paper came out, there was like this collective gasp in the group because all of a sudden, two very or seemingly disparate tracts of science in my own group were actually one and the same. PALCA: And so what, I mean, tell me a little bit more about this lin-28. It's something to do with these microRNAs, is that right? Dr. DALEY: You know, lin-28 has a long history. I think it was discovered about 20 years ago in worms. It was a gene which when disrupted in worms changed the sort of developmental timing of the organism. And then more recently, there's just been a couple of papers here and there which has seemed to suggest that if you express it in certain cells, it would actually promote their proliferation and maybe be involved in tumor agenesis. So what's really been going on in the stem cell community is looking for genes that will turn these specialized cells like skin cells back into stem cells. And along the way, lin-28 fell out of these screens. Well, we've now provided the explanation for how lin-28 works. It seems to work by regulating the development of these very exciting and interesting classes, small RNAs called microRNAs. PALCA: And is there an implication then for - I mean, it's always been a question, I suppose, that the cells that are embryonic stem cells - one of the tests to make sure they're really embryonic stem cells is that they can form these tumors that can have all sorts of tissue types in them. But that's always raised this, at least the possibility in my mind - I guess others as well - that somehow cells derived from these could be cancer-causing, is this part of understanding that process as well? Dr. DALEY: Yes. Yes, in fact, it's very important for that process. So stem cells have very important properties that they replenish our tissues. They repair disease and destruction, but in doing that, they also have the possibility that if they become deranged, they can actually form tumors. And now we do appreciate that many classes of cancer arise from what are called cancer stem cells. That that can be either because the stem cells in the tissue undergo mutations which make them behave badly or in other instances, it's a - you get a more specialized cell which undergoes this kind of dedifferentiation process and making it more like a stem cell. PALCA: George, we're going to have to take a break and - so hold that thought and we'll come back in about a minute or two and we'll finish the explanation, okay? Great. So we're going to be talking more with George Daley about stem cells and how they are similar to and different from cancer cells, so stay with us. This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) PALCA: From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Joe Palca. We're talking this hour about stem cells with George Daley of Children's Hospital Boston and he's also affiliated with Harvard Medical School. And George, you were in the midst of a discussion of the process by which stem cells can - and become cancer cells or it might even be the cause of cancer in some cases, then we had to stop, so can you back up a little and take another run at it? Dr. DALEY: Sure. PALCA: Okay. Dr. DALEY: Well, I think we're speaking to the point that stem cells have in some instances a similarity-ness(ph) to cancers. The most versatile stem cells, the embryonic and the pluripotent stem cells are immortal, that is they grow forever, and that's a property which is shared very closely with cancers. Now, cancers are immortal and they don't differentiate normally. Stem cells are immortal and typically, if they're in the right environment, will specialize, will differentiate, will become functional tissues. So what we're learning is that the same kinds of genes that can help us make stem cells - genes like lin-28 or genes like MIC(ph) - may also be similar genes to those that when they're disregulated(ph) make cancers. So these kinds of studies of stem cells and cancers are actually turning out to reveal aspects of common biology, pathways that may be similar to both. PALCA: Cool. Very interesting. All right, I think we have time for one call, so let's try Elaine(ph) - I'm sorry - Kate(ph) in Greensboro, North Carolina. Kate, welcome to the program. KATE (Caller): Thank you very much. I was just reading an article about using the mouse testicular cells and turning those into cancer cells, I mean - excuse me - into stem cells. And I'd like to get Dr. Daley's viewpoint on that research and how he could expand his own research in that direction, and I'll take my comments off the air. PALCA: Okay, Kate, thanks. George? Dr. DALEY: That's a fascinating area of experimentation. It's part of this now growing tradition of being able to take cells from the body whether they're skin cells or testicular cells, and by simple manipulations getting them to revert to their stem cell status. Now, we've always thought that the cells that give rise to sperm, these testicular cells that this caller refers to are kind of close to stem cells. They're really part of our germ line. That's the cells in our body that are important for carrying on heredity, for passing on the species. So we always knew that they had this kind of immortality about them. But what's amazing about these testicular studies is that simply placing those cells in a Petri dish with a cocktail of growth factors actually gets them to revert to stem cells. And I think this is really fascinating. It speaks for many, many breakthroughs in the years to come. We really do hope that this is going to give us new insights into biology and maybe teach us how to actually use cells to treat diseases in the future. PALCA: Although it's - just thinking that - at one point, you were trying to get embryonic stem cells to turn into testicular precursors. Now they're talking about going the other direction. Dr. DALEY: Well, you know, biology is a to and fro. PALCA: Yeah. Dr. DALEY: We're learning a lot about how to become more primitive and also how to become more specialized. PALCA: Well, actually\u2026 Dr. DALEY: I think we need both. PALCA: I was going to throw that back to you as a sort of a final question. It feels a little bit like the nature of cells and what it means to be a particular cell is - I mean, what we understand, the nature of what it means to be a particular cell is undergoing a sort of a shift now? Dr. DALEY: Yes, it is. I mean, I think we're astounded as biologists to think that we could take a cell that's been perhaps sitting in your skin for years and reawakened its embryonic potential. I mean, I think that's a really startling capacity for the cell. It really means that the genome is very plastic and that ultimately we hope to be able to turn that mutability, that versatility into clinical ends(ph). PALCA: All right. Well, I'm afraid that's all we have the time. George Daley, thanks very much for spending time with us today. Dr. DALEY: Thanks for having me, Joe.

PALCA: So - and if you want to ask questions about this, you're welcome to join us. And just remind you, the number is 800-989-8255, that's 800-989-TALK.  So, I mean, what's the premise here? Why are we talking about cancer cells and stem cells in the same breath?  Dr. DALEY: Well, you know, both of these types of cells are generated a lot of real excitement recently. Stem cells have now been made from skin cells by simply introducing a small number of genes. And what we think is going on there is essentially a dedifferentiation process taking a highly specialized cell and reverting it back to its sort of primitive origins as a stem cell.  Well, one of the proteins that's involved is called lin-28. And our group has recently shown that this protein is involved in regulating a class of small RNAs which don't actually make proteins themselves but regulate the expression of other proteins. Well, we were studying this protein lin-28 and we actually were thinking it was more relevant to cancer, and it turns out that it's relevant to both stem cells and cancer.  PALCA: We're talking with George Daley about a protein that seems to be important to decide the fate of cells. I'm Joe Palca and this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  And lin-28, if I remember right, was one of these magic factors that was able to take a normal skin cell and make it behave like an embryonic stem cell.  Dr. DALEY: That's right. So Jamie Thomson's group discovered this and reported it in November. Our group, which involves one of my graduate students, Srini Viswanathan, and a very talented junior faculty member, Richard Gregory, was studying this tendency for RNAs to be blocked in processing in embryonic tissues. And we discovered this protein. We had no direct idea it might be the same kind of protein that would reprogram skin cells. And interestingly enough, that was a project going on in a different part of my lab.  So when Jamie Thomson's paper came out, there was like this collective gasp in the group because all of a sudden, two very or seemingly disparate tracts of science in my own group were actually one and the same.  PALCA: And so what, I mean, tell me a little bit more about this lin-28. It's something to do with these microRNAs, is that right?  Dr. DALEY: You know, lin-28 has a long history. I think it was discovered about 20 years ago in worms. It was a gene which when disrupted in worms changed the sort of developmental timing of the organism. And then more recently, there's just been a couple of papers here and there which has seemed to suggest that if you express it in certain cells, it would actually promote their proliferation and maybe be involved in tumor agenesis.  So what's really been going on in the stem cell community is looking for genes that will turn these specialized cells like skin cells back into stem cells. And along the way, lin-28 fell out of these screens. Well, we've now provided the explanation for how lin-28 works. It seems to work by regulating the development of these very exciting and interesting classes, small RNAs called microRNAs.  PALCA: And is there an implication then for - I mean, it's always been a question, I suppose, that the cells that are embryonic stem cells - one of the tests to make sure they're really embryonic stem cells is that they can form these tumors that can have all sorts of tissue types in them. But that's always raised this, at least the possibility in my mind - I guess others as well - that somehow cells derived from these could be cancer-causing, is this part of understanding that process as well?  Dr. DALEY: Yes. Yes, in fact, it's very important for that process. So stem cells have very important properties that they replenish our tissues. They repair disease and destruction, but in doing that, they also have the possibility that if they become deranged, they can actually form tumors. And now we do appreciate that many classes of cancer arise from what are called cancer stem cells. That that can be either because the stem cells in the tissue undergo mutations which make them behave badly or in other instances, it's a - you get a more specialized cell which undergoes this kind of dedifferentiation process and making it more like a stem cell.  PALCA: George, we're going to have to take a break and - so hold that thought and we'll come back in about a minute or two and we'll finish the explanation, okay? Great.  So we're going to be talking more with George Daley about stem cells and how they are similar to and different from cancer cells, so stay with us.  This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  PALCA: From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Joe Palca.  We're talking this hour about stem cells with George Daley of Children's Hospital Boston and he's also affiliated with Harvard Medical School.  And George, you were in the midst of a discussion of the process by which stem cells can - and become cancer cells or it might even be the cause of cancer in some cases, then we had to stop, so can you back up a little and take another run at it?  Dr. DALEY: Sure.  PALCA: Okay.  Dr. DALEY: Well, I think we're speaking to the point that stem cells have in some instances a similarity-ness(ph) to cancers. The most versatile stem cells, the embryonic and the pluripotent stem cells are immortal, that is they grow forever, and that's a property which is shared very closely with cancers.  Now, cancers are immortal and they don't differentiate normally. Stem cells are immortal and typically, if they're in the right environment, will specialize, will differentiate, will become functional tissues. So what we're learning is that the same kinds of genes that can help us make stem cells - genes like lin-28 or genes like MIC(ph) - may also be similar genes to those that when they're disregulated(ph) make cancers. So these kinds of studies of stem cells and cancers are actually turning out to reveal aspects of common biology, pathways that may be similar to both.  PALCA: Cool. Very interesting.  All right, I think we have time for one call, so let's try Elaine(ph) - I'm sorry - Kate(ph) in Greensboro, North Carolina.  Kate, welcome to the program.  KATE (Caller): Thank you very much. I was just reading an article about using the mouse testicular cells and turning those into cancer cells, I mean - excuse me - into stem cells. And I'd like to get Dr. Daley's viewpoint on that research and how he could expand his own research in that direction, and I'll take my comments off the air.  PALCA: Okay, Kate, thanks.  George?  Dr. DALEY: That's a fascinating area of experimentation. It's part of this now growing tradition of being able to take cells from the body whether they're skin cells or testicular cells, and by simple manipulations getting them to revert to their stem cell status. Now, we've always thought that the cells that give rise to sperm, these testicular cells that this caller refers to are kind of close to stem cells. They're really part of our germ line. That's the cells in our body that are important for carrying on heredity, for passing on the species. So we always knew that they had this kind of immortality about them. But what's amazing about these testicular studies is that simply placing those cells in a Petri dish with a cocktail of growth factors actually gets them to revert to stem cells.  And I think this is really fascinating. It speaks for many, many breakthroughs in the years to come. We really do hope that this is going to give us new insights into biology and maybe teach us how to actually use cells to treat diseases in the future.  PALCA: Although it's - just thinking that - at one point, you were trying to get embryonic stem cells to turn into testicular precursors. Now they're talking about going the other direction.  Dr. DALEY: Well, you know, biology is a to and fro.  PALCA: Yeah.  Dr. DALEY: We're learning a lot about how to become more primitive and also how to become more specialized.  PALCA: Well, actually\u2026  Dr. DALEY: I think we need both.  PALCA: I was going to throw that back to you as a sort of a final question. It feels a little bit like the nature of cells and what it means to be a particular cell is - I mean, what we understand, the nature of what it means to be a particular cell is undergoing a sort of a shift now?  Dr. DALEY: Yes, it is. I mean, I think we're astounded as biologists to think that we could take a cell that's been perhaps sitting in your skin for years and reawakened its embryonic potential. I mean, I think that's a really startling capacity for the cell. It really means that the genome is very plastic and that ultimately we hope to be able to turn that mutability, that versatility into clinical ends(ph).  PALCA: All right. Well, I'm afraid that's all we have the time. George Daley, thanks very much for spending time with us today.  Dr. DALEY: Thanks for having me, Joe.

In the nation's first national park, which spans Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, so far this winter 175 buffalo have been sent to slaughter. The fear is the bison, which migrate north in the winter, will infect ranchers' cattle with a disease called brucellosis. Here's the irony. The bison are believed to have originally caught the disease from cows back in the early 1900s. Now, according to the Billings Gazette, over 275 bison have been captured. Some of them have been hazed. And some of the locals don't think this is necessarily a good idea. Stephan Sea(ph), media coordinator for the Buffalo Field Campaign, gave the Jackson Hole News a statement. Quote: \"The actions of Yellowstone National Park demonstrate that they are unqualified to protect the bison the nation is entrusting them with. \" The story was being covered by the co-editor of the Jackson Hole News and Guide, and he joins us, Angus Thermer. Hi, Angus, how are you? Mr. ANGUS THERMER (Jackson Hole News and Guide): I'm doing well. Good morning. STEWART: So on the surface, you have animals who may infect other animals, and people are trying to control this. So what's so controversial about trying to stop this disease from spreading to the cattle? Mr. THERMER: Well, this is the last wild-ranging bison herd in North America, and Buffalo Field Campaign believes that public land should belong to wildlife as well as domestic livestock like cattle, and right now there's a very low tolerance for having wildlife out on these public lands because they might - they might spread this disease, Brucellosis, to cattle, even though the cattle aren't there are this particular time, and these wild bison are migrating out of Yellowstone. As the snow starts to become denser and their forage is difficult to get to, they move to lower elevations in search of food, and they're rounded up and sent to slaughter, and some folk don't believe that's the right thing to do. STEWART: So is this coming down to a valuation of a cow's life over a bison's life? Mr. THERMER: Some people say there are too many cattle, that that that's the problem, that it's not too many bison, yes. But the stockmen take this disease very seriously. If it's found in a cattle herd, the cattle herd is rounded up and destroyed. The stockman usually is compensated. But herds next to it are tested as a result, and if a state finds more than one case of brucellosis in its cattle herds during the year, it loses its ability to ship cattle freely across state lines. So there's a big economic implication for ranchers. STEWART: Now, if you go to the CDC's Web site and you look up brucellosis, it says that humans can generally be infected in one of three ways: eating or drinking something that's contaminated, breathing the organism in, having the bacteria enter the body through skin wounds. Also some unpasturized food products can transmit it as well. Yet in one article I read, it described some of the meat of the slaughtered bison going to various native tribes. Mr. THERMER: Yes, that's correct, and it's generally - it's believed and it's advertised that eating meat from a bison that is actually infected with brucellosis or an elk that's infected with brucellosis is not dangerous as long as the meat is prepared correctly. Now, you can look around some of these game-and-fish and fish-and-wildlife Web sites and it's difficult to find out what prepared correctly is, but if you go to a cooking Web site, if you get out your \"Joy of Cooking\" or some similar reference text and you look up what temperature it takes to kill bacteria - and brucellosis is a bacteria - you'll find you'll have to do your meat up to 145 degrees, which is beyond medium rare, I believe. So there is a possibility of catching the disease from contact with the fluids, usually reproductive tissues and stuff like that, from a carcass, but the danger from eating meat is minimal. STEWART: We're speaking with the co-editor of the Jackson Hole News and Guide, Angus Thermer, about the situation where some bison are being rounded up at Yellowstone National Park. Some of them have been slaughtered. And in this process something called hazing has been going on. Could you explain what that is to us? Mr. THERMER: Yes. Yellowstone has an agreement with some of the Montana agencies - the Fish, Wildlife and Parks, and Department of Livestock, and the U. S. Forest Service - regarding bison that migrate outside of the world's first national park on a regular basis, and one of the methods to keep them away from cattle and the cattle-grazing allotments on public land outside Yellowstone is simply to chase them back inside the park, and that's called hazing, and that's also controversial. You're running bison in deep snow in the middle of the winter or in spring when their fat reserves are down. Sometimes there's bison calves along with them, and it can be ugly at times. But it is a method that Yellowstone is trying to -as an alternative to capturing and slaughtering the bison, and last Friday Yellowstone was successful in hazing 119 bison back from the northern border of the park, so they did not have to capture them. STEWART: And of the bison that have been slaughtered, are they 100-percent sure that they were infected with this disease, with this bacteria, brucellosis? Mr. THERMER: Absolutely not. They stopped testing for that some time ago. You cannot tell whether a live animal has brucellosis. You can tell whether a live animal has been exposed to the bacteria, but that's as far as the tests go. To find out whether an animal is infected with - actually infected with brucella abortis, the bacteria that we're talking about, you have to kill it and do a tissue sample on some of its organs. And Yellowstone used to test the bison, and the ones that were clean, the ones that were absolutely not exposed, exposed at all to the organism, they would keep in a corral and try to release later in the year, and they would send only the ones they were exposed, not knowing whether they were actually infected; they would send only the ones that tested positive for exposure to disease to slaughter. But that practice has gone by the wayside. It's too complicated, apparently, and so all bison that migrate toward the northern boundary are captured, or most of them are captured - many of them are captured inside Yellowstone, inside the world's first national park and sent to slaughterhouses, and only when there's an opportunity to chase them back into the heart of Yellowstone are they spared. STEWART: Angus Thermer is the editor, co-editor of the Jackson Hole News and Guide. Thanks for explaining it all to us, Angus. We appreciate it. Mr. THERMER: Any time.

Well, you know, it turned out, you know, all this time later, I finally got the diagnosis that I was suffering from migraine headaches, which are a whole different animal. If you have a migraine, if you're a migraine sufferer, you can feel my pain. You know what I'm talking about. It's not the common oh, you know, little tension here, a little pressure here. It is really quite debilitating, and that's kind of what separates them from what you would call an ordinary headache. CHIDEYA: Is there any kind of difference in how often people have headaches or for what, when they're black women? Ms. OLIVER: Black women particularly are prone, for whatever reason, to migraine headaches. They are, however, the last people to get treatment, to go out and seek help for migraines, and I think that's probably, you know, something that's maybe a little bit cultural or, you know, we feel we have to be tough and strong and can't afford to lose work, and all sorts of issues kind of tumble into that, but for whatever reason, black women are the last to get treatment, and I really hope that changes. It doesn't have to be. You don't have to, you know, literally be shut off in a dark room. You know what, Farai? I actually own a pair of black-out curtains. That's pathetic, isn't it, that it just\ufffd? CHIDEYA: Well, tell us exactly why that helps by blocking out the light. Ms. OLIVER: It helps - if you're a person who suffers from migraines, you find yourself to be completely insensitive, or your tolerance of light is definitely acute. You're not the same. It bothers you. There are other triggers, whether it's chocolate or cheese or certain types of foods. It's kind of all over the place, and the symptoms depend on the individual. But for me, I found that it was kind of sometimes an issue with light that tumbled into something else, maybe, you know, whatever that food or beverage was. I hadn't quite narrowed it down to figure out what exactly my triggers are. I just know that I always have to fight, really, to try to stay one step ahead of it. If I have the symptoms of a migraine, I found something that has worked for me because it's specific for migraines. It takes care of the migraine, as opposed to just sort of popping all of these things, not knowing, you know, if they really work. For whatever reason, this medication that's migraine-specific medication was something that has helped me to be able to keep, you know, a couple of steps ahead of a migraine. CHIDEYA: So as a sportscaster, that's not exactly a black-out curtain, I'm going to just have a quite moment away from the world occupation. So what happens - have you ever had moments where you just said I can't work? Ms. OLIVER: Oh yeah. You know what? I had those moments early in my career, where I really had no - I had no choice. I couldn't get out of bed. I couldn't see straight. All sorts of things were happening. But as I finally got a hold of them and got the proper diagnosis that I was a migraine sufferer, then you know, I was able to find something that worked, but there had been plenty of times, plenty of games, where I'm standing there, 80,000 people are screaming, bright sunlight, and I'm just going could they just hold it down a little bit? You know, and you're not going to get, you know, 80,000, you know, ticket-holders to hold it down. So you know, you just kind of figured out - you know, some days I've toughed it out. Some days I've gone on air with a very bad migraine, because that's my job. CHIDEYA: Has anyone ever just run a tackle into you by accident, shaken up your brain, anything? Ms. OLIVER: I have never been sideline road-kill. I've made it a point to always know where the action is and to not get caught up in it. There are times, though, when my back is turned, I'm doing a stand-up, for example, and you could see everybody. Their eyes are getting big, and they're just kind of like - you know, my cameraman's really good about pulling me out of the way. So no, I haven't had any kind of brain scramble to that extent, but yeah, I can see where you're going. A lot of these players who suffer from concussions, eventually, you know, sometimes they can turn into migraine sufferers as well. CHIDEYA: Well before we let you go, tell us about the Black Women's Health Imperative. How did you get involved, and what are you guys trying to do? Ms. OLIVER: Oh, it's just a wonderful organization. It's a national, not-for-profit organization that's devoted to tackling health issues as it relates to black women and girls. blackwomenshealth. org is the place to go. You can find out more information about all sorts of health issues that we all sort of are subjected to, and it's a wonderful place to kind of go and find out all sorts of things, particularly about migraines. But headachequiz. com, Farai, if I could just say that, it is a tremendous Web site, and it'll walk you through all the signs and the symptoms. So you can take that information, take it to your doctor and say can we possibly look at this as opposed to just sort of blindly going through and saying ooh, I have a bad headache, or do I have sinus headache, which by the way medically, there is no such thing. So black women out there, you know, suffering through these things, and you really don't have to. CHIDEYA: Pam, thanks so much. Ms. OLIVER: Thank you. Thanks for having me. CHIDEYA: Pam Oliver is a sports reporter for Fox Sports and also for TNT, and she joined us from Georgia Public Radio in Atlanta.  FARAI CHIDEYA, host:  Most of us have had a day where we think I just can't take it anymore. Some folks have headaches, and some get migraines, a whole different force-factor of pain. You may know Pam Oliver as a sportscaster for TNT. She's also a member of the Black Women's Health Imperative, and migraines are something she knows about personally. Hi, Pam.  Ms. PAM OLIVER (Sportscaster, TNT; Member, Black Women's Health Imperative): Hi, Farai, how are you? Don't forget my day job, Fox Sports.  CHIDEYA: Fox sports, okay.  Ms. OLIVER: That's my day job.  CHIDEYA: Absolutely appreciate it. So tell me about your struggle with migraines. Have you always dealt with them?  Ms. OLIVER: Oh man, it seems for most of my life, I'd had these issues with migraines, really I can say definitively for the last 20 years. I'm 47. So I noticed there was one point in my life, I had to take a leave of absence, Farai, because I could not literally shake what I thought was a common headache.

I'm Joe Palca sitting in for Ira Flatow. Later in the hour, we'll answer your questions about leap year. But up first, what if building an organism was as simple as running a computer program? Instead of a software program that told a computer how to process words, crunch numbers or play a game, a genetic program would give instructions for building an organism from its component parts - millions of tiny snippets of DNA. Instead of hitting the print button, you hit the construct button and a synthesizer would start worrying and out pops a new virus or microbe or some other thing. Well, that sounds farfetched. It may be, but then again there was a time when no one would believe how much computing power would fit on a machine the size of a notebook. Today, we'll be talking about synthetic biology and the progress scientists are making in building new life forms from scratch. We'll also consider issues raised by this research. Things like, who should control it and who should do it and what kinds of organisms they could make and who should own the technology. And our ideas about what it means to be alive might change if we can someday create life in the lab from its component parts. If you'd like to join the discussion, give us a call. Our number is 800-989-8255.  That's 1-800-989-TALK. And if you want more information about what we'll be talking about this hour, go to our Web site at www. sciencefriday. com where you'll find links to our topic. And now, I'd like to introduce my guests for this hour. First, Drew Endy is an assistant professor in the department of biological engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. He joins me today by phone from Boston. Welcome to the program, Dr. Endy. Dr. DREW ENDY (Assistant Professor of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology): Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon. PALCA: Good afternoon. And Paul Rabinow is the author of several books, including \"A Machine to Make a Future: Biotech Chronicles\" and \"Making PCR: A Story of Biotechnology. \" His most recent is \"Marking Time on the Anthropology of the Contemporary,\" out last year from Princeton University Press. He is a professor of anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Rabinow. Dr. PAUL RABINOW (Professor of Anthropology, University of California, Berkeley): Thank you very much. PALCA: And of course, we'd like to take your calls, so don't forget, you can join us at 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TOTN. And Drew Endy, let me start with you. I kind of posed the beginning of this discussion in terms of whole organisms, but maybe it's wrong to cast the whole notion of synthetic biology as thinking about it as, you know, as an entire thing. Is that - is it fair to say that you're looking at synthetic parts that make up biology? Dr. ENDY: That's a good question. I think - how I look at it is to consider the whole of biotechnology, all the different things that you could use biology for, things that it might make for you, and then ask where are we with biotechnology today, right? So when I was born back in 1970 and grew up through the '70s, '80s, '90s and now, biotechnology was just getting started. So the whole field is about 30 years old. If you consider it as a field you could ask, well, it's sort of a young adult right now, and how are we doing, how powerful is it, and how much more do we have to do. Where synthetic biology comes in is it says, well, if we were going to try and make biotechnology more useful and more powerful, how would we do that exactly? And this is where you get into inventing new tools and trying to make the whole process of engineering biology easier. So when you talk about building an organism or constructing a genome, what that really indicates to me is there are some exciting new technologies or tools that let people build new pieces of DNA in ways that haven't been possible before. And then what you'd want to consider in addition to that would be all the different bits and pieces and how you would organize them and why you would be doing it in the first place and what the consequences of success are going to be. And so to the extent that you can figure all of that out and put it under a nice label or an umbrella that would be synthetic biology for me. PALCA: I see. And so how would you characterize the maturity of the field right now? Dr. ENDY: You know, to go back to it, I think, they're sort of a young adult, where some great things have happened. You know, going back to production of drugs and bacteria for treating diseases like diabetes decades ago, we have a lot of work to do, right? So the reports that have come out most recently are terrific advances. There are the first reports, for example, of building a gnome, all of the genetic material for a microorganism from scratch, from information on a computer database and raw chemicals derived from sugar. But, wow, you know, how do we figure out what sorts of new genomes to make and could we do it quicker, faster and cheaper and so on and so forth. So I think we haven't even scratched the surface of biotechnology if you wanted to dig into it a little bit. PALCA: Well, okay. So Paul Rabinow, turning to you and maintaining this analogy of the young adult or the - or maybe the tween - how would you characterize it? And I guess the other question that comes to mind is, you know, as we raise our young, we do have some guiding principles, but this is all new. Do any of the guiding principles that we bring with us from, let's say, our history with, you know, basic biology, do any of those inform us about how we should be dealing with this new synthetic biology? Dr. RABINOW: Well, first of all, good morning. Good morning, Drew. And I completely agree with what Drew said, very eloquently put. I pay attention to analogies in particular and so we could use that analogy, we could use some others. But I think it's really important to understand that while a lot of attention has been given to potential things that could happen and/or accomplishments like Craig Venter's construction of a genome, there are more concrete things going on that Drew alluded to that are really quite spectacular at this point. So Jay Keasling at Berkeley, who is head of the Synthetic Biology Engineering Center that both Drew and I are associated with, has engineered artemisinin, which is one of the few effective anti-malaria molecules left in the world. It's grown - it evolved in nature on the bark of a Chinese tree. And now, Jay, with the help of the Gates Foundation and One World Health, is producing this molecule both in yeast and in E. coli. So this tells us really exciting and important things about how nature works and can be made to work. PALCA: But - can I interrupt you for a second? Dr. RABINOW: Sure. PALCA: How does being able to produce artemisinin differ from, let's say, producing insulin, which people have also been able to produce using yeast and bacteria? Dr. RABINOW: Well, this is where Drew's analogy comes in. The production of insulin, or human growth hormone or other such molecules, took an immense amount of time and work. And basically, was an attempt to imitate nature, to build the proteins in the same way that they had been built - more or less in the same way that they have been built in nature. Whereas, what Keasling's lab has done is to say, well, nature is - can be treated as if it was an engineering challenge and had machine-like qualities, and we can build pathways into organisms that were no way evolved to produce this molecule. And then - and this is really important - we continue to do that in a way that will do something that's beneficial to humanity and will build pathways not only within the organism itself, but out through other kinds of institutions, such that the science is beneficial both for learning how nature works and can be made to work, but also for addressing an extremely important problem in ways that is both more rapid and efficient than the current international agencies have been able to do. PALCA: All right. We are - let's hear what - because this raises a whole passel of questions, and I want to hear what some of our listeners think about this. So let's first go to the phones now and go to Tyson(ph) in Fremont, California. Tyson, welcome to the program. TYSON (Caller): Yes. Thank you for taking my call. I'm a big fan of your show. PALCA: Thanks. TYSON: My question is for everybody involved. My wife and I are vegan and so we have a deep respect for life and - just in general. And my question was, how do you think this is going to impact people who view life in general? Do you think it will, you know, help them realize that there's life all around us and it's valuable and special and unique? Or do you think it'll have the opposite effects to where, you know, people will start to see life as just another thing to be made in a factory? Do you think people will, you know, go the other end to where they will have a complete disrespect or they just see it as a commodity like we would see a computer or a car? PALCA: Important question. Yeah. Paul Rabinow - maybe I can ask the anthropologist - can pitch that in your direction. Dr. RABINOW: Sure. I think that's an open question and that the public debate and the responsibility of the scientists involved will play a big role into how things ramify. But keep in mind, one of the leaders of the field, Craig Venter, who you've had on before, took a year off and sailed around the world on his yacht and sampled tens of thousands of genomes and showed that in nature itself there's an immense amount of genetic activity and swapping of genes. And a lot of very interesting processes whereby organisms develop resistance to certain environments, change their dynamics, and what have you. So I think at one level - and this is my position - one has a lot to learn about how nature or life or evolution actually works and to not take an overly restricted view of that. So what Drew and Jay and other people are trying to do is to learn from nature, but also to see that nature itself is an extremely dynamic and changeable set of processes. So we have to get out of the 19th century view that nature is static and fixed or mechanical in some simple way. And to find both better analogies and both better research technology. Now, can that lead to disastrous or dangerous or risky consequences? Absolutely. So this is the time at the beginning of this exciting field - and Drew has been a leader in raising these issues - that we need to raise public awareness and we need to talk to the scientific community, in my view, to make them aware of the fact that this whole coming into maturity of biotechnology is done in the right way. PALCA: Drew Endy, you know, I was going to ask, have you a perspective now having worked in this field for the many years you have? Dr. ENDY: That is a really wonderful question that was raised by the caller. The, you know, first thing to say is within the research community whether you're a scientist or an engineer, the capability to construct an organism is going to be an amazingly powerful way to discover and learn how life works\u2026 PALCA: Right. Dr. ENDY: \u2026within the laboratory setting. But the caller's question really was much more powerful than that. It touched on how, you know, everybody's view of the living world might change - will it lead to a more respect or commoditization of life processes. And I think, as Paul mentioned, you know, quite expertly, it could go either way or probably will happen both ways. The way I would consider it, you know, by bringing up a different example would be to remember what happened with computing and electronics where computers, say around 1950, were very exclusive technology in their electronic form. And they were deployed against problems, you know, such as designing hydrogen bombs or computing the trajectories of munitions for the military. Within 25 years, many individuals had become so fed up with limited access to computing that they went off and invented the personal computer, which then led to many, many other dreams being realized around computer technologies, right, whether you want to call the iPhone a high watermark of that is just up to you. PALCA: Drew Endy, we have to take a short break so I'll cut you off there, but we'll come back and talk more about this. We're talking about synthetic biology. Stay with us. This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) PALCA: From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Joe Palca. We're talking this hour about synthetic biology. My guests are Paul Rabinow, professor of anthropology at the University of California-Berkeley, and Drew Endy, an assistant professor of biological engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. And, Drew Endy, at the end you were saying that when there was an attempt to put restrictions and people became frustrated with restrictions on computers, they went out and invented the personal computer which, of course, you know, took people who might have been afraid of technology and said, too bad, we're developing it anyway. And I want to carry that analogy a little further. I mean, is there going to be a way to keep the lid on things that people might not want to have happen with the synthetic biology? Dr. ENDY: There are ways one could imagine, but I think the costs associated with them would be tremendous. And, you know, I don't think you should consider it as, you know, the technology is getting out of the box somehow, but rather it's a really exciting technology in the same way that computers were exciting to people because you could, well, compute - being able to program the stuff of life itself to engineer biology is incredibly exciting to many people. And so it's almost as if there's a pent-up demand for people to have access to biotechnology. To come back to the caller's question, you know, as people have different values and want to constructively celebrate them, you need to pay or perhaps even participate in the development and application of the technology so that we can work through what those issues are. As Paul was saying, I think, it could go either way, right? Will it lead to a better understanding and celebration of life itself as we become closer with it and participate more directly in taking responsibility for genetic material and the changes we make to it, or will it be a locked-up, you know, pessimistic technology that commoditizes our existence. You know, again, it's going to be up to everybody who participates in the conversations and the practice of developing the technology. Dr. RABINOW: Right. PALCA: Right. Paul Rabinow, you were going to add something. Dr. RABINOW: Yes. PALCA: Go ahead. Dr. RABINOW: Two points. First, commodification is a word that is used in seemingly in an entirely negative way. But living here in Berkeley in California, the Alice Waters and Chez Panisse and natural foods were - have introduced a tremendous improvement and remediation of our food supply and what we eat. But they're also a business. So I don't think there is any necessary and inherent contradiction between growing wonderful arugula in the Sierras and selling them. So the question is not so much whether we're in pure life and pure business, but how the ramifications and combinations of those vectors can be put to improve the quality of all of our lives. So that's one point. The second point is I think the two major things that we need to do now in a globalized world connected by the Internet and furthermore in which the centers of science are no longer just the United States and Europe, but now are China and India and Brazil and Mexico and South Africa and many other places. We live in a globalized world now connected by the Internet. The idea of national regulations seems extremely limited. So I think we need to do two things, and I know Drew agrees. First, we need as much open-sourced discussion as possible. We need a much better education system in which young scientists and young economists learn more than just their subspecialties. And then we need an open world in which we don't put on visa restrictions on scientists, but we make the most contact possible because that's the way that people will know what's going on in each other's lives around the world. And that's the way that the very best of science, the enlightenment hope for science, can be encouraged. But if you build barriers and close down walls and don't allow people to travel and put government restrictions on what's going on, you're asking for trouble in the long run. And it's not actually going to provide the security that people think it is. So this is a very exciting moment, but the world is a very dangerous place right now and I think Drew and I are very much both on the same side of encouraging responsible and enthusiastic science. PALCA: Let's take another call now and go to Elaine(ph) in Wilmington, North Carolina. Elaine, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. ELAINE (Caller): Well, thank you. My question has to do with the relationship of synthetic organisms and the environment. And I'm wondering whether thought has been given to such things as sequestration of carbon, whether some of these organisms could eat that carbon up or there would be other uses to help clean up the environment. PALCA: Interesting question, Elaine. Thanks for that. Drew Endy, have you heard about any technologies that are like that at all? Dr. ENDY: Sure. I mean, it's one of the great promises of biotechnology, to be able to take elements in the atmosphere, whether it'd be carbon or nitrogen and ameliorate or impact humans' relationship with those elemental cycles. It's very controversial if you dig down into it, right? Because many times, for example, if you take carbon sequestration, some of the best systems in the world for doing that might be natural systems, right, the marshes or the soils of the forest. And so careful attention needs to be paid if one were to try and compliment what nature is already pretty good at with engineered solution. But, absolutely. One of the great applications of biological technologies would be to better integrate the impact of human civilizations within the natural world. Dr. RABINOW: Keep\u2026 PALCA: There's - sorry. Go ahead, Paul Rabinow. Dr. RABINOW: Keep in mind that synthetic biology is a young field. Nanotechnology, which is a little bit older and has more centers and is directly involved with environmental issues, has been doing some interesting things in terms of exactly those issues. So that might be another program, but new cutting-edge science is not and should not be blind to environmental issues. And then, secondly, there's a huge new set of centers at Berkeley, but also at other places as well, in which synthetic biology is now devoting major efforts towards creating biofuels. And the question of what that's going to do to the natural environment and what's that going to do on the geopolitics of energy and the rest is very much on the agenda. So there are exciting things going on at MIT and other places, but these are the issues we all need to be talking about before it's too late. PALCA: Well, speaking of issues, there's a group of people who've gathered at \"Second Life\" on Science Friday Island. And one of them, Troy McCullen(ph) has asked the following question. Can you give an overview of what biotechnologies can and can't be patented? So is patenting the right word to think about here or should we be thinking more like copyright or - I don't know, how do you - what's going to happen? How does ownership of these things going to work? Drew Endy, maybe you could take a stab at that? Dr. ENDY: Well, within the current practice of biotechnology, patents are the dominant and accepted form of intellectual property and they're put to good use within certain applications. I think it's an interesting question. And the way I considered it is to map how ownership-sharing and innovation schemes changes in response to advances in technology. And the most relevant one to consider first would be DNA synthesis technology. So DNA synthesis is a technology where you can go from raw materials derived from sugarcane and information in a computer database and print DNA. All of a sudden, you don't have to go to your freezer to get a pre-existing piece of DNA, you print it from scratch whenever you need it. This technology, DNA synthesis, and other genetic construction technologies are getting better exponentially, which is a cliche but, you know, practically it means they're doubling in capacity every 12 to 18 months. They're getting better faster than computers are getting better. So if you look at how things like computing and, as Paul is mentioning, the fact that we're in a global Internet-driven world, what happens when we get to the point where there are online databases of standard biological parts and devices and whenever you want to call up or program a new synthetic organism, you download these sequences off the Web, right? Now this, all of a sudden, instead of looking like a bunch of freezers where you go get your DNA, maybe it looks more like iTunes on Apple's Web site. And all of a sudden, I think copyright becomes a very interesting thing to consider. But I don't want to overstate where this might go because, practically, the legal community is starting to think about it. It's not clear whether we should go with patenting in the future, copyright, something specific to the domain like what's been done with ship hauls(ph) and protection around that. So the ownership frameworks going forward in biotechnology, I suspect, are going to come under tremendous amount of stress in response to the improvements and the technologies that allow the work to go forward. PALCA: Yeah, Paul Rabinow, go ahead. Dr. RABINOW: Keep in mind that Drew is being modest. He's the head of the BioBricks Foundation in - which has devoted the most cutting-edge thought to these issues, and he has a lot more to say about it. Let me add only that the models have say, the pharmaceutical industry in - and what's happened with AIDS drugs, I think, is not in a global world with really pressing issues of environmental concern, health concern. And also the fact that science should be a globalized good, I think, that's probably the path not to follow. So struggling and thinking through the kinds of issues have opened access plus proprietary protection that will enable in further research without closing off large sections of humanity to the benefits both of learning and enjoying science, but also the products of science, that's the challenge. So one could say that how can we increase our capacities without increasing relations of domination and exploitation? Now that's a fancy way of saying, how can we increase the general good of this exciting and young field without just increasing the riches and wealth and health of a small group, a small part of humanity. PALCA: Let's take another call now and go this time to Zack(ph) in Ogden, Utah. Zack, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. ZACK (Caller): Hey, thanks so much. I love SCIENCE FRIDAY. PALCA: Sure. ZACK: I am a devout Christian but, scientifically, I'm excited for the advances that we're making. That being said, I - my question is, at what point as we're, I guess, designing or coming up with genetic codes of genome, at what point do we draw the line and say, you know, let's let nature or God take its course and maybe we don't need to necessarily interact or interfere with the hand of God in nature or whatever way you want to look of that, you know, where do we draw that line? PALCA: Interesting question, Zack. Drew Endy, what do you think? Dr. ENDY: I think one place to start is to consider that by constructing or reconstructing things that already exists, this is an approach for understanding what we already find in the natural world. And so that I personally would feel would be well within, sort of, an acceptable sphere of activity. As you go forward I don't see an absolute answer to your question, it's something that we're going to have to continue to consider as we build things and learn what it means to be constructors not creators. I think there's an important distinction in the language here. A creator, a God, you know, has unlimited power, knowledge, ability to manipulate all that we know. Engineers, I'm an engineer, you know, I'm useful - used to wearing a hardhat to doing construction projects, right, but I can't really control what I'm doing all the time. Now, I try and make do and sometimes things work and sometimes they don't. And so I think as we start to understand the work more in the context of construction and see how it goes then, you know, we'll have to continue to have conversations around the issue you've just brought up. I, again, don't know perorally(ph) how to answer that absolutely. Dr. RABINOW: Let me add that my chief assistant, the main person who I'm working with out here in Berkeley on our project, Gaymon Bennett, is a doctoral student in Theology and he's a member of a group out here called Theologians for Stem Cells. So the question is which God, which interpretation of religion, and there's a vast array of difference of religious opinion among the major world religions as well as indigenous religions on all of these questions, so I think the idea that there's a single religious answer or that we know if one believe there was a God we knew what God's will was, I think many people believe is the fundamental center of Hubris, not attempting to do good things in the world but claiming to know what the omnipotent and divine voice is and what's allowed and what's not allowed, because I can assure you there's absolutely no consensus about that. PALCA: We're talking about synthetic biology and the implications of what this new world is going to bring us. We're taking your calls at 800-989-8255. This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. You know, not to make light of it, but every time a new technology comes along there is a question of whether we're stepping over a line and usurping some role that God has determined for us. And I remember my dad used to joke that if God had wanted us to fly, he wouldn't have given us the railroad. (Soundbite of laughter) PALCA: So there's an element to that every time, and I guess we can keep peeling back that onion. But let's take another call now and go to Chuck(ph) in San Francisco. CHUCK (Caller): Thank you very much. Actually, it's interesting you mention hubris and messing with creation, because I'm kind of coming at the same issue from a different direction which is to say, I think that in our current age there's a certain amount of scientific technological hubris that - I'm no Luddite\u2026 PALCA: Yes. CHUCK: \u2026but\u2026 PALCA: Yes. CHUCK: \u2026I think, you know, this is very exciting. But instead of thinking of messing with creation I'm wondering if you can look at the ecosystem as an extremely complex product of eons of evolution where all the pieces kind of have evolved to fit together in a certain way. I'm not saying it's static, but it is extremely complex. And if you consider the effects of introducing non-native  species into an ecosystem, not necessarily something that's harmful per se, but something that has no natural predators or diseases or simply out-competes  other organisms for a certain niche, I think, maybe, you can start to see what I'm concerned about. That if you engineer a new life form it is not, you know, by definition novel and therefore just introducing it into this complex system, product of such a long evolutionary process, inevitably you're going to have unexpected consequences and they could quite easily, I think, not be desirable. PALCA: Interesting question, Chuck, although I suppose one answer would be that most things fail. Most things don't survive very well. But maybe I should ask Drew Endy, what he makes of that question? Dr. ENDY: Joe, I agree with your statement just now, but, you know, it doesn't make the issue any less important. We depend, absolutely, on the natural living world and its, you know, continued prosperity to the extent that we have anything to do with it, and so we certainly wouldn't want to mess that up. You know, one of the things which surprises me is somebody growing up in a world already with biotechnology that the engineering community itself is relatively immature. And so, for example, 30 years after the invention of genetic engineering we don't have what I would recognize as the American society of genetic engineers. The reason that's funny or interesting to me is when I studied civil engineering and when I was a student, I had to take courses in professional practice and development, and I learned things like bridge designers will sign their work and put a little tag in, you know, or plaque next to the bridge. And, you know, a lot of times those cultural practices allow for things like, well, when the bridge falls down you're going to go talk to somebody about it and maybe you're not going to be a structural engineer very much longer, right? And so how do we develop, sort of, the culture of responsibility around biotechnology as it becomes more powerful, as it becomes more distributed so that issues like the one having to do with environmental health and safety, you know, become, sort of, anticipated and the solutions get built into the practice as things go forward. PALCA: Well, I'd like to continue this discussion, it's quite fascinating, but I'm afraid we're out of time. So I have to thank my guests, Drew Endy, you were just hearing, is an assistant professor of biological engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. And we also talked with Paul Rabinow, professor of anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley. Thanks to both of you for being with us. Dr. ENDY: Thank you. Dr. RABINOW: Thank you. When we come back, we'll have a brief that - thank you - we'll have a brief look at time and what it means to be doing a SCIENCE FRIDAY program on Friday, February 29th, that's today. Stay with us.  JOE PALCA, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Joe Palca sitting in for Ira Flatow.  Later in the hour, we'll answer your questions about leap year. But up first, what if building an organism was as simple as running a computer program? Instead of a software program that told a computer how to process words, crunch numbers or play a game, a genetic program would give instructions for building an organism from its component parts - millions of tiny snippets of DNA.  Instead of hitting the print button, you hit the construct button and a synthesizer would start worrying and out pops a new virus or microbe or some other thing. Well, that sounds farfetched. It may be, but then again there was a time when no one would believe how much computing power would fit on a machine the size of a notebook.  Today, we'll be talking about synthetic biology and the progress scientists are making in building new life forms from scratch. We'll also consider issues raised by this research. Things like, who should control it and who should do it and what kinds of organisms they could make and who should own the technology. And our ideas about what it means to be alive might change if we can someday create life in the lab from its component parts.  If you'd like to join the discussion, give us a call. Our number is 800-989-8255.  That's 1-800-989-TALK. And if you want more information about what we'll be talking about this hour, go to our Web site at www. sciencefriday. com where you'll find links to our topic.  And now, I'd like to introduce my guests for this hour. First, Drew Endy is an assistant professor in the department of biological engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. He joins me today by phone from Boston.  Welcome to the program, Dr. Endy.  Dr. DREW ENDY (Assistant Professor of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology): Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon.  PALCA: Good afternoon.  And Paul Rabinow is the author of several books, including \"A Machine to Make a Future: Biotech Chronicles\" and \"Making PCR: A Story of Biotechnology. \" His most recent is \"Marking Time on the Anthropology of the Contemporary,\" out last year from Princeton University Press. He is a professor of anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley.  Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Rabinow.  Dr. PAUL RABINOW (Professor of Anthropology, University of California, Berkeley): Thank you very much.  PALCA: And of course, we'd like to take your calls, so don't forget, you can join us at 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TOTN.  And Drew Endy, let me start with you. I kind of posed the beginning of this discussion in terms of whole organisms, but maybe it's wrong to cast the whole notion of synthetic biology as thinking about it as, you know, as an entire thing. Is that - is it fair to say that you're looking at synthetic parts that make up biology?  Dr. ENDY: That's a good question. I think - how I look at it is to consider the whole of biotechnology, all the different things that you could use biology for, things that it might make for you, and then ask where are we with biotechnology today, right? So when I was born back in 1970 and grew up through the '70s, '80s, '90s and now, biotechnology was just getting started. So the whole field is about 30 years old.  If you consider it as a field you could ask, well, it's sort of a young adult right now, and how are we doing, how powerful is it, and how much more do we have to do. Where synthetic biology comes in is it says, well, if we were going to try and make biotechnology more useful and more powerful, how would we do that exactly? And this is where you get into inventing new tools and trying to make the whole process of engineering biology easier.  So when you talk about building an organism or constructing a genome, what that really indicates to me is there are some exciting new technologies or tools that let people build new pieces of DNA in ways that haven't been possible before. And then what you'd want to consider in addition to that would be all the different bits and pieces and how you would organize them and why you would be doing it in the first place and what the consequences of success are going to be.  And so to the extent that you can figure all of that out and put it under a nice label or an umbrella that would be synthetic biology for me.  PALCA: I see. And so how would you characterize the maturity of the field right now?  Dr. ENDY: You know, to go back to it, I think, they're sort of a young adult, where some great things have happened. You know, going back to production of drugs and bacteria for treating diseases like diabetes decades ago, we have a lot of work to do, right? So the reports that have come out most recently are terrific advances. There are the first reports, for example, of building a gnome, all of the genetic material for a microorganism from scratch, from information on a computer database and raw chemicals derived from sugar.  But, wow, you know, how do we figure out what sorts of new genomes to make and could we do it quicker, faster and cheaper and so on and so forth. So I think we haven't even scratched the surface of biotechnology if you wanted to dig into it a little bit.  PALCA: Well, okay.  So Paul Rabinow, turning to you and maintaining this analogy of the young adult or the - or maybe the tween - how would you characterize it? And I guess the other question that comes to mind is, you know, as we raise our young, we do have some guiding principles, but this is all new. Do any of the guiding principles that we bring with us from, let's say, our history with, you know, basic biology, do any of those inform us about how we should be dealing with this new synthetic biology?  Dr. RABINOW: Well, first of all, good morning. Good morning, Drew. And I completely agree with what Drew said, very eloquently put. I pay attention to analogies in particular and so we could use that analogy, we could use some others. But I think it's really important to understand that while a lot of attention has been given to potential things that could happen and/or accomplishments like Craig Venter's construction of a genome, there are more concrete things going on that Drew alluded to that are really quite spectacular at this point.  So Jay Keasling at Berkeley, who is head of the Synthetic Biology Engineering Center that both Drew and I are associated with, has engineered artemisinin, which is one of the few effective anti-malaria molecules left in the world. It's grown - it evolved in nature on the bark of a Chinese tree. And now, Jay, with the help of the Gates Foundation and One World Health, is producing this molecule both in yeast and in E. coli.  So this tells us really exciting and important things about how nature works and can be made to work.  PALCA: But - can I interrupt you for a second?  Dr. RABINOW: Sure.  PALCA: How does being able to produce artemisinin differ from, let's say, producing insulin, which people have also been able to produce using yeast and bacteria?  Dr. RABINOW: Well, this is where Drew's analogy comes in. The production of insulin, or human growth hormone or other such molecules, took an immense amount of time and work. And basically, was an attempt to imitate nature, to build the proteins in the same way that they had been built - more or less in the same way that they have been built in nature. Whereas, what Keasling's lab has done is to say, well, nature is - can be treated as if it was an engineering challenge and had machine-like qualities, and we can build pathways into organisms that were no way evolved to produce this molecule.  And then - and this is really important - we continue to do that in a way that will do something that's beneficial to humanity and will build pathways not only within the organism itself, but out through other kinds of institutions, such that the science is beneficial both for learning how nature works and can be made to work, but also for addressing an extremely important problem in ways that is both more rapid and efficient than the current international agencies have been able to do.  PALCA: All right. We are - let's hear what - because this raises a whole passel of questions, and I want to hear what some of our listeners think about this. So let's first go to the phones now and go to Tyson(ph) in Fremont, California.  Tyson, welcome to the program.  TYSON (Caller): Yes. Thank you for taking my call. I'm a big fan of your show.  PALCA: Thanks.  TYSON: My question is for everybody involved. My wife and I are vegan and so we have a deep respect for life and - just in general. And my question was, how do you think this is going to impact people who view life in general? Do you think it will, you know, help them realize that there's life all around us and it's valuable and special and unique? Or do you think it'll have the opposite effects to where, you know, people will start to see life as just another thing to be made in a factory? Do you think people will, you know, go the other end to where they will have a complete disrespect or they just see it as a commodity like we would see a computer or a car?  PALCA: Important question. Yeah.  Paul Rabinow - maybe I can ask the anthropologist - can pitch that in your direction.  Dr. RABINOW: Sure. I think that's an open question and that the public debate and the responsibility of the scientists involved will play a big role into how things ramify. But keep in mind, one of the leaders of the field, Craig Venter, who you've had on before, took a year off and sailed around the world on his yacht and sampled tens of thousands of genomes and showed that in nature itself there's an immense amount of genetic activity and swapping of genes.  And a lot of very interesting processes whereby organisms develop resistance to certain environments, change their dynamics, and what have you. So I think at one level - and this is my position - one has a lot to learn about how nature or life or evolution actually works and to not take an overly restricted view of that.  So what Drew and Jay and other people are trying to do is to learn from nature, but also to see that nature itself is an extremely dynamic and changeable set of processes. So we have to get out of the 19th century view that nature is static and fixed or mechanical in some simple way. And to find both better analogies and both better research technology.  Now, can that lead to disastrous or dangerous or risky consequences? Absolutely. So this is the time at the beginning of this exciting field - and Drew has been a leader in raising these issues - that we need to raise public awareness and we need to talk to the scientific community, in my view, to make them aware of the fact that this whole coming into maturity of biotechnology is done in the right way.  PALCA: Drew Endy, you know, I was going to ask, have you a perspective now having worked in this field for the many years you have?  Dr. ENDY: That is a really wonderful question that was raised by the caller. The, you know, first thing to say is within the research community whether you're a scientist or an engineer, the capability to construct an organism is going to be an amazingly powerful way to discover and learn how life works\u2026  PALCA: Right.  Dr. ENDY: \u2026within the laboratory setting. But the caller's question really was much more powerful than that. It touched on how, you know, everybody's view of the living world might change - will it lead to a more respect or commoditization of life processes. And I think, as Paul mentioned, you know, quite expertly, it could go either way or probably will happen both ways. The way I would consider it, you know, by bringing up a different example would be to remember what happened with computing and electronics where computers, say around 1950, were very exclusive technology in their electronic form. And they were deployed against problems, you know, such as designing hydrogen bombs or computing the trajectories of munitions for the military.  Within 25 years, many individuals had become so fed up with limited access to computing that they went off and invented the personal computer, which then led to many, many other dreams being realized around computer technologies, right, whether you want to call the iPhone a high watermark of that is just up to you.  PALCA: Drew Endy, we have to take a short break so I'll cut you off there, but we'll come back and talk more about this. We're talking about synthetic biology. Stay with us.  This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  PALCA: From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Joe Palca.  We're talking this hour about synthetic biology. My guests are Paul Rabinow, professor of anthropology at the University of California-Berkeley, and Drew Endy, an assistant professor of biological engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.  And, Drew Endy, at the end you were saying that when there was an attempt to put restrictions and people became frustrated with restrictions on computers, they went out and invented the personal computer which, of course, you know, took people who might have been afraid of technology and said, too bad, we're developing it anyway. And I want to carry that analogy a little further. I mean, is there going to be a way to keep the lid on things that people might not want to have happen with the synthetic biology?  Dr. ENDY: There are ways one could imagine, but I think the costs associated with them would be tremendous. And, you know, I don't think you should consider it as, you know, the technology is getting out of the box somehow, but rather it's a really exciting technology in the same way that computers were exciting to people because you could, well, compute - being able to program the stuff of life itself to engineer biology is incredibly exciting to many people. And so it's almost as if there's a pent-up demand for people to have access to biotechnology.  To come back to the caller's question, you know, as people have different values and want to constructively celebrate them, you need to pay or perhaps even participate in the development and application of the technology so that we can work through what those issues are. As Paul was saying, I think, it could go either way, right? Will it lead to a better understanding and celebration of life itself as we become closer with it and participate more directly in taking responsibility for genetic material and the changes we make to it, or will it be a locked-up, you know, pessimistic technology that commoditizes our existence. You know, again, it's going to be up to everybody who participates in the conversations and the practice of developing the technology.  Dr. RABINOW: Right.  PALCA: Right. Paul Rabinow, you were going to add something.  Dr. RABINOW: Yes.  PALCA: Go ahead.  Dr. RABINOW: Two points. First, commodification is a word that is used in seemingly in an entirely negative way. But living here in Berkeley in California, the Alice Waters and Chez Panisse and natural foods were - have introduced a tremendous improvement and remediation of our food supply and what we eat. But they're also a business. So I don't think there is any necessary and inherent contradiction between growing wonderful arugula in the Sierras and selling them. So the question is not so much whether we're in pure life and pure business, but how the ramifications and combinations of those vectors can be put to improve the quality of all of our lives. So that's one point.  The second point is I think the two major things that we need to do now in a globalized world connected by the Internet and furthermore in which the centers of science are no longer just the United States and Europe, but now are China and India and Brazil and Mexico and South Africa and many other places. We live in a globalized world now connected by the Internet. The idea of national regulations seems extremely limited.  So I think we need to do two things, and I know Drew agrees. First, we need as much open-sourced discussion as possible. We need a much better education system in which young scientists and young economists learn more than just their subspecialties. And then we need an open world in which we don't put on visa restrictions on scientists, but we make the most contact possible because that's the way that people will know what's going on in each other's lives around the world.  And that's the way that the very best of science, the enlightenment hope for science, can be encouraged. But if you build barriers and close down walls and don't allow people to travel and put government restrictions on what's going on, you're asking for trouble in the long run. And it's not actually going to provide the security that people think it is.  So this is a very exciting moment, but the world is a very dangerous place right now and I think Drew and I are very much both on the same side of encouraging responsible and enthusiastic science.  PALCA: Let's take another call now and go to Elaine(ph) in Wilmington, North Carolina. Elaine, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  ELAINE (Caller): Well, thank you. My question has to do with the relationship of synthetic organisms and the environment. And I'm wondering whether thought has been given to such things as sequestration of carbon, whether some of these organisms could eat that carbon up or there would be other uses to help clean up the environment.  PALCA: Interesting question, Elaine. Thanks for that.  Drew Endy, have you heard about any technologies that are like that at all?  Dr. ENDY: Sure. I mean, it's one of the great promises of biotechnology, to be able to take elements in the atmosphere, whether it'd be carbon or nitrogen and ameliorate or impact humans' relationship with those elemental cycles. It's very controversial if you dig down into it, right? Because many times, for example, if you take carbon sequestration, some of the best systems in the world for doing that might be natural systems, right, the marshes or the soils of the forest. And so careful attention needs to be paid if one were to try and compliment what nature is already pretty good at with engineered solution.  But, absolutely. One of the great applications of biological technologies would be to better integrate the impact of human civilizations within the natural world.  Dr. RABINOW: Keep\u2026  PALCA: There's - sorry. Go ahead, Paul Rabinow.  Dr. RABINOW: Keep in mind that synthetic biology is a young field. Nanotechnology, which is a little bit older and has more centers and is directly involved with environmental issues, has been doing some interesting things in terms of exactly those issues. So that might be another program, but new cutting-edge science is not and should not be blind to environmental issues.  And then, secondly, there's a huge new set of centers at Berkeley, but also at other places as well, in which synthetic biology is now devoting major efforts towards creating biofuels. And the question of what that's going to do to the natural environment and what's that going to do on the geopolitics of energy and the rest is very much on the agenda. So there are exciting things going on at MIT and other places, but these are the issues we all need to be talking about before it's too late.  PALCA: Well, speaking of issues, there's a group of people who've gathered at \"Second Life\" on Science Friday Island. And one of them, Troy McCullen(ph) has asked the following question. Can you give an overview of what biotechnologies can and can't be patented?  So is patenting the right word to think about here or should we be thinking more like copyright or - I don't know, how do you - what's going to happen? How does ownership of these things going to work? Drew Endy, maybe you could take a stab at that?  Dr. ENDY: Well, within the current practice of biotechnology, patents are the dominant and accepted form of intellectual property and they're put to good use within certain applications. I think it's an interesting question. And the way I considered it is to map how ownership-sharing and innovation schemes changes in response to advances in technology.  And the most relevant one to consider first would be DNA synthesis technology. So DNA synthesis is a technology where you can go from raw materials derived from sugarcane and information in a computer database and print DNA. All of a sudden, you don't have to go to your freezer to get a pre-existing piece of DNA, you print it from scratch whenever you need it.  This technology, DNA synthesis, and other genetic construction technologies are getting better exponentially, which is a cliche but, you know, practically it means they're doubling in capacity every 12 to 18 months. They're getting better faster than computers are getting better.  So if you look at how things like computing and, as Paul is mentioning, the fact that we're in a global Internet-driven world, what happens when we get to the point where there are online databases of standard biological parts and devices and whenever you want to call up or program a new synthetic organism, you download these sequences off the Web, right? Now this, all of a sudden, instead of looking like a bunch of freezers where you go get your DNA, maybe it looks more like iTunes on Apple's Web site.  And all of a sudden, I think copyright becomes a very interesting thing to consider. But I don't want to overstate where this might go because, practically, the legal community is starting to think about it. It's not clear whether we should go with patenting in the future, copyright, something specific to the domain like what's been done with ship hauls(ph) and protection around that.  So the ownership frameworks going forward in biotechnology, I suspect, are going to come under tremendous amount of stress in response to the improvements and the technologies that allow the work to go forward.  PALCA: Yeah, Paul Rabinow, go ahead.  Dr. RABINOW: Keep in mind that Drew is being modest. He's the head of the BioBricks Foundation in - which has devoted the most cutting-edge thought to these issues, and he has a lot more to say about it. Let me add only that the models have say, the pharmaceutical industry in - and what's happened with AIDS drugs, I think, is not in a global world with really pressing issues of environmental concern, health concern. And also the fact that science should be a globalized good, I think, that's probably the path not to follow.  So struggling and thinking through the kinds of issues have opened access plus proprietary protection that will enable in further research without closing off large sections of humanity to the benefits both of learning and enjoying science, but also the products of science, that's the challenge. So one could say that how can we increase our capacities without increasing relations of domination and exploitation? Now that's a fancy way of saying, how can we increase the general good of this exciting and young field without just increasing the riches and wealth and health of a small group, a small part of humanity.  PALCA: Let's take another call now and go this time to Zack(ph) in Ogden, Utah.  Zack, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  ZACK (Caller): Hey, thanks so much. I love SCIENCE FRIDAY.  PALCA: Sure.  ZACK: I am a devout Christian but, scientifically, I'm excited for the advances that we're making. That being said, I - my question is, at what point as we're, I guess, designing or coming up with genetic codes of genome, at what point do we draw the line and say, you know, let's let nature or God take its course and maybe we don't need to necessarily interact or interfere with the hand of God in nature or whatever way you want to look of that, you know, where do we draw that line?  PALCA: Interesting question, Zack.  Drew Endy, what do you think?  Dr. ENDY: I think one place to start is to consider that by constructing or reconstructing things that already exists, this is an approach for understanding what we already find in the natural world. And so that I personally would feel would be well within, sort of, an acceptable sphere of activity. As you go forward I don't see an absolute answer to your question, it's something that we're going to have to continue to consider as we build things and learn what it means to be constructors not creators. I think there's an important distinction in the language here. A creator, a God, you know, has unlimited power, knowledge, ability to manipulate all that we know.  Engineers, I'm an engineer, you know, I'm useful - used to wearing a hardhat to doing construction projects, right, but I can't really control what I'm doing all the time. Now, I try and make do and sometimes things work and sometimes they don't. And so I think as we start to understand the work more in the context of construction and see how it goes then, you know, we'll have to continue to have conversations around the issue you've just brought up. I, again, don't know perorally(ph) how to answer that absolutely.  Dr. RABINOW: Let me add that my chief assistant, the main person who I'm working with out here in Berkeley on our project, Gaymon Bennett, is a doctoral student in Theology and he's a member of a group out here called Theologians for Stem Cells. So the question is which God, which interpretation of religion, and there's a vast array of difference of religious opinion among the major world religions as well as indigenous religions on all of these questions, so I think the idea that there's a single religious answer or that we know if one believe there was a God we knew what God's will was, I think many people believe is the fundamental center of Hubris, not attempting to do good things in the world but claiming to know what the omnipotent and divine voice is and what's allowed and what's not allowed, because I can assure you there's absolutely no consensus about that.  PALCA: We're talking about synthetic biology and the implications of what this new world is going to bring us. We're taking your calls at 800-989-8255.  This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  You know, not to make light of it, but every time a new technology comes along there is a question of whether we're stepping over a line and usurping some role that God has determined for us. And I remember my dad used to joke that if God had wanted us to fly, he wouldn't have given us the railroad.  (Soundbite of laughter)  PALCA: So there's an element to that every time, and I guess we can keep peeling back that onion.  But let's take another call now and go to Chuck(ph) in San Francisco.  CHUCK (Caller): Thank you very much. Actually, it's interesting you mention hubris and messing with creation, because I'm kind of coming at the same issue from a different direction which is to say, I think that in our current age there's a certain amount of scientific technological hubris that - I'm no Luddite\u2026  PALCA: Yes.  CHUCK: \u2026but\u2026  PALCA: Yes.  CHUCK: \u2026I think, you know, this is very exciting. But instead of thinking of messing with creation I'm wondering if you can look at the ecosystem as an extremely complex product of eons of evolution where all the pieces kind of have evolved to fit together in a certain way. I'm not saying it's static, but it is extremely complex. And if you consider the effects of introducing non-native  species into an ecosystem, not necessarily something that's harmful per se, but something that has no natural predators or diseases or simply out-competes  other organisms for a certain niche, I think, maybe, you can start to see what I'm concerned about.  That if you engineer a new life form it is not, you know, by definition novel and therefore just introducing it into this complex system, product of such a long evolutionary process, inevitably you're going to have unexpected consequences and they could quite easily, I think, not be desirable.  PALCA: Interesting question, Chuck, although I suppose one answer would be that most things fail. Most things don't survive very well. But maybe I should ask Drew Endy, what he makes of that question?  Dr. ENDY: Joe, I agree with your statement just now, but, you know, it doesn't make the issue any less important. We depend, absolutely, on the natural living world and its, you know, continued prosperity to the extent that we have anything to do with it, and so we certainly wouldn't want to mess that up. You know, one of the things which surprises me is somebody growing up in a world already with biotechnology that the engineering community itself is relatively immature.  And so, for example, 30 years after the invention of genetic engineering we don't have what I would recognize as the American society of genetic engineers. The reason that's funny or interesting to me is when I studied civil engineering and when I was a student, I had to take courses in professional practice and development, and I learned things like bridge designers will sign their work and put a little tag in, you know, or plaque next to the bridge. And, you know, a lot of times those cultural practices allow for things like, well, when the bridge falls down you're going to go talk to somebody about it and maybe you're not going to be a structural engineer very much longer, right?  And so how do we develop, sort of, the culture of responsibility around biotechnology as it becomes more powerful, as it becomes more distributed so that issues like the one having to do with environmental health and safety, you know, become, sort of, anticipated and the solutions get built into the practice as things go forward.  PALCA: Well, I'd like to continue this discussion, it's quite fascinating, but I'm afraid we're out of time. So I have to thank my guests, Drew Endy, you were just hearing, is an assistant professor of biological engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. And we also talked with Paul Rabinow, professor of anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley.  Thanks to both of you for being with us.  Dr. ENDY: Thank you.  Dr. RABINOW: Thank you.  When we come back, we'll have a brief that - thank you - we'll have a brief look at time and what it means to be doing a SCIENCE FRIDAY program on Friday, February 29th, that's today. Stay with us.

I'm Joe Palca sitting in for Ira Flatow. It may only be the last day of February but 2008 has already been a busy year for militant animal rights activists. These protesters use tactics like smear campaigns, vandalism, and sometimes violence to try and stop researchers from experimenting on animals in the lab. They appear to be responsible for a fire at a UCLA scientist home three weeks ago and there are allegations activists were involved in another attack on a West Coast researcher's home just last weekend. Overseas, in Europe, businesses associated with animal research are reporting an increase in vandalism. Today on SCIENCE FRIDAY, we're exploring the issue of animal rights and research ethics. If you'd like to join us, give us call. Our number is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. And if you want more information about what we'll be talking about at this hour, go to our Web site at www. ScienceFriday. com where you'll find links to our topic. And let me introduce my first guest this hour, Michael Conn, is associate director of the Oregon National Primate Research Center. He is also co-author with James Parker of the forthcoming book, \"The Animal Research War\" from Palgrave Macmillan, in which he discusses the rise of the militant animal rights movement. He joins us from Portland. Welcome. Doctor MICHAEL CONN (Associate Director, Oregon National Primate Research Center, Oregon Health and Science University; Co-Author, \"The Animal Research War\"): Hello, Joe, and thanks very much for featuring this important topic. PALCA: Well, thank you for joining us. And frankly, you know, as someone who is bringing this up, you know, it is tend to be - it does tend to be sort of - scientists seem to like to have a low profile about this, and in fact, in your book, you talk about the silent war. Can you tell me more about what you mean about - when you say that, silent war? Dr. CONN: Well, the war against animal researchers is a very real and, as you pointed out, very violent war but all but invisible in the media. And that was one of the reasons that Jim Parker and I wrote this book. We would like to place this on the public agenda. We'd like the public to understand that there are researchers who are now walking away from productive careers because they fear for their families's wellbeing. Extremist groups are having a strangling effect on a lot of drug development. The book talks about the battles, the spies and the casualties in the animal research war, but our fear that if the extremists win, the real losers will be the public - all the people struggling with disease. PALCA: But if you - I mean, there's always a double-edged sword here because on the one hand, you can certainly point to examples of research that's benefiting humans and the human health. But there's certainly research that has also gone nowhere and - in retrospect, anyway - caused unnecessary suffering from animals. And you sometimes wonder, well, if people really knew the whole story maybe they wouldn't - they'd say on balance, you know, we don't want the benefits because the costs are too great. What do you say to that? Dr. CONN: Well, I think every once in a while you hear about something that's gone wrong, a bad scenario, and just for the moment because as often as not, we don't really know what happened. Let's assume that some of these scenarios are true. So what you're really saying then is because people die in car accidents, we shouldn't drive cars. Just because there are occasional problems, it does not mean you should turn off a pipeline. It is unquestionably improved the circumstances not only of people but of animals as well. We live in a wonderful time. The happy news is that a lot of young people you'd talked to will think the iron lung is a rock group. They won't remember polio, they won't remember small pox. Those are some of the major triumphs of animal research. They affect virtually everybody's life. Research as you point out is a tradeoff. In order to learn more how to help humans, we engage in animal experimentation, but this experimentation is governed by strict rules and regulations put on our plate by the federal government. There is very little pain or suffering in animal research. PALCA: You know, you're at the Oregon National Primate Research Center, and over the years, I've had occasion to do stories that involved your institution and every time I call there's a great trepidation about what's the media going to say if they come here. And then I have to do - I feel a lot of convincing that I'm, you know, that I'm not coming in to do a expose of some sort, I'm just interested in the science - although I suppose if there were an expose to be done, I'd want to do that, too. But the point is, it seems to me there's a defensive quality on the part of scientists as well, not just because - it may be justifiably but certainly it's sometimes hard to get in the door to hear the story of what the benefits are. Dr. CONN: Well, there's a couple of reasons for that. Some of them are technical. Because our animals are susceptible to human tuberculosis, we require anyone who enters the facilities to have proof of not being tuberculin positive. Beyond that, just interacting with the animals requires some training. It's not a good idea and it's very stressful for animals - when you stare at them, it upsets them. It upsets animals when there are new people around them. They wonder what's going on. But one of our real problems has to do with the media. In an effort to create balanced news casts, media frequently give individuals with extremist views, people who make outlandish and often untrue accusations the same platform and the same air time as researchers. The public presumes that the truth is somewhere in between. The media should strive to find out the truth and report that. PALCA: And so, can you cite an example of where a claim by an animal rights group has been given equal weight with a scientifically valid point of view? Dr. CONN: Absolutely. One of the things that drew my attention to writing this book, to begin with, came from a personal experience when I went on a trip to the East Coast - I'm on the West Coast now. And what happened was an animal extremist learned that I was going to be taking that trip, and this is an individual who'd said that the killing of animal researchers is warranted in order to stop animal research. He posted that on his listserv and I was followed around for about two and half days. They tried to meet me at the airport. They made wild accusations to the media which were reported by the media. I was in a very defensive mode trying to address them when in fact they were made up from whole cloth, and I ended being on the same platform as individuals who were literally making up stories. At the time, we were not using monkeys at all, in fact. And at that time, I hadn't even used rats in several years. But they made all kinds of outlandish claims, put up billboards at the university where I was and used public access laws in that state to attend meetings, to shout at me. And it really got us nowhere. PALCA: Okay. Let's take a call right now because this is obviously a very contentious issue but let's go now to the phones and talk to Justin(ph) in Vernon, Connecticut. Justin, welcome to the program. JUSTIN (Caller): Thanks for taking my call, Joe. PALCA: You bet. JUSTIN: You know, I think, it's kind of undeniable that there's this growing body of research showing that grandiose claims about, you know, the predictive value and contribution of animal experiments to human health are completely unfounded, and that the overwhelming majority of all animal experiments have no utility at all for human health\u2026 PALCA: So wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's a pretty broad statement. Can you cite a scientific paper or\u2026 JUSTIN: There's an article that came out in this month's journal of Royal Society of Medicine. It's written by Robert Matthews. PALCA: Okay. JUSTIN: He makes these claims exactly and he says\u2026 PALCA: Well\u2026 JUSTIN: \u2026the successes that have come from animal experiments are nothing more than anecdotal much like - I would suggest the claims that Mr. Conn is making about the existence of violence in the animals rights movement. PALCA: Okay. Well, okay, let's ask first, Mr. Conn - Dr. Conn if he knows about this article in the Proceedings of the Royal Society\u2026 Dr. CONN: I do not. But there's many, many examples in the literature suggesting just the otherwise to be true. I mean, let's face it. PALCA: Right. Dr. CONN: Even humans are not perfect models for other humans. Animals are not perfect models for humans, but there is one classic study that has been often cited in the literature and it was done by Harry Olson and colleagues. And what they did was they brought together the results from 12 different international pharmaceutic companies and they looked at the productivity of animal tests in human toxicity. The overall conclusion from 150 randomly selected compounds and 221 human toxicity events was that the animal model had significant predictive power to detect most but not all areas of human toxicity, so there is a big advantage. If you look at the history\u2026 JUSTIN: And the FDA\u2026 Dr. CONN: \u2026and we do a lot\u2026 JUSTIN: The FDA also reports that 95 percent of drugs that are tested on animals fail in human clinical trials because they can't predict the side effects of the drugs in animals that are going to result in human beings\u2026 PALCA: Justin, hold on. Hold on a second. And Dr. Conn, hold on a second. We may be able to cut through this because I have another guest who's on the line and he's actually from the U. K. and I'm going to bring him on now. Jonathan Wolff is a member of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics and he's a professor and department head in Philosophy at University College London. Welcome to the program, Dr. Wolff. Doctor JONATHAN WOLFF (Member, Nuffield Council on Bioethics; Professor and Department Head, Philosophy, University College London): I'll say good evening because it's evening in my time. PALCA: Well, fine, that's good. We'll accept that. We're familiar with time change here. So I don't know if you've been hearing what we're just talking about but there was allegedly or apparently an article in - is it, Justin, which journal? JUSTIN: The journal of the Royal Society of Medicine\u2026 PALCA: Journal of the Royal Society\u2026 JUSTIN: \u2026by Robert Matthews. PALCA: By Matthews, talking about the lack of predictive value of animal research. Did you see that article, by any chance? Dr. WOLFF: I didn't see that one. I'm familiar with those sort of claims. Yeah. PALCA: And what do you make of them in general? Dr. WOLFF: Well, I'm a philosopher not a scientist and so I have to leave it to the scientists to decide whether the studies are predictive. But in the report we did for the Nuffield Council, we thought it was very important to make a distinction between the scientific questions and the moral questions because even if it is true that we learn a lot from animal experiments, it doesn't follow from that that they're morally acceptable. And so we do have to take the ethical questions separately from the scientific question. PALCA: Okay. So now I want to go back, Justin, if you'll indulge me for a second with Dr. Conn because it does seem as if there's - is there a question I would never have doubted the validity of animals in research based on, you know, 25 years of science reporting, but do you have any doubts at all? Dr. CONN: Our obligation to animals, Joe, is that they don't suffer or feel pain. Our obligation to people is that we respect people's rights to be self-directing  within the context of society. There's been a great deal of discussion about the morality of doing research and I was actually - I receive a great deal of insight from comments made by the Dalai Lama when he addressed the neuroscience meeting in - I think it was 2005. He said, I encourage the minimum use of experiments on animals; the absolute minimum of pain; only perform highly necessary experiments with as little pain as possible. If it must be done and that is your path, it is compassionate to kill out of necessity, but only with empathy. I think that's extremely telling and I think it addresses something that we all embrace in animal research and that is the three Rs: reduction, refinement and replacement. PALCA: Okay, Dr, Conn, I'm going to have to cut you off there because we have to take a short break. Justin, thank you very much for starting this topic. We will not stop here. And do stay with us. We'll be right back after a short break. This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) PALCA: From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Joe Palca. We're talking this hour about animal research. My guests are Michael Conn. He's the associate director of the Oregon National Primate Research Center and the co-author of the new book, \"The Animal Research War. \" And Jonathan Wolff has joined us. He's a philosophy professor at University College London, who helped write a 2005 bioethics report on animal experimentation. And I want to come back to those three Rs that you were mentioning, Dr. Conn, but I want to - I just want to belabor Justin's point for one more second which is - is the use of animals scientifically valid because as Dr. Wolff said, you know, there's a moral question that has to be dealt with. But if they're not even getting useful information from animals - which I never knew was even being seriously suggested - but if you're not, then you shouldn't even - then why bother in the first place? So do you accept the premise that animals are not valuable as predictors for behavior of drugs and what have you and in understanding human disease? Dr. CONN: Animals are very valuable but they're not perfect predictors. In fact, anyone watching the news recently will know that drug trials for cough medicine that was tested in adults failed to provide accurate data for children. The drug industry has known for years that even things like gender, age and the ethnic background of test subjects may result in data that's only reliable for that demographic. In the same way one could certainly argue that fish are not very good models for human hearing aids but in point of fact, the proof is in the pudding. The majority of the cures that have come out in the last century has come as the direct result of animal research. Diabetes was first discovered in dogs and it was animal studies that helped us understand the mechanism by which diabetes occurs. PALCA: So coming back to you, Jonathan Wolff, and the report that you wrote, I presume that it starts with the premise, at least, that there is some value in using animals in research, else, why bother coming up with a report to discuss the appropriate use of animals in research? Dr. WOLFF: Well, it's certainly a question we have to consider because we receive - we took evidence from the public and we got quite a few letters arguing exactly the point that Justin made before that there's no predictive power. And indeed, some people argued that some animal research had held up medical research because if we haven't been wasting our time experimenting on animals, we would have done other things which were much more valuable, so we have to consider this. And in fact, our view in the end - not my view because I didn't write that part, but the view of the committee was very similar to Dr. Conn's view. There are many mistakes but there are also many benefits as well. PALCA: Not your view? Dr. WOLFF: Well, it's not - I didn't have a view because I'm not competent with scientific\u2026 PALCA: Got it. Okay. All right. That's fine. That's a perfectly reasonable point of view. All right. Let's take another call now and let's go to Najib(ph) in Oklahoma City, I guess, Oklahoma. Welcome to the program. NAJIB (Caller): Thank you for taking my call. Good afternoon, gentlemen. PALCA: Good afternoon. NAJIB: It's a very, very interesting subject. I'm a professional scientist and I work for a public university here in Oklahoma and I'm also a member of a committee on - at the university which is called the Animal Use Committee. And I was wondering if I could bring the discussion to a more pragmatic point which is that the federal government mandates that such committees exist on all institutions where animal research is conducted. And this committee is charged with the mission of ensuring that animals are used humanely and one of the things that we have on our research protocols, the three Rs that have been mentioned in the discussion. The first one is replace and one of the questions we ask of our researchers to do is to ask them, have you considered alternatives to animal use? In other words, have you considered replacing the animals that you're requesting for the kind of work that you do and the kind of hypothesis that you are positing. And thank you, I'll get your comments off the air. PALCA: Thank you very much, Najib. What about that, Dr. Conn? Dr. CONN: Well, the - one of the things that we learned when we were writing the book that surprised us is about half of the American population does not realize that animal research is regulated. Not only is it regulated very, very strictly by the Animal Welfare Act in the United States but there are comparable laws in the U. K. and other parts of the world as well. These laws give the USDA the ability to come in and inspect our facility - and inspect, they do. The USDA shows up at random times during the year, typically about twice a year. Last year, it happened to have been three times a year. And they show up at random times. Everyone stops what they're doing. They can open any door. They can look in any closet. They look to make sure that we don't have any Tylenol that's two weeks beyond expiration date. If we do, we get cited. They can also shut us down. They can also levy very heavy fines and they've done that at institutions in the past when they're out of compliance. PALCA: So, Dr. Wolff, Jonathan Wolff, in the U. K. , are there similar protections - are more stringent or do you know the differences between the U. S. and the U. K. ? r. WOLFF: Well, we believe that we are the most stringent country for regulations - though perhaps every country thinks that, but we have very similar regulations for the ones just described. PALCA: And, I mean, but the regulations presuppose again that any research is acceptable in any - and that some pain is acceptable or disease induction because the benefit is there. So you're still starting with some level of use that some people will object to? Dr. WOLFF: Well, that's true. And we do, in our regulations, have the committee that performs the type of cost-benefit analysis which they use to grant a license. And so if you're applying for license, you have to show there's going to be a medical benefit for human health or animal health. And the committee has to be convinced that the benefits do outweigh the costs. But you know, the problem with any cost-benefit analysis is when you have a situation where the benefits go to one group and all the costs fall on another, and that really is what is morally problematic for many people. But even though many animal experimentations are done for animals, they're not done for the animals who are in the experiments and these will suffer, some think, maybe not very much pain but they will die prematurely, and that is a concern for some people - many people, I think. PALCA: Let's take another call now and go to Angie(ph) in Chicago, Illinois. Angie, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. ANGIE (Caller): Oh, hi. I'm a research scientist and I happen to have a love of animals. I have many animals at home and actually studied animal sciences in school and ended up in a human research lab because of the more availability of jobs. And - but I guess - so that's just my background - but I guess I wanted - my comment was or question - I understand that he call animal rights activist, terrorists and militant, but it's kind of sounds biased to me. You're coming off saying he's militant, animal rights activist instead of saying these animal rights activists which some of them you know, do, you know, non-justifiable actions but there are people out there, like I feel, you know, a lot of empathy and feelings for the animals that we use in our lab, and I guess, to be called a militant person because I have a - I feel\u2026 PALCA: Well, I\u2026 ANGIE: \u2026animals do\u2026 PALCA: No, I think you're making a fair point. I think, as I hear it and I'll let Michael Conn speak to this, but we're making a distinction here between people who hold strong beliefs and would prefer, I think, even in your book, Michael Conn, there's a card that some people are - you know, you offer to people saying I don't want to benefit from animal research, I don't want to take part in it, I don't want my research dollars to go for it so I'm signing this card, you know, I'm saying, don't do anything beneficial for me that's based on animal research, then we make a distinction between people who have a moral objection and people who take that moral objection and use it to justify violent threats against researchers. At least, that's how I would see it, Michael Conn, maybe I didn't characterize it properly. Dr. CONN: Well, when I call people extremists, I'm talking about individuals who believe in no leather, no pets and no medical research and those views are very extreme compared to most of the public. It is absolutely okay for you or anyone to disagree with me, to publicly discuss your views, to lobby your congressmen, to try to change the law. What is not okay is to put a bomb at my doorstep and menace my family. People living in a civilized society can all agree that firebombing homes and threatening children, is not part of the acceptable process of bringing about political change. In a democracy, fear and intimidation cannot be allowed to play a part in changing the hearts and minds of people. ANGIE: Sure, but I think it's important when we're on a national media like this that we don't give people that are really fighting for animal rights maybe in an honest way and a good way that we don't give them a bad name, too. PALCA: Right, so, you're saying, be - don't tar people with a broad brush stroke that there's nuance in this debate, and I appreciate you're bringing that point up. ANGIE: Okay. PALCA: I think now, we've been talking some about alternatives to animals and research, and we have another guest this hour who can speak directly to that question. William Stokes is the director of the National Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods, a committee organized by the NI - National Institutes of Health that helps look at using non-animal alternatives in the lab. Welcome to the program, Dr. Stokes. Doctor WILLIAM STOKES (Director, National Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences): Thank you very much, Joe. PALCA: So\u2026 Dr. STOKES: I appreciate the opportunity to be on your show. PALCA: Good. So tell me, what is this new program? How will it replace animals that are currently being used in research? Dr. STOKES: Well, we have a inter-agency committee that involves all the federal agencies that are responsible for safeguarding the public health and safety of both animals and people and the environment. We work together to review, propose new alternative methods. And I just want to emphasize that those alternative methods are ones that reduce the number of animals used for a procedure or replace the animals with a non-animal approach or refine the procedure to reduce discomfort that is experienced by the animals. So we have actually had this committee operating for 10 years now and we have looked at a variety of alternative methods and many of these have now been adopted and are being used for - by regulatory agencies for determining whether chemicals and products are safe or hazardous to people, animals or the environment. PALCA: So, I mean, do you have an estimate? Is this going to eliminate hundreds of animals, thousands of animals, tens of thousands of animals from research? Dr. STOKES: Well, we estimate that it's had a fairly significant effect. Just one example is a test that's used to determine whether a chemical can be poisonous to people or children. It's called the Acute Oral Toxicity Test. When it originated early in the 20th century, it was standard to use up to 200 animals to conduct that test. By the '80s, that number was down to 25. And we recently reviewed and endorsed a method that's been adopted internationally now to make that determination that only uses about six to nine animals. So, you know, there's a 70 percent reduction on average in the number of animals used for that particular test. And that is the most common toxicity test or safety test conducted in the world, so I think that's pretty significant. PALCA: Jonathan Wolff, has this kind of thing been taking place in the U. K. , this idea of replacing, you know, using toxicological screens involving cells rather than living animals? Dr. WOLFF: Yes. And the idea - and I have to say - was invented in the U. K. \u2026 PALCA: Ah. Dr. WOLFF: \u2026from Richard Ryder in the 1950s. And it was ignored for about 20 years - now, become fashionable again. And, yet the three Rs are I think very important and there's no doubt that if we could really carry them forward, this would be the way of the future, I think. And the scientists I have spoken to have been enthusiastic. But what we have to realize is, particularly on the replacement end, it is limited, so we can make a distinction between safety testing and drug research. And although a certain amount of safety testing can be done using replacement techniques, cell cultures and so on, it's very hard to see how you can test a drug on something less than a whole animal, so there are limits to the three Rs, particularly on replacements. PALCA: We are talking this hour about animals in research: the ethics, the merits and the possibilities for replacing them, I suppose, that - that would be one way of looking at it. I'm Joe Palca and this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And now, we have a query from the people who are listening to this program on - in Second Life on SCIENCE FRIDAY Island. And we have a question from Manther Riptide(ph) who says, theoretically, don't many researchers need to file petitions showing lack of alternative safety testing. Michael Conn, is there a need most to researchers to say, this is why we must use animals in this particular project? Dr. CONN: Absolutely there is. Every protocol is reviewed according to the three Rs. We try to reduce the number of animals used; to refine the techniques so there's less pain and suffering; and ultimately, to replace the animals with non-animal techniques. I think that's something we all agree on. Animal research is very costly and very difficult. And as new alternatives become available, I will be first in line to use them. I read an article by Dr. Wolff in which he noted that between the '70s and today, animal use has already been halved. PALCA: Dr. Wolff, is that the direction you think things are going in? Dr. WOLFF: Well, I hope it is. I fear it might not be because we live in a time when we are more and more concerned about chemicals and toxins and safety. And so we have had directives in the E. U. that a great deal more safety testing must be done. So at the same time, it is trying to reduce the number of animals in research, we have increasing numbers used to safety testing in some areas. But also we have to remember that there are lots of other ways in which animals are used in scientific research, for example, in genetic modification. And so there's a need or scientific need to often to create genetically-mutated mice, say, for particular purposes. But this is very haphazard and thousands - hundreds of thousands of mice will be bred without the correct mutation and euthanized - is the term. And what worries a lot of people, I think, is that huge loss of life, admittedly, animal life. But the fundamental moral question is whether an animal life is less valuable than a human life. Now, it may be that it is, but we need to think, why is this? What are the reasons? What are the arguments? PALCA: All right. Fair enough. Let's - I think we have time for one quick call before the break. And let's go to Rick(ph) in Phoenix, Arizona. Rick, welcome to the program. RICK (Caller): Oh, good afternoon, gentlemen. A very interesting topic today. Just very briefly, I had polio in 1952 - full paralysis of both legs, braces throughout the childhood, throughout my adulthood, and now suffer from post-polio  muscular atrophy where I'm losing whatever muscle tone I had gained through arduous efforts throughout my life. And if it hadn't been for Salk growing the vaccine in the pancreas of Rhesus, this scourge of mankind which has been - there's even a cartouche of a pharaoh with the characteristic flail leg of a polio victim. If it hadn't been for Salk and other sciences - scientists working with animals to create this vaccine, millions of children would suffer the same fate that I suffer. PALCA: Right. RICK: And that would end my comment other than saying that the animal rights activists seem to be as ignorant of the scientific method as most Americans. PALCA: Oh, well. RICK: End of comment. PALCA: Okay, Rick. Thank you very much for that call. Well, we are going to continue talking about the use of animals in research: the benefits and the ethics and the possibilities of replacement. So stay with us. We will be right back after a short break. (Soundbite of music) PALCA: From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Joe Palca. We are talking about animals in research and my guests this hour are Michael Conn, he's the associate director of the Oregon National Primate Research Center; Jonathan Wolff, a philosophy professor at the University College London; and William Stokes. Dr. Stokes is at the National Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods. It's a committee organized by the National Institutes of Health that helps look at using non-animal  alternatives in the lab. And really, what I wanted to do is ask each of you gentlemen, as we wind up this segment, to speak to the question of, what's missing in the debate? I mean, William Stokes, has there been an aspect of the animal research debate that hasn't gotten enough attention in your opinion? And maybe that there are alternatives but what's missing from the debate from your point of view? Dr. STOKES: Well, I'm a veterinarian by training and I actually specialized in laboratory animal medicine. And I think it's really important, as Dr. Wolff pointed out, to - for the public to understand that animals are only used where they have to be used and that their use has to be justified; that they must be used in the most humane way possible; and that the number of animals used can only be that number that's necessary for scientific validity; and that animals in the laboratory get exceedingly good care; that they all have an attending veterinarian that's trained in laboratory animals. I think the other thing that's missing is there's not much emphasis given to the progress that's being made in both research and in the area of testing. Where we are able to use non-animal methods and where those are having an impact on the animal research, we've made incredible advances in being able to grow different types of cells and organs within the body and culture. We've come up with improved computational approaches, including the new science of informatics where we can integrate very complex biological information. And I think it's important for the public to be aware of this progress that is being made and that's often not discussed. PALCA: Okay. Jonathan Wolff, what about - what's missing here that should be given more emphasis, in your opinion? Dr. WOLFF: Well, I agree with everything that's just been said and I think there's this tremendous lack of knowledge. And I would just say, talking(ph) very briefly, which is that I think a lot of people who give money for charity, medical charities, don't understand where that money goes. So if people who make a donation to a heart charity or cancer charity, they somehow think that the inputted money and the output will be a cure, without thinking that that money is paying for laboratory experiments, very often on animals. And I'm not saying this will change peoples' view but it does seem to me important that people know what is happening to the money that they provide. PALCA: All right. Interesting point. Finally, Dr. Michael Conn, go ahead with - what's missing? You've written a book trying to call peoples' attention to this what you call a silent war. What do you think is missing? Dr. CONN: We are. We're trying to get it on the public agenda. We want people to know that animals are treated well in research and that a great deal of good comes from research. The question I would end with is, does the possibility of a child having a normal lifetime weigh less than the abstract principle that we cannot use animals in research? PALCA: Well, we'll leave that one hanging in the air just as you've phrased it. Thank you very much, all three of you gentlemen for joining me today. Dr. CONN: Thank you very much, Joe. PALCA: That was\u2026 Dr. STOKES: Thanks, Joe. PALCA: You're welcome. Michael Conn - that was Michael Conn. He's the associate director of the Oregon National Primate Research Center. He's also the co-author of the forthcoming book, \"The Animal Research War\" from Palgrave Macmillan. We also spoke with Jonathan Wolff, a philosophy professor at University College London, who helped write a 2005 bioethics report on animal experimentation; and also William Stokes. He's the Director of the National Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods, a committee organized by the National Institutes of Health that helps look at using non-animal alternatives in the laboratory.  JOE PALCA, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Joe Palca sitting in for Ira Flatow.  It may only be the last day of February but 2008 has already been a busy year for militant animal rights activists. These protesters use tactics like smear campaigns, vandalism, and sometimes violence to try and stop researchers from experimenting on animals in the lab. They appear to be responsible for a fire at a UCLA scientist home three weeks ago and there are allegations activists were involved in another attack on a West Coast researcher's home just last weekend. Overseas, in Europe, businesses associated with animal research are reporting an increase in vandalism.  Today on SCIENCE FRIDAY, we're exploring the issue of animal rights and research ethics. If you'd like to join us, give us call. Our number is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. And if you want more information about what we'll be talking about at this hour, go to our Web site at www. ScienceFriday. com where you'll find links to our topic.  And let me introduce my first guest this hour, Michael Conn, is associate director of the Oregon National Primate Research Center. He is also co-author with James Parker of the forthcoming book, \"The Animal Research War\" from Palgrave Macmillan, in which he discusses the rise of the militant animal rights movement. He joins us from Portland.  Welcome.  Doctor MICHAEL CONN (Associate Director, Oregon National Primate Research Center, Oregon Health and Science University; Co-Author, \"The Animal Research War\"): Hello, Joe, and thanks very much for featuring this important topic.  PALCA: Well, thank you for joining us. And frankly, you know, as someone who is bringing this up, you know, it is tend to be - it does tend to be sort of - scientists seem to like to have a low profile about this, and in fact, in your book, you talk about the silent war. Can you tell me more about what you mean about - when you say that, silent war?  Dr. CONN: Well, the war against animal researchers is a very real and, as you pointed out, very violent war but all but invisible in the media. And that was one of the reasons that Jim Parker and I wrote this book. We would like to place this on the public agenda. We'd like the public to understand that there are researchers who are now walking away from productive careers because they fear for their families's wellbeing.  Extremist groups are having a strangling effect on a lot of drug development. The book talks about the battles, the spies and the casualties in the animal research war, but our fear that if the extremists win, the real losers will be the public - all the people struggling with disease.  PALCA: But if you - I mean, there's always a double-edged sword here because on the one hand, you can certainly point to examples of research that's benefiting humans and the human health. But there's certainly research that has also gone nowhere and - in retrospect, anyway - caused unnecessary suffering from animals. And you sometimes wonder, well, if people really knew the whole story maybe they wouldn't - they'd say on balance, you know, we don't want the benefits because the costs are too great. What do you say to that?  Dr. CONN: Well, I think every once in a while you hear about something that's gone wrong, a bad scenario, and just for the moment because as often as not, we don't really know what happened. Let's assume that some of these scenarios are true. So what you're really saying then is because people die in car accidents, we shouldn't drive cars. Just because there are occasional problems, it does not mean you should turn off a pipeline. It is unquestionably improved the circumstances not only of people but of animals as well.  We live in a wonderful time. The happy news is that a lot of young people you'd talked to will think the iron lung is a rock group. They won't remember polio, they won't remember small pox. Those are some of the major triumphs of animal research. They affect virtually everybody's life.  Research as you point out is a tradeoff. In order to learn more how to help humans, we engage in animal experimentation, but this experimentation is governed by strict rules and regulations put on our plate by the federal government. There is very little pain or suffering in animal research.  PALCA: You know, you're at the Oregon National Primate Research Center, and over the years, I've had occasion to do stories that involved your institution and every time I call there's a great trepidation about what's the media going to say if they come here. And then I have to do - I feel a lot of convincing that I'm, you know, that I'm not coming in to do a expose of some sort, I'm just interested in the science - although I suppose if there were an expose to be done, I'd want to do that, too. But the point is, it seems to me there's a defensive quality on the part of scientists as well, not just because - it may be justifiably but certainly it's sometimes hard to get in the door to hear the story of what the benefits are.  Dr. CONN: Well, there's a couple of reasons for that. Some of them are technical. Because our animals are susceptible to human tuberculosis, we require anyone who enters the facilities to have proof of not being tuberculin positive. Beyond that, just interacting with the animals requires some training. It's not a good idea and it's very stressful for animals - when you stare at them, it upsets them. It upsets animals when there are new people around them. They wonder what's going on.  But one of our real problems has to do with the media. In an effort to create balanced news casts, media frequently give individuals with extremist views, people who make outlandish and often untrue accusations the same platform and the same air time as researchers. The public presumes that the truth is somewhere in between. The media should strive to find out the truth and report that.  PALCA: And so, can you cite an example of where a claim by an animal rights group has been given equal weight with a scientifically valid point of view?  Dr. CONN: Absolutely. One of the things that drew my attention to writing this book, to begin with, came from a personal experience when I went on a trip to the East Coast - I'm on the West Coast now. And what happened was an animal extremist learned that I was going to be taking that trip, and this is an individual who'd said that the killing of animal researchers is warranted in order to stop animal research. He posted that on his listserv and I was followed around for about two and half days. They tried to meet me at the airport. They made wild accusations to the media which were reported by the media. I was in a very defensive mode trying to address them when in fact they were made up from whole cloth, and I ended being on the same platform as individuals who were literally making up stories.  At the time, we were not using monkeys at all, in fact. And at that time, I hadn't even used rats in several years. But they made all kinds of outlandish claims, put up billboards at the university where I was and used public access laws in that state to attend meetings, to shout at me. And it really got us nowhere.  PALCA: Okay. Let's take a call right now because this is obviously a very contentious issue but let's go now to the phones and talk to Justin(ph) in Vernon, Connecticut.  Justin, welcome to the program.  JUSTIN (Caller): Thanks for taking my call, Joe.  PALCA: You bet.  JUSTIN: You know, I think, it's kind of undeniable that there's this growing body of research showing that grandiose claims about, you know, the predictive value and contribution of animal experiments to human health are completely unfounded, and that the overwhelming majority of all animal experiments have no utility at all for human health\u2026  PALCA: So wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's a pretty broad statement. Can you cite a scientific paper or\u2026  JUSTIN: There's an article that came out in this month's journal of Royal Society of Medicine. It's written by Robert Matthews.  PALCA: Okay.  JUSTIN: He makes these claims exactly and he says\u2026  PALCA: Well\u2026  JUSTIN: \u2026the successes that have come from animal experiments are nothing more than anecdotal much like - I would suggest the claims that Mr. Conn is making about the existence of violence in the animals rights movement.  PALCA: Okay. Well, okay, let's ask first, Mr. Conn - Dr. Conn if he knows about this article in the Proceedings of the Royal Society\u2026  Dr. CONN: I do not. But there's many, many examples in the literature suggesting just the otherwise to be true. I mean, let's face it.  PALCA: Right.  Dr. CONN: Even humans are not perfect models for other humans. Animals are not perfect models for humans, but there is one classic study that has been often cited in the literature and it was done by Harry Olson and colleagues. And what they did was they brought together the results from 12 different international pharmaceutic companies and they looked at the productivity of animal tests in human toxicity.  The overall conclusion from 150 randomly selected compounds and 221 human toxicity events was that the animal model had significant predictive power to detect most but not all areas of human toxicity, so there is a big advantage. If you look at the history\u2026  JUSTIN: And the FDA\u2026  Dr. CONN: \u2026and we do a lot\u2026  JUSTIN: The FDA also reports that 95 percent of drugs that are tested on animals fail in human clinical trials because they can't predict the side effects of the drugs in animals that are going to result in human beings\u2026  PALCA: Justin, hold on. Hold on a second. And Dr. Conn, hold on a second. We may be able to cut through this because I have another guest who's on the line and he's actually from the U. K. and I'm going to bring him on now.  Jonathan Wolff is a member of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics and he's a professor and department head in Philosophy at University College London.  Welcome to the program, Dr. Wolff.  Doctor JONATHAN WOLFF (Member, Nuffield Council on Bioethics; Professor and Department Head, Philosophy, University College London): I'll say good evening because it's evening in my time.  PALCA: Well, fine, that's good. We'll accept that. We're familiar with time change here. So I don't know if you've been hearing what we're just talking about but there was allegedly or apparently an article in - is it, Justin, which journal?  JUSTIN: The journal of the Royal Society of Medicine\u2026  PALCA: Journal of the Royal Society\u2026  JUSTIN: \u2026by Robert Matthews.  PALCA: By Matthews, talking about the lack of predictive value of animal research.  Did you see that article, by any chance?  Dr. WOLFF: I didn't see that one. I'm familiar with those sort of claims. Yeah.  PALCA: And what do you make of them in general?  Dr. WOLFF: Well, I'm a philosopher not a scientist and so I have to leave it to the scientists to decide whether the studies are predictive.  But in the report we did for the Nuffield Council, we thought it was very important to make a distinction between the scientific questions and the moral questions because even if it is true that we learn a lot from animal experiments, it doesn't follow from that that they're morally acceptable. And so we do have to take the ethical questions separately from the scientific question.  PALCA: Okay. So now I want to go back, Justin, if you'll indulge me for a second with Dr. Conn because it does seem as if there's - is there a question I would never have doubted the validity of animals in research based on, you know, 25 years of science reporting, but do you have any doubts at all?  Dr. CONN: Our obligation to animals, Joe, is that they don't suffer or feel pain. Our obligation to people is that we respect people's rights to be self-directing  within the context of society.  There's been a great deal of discussion about the morality of doing research and I was actually - I receive a great deal of insight from comments made by the Dalai Lama when he addressed the neuroscience meeting in - I think it was 2005. He said, I encourage the minimum use of experiments on animals; the absolute minimum of pain; only perform highly necessary experiments with as little pain as possible. If it must be done and that is your path, it is compassionate to kill out of necessity, but only with empathy.  I think that's extremely telling and I think it addresses something that we all embrace in animal research and that is the three Rs: reduction, refinement and replacement.  PALCA: Okay, Dr, Conn, I'm going to have to cut you off there because we have to take a short break.  Justin, thank you very much for starting this topic. We will not stop here.  And do stay with us. We'll be right back after a short break.  This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  PALCA: From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Joe Palca.  We're talking this hour about animal research. My guests are Michael Conn. He's the associate director of the Oregon National Primate Research Center and the co-author of the new book, \"The Animal Research War. \" And Jonathan Wolff has joined us. He's a philosophy professor at University College London, who helped write a 2005 bioethics report on animal experimentation.  And I want to come back to those three Rs that you were mentioning, Dr. Conn, but I want to - I just want to belabor Justin's point for one more second which is - is the use of animals scientifically valid because as Dr. Wolff said, you know, there's a moral question that has to be dealt with. But if they're not even getting useful information from animals - which I never knew was even being seriously suggested - but if you're not, then you shouldn't even - then why bother in the first place? So do you accept the premise that animals are not valuable as predictors for behavior of drugs and what have you and in understanding human disease?  Dr. CONN: Animals are very valuable but they're not perfect predictors. In fact, anyone watching the news recently will know that drug trials for cough medicine that was tested in adults failed to provide accurate data for children. The drug industry has known for years that even things like gender, age and the ethnic background of test subjects may result in data that's only reliable for that demographic.  In the same way one could certainly argue that fish are not very good models for human hearing aids but in point of fact, the proof is in the pudding. The majority of the cures that have come out in the last century has come as the direct result of animal research. Diabetes was first discovered in dogs and it was animal studies that helped us understand the mechanism by which diabetes occurs.  PALCA: So coming back to you, Jonathan Wolff, and the report that you wrote, I presume that it starts with the premise, at least, that there is some value in using animals in research, else, why bother coming up with a report to discuss the appropriate use of animals in research?  Dr. WOLFF: Well, it's certainly a question we have to consider because we receive - we took evidence from the public and we got quite a few letters arguing exactly the point that Justin made before that there's no predictive power. And indeed, some people argued that some animal research had held up medical research because if we haven't been wasting our time experimenting on animals, we would have done other things which were much more valuable, so we have to consider this.  And in fact, our view in the end - not my view because I didn't write that part, but the view of the committee was very similar to Dr. Conn's view. There are many mistakes but there are also many benefits as well.  PALCA: Not your view?  Dr. WOLFF: Well, it's not - I didn't have a view because I'm not competent with scientific\u2026  PALCA: Got it. Okay. All right. That's fine. That's a perfectly reasonable point of view.  All right. Let's take another call now and let's go to Najib(ph) in Oklahoma City, I guess, Oklahoma.  Welcome to the program.  NAJIB (Caller): Thank you for taking my call. Good afternoon, gentlemen.  PALCA: Good afternoon.  NAJIB: It's a very, very interesting subject. I'm a professional scientist and I work for a public university here in Oklahoma and I'm also a member of a committee on - at the university which is called the Animal Use Committee. And I was wondering if I could bring the discussion to a more pragmatic point which is that the federal government mandates that such committees exist on all institutions where animal research is conducted. And this committee is charged with the mission of ensuring that animals are used humanely and one of the things that we have on our research protocols, the three Rs that have been mentioned in the discussion.  The first one is replace and one of the questions we ask of our researchers to do is to ask them, have you considered alternatives to animal use? In other words, have you considered replacing the animals that you're requesting for the kind of work that you do and the kind of hypothesis that you are positing. And thank you, I'll get your comments off the air.  PALCA: Thank you very much, Najib.  What about that, Dr. Conn?  Dr. CONN: Well, the - one of the things that we learned when we were writing the book that surprised us is about half of the American population does not realize that animal research is regulated. Not only is it regulated very, very strictly by the Animal Welfare Act in the United States but there are comparable laws in the U. K. and other parts of the world as well. These laws give the USDA the ability to come in and inspect our facility - and inspect, they do.  The USDA shows up at random times during the year, typically about twice a year. Last year, it happened to have been three times a year. And they show up at random times. Everyone stops what they're doing. They can open any door. They can look in any closet. They look to make sure that we don't have any Tylenol that's two weeks beyond expiration date. If we do, we get cited. They can also shut us down. They can also levy very heavy fines and they've done that at institutions in the past when they're out of compliance.  PALCA: So, Dr. Wolff, Jonathan Wolff, in the U. K. , are there similar protections - are more stringent or do you know the differences between the U. S. and the U. K. ?  r. WOLFF: Well, we believe that we are the most stringent country for regulations - though perhaps every country thinks that, but we have very similar regulations for the ones just described.  PALCA: And, I mean, but the regulations presuppose again that any research is acceptable in any - and that some pain is acceptable or disease induction because the benefit is there. So you're still starting with some level of use that some people will object to?  Dr. WOLFF: Well, that's true. And we do, in our regulations, have the committee that performs the type of cost-benefit analysis which they use to grant a license. And so if you're applying for license, you have to show there's going to be a medical benefit for human health or animal health. And the committee has to be convinced that the benefits do outweigh the costs. But you know, the problem with any cost-benefit analysis is when you have a situation where the benefits go to one group and all the costs fall on another, and that really is what is morally problematic for many people.  But even though many animal experimentations are done for animals, they're not done for the animals who are in the experiments and these will suffer, some think, maybe not very much pain but they will die prematurely, and that is a concern for some people - many people, I think.  PALCA: Let's take another call now and go to Angie(ph) in Chicago, Illinois.  Angie, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  ANGIE (Caller): Oh, hi. I'm a research scientist and I happen to have a love of animals. I have many animals at home and actually studied animal sciences in school and ended up in a human research lab because of the more availability of jobs. And - but I guess - so that's just my background - but I guess I wanted - my comment was or question - I understand that he call animal rights activist, terrorists and militant, but it's kind of sounds biased to me. You're coming off saying he's militant, animal rights activist instead of saying these animal rights activists which some of them you know, do, you know, non-justifiable actions but there are people out there, like I feel, you know, a lot of empathy and feelings for the animals that we use in our lab, and I guess, to be called a militant person because I have a - I feel\u2026  PALCA: Well, I\u2026  ANGIE: \u2026animals do\u2026  PALCA: No, I think you're making a fair point. I think, as I hear it and I'll let Michael Conn speak to this, but we're making a distinction here between people who hold strong beliefs and would prefer, I think, even in your book, Michael Conn, there's a card that some people are - you know, you offer to people saying I don't want to benefit from animal research, I don't want to take part in it, I don't want my research dollars to go for it so I'm signing this card, you know, I'm saying, don't do anything beneficial for me that's based on animal research, then we make a distinction between people who have a moral objection and people who take that moral objection and use it to justify violent threats against researchers. At least, that's how I would see it, Michael Conn, maybe I didn't characterize it properly.  Dr. CONN: Well, when I call people extremists, I'm talking about individuals who believe in no leather, no pets and no medical research and those views are very extreme compared to most of the public. It is absolutely okay for you or anyone to disagree with me, to publicly discuss your views, to lobby your congressmen, to try to change the law. What is not okay is to put a bomb at my doorstep and menace my family. People living in a civilized society can all agree that firebombing homes and threatening children, is not part of the acceptable process of bringing about political change. In a democracy, fear and intimidation cannot be allowed to play a part in changing the hearts and minds of people.  ANGIE: Sure, but I think it's important when we're on a national media like this that we don't give people that are really fighting for animal rights maybe in an honest way and a good way that we don't give them a bad name, too.  PALCA: Right, so, you're saying, be - don't tar people with a broad brush stroke that there's nuance in this debate, and I appreciate you're bringing that point up.  ANGIE: Okay.  PALCA: I think now, we've been talking some about alternatives to animals and research, and we have another guest this hour who can speak directly to that question.  William Stokes is the director of the National Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods, a committee organized by the NI - National Institutes of Health that helps look at using non-animal alternatives in the lab.  Welcome to the program, Dr. Stokes.  Doctor WILLIAM STOKES (Director, National Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences): Thank you very much, Joe.  PALCA: So\u2026  Dr. STOKES: I appreciate the opportunity to be on your show.  PALCA: Good. So tell me, what is this new program? How will it replace animals that are currently being used in research?  Dr. STOKES: Well, we have a inter-agency committee that involves all the federal agencies that are responsible for safeguarding the public health and safety of both animals and people and the environment. We work together to review, propose new alternative methods. And I just want to emphasize that those alternative methods are ones that reduce the number of animals used for a procedure or replace the animals with a non-animal approach or refine the procedure to reduce discomfort that is experienced by the animals.  So we have actually had this committee operating for 10 years now and we have looked at a variety of alternative methods and many of these have now been adopted and are being used for - by regulatory agencies for determining whether chemicals and products are safe or hazardous to people, animals or the environment.  PALCA: So, I mean, do you have an estimate? Is this going to eliminate hundreds of animals, thousands of animals, tens of thousands of animals from research?  Dr. STOKES: Well, we estimate that it's had a fairly significant effect. Just one example is a test that's used to determine whether a chemical can be poisonous to people or children. It's called the Acute Oral Toxicity Test. When it originated early in the 20th century, it was standard to use up to 200 animals to conduct that test. By the '80s, that number was down to 25. And we recently reviewed and endorsed a method that's been adopted internationally now to make that determination that only uses about six to nine animals. So, you know, there's a 70 percent reduction on average in the number of animals used for that particular test. And that is the most common toxicity test or safety test conducted in the world, so I think that's pretty significant.  PALCA: Jonathan Wolff, has this kind of thing been taking place in the U. K. , this idea of replacing, you know, using toxicological screens involving cells rather than living animals?  Dr. WOLFF: Yes. And the idea - and I have to say - was invented in the U. K. \u2026  PALCA: Ah.  Dr. WOLFF: \u2026from Richard Ryder in the 1950s. And it was ignored for about 20 years - now, become fashionable again. And, yet the three Rs are I think very important and there's no doubt that if we could really carry them forward, this would be the way of the future, I think. And the scientists I have spoken to have been enthusiastic. But what we have to realize is, particularly on the replacement end, it is limited, so we can make a distinction between safety testing and drug research. And although a certain amount of safety testing can be done using replacement techniques, cell cultures and so on, it's very hard to see how you can test a drug on something less than a whole animal, so there are limits to the three Rs, particularly on replacements.  PALCA: We are talking this hour about animals in research: the ethics, the merits and the possibilities for replacing them, I suppose, that - that would be one way of looking at it.  I'm Joe Palca and this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  And now, we have a query from the people who are listening to this program on - in Second Life on SCIENCE FRIDAY Island. And we have a question from Manther Riptide(ph) who says, theoretically, don't many researchers need to file petitions showing lack of alternative safety testing.  Michael Conn, is there a need most to researchers to say, this is why we must use animals in this particular project?  Dr. CONN: Absolutely there is. Every protocol is reviewed according to the three Rs. We try to reduce the number of animals used; to refine the techniques so there's less pain and suffering; and ultimately, to replace the animals with non-animal techniques. I think that's something we all agree on. Animal research is very costly and very difficult. And as new alternatives become available, I will be first in line to use them.  I read an article by Dr. Wolff in which he noted that between the '70s and today, animal use has already been halved.  PALCA: Dr. Wolff, is that the direction you think things are going in?  Dr. WOLFF: Well, I hope it is. I fear it might not be because we live in a time when we are more and more concerned about chemicals and toxins and safety. And so we have had directives in the E. U. that a great deal more safety testing must be done. So at the same time, it is trying to reduce the number of animals in research, we have increasing numbers used to safety testing in some areas.  But also we have to remember that there are lots of other ways in which animals are used in scientific research, for example, in genetic modification. And so there's a need or scientific need to often to create genetically-mutated mice, say, for particular purposes. But this is very haphazard and thousands - hundreds of thousands of mice will be bred without the correct mutation and euthanized - is the term.  And what worries a lot of people, I think, is that huge loss of life, admittedly, animal life. But the fundamental moral question is whether an animal life is less valuable than a human life. Now, it may be that it is, but we need to think, why is this? What are the reasons? What are the arguments?  PALCA: All right. Fair enough. Let's - I think we have time for one quick call before the break. And let's go to Rick(ph) in Phoenix, Arizona.  Rick, welcome to the program.  RICK (Caller): Oh, good afternoon, gentlemen. A very interesting topic today. Just very briefly, I had polio in 1952 - full paralysis of both legs, braces throughout the childhood, throughout my adulthood, and now suffer from post-polio  muscular atrophy where I'm losing whatever muscle tone I had gained through arduous efforts throughout my life. And if it hadn't been for Salk growing the vaccine in the pancreas of Rhesus, this scourge of mankind which has been - there's even a cartouche of a pharaoh with the characteristic flail leg of a polio victim. If it hadn't been for Salk and other sciences - scientists working with animals to create this vaccine, millions of children would suffer the same fate that I suffer.  PALCA: Right.  RICK: And that would end my comment other than saying that the animal rights activists seem to be as ignorant of the scientific method as most Americans.  PALCA: Oh, well.  RICK: End of comment.  PALCA: Okay, Rick. Thank you very much for that call.  Well, we are going to continue talking about the use of animals in research: the benefits and the ethics and the possibilities of replacement. So stay with us. We will be right back after a short break.  (Soundbite of music)  PALCA: From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Joe Palca.  We are talking about animals in research and my guests this hour are Michael Conn, he's the associate director of the Oregon National Primate Research Center; Jonathan Wolff, a philosophy professor at the University College London; and William Stokes. Dr. Stokes is at the National Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods. It's a committee organized by the National Institutes of Health that helps look at using non-animal  alternatives in the lab.  And really, what I wanted to do is ask each of you gentlemen, as we wind up this segment, to speak to the question of, what's missing in the debate?  I mean, William Stokes, has there been an aspect of the animal research debate that hasn't gotten enough attention in your opinion? And maybe that there are alternatives but what's missing from the debate from your point of view?  Dr. STOKES: Well, I'm a veterinarian by training and I actually specialized in laboratory animal medicine. And I think it's really important, as Dr. Wolff pointed out, to - for the public to understand that animals are only used where they have to be used and that their use has to be justified; that they must be used in the most humane way possible; and that the number of animals used can only be that number that's necessary for scientific validity; and that animals in the laboratory get exceedingly good care; that they all have an attending veterinarian that's trained in laboratory animals.  I think the other thing that's missing is there's not much emphasis given to the progress that's being made in both research and in the area of testing. Where we are able to use non-animal methods and where those are having an impact on the animal research, we've made incredible advances in being able to grow different types of cells and organs within the body and culture. We've come up with improved computational approaches, including the new science of informatics where we can integrate very complex biological information. And I think it's important for the public to be aware of this progress that is being made and that's often not discussed.  PALCA: Okay. Jonathan Wolff, what about - what's missing here that should be given more emphasis, in your opinion?  Dr. WOLFF: Well, I agree with everything that's just been said and I think there's this tremendous lack of knowledge. And I would just say, talking(ph) very briefly, which is that I think a lot of people who give money for charity, medical charities, don't understand where that money goes. So if people who make a donation to a heart charity or cancer charity, they somehow think that the inputted money and the output will be a cure, without thinking that that money is paying for laboratory experiments, very often on animals. And I'm not saying this will change peoples' view but it does seem to me important that people know what is happening to the money that they provide.  PALCA: All right. Interesting point.  Finally, Dr. Michael Conn, go ahead with - what's missing? You've written a book trying to call peoples' attention to this what you call a silent war. What do you think is missing?  Dr. CONN: We are. We're trying to get it on the public agenda. We want people to know that animals are treated well in research and that a great deal of good comes from research. The question I would end with is, does the possibility of a child having a normal lifetime weigh less than the abstract principle that we cannot use animals in research?  PALCA: Well, we'll leave that one hanging in the air just as you've phrased it. Thank you very much, all three of you gentlemen for joining me today.  Dr. CONN: Thank you very much, Joe.  PALCA: That was\u2026  Dr. STOKES: Thanks, Joe.  PALCA: You're welcome.  Michael Conn - that was Michael Conn. He's the associate director of the Oregon National Primate Research Center. He's also the co-author of the forthcoming book, \"The Animal Research War\" from Palgrave Macmillan. We also spoke with Jonathan Wolff, a philosophy professor at University College London, who helped write a 2005 bioethics report on animal experimentation; and also William Stokes. He's the Director of the National Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods, a committee organized by the National Institutes of Health that helps look at using non-animal alternatives in the laboratory.

It's a profile of a man named Dr. Michael Lill, he's the head of the Bone Marrow Transplant Program at Cedar-Sinai Medical Center, and he developed this program specifically for Jehovah's Witnesses to receive bone marrow transplants without blood transfusions which would be against their religion. Patty Neighmond reported the story about Dr. Lill and here's a little bit of that story. Dr. MICHAEL LILL (Medical Director, Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Cedar-Sinai Medical Center): So this - so I'm mainly presenting patient Ruth Medina(ph), she's a 25-year-old female Jehovah's Witness here for autologous stem cell transplant for Jehovah's Witness protocol. PATRICIA NEIGHMOND: Ruth Medina is unusual because her religion forbids any medical treatment that uses blood or blood products. Ms. RUTH MEDINA (Patient): For me, it's the sanctity of blood or blood is the life of a person. NEIGHMOND: That means Medina will refuse a blood transfusion. But she's here for a bone marrow transplant to treat Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and transfusions are typically given to boost patient's strength and help them survive the transplant. Dr. LILL: How are you doing today? Ms. MEDINA: I feel good.  I'm just really tired, but I'm good.  NEIGHMOND: Ruth Medina is bald from recent chemotherapy but she sits upright in her bed looking strong and beautiful in her bluish gown. She says she's completely comfortable with her decision to say no to a blood transfusion even to save her life. Ms. MEDINA: We actually don't ever even sit around and cry about it, we're always so optimistic about it. We know that it's something that I can get over, I have a lot of strength. NEIGHMOND: Medina came to Cedars because Dr. Lill decided to buck the system and give Jehovah's Witness patients a chance against cancer by performing bone marrow transplants. Dr. LILL: Many of my colleagues think that I'm slightly crazy to be doing this and they're more than happy to refer their Jehovah's Witness patients to me. NEIGHMOND: Other doctors won't risk is because they worry patients might die without a transfusion. But when Dr. Lill examined the actual statistics he found most patients didn't really need them. He decided to conserve patients' blood and make the need for transfusion even less likely. Dr. LILL: What we do for a Jehovah's Witness patients is the blood tests go into pediatric tubes so we don't use as much blood, we don't draw the blood from the central line so we don't throw away that first tablespoon, we don't do as many blood tests. NEIGHMOND: Since the program began six years ago, Cedars has performed so-called bloodless transplants for 21 Jehovah's Witnesses. Dr. LILL: In my capacity as a healer, I am not a technician. We are supposed to be treating the whole human being and that involves an understanding of their spiritual aspects as well as the mechanical/technical aspects of deciding what dose of chemotherapy I give for what particular indication. NEIGHMOND: Lill's decision to treat these patients is motivated not only by respect for their beliefs but also by Lill's own philosophical commitment. Dr. LILL: I think amongst our most important set of core values in the United States are the philosophy that comes out of the Enlightenment, and a key part of that came out of so many people killing each other in such horrible ways for so many hundreds of years in the middle of Europe over religious issues. NEIGHMOND: So for Lill it simply comes down to this. Dr. LILL: Individuals get the right to make their own choices even if they're bad choices.

If it's successful it will be the longest non-stop sea voyage in history. Fifty-something Reid is an accomplished sailor, but 24-year-old Queens, New York, native - you're from Queens, right Soanya? Ms. SOANYA AHMAD (Attempted 1000-day World Sea Voyage): Yes, I am. STEWART: - had little to no experience. And from the sound of her first blog entry, she was really pretty excited. She wrote, when we woke up at 6:30 a. m. we saw the sun rise on a glass ocean and no land in sight. Right now we're about 40 miles offshore and the water is turning turquoise. I haven't gotten seasick yet, and I'm enjoying the ethereal beauty around me. Well, about 300 days later it was a different story. The blog entries began to tell tales of shredded sails and some serious sickness. Soanya left the boat about ten days ago and set foot on land for the first time - and was it 305 days? Ms. AHMAD: Yes, it was. STEWART: - in Australia. And she joins us now in the studio. It's amazing to think two weeks ago you were on a boat in the middle of nowhere. Ms. AHMAD: It is amazing. It's almost a dream. STEWART: Unbelievable. So first of all, how are you feeling? Have you been checked out by a doctor? What's going on with you physically? Ms. AHMAD: On the boat, I was experiencing seasickness on and off, especially towards the end of the voyage, when I got off. After I got off I was checked out by a doctor and given a clean bill of health. STEWART: He just said you were just seasick? Just nauseous, nothing. . . Ms. AHMAD: Nauseous, yeah. Nothing serious. STEWART: Although I've been seasick, it can be serious. Ms. AHMAD: Well, it was for a while. I was just laid out on the bunk in the watch, in the pilot house, and not being very useful. STEWART: Which is important to note that it's not just that you were sailing leisurely around the world, everyday - there's no time to be bored. Everyday you had chores to do and missions to accomplish just to survive on this boat. Ms. AHMAD: Yeah, it was quite a voyage of survival. Not in terms of struggling to get things, 'cause we brought everything we needed, but the sheer maintenance and sailing the boat and carrying out our routines just to make it to the next day took up all of our time. There wasn't very much time to get bored. STEWART: Obviously, you know, you were hopeful to complete this whole trip when you left, otherwise you probably wouldn't have gone. Now, Captain Stowe, he'd been planning it for years. He called it the Mars Ocean Odyssey - I want to explain this to people - because he believes the trip might prove instructive to space agencies considering sending people on long isolated missions. So his motives were clear. He'd been in this for years and years and years. But what made you, somebody who really had no maritime experience, decide, yeah, I'll spend two-and-a-half years at sea? Ms. AHMAD: It was almost more like three years. But, well, I always had an interest in the waterfront, but I never had an opportunity to really explore it, that interest, until my college years. And I was studying photography and I kind of used photography as an excuse to get down to the New York City waterfront and really start to explore and look at what's there and what the various possibilities were for myself to work on the waterfront. 'Cause I realized early on that maybe an office job was really just not for me. STEWART: That you had to experience this, really, if you were going to take pictures of it. Ms. AHMAD: Right. I got down on the piers; I saw various boats. I was hoping to get on the boats and look inside and see how it went. STEWART: Mm-hmm. Ms. AHMAD: So after I got my degree in photography, I then said, what else can I do on the waterfront? And I discovered this other program, also given through CUNY, that introduced students to the working New York City waterfront. And I thought, wow, this is just the thing I needed. And it was a very introductory program with basic classes such as basic navigation, marine electronics. . . STEWART: So you had a little bit - you finally got a little bit of experience. Ms. AHMAD: Yes, a little. STEWART: So I have to ask you though about one thing that is obvious is that you and Reid Stowe had a relationship. But on the boat, were you captain and crew, or were you able to maintain some sort of relationship while you were at sea for that long? Ms. AHMAD: Well, the first three years that we knew each other, it was purely, you know, I was visiting as a friend of the project. STEWART: Mm-hmm. Ms. AHMAD: And he always was doing something and never really had time to sit and talk and chit-chat. But I was very fascinated by the whole 1000-day concept. STEWART: Right. Ms. AHMAD: And when I decided to go, and I told him I'd like to go with you, then he started looking at me kind of differently, as someone that would be in confinement, in a way, for an extended period of time. And then - so he had to get to know me - and, by first, as well. STEWART: Sure. Ms. AHMAD: And so our relationship kind of took off from there. STEWART: Do you still keep in - we're running out of time, unfortunately. Do you still keep in contact with him now that you're off the boat? Ms. AHMAD: Ah, yes I do. We're in contact via e-mail. STEWART: Are you happy to be home? Ms. AHMAD: I have mixed feelings about it. STEWART: Sure. Especially after you decided to devote yourself to something like that for so long. Ms. AHMAD: Yeah. STEWART: Well, we're so glad that you're well. And that you. . . Ms. AHMAD: Well, thank you. STEWART: You look well. And I appreciate you taking the time to come in and answer all these questions. Ms. AHMAD: Yeah, thank you for having me. STEWART: Sure, of course. Soanya Ahmad, thanks so much, good luck with your next endeavor.

It's produced by WNYC here in New York and by esteemed science correspondent Robert Krulwich and producer Jad Abumrad. And the sorry is all about liars. ROBERT KRULWICH: There are people who lie, and lie, and lie. JAD ABUMRAD: Right. Ms. YALING YANG (Researcher, University of Southern California): Yeah. ABUMRAD: Exactly. Ms. YANG: They just can't help it. They feel this impulse that they cannot control. ABUMRAD: Yeah. The lie just tumbles out before can stop. KRULWICH: And that is, who? ABUMRAD: Oh, that's Yaling Yang. She's a researcher in the University of Southern California. Ms. YANG: In the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience. ABUMRAD: Now, Robert, here's what Yaling did. She gathered together a group of subject. Put then through a series of interviews, series of test, and was able to identify a subset that seemed to lie more often, more persistently than average. KRULWICH: Okay. ABUMRAD: And so she wondered, is it just their personalities, their upbringing, or might there be something in their heads, in their brains, that could explain this lying? Ms. YANG: basically, what took people in the - in my scanner and then we scan their brains. ABUMRAD: She scanned all her subjects, the liars and the non-liars - no one knew which group their in. And she was looking at a particular part of their brain called\u2026 Ms. YANG: The prefrontal cortex. This is the part of the brain that passes the information\u2026 ABUMRAD: This is where the real thinking happens. Ms. YANG: \u2026making decisions and moral judgment for example. ABUMRAD: Now if you zoom in to that place just behind your forehead, you will see - are two kinds of brain tissue. You've got gray matter and then you've white matter. KRULWICH: I've heard of gray matter. ABUMRAD: Yes. Well, we think of the brain as being gray but actually its two things, its gray and white. The gray stuff, kind of think of it as like the computer processor part. KRULWICH: Yeah. ABUMRAD: It's these little clumps of neurons that process information. Like computer chips. That's the gray, where as the white\u2026 Ms. YANG: The white matter is like the connections between all these computer. ABUMRAD: The white matter in other words is what moves the thoughts around. KRULWICH: Gray is where the thinking happens and then white is when you move the thought from here to there. ABUMRAD: Exactly. Ms. YANG: Yes. They transfer information from one end to the other. ABUMRAD: Okay. So you've got your gray, you've got your white, what Yaling though she would see when she looked into the brains of people who lie a lot\u2026 Ms. YANG: I thought we would see a reduction. ABUMRAD: Just piece of it not there. Ms. YANG: Yeah. They're missing something. ABUMRAD: Specifically, she though she would find less gray stuff. Less of the thinking stuff. KRULWICH: Why would it - why would - why? ABUMRAD: Because that's what she seen in other mental disorders that are kind of like this. And if you think about it in a really simplistic level, the gray is where you think the thoughts and it's also among other where you crunch your moral calculations. And liars, she figured, have trouble in this department. Assumes maybe they have less gray. That was her notion. KRULWICH: Okay. ABUMRAD: But, when she got the pictures back, what she saw was\u2026 Ms. YANG: Such a great increase. ABUMRAD: More - and not the gray. Ms. YANG: More white matter. ABUMRAD: More white stuff. A lot more. Ms. YANG: Twenty-five percent. It's like a quarter. ABUMRAD: So they have 25 percent more connections in their head than non-liars? Ms. YANG: Yes. ABUMRAD: Before we get to what that means, what were you thinking when you saw this? Ms. YANG: I thought this was something. ABUMRAD: Something. Ms. YANG: Something. ABUMRAD: Something. Here's her idea so far, ready? KRULWICH: Yes. ABUMRAD: She thinks that these extra connections play a crucial role in a kind of in the moment story telling. That's essentially what lying is, coming up with a story on the fly. Let me give you an example, okay? KRULWICH: Mm-hmm. ABUMRAD: You're leaving work. You're walking down the hall, you don't yield. And an annoying but nice co-worker corners you. KRULWICH: Oh, hey, Sally(ph). ABUMRAD: Corners you in the elevator. Unidentified Woman: (As Sally) Hey. ABUMRAD: Asks you out. KRULWICH: You know, I've been meaning to ask, you maybe want to go out with me on Friday? (Soundbite of train) ABUMRAD: There you are. Questions dangling in the air. Unidentified Man: You maybe want to go out with me on Friday? ABUMRAD: For most of us, right in that moment inside our head in our brains, we're thinking\u2026 Unidentified Woman: (As Sally) Crap. Oh, shoot. ABUMRAD: Say you're busy. Say you're busy. Say you're busy. SALLY: (unintelligible) but with what? What? ABUMRAD: What are you busy with? Think of something. Think, think. SALLY: This thing. ABUMRAD: You're just reeking out into the voyage, trying to form a connection with some ideas that can help you come up with some excuse. SALLY: I could say\u2026 ABUMRAD: You know, I could say - ah, what? What? What? SALLY: Think of anything. ABUMRAD: And really, what you need to do at this moment is just take a bunch of desperate thought on different sides of your brain, like, me tonight. Teeth, dentist, and connect them all together. Unidentified Woman: (As Sally) I'm having some late night dental work. ABUMRAD: Like that. KRULWICH: Oh, okay. ABUMRAD: We can all do it given enough time. But for these people who lie a lot, she thinks that because they have so many more of these connections to begin with, they get there faster. Unidentified Woman: (As Sally) My mom is visiting that night. I'm meeting a friend for sushi. I am performing in a circus. Friday night book club. Ice hockey practice. Yoga. I have to polish my silver. I've got chemo. Ms. YANG: They've got more connections\u2026 Unidentified Woman: (As Sally) Sorry, bee keeping. Ms. YANG: \u2026the faster the speed of the processing can jump from one idea to another and you can come up with more random stories. ABUMRAD: She thinks that in the brains than most of us. We have trouble making those connections. We have - would you have trouble if I said to you like, come on, come and go out with me on Friday night. Would you not be able to come up with a wowzer(ph)? KRULWICH: I would say, yeah. They - I have to count straws. See, Thursday night is straw counting, we always - we have about 316 straws so far. And I'm only doing one with the little red circles on them. So that Thursday night. Sorry. (Soundbite of laughter) KRULWICH: I don't where everything comes. It just happens. I just\u2026 ABUMRAD: There you go. See? You've got extra white matter perhaps. KRULWICH: So she's saying this is a cause of lying of an effect of lying? ABUMRAD: Well, she's not sure. And this is a big debate. KRULWICH: Hmm. ABUMRAD: What she can say is that children, as they grow\u2026 Ms. YANG: Yeah, from age two to age 10, there's a big jump in their white matter. (Soundbite of music) Ms. YANG: And that's actually the same age that they develop the skill to lie. (Soundbite of baby) ABUMRAD: Yaling has a good reason to be thinking about how brains develop because she's a new mom. Is this your first kid? Ms. YANG: Yes. It's my first one. ABUMRAD: Bo or girl? Ms. YANG: A girl. ABUMRAD: Doesn't it make you wonder a little bit about what's gong on inside her head? Ms. YANG: oh, yes. I wonder about that all the time. It's still too early to scan her brain but eventually I will do it. ABUMRAD: Are you serious? Ms. YANG: Yes. ABUMRAD: This is a moral to this. Never, if you're a little baby, have a social psychiatrist as a mother.  ALISON STEWART, host:  Do you want to go, Matt, or do you want me to go?  MATT MARTINEZ: I'll go. I'll go. I'll go.  STEWART: Okay.  MARTINEZ: I have one of the most e-mailed stories at npr. org right now. It is from NPR's Radio Lab. It's produced by WNYC here in New York and by esteemed science correspondent Robert Krulwich and producer Jad Abumrad. And the sorry is all about liars.  ROBERT KRULWICH: There are people who lie, and lie, and lie.  JAD ABUMRAD: Right.  Ms. YALING YANG (Researcher, University of Southern California): Yeah.  ABUMRAD: Exactly.  Ms. YANG: They just can't help it. They feel this impulse that they cannot control.  ABUMRAD: Yeah. The lie just tumbles out before can stop.  KRULWICH: And that is, who?  ABUMRAD: Oh, that's Yaling Yang. She's a researcher in the University of Southern California.  Ms. YANG: In the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience.  ABUMRAD: Now, Robert, here's what Yaling did. She gathered together a group of subject. Put then through a series of interviews, series of test, and was able to identify a subset that seemed to lie more often, more persistently than average.  KRULWICH: Okay.  ABUMRAD: And so she wondered, is it just their personalities, their upbringing, or might there be something in their heads, in their brains, that could explain this lying?  Ms. YANG: basically, what took people in the - in my scanner and then we scan their brains.  ABUMRAD: She scanned all her subjects, the liars and the non-liars - no one knew which group their in. And she was looking at a particular part of their brain called\u2026  Ms. YANG: The prefrontal cortex.

BRAND: Our regular medical expert is here with more. Dr. Sydney Spiesel is a Yale University faculty member, also a practicing pediatrician and a regular here on our show. Hi, Syd.  Dr. SYDNEY SPIESEL (Yale Medical School): Hi, Madeleine. BRAND: So it's been known for some time that there is an association between breast cancer and nightshift work, right? Dr. SPIESEL: Yes. Absolutely. There are a number of studies that have supported that. The biggest one was a study of nurses. And the ones who spent a lot of time on nightshift were at greater risk for breast cancer for sure, compared to the ones who mostly spent their time on dayshift. BRAND: So now here comes this new study, I believe it's out of Israel, where scientists show that women who are exposed to a lot of nighttime lights have higher rates of breast cancer. Dr. SPIESEL: Yeah. They took aerial maps of - at night of Israel that showed where - what areas had high light density, which are mostly cities, as you'd expect, and what parts of Israel were kind of dark at night. They compared that with maps of areas that had high frequency of breast cancer in women and areas that had low frequency.  And sure enough, the two maps just lined up beautifully. The places where there was a lot of nighttime light, and presumably that means a lot of nighttime life, activity, showed greater rates of breast cancer than the darker places. BRAND: And I suppose they excluded other factors, right? They controlled for other factors? Dr. SPIESEL: Well, yes. They did to the best they could. There are a lot of other factors that one might imagine. It's not just - the difference between city and country is not just light. It's also stress. It's ethnicity. It's birth rate. It's average income. And they tried - they did as best they could to use statistical methods to filter out those confounding variables.  BRAND: So what could be the possible explanation for this? Dr. SPIESEL: It may be related to a hormone called melatonin. Melatonin is produced by a gland deep in the brain. It's produced when we are in relative darkness. And it's released at much lower levels when we're in light. So at night people's melatonin levels tend to be high, except if you're in setting where there's a lot of bright light around you. BRAND: We have associated melatonin with sleep, right? I mean, this gives you a good night's sleep is the production of melatonin? Dr. SPIESEL: Well, the melatonin probably doesn't directly cause sleep, but it may regulate other things that help us sleep, and so melatonin is often used by doctors to reset people's day/night clocks, for example. There's an interesting detail, which again adds evidence to this whole thing. Women who are completely blind, who don't perceive light at all, have generally high circulating levels of melatonin day and night. And it doesn't actually affect their sleep very much, but it's interesting in that these women have much lower rates of breast cancer than sighted women. BRAND: And Syd, this study, did it address all cancers or just breast cancer? Dr. SPIESEL: They compared breast cancer rates with nighttime illumination with lung cancer rates. And they found that the lung cancer rates were completely unrelated to the level of local illumination at night. Whereas the breast cancer rates were very directly related.  Now, none of this proves anything. You have to always keep in mind that we're seeing an association. These studies just show association. It can't demonstrate causation, but they give you something to think about. BRAND: That's Dr. Sydney Spiesel. He's a Yale Medical School professor.

No one is proving that baking soda and vinegar makes a volcano. RACHEL MARTIN, host:  We were so smart back then. STEWART: I was very proud of that. There were no mice running through mazes here. To name a few of the finalist projects, \"A geometric analysis of the number of lattice points inside polygons on nine sides,\" \"Proof that Einstein's General Relativity Theory could in principal modify rotational curves in the absence of dark matter. \" MARTIN: Well, in principle, it could. STEWART: :A new way to improve the efficacy of antibiotics against multi-drug resistant bacteria. : Now we picked those three because those had words we could pronounce. The science talent search goes back 66 years. It used to be the Westinghouse Science Search. Now in that time, six of the contest finalists have won Nobel Prizes. Two have won Fields Medals. Two have won McArthur Genius Grants. And this year, out of 1,600 contestants nationwide and 14 finalists, the winner is. . . (Soundbite of drum roll) STEWART: That's our drum roll for you. Shivani Sud, 17 years old, she won, or I should say, she earned, 100,000 dollar scholarship from the Intel Foundation, and Shivani is on the line to tell us about her project. First of all, congratulations. MARTIN: Congrats. Ms. SHIVANI SUD (Winner, Intel Science Talent Search 2008): Thank you so much. STEWART: You must be so excited. Ms. SUD: I most definitely am. STEWART: Can you describe that feeling in your heart of hearts as they were reading off the name of the big winner? Ms. SUD: Well, it was kind of an intense moment. As they counted down, I just kind of told myself it's OK. You came here. You did your best. You met a lot of great people. It's OK you didn't win anything. So I was really shocked when they said my name. MARTIN: That's awesome. STEWART: That's amazing. Your family must be so proud. Ms. SUD: Definitely. STEWART: Now your project is not only scientifically significant, it's also personally significant for you. Tell us a little about your project and the genesis of it. Ms. SUD: So, essentially my project focuses on early-stage colon cancer. Right now in the clinic, when we look at stage two colon cancer, about 40 to 50 percent of patients relapse, they develop cancer a second time. So what I wanted to see if I could go down to the genetics and use a genetic predictor to figure out who's most likely to relapse, and furthermore, if there's certain drugs I can use to reverse that signature of malignancy to prevent that relapse. So shifting the conversation from after-the-fact chemotherapy to proactive chemo-prevention. STEWART: Now did you - you knew someone in your life who had cancer? Ms. SUD: I did. I have an immediate family member who had a benign brain tumor. STEWART: And what impact did that make on you? Ms. SUD: Well, that's when I was six years old and it definitely made an emotional imprint on me. I was very fortunate. I got to keep my family member. The doctors did a great job, but you know that there are millions of families that don't have that chance, and I know that definitely helped me to start live out my dreams, and I'd like to return that to someone else. STEWART: Now have you always been interested in genetics? Ms. SUD: Well, I've always had an interest in cancer. It's a funny story, because I started off doing my research at Temple University, and then I spent the summer with Dr. Tsokos at the NIH. And every place I go I either listen to a talk in the lab or I read a paper, so initially I didn't even know you could do this kind of stuff with genetics. And then when I read it, I thought, wow, this is really cool. Let me go try this. So, I mean, it's interesting because you learn new things. STEWART: I'm wondering how you were first received when you're younger. I mean, you're 17 now. And you're at Temple, or you decide you're going to work at Duke University, where you did a little bit of your research. You walk into the research lab and you say hi, I'm here, I'm 15 and I'm going to do cancer research. Ms. SUD: Well, you definitely have to get in touch with them beforehand. I got in touch with the mentor that I had at Temple beforehand. The one at NIH, I applied there. And then I sent some of the research I had done down to the lab at Duke. It's definitely hard. When I'm in the lab, I don't like to be babied as someone who doesn't really know what they're doing. I really like to go out and show that I am capable, and that I do have the skills required for scientific inquiries. So you definitely have to prove yourself. But I have to say every environment has been very supportive. STEWART: Was it ever difficult to deal with - you picked a branch of science that deals with life and death. Ms. SUD: Mm hum. STEWART: Not just abstracts. Did you let yourself go there when you were thinking about your project? Ms. SUD: Well, it's something that always strikes you when you're sitting there late at night, working in the cell culture 'hood, you definitely wonder what you're doing there. And you go back to that image of you with your family member or others. And it just motivates you even more. And when you're at science fairs, like here when we were putting our projects on display, or at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair, you have a lot of people who come by your project and say I have a family member who has cancer or I have this cancer, will this help me?  And you know, sometimes it's very difficult because you know that your research has a little while to go before it can actually be implemented in the clinic. But overall, it just motivates you even more because you put a face to your research. It's not just about this cell that you see under a microscope, it's about the potential that your work has to help someone else. And that's really what makes it worth it. STEWART: Shivani, are you interested in a career in oncology, being \"Dr. Sud? \" Ms. SUD: I'm most definitely interested in medical research, so right now I'm looking at the M. D. -Ph. D. track and trying to kind of figure out where I want to go next year. MARTIN: One of those isn't enough. You need a M. D. -Ph. D. (Soundbite of laughter) STEWART: So I don't want to make an assumption. Are you going to go to college next year? Ms. SUD: I most definitely will be going to college next year. STEWART: What are you thinking about? Where you thinking? Ms. SUD: I'm not really sure. I've gotten into all my schools so far. I've got two left to hear back from. So I guess. . . MARTIN: Something tells me they're going to let you in. Lucky guess. Ms. SUD: It's kind of nice, because you sit there, and you wait and you pray that they'll pick you and now you get to pick one of them. So a little bit of revenge time. STEWART: And on the short-term, how are you going to celebrate? Ms. SUD: How am I going to celebrate? Well, we had a pretty nice celebration last night. We had a student party back here. I really can't wait to get back home and tell my grandmother. I know she'll be very proud and after that, I've got homework to catch up on. (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: Oh, my gosh. STEWART: Well, Shivani Sud, we congratulate you once again on winning the Intel Science Talent Search. Really appreciate you taking the time after what must have been a very exciting 24 hours. And we wish you all the best. Ms. SUD: Thanks. MARTIN: It makes me feel more secure about the future with people like you at the helm. Ms. SUD: Thank you so much for having me. I really appreciate it. MARTIN: Take care. Hey, that does it for this hour of the Bryant Park Project, directed by Jacob Ganz, edited by Trish McKinney, produced by Matt Martinez, executive E. P. , Sharon Hoffman. I'm Rachel Martin. STEWART: I'm Alison Stewart. MARTIN: It's time for breakfast! STEWART: I'm out of here. We're always online at npr. org/bryantpark. This is the Bryant Park Project from NPR News. I'm getting a bagel.  ALISON STEWART, host:   The Intel Science Talent Search is not the science fair you were in as a kid. No one is proving that baking soda and vinegar makes a volcano.  RACHEL MARTIN, host:   We were so smart back then.  STEWART: I was very proud of that. There were no mice running through mazes here. To name a few of the finalist projects, \"A geometric analysis of the number of lattice points inside polygons on nine sides,\" \"Proof that Einstein's General Relativity Theory could in principal modify rotational curves in the absence of dark matter. \"  MARTIN: Well, in principle, it could.  STEWART: :A new way to improve the efficacy of antibiotics against multi-drug resistant bacteria. : Now we picked those three because those had words we could pronounce. The science talent search goes back 66 years. It used to be the Westinghouse Science Search. Now in that time, six of the contest finalists have won Nobel Prizes. Two have won Fields Medals. Two have won McArthur Genius Grants. And this year, out of 1,600 contestants nationwide and 14 finalists, the winner is. . .  (Soundbite of drum roll)  STEWART: That's our drum roll for you. Shivani Sud, 17 years old, she won, or I should say, she earned, 100,000 dollar scholarship from the Intel Foundation, and Shivani is on the line to tell us about her project. First of all, congratulations.  MARTIN: Congrats.  Ms. SHIVANI SUD (Winner, Intel Science Talent Search 2008): Thank you so much.  STEWART: You must be so excited.  Ms. SUD: I most definitely am.  STEWART: Can you describe that feeling in your heart of hearts as they were reading off the name of the big winner?  Ms. SUD: Well, it was kind of an intense moment. As they counted down, I just kind of told myself it's OK. You came here. You did your best. You met a lot of great people. It's OK you didn't win anything. So I was really shocked when they said my name.  MARTIN: That's awesome.  STEWART: That's amazing. Your family must be so proud.  Ms. SUD: Definitely.  STEWART: Now your project is not only scientifically significant, it's also personally significant for you. Tell us a little about your project and the genesis of it.  Ms. SUD: So, essentially my project focuses on early-stage colon cancer. Right now in the clinic, when we look at stage two colon cancer, about 40 to 50 percent of patients relapse, they develop cancer a second time. So what I wanted to see if I could go down to the genetics and use a genetic predictor to figure out who's most likely to relapse, and furthermore, if there's certain drugs I can use to reverse that signature of malignancy to prevent that relapse. So shifting the conversation from after-the-fact chemotherapy to proactive chemo-prevention.  STEWART: Now did you - you knew someone in your life who had cancer?  Ms. SUD: I did. I have an immediate family member who had a benign brain tumor.  STEWART: And what impact did that make on you?  Ms. SUD: Well, that's when I was six years old and it definitely made an emotional imprint on me. I was very fortunate. I got to keep my family member. The doctors did a great job, but you know that there are millions of families that don't have that chance, and I know that definitely helped me to start live out my dreams, and I'd like to return that to someone else.  STEWART: Now have you always been interested in genetics?  Ms. SUD: Well, I've always had an interest in cancer. It's a funny story, because I started off doing my research at Temple University, and then I spent the summer with Dr. Tsokos at the NIH. And every place I go I either listen to a talk in the lab or I read a paper, so initially I didn't even know you could do this kind of stuff with genetics. And then when I read it, I thought, wow, this is really cool. Let me go try this. So, I mean, it's interesting because you learn new things.  STEWART: I'm wondering how you were first received when you're younger. I mean, you're 17 now. And you're at Temple, or you decide you're going to work at Duke University, where you did a little bit of your research. You walk into the research lab and you say hi, I'm here, I'm 15 and I'm going to do cancer research.  Ms. SUD: Well, you definitely have to get in touch with them beforehand. I got in touch with the mentor that I had at Temple beforehand. The one at NIH, I applied there. And then I sent some of the research I had done down to the lab at Duke. It's definitely hard. When I'm in the lab, I don't like to be babied as someone who doesn't really know what they're doing. I really like to go out and show that I am capable, and that I do have the skills required for scientific inquiries. So you definitely have to prove yourself. But I have to say every environment has been very supportive.  STEWART: Was it ever difficult to deal with - you picked a branch of science that deals with life and death.  Ms. SUD: Mm hum.  STEWART: Not just abstracts. Did you let yourself go there when you were thinking about your project?  Ms. SUD: Well, it's something that always strikes you when you're sitting there late at night, working in the cell culture 'hood, you definitely wonder what you're doing there. And you go back to that image of you with your family member or others. And it just motivates you even more. And when you're at science fairs, like here when we were putting our projects on display, or at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair, you have a lot of people who come by your project and say I have a family member who has cancer or I have this cancer, will this help me?   And you know, sometimes it's very difficult because you know that your research has a little while to go before it can actually be implemented in the clinic. But overall, it just motivates you even more because you put a face to your research. It's not just about this cell that you see under a microscope, it's about the potential that your work has to help someone else. And that's really what makes it worth it.  STEWART: Shivani, are you interested in a career in oncology, being \"Dr. Sud? \"  Ms. SUD: I'm most definitely interested in medical research, so right now I'm looking at the M. D. -Ph.

There's even wireless medical devices implanted in people. They make it easy to monitor patients. But a new study warns they may be easy to hack. From member station WFCR in Amherst, Massachusetts, Tina Antolini reports. TINA ANTOLINI: One of the most common wireless medical devices in use today is an implantable cardiac defibrillator, or ICD. It's about the size of a pager and can use an electric shock to steady a heart with an irregular beat. ICDs can also hold personal information, like birthdates and medical records. And it was just that kind of information that a team of computer scientists was able to steal from an ICD during a recent experiment. Kevin Fu, a computer scientist at the University of Massachusetts, helped build the device that intercepted the signals. Professor KEVIN FU (University of Massachusetts Amherst): If the patient is with the doctor and we have our device nearby, we can listen to that communication and sort of hear what is going on between the device and the monitoring system. ANTOLINI: What's more, researchers found they could actually reprogram the ICD without the patient knowing, and even instruct it to deliver a harmful shock. That raises some troubling scenarios, like an attack on Vice President Dick Cheney, who's among the hundreds of thousands of Americans who have an ICD. But the researchers emphasize there is no immediate threat to people already using an ICD or a similar device, like a pacemaker. Their attack wasn't easy to pull off, even in the laboratory. And nobody's ever reported an actual attack. Study co-author William Maisel is the director of the Medical Device Safety Institute at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. He says they just wanted to highlight some of the problems that could arise as more medical devices go wireless. Dr. WILLIAM MAISEL (Director, Medical Device Safety Institute): It's much like airport security officials who might try to pass a package through security. Just because they get a package through doesn't mean that their airplane flight is going to be any less safe. And in fact it probably will make it more safe in the future. ANTOLINI: Indeed, the researchers also suggest some ways companies could make their wireless devices more secure. One of those companies, Medtronic, made the defibrillator used in the study and says it is aware of potential security issues. But Rob Clark, Medtronic's senior director of public relations, says the industry has to make sure that security improvements don't make the devices less useful to patients or doctors. Mr. ROB CLARK (Medtronic): The primary focus of the manufacturer is to make sure that the device does what it's intended to do from a medical perspective, and then laying on as much security around that as possible, but not creating security or putting security in place that would in fact inhibit the device's capability and its ability to treat the patient. ANTOLINI: The Food and Drug Administration, which licenses medical devices, says it will be working to develop security recommendations so that a patient's information is as safe as their heartbeats.

We don't usually think of video war games as therapy, but researchers are finding way to use - finding way, how do you like that? We'll just start over: three, two, one. I'm Farai Chideya, and this is NEWS AND NOTES. We don't usually think of video war games as therapy, but researchers are finding ways to use virtual reality to help soldiers deal with what they've experienced in combat. Skip Rizzo is a clinical psychologist and a research scientist at the Institute for Creative Technologies at University of Southern California. He's helped to develop a PTSD therapy he calls Virtual Iraq. Hi, Skip. Dr. SKIP RIZZO (Clinical Psychologist, Research Scientist, Institute for Creative Technologies, University of Southern California): Thanks for having me. CHIDEYA: So the idea of a virtual universe is to simulate reality for the viewer. And, in this case, does that mean really simulating war? Dr. RIZZO: In order to treat PTSD effectively, we often rely on what's called exposure therapy, and that is to get people to revisit the trauma and to emotionally process those memories and the negative things that happened to them. As long as you avoid re-processing these memories or re-experiencing them in a therapeutic fashion, they're going to continue to haunt you. So that is why we go to the trouble and expense to create a virtual Iraq environment in which the person can ever so gradually re-experience what they went through in Iraq, but in a safe, supportive environment in the clinician's office. So, yes, we do replicate war, but not, of course, to the level of intensity, and certainly not at a level that is too much for a patient to handle. CHIDEYA: Who, exactly, are the patients that you're dealing with? Dr. RIZZO: We have a number of sites, but our primary research site is down in San Diego at the Naval Medical Hospital. This is a project that was funded by the Office of Naval Research. So we have active-duty naval and Marine personnel that are going through the treatment there. But across the nation, we've got about 20 sites that work with people in the Army and Air Force, National Guard, Reservists and so forth. CHIDEYA: So take me through an experience. If I were a patient and I sat down and put on these goggles that I've seen in newspaper accounts of what you're working on, what would I see? What would you tell me? What would you do if I panicked? Dr. RIZZO: Right, right. Well, one thing to keep in mind is when you're in a virtual-reality environment, wearing a virtual reality head-mounted display, as you move your head around, the computer updates the graphics so that you get the sense of being immersed within whatever environment is modeled. So we put a pair of headsets on a person, and they're also sitting on a base-shaker platform, so they actually can feel vibration. We also have a smell machine that pumps smells into the space that are relevant for what the person is going to experience. And, of course, we have good sound. So when you're in the environment, you get the illusion that you're either going down a desert road through Iraq or you're walking through a desert city, through a marketplace, through ramshackle buildings and so forth, but we can systematically begin to ramp up the provocative nature of the environment. So we can click a button, and a gunshot in the distance is heard or a gunshot right next to your head is heard, or an IED can be exploded, or an insurgent can come out from behind some palm trees, or the Humvee that's in front of you can blow up. So\u2026 CHIDEYA: Well, Skip, let me ask you this. I mean, how do you decide who is eligible for treatment and who's responding? And have you ever had bad responses? I can imagine that you might. Dr. RIZZO: Well no, we actually - so far in our research, we haven't had any situations where somebody yanks off the headset and runs out of the room. That never has happened. And I think that's more of a tribute to the therapists that are working in this area, and not necessarily to the technology. A good therapist is monitoring the patient very closely, watching their heart rate, their skin conductance, their respiration. We record all of these physiological measures of stress, as well as they're in full audio contact with the patient. Dr. RIZZO: The idea here is that you put a person in the environment at a level that they can handle with only a little bit of anxiety, and that eventually, that anxiety distinguishes or habituates, i. e. , the person gets used to the environment, and then they're able to take on a little bit more. CHIDEYA: You just had your first round of patients complete a full course of therapy, which I understand is 10 to 12 sessions, roughly. What were some of the results that you got from those patients? Dr. RIZZO: Well, thus far, we're really encouraged with what we've seen. We've had 14 people go through the complete treatment, and of that number, 11 no longer meet the criteria for PTSD. And I don't want to, you know, over - go beyond that data, but I think that's rather encouraging, considering that these were active-duty participants that had just gotten back, had tried other forms of treatment without any success. So, you know, we're feeling that we're on the right track, but we still have quite a bit more work to do in order to, you know, really validate that this is a successful treatment. But one thing to keep in mind is that the VR is a tool to deliver exposure therapy. And thus far, exposure therapy has been supported as the best-validated treatment procedure for PTSD of all forms of treatment. This was documented by the National Academy of Science last fall and in other sources, as well. So what we're doing is we're able to do this exposure therapy, but in a much more controlled and a much more provocative fashion. So I think we're resting on good ground, that we're operating from good theoretical principles and accepted treatment practices. CHIDEYA: Skip, thanks so much. Dr. RIZZO: All right, well, thank you.

Thirty years ago, you had to wait until the 5th of April for cherry blossoms. While spring began yesterday, March 20th, scientists say we are seeing the signs of spring earlier and earlier, an average of eight hours earlier every year. Kirsten de Beurs is one of the scientists studying this phenomenon. She's an assistant professor of geography at Virginia Tech. She describes for us two satellite images, one from 1982 and one from 2006 that showed us how things are changing. Dr. KIRSTEN DE BEURS (Assistant Professor, Geography, Virginia Tech): What you start to see is that the greener areas are the areas where start of season is earliest in the map, if you just look at 1982. And then, the light green, it's a little bit later, and then yellow, it's even later, and then red is very late. ADAMS: So, we are very clearly looking at a great deal more dark green on the 2006 map than the 1982 map? Dr. DE BEURS: Yes. If you compare 1982 with 2006, you will see that there's more dark green in 2006. And the green is standing further north, and then there's less red all the way in the north. ADAMS: I thought, when I thought about this, I heard about this, I thought it would be spring moving from south to north. But this pretty much means spring happening all over the country eight hours earlier, wherever it may be. Dr. DE BEURS: More or less, yes. ADAMS: Are you gathering this information only by satellites? And how - what can the satellite actually see? Dr. DE BEURS: What the satellite sees is reflectance variance. For example, this satellite sees red and near-red reflectance. And that's just a measure of how much vegetation is on the ground basically. And so\u2026 ADAMS: Yeah, you know, I understood\u2026 Dr. DE BEURS: Yes. ADAMS: \u2026very little of what you said. But I get the idea that if something is growing, and the satellite can see it. Dr. DE BEURS: Yes. We have images every day and saw changes every day, and we can see that over time. ADAMS: And are you getting information data from any other sources, from people who live in these places and can tell you\u2026 Dr. DE BEURS: Definitely. ADAMS: \u2026what's blooming? Dr. DE BEURS: Yeah, yes, definitely. So, this, of course, looking at the satellites is just one side of the story. I mean, it's the ground validation that really makes it. What we see from the satellite can be a little bit different from what we actually see on the ground. Right now, big area study is doing the ground validation, working with people on the ground. There's a Project BudBurst where you can go on the Web site, and actually fill in your own information from your own yard, if you want to. There's a lot of different citizen scientist that help us gather information. And, of course, the main thing right now is to validate our satellite data and see if what we think we see is actually happening on the ground. ADAMS: What does it mean that spring is coming eight hours earlier every year? Dr. DE BEURS: Well, what happens is that we see the vegetation start to occur earlier. And you can imagine that if maybe the timing of the vegetation changes, the animals have to adjust their timing as well. And that's not always very easy for them to do. And so, what could happen is that you get a mismatch between vegetation timing and, for example, the timing that the animals might - that the birds migrate or the animals breed. And\u2026 ADAMS: But wouldn't they be adjusting? Dr. DE BEURS: They would, but it's not necessarily said that they can adjust at the same speed as the vegetation is changing right now. And so, I mean, if you, for example, think about birds and bird breeding, right, I mean, the time that the bird is laying its egg, and the time that it's breeding, there is a different timing of the year is when the vegetation occurs. So, when it gets warmer, for example, and the vegetation starts at - the timing of the vegetation changes, it's not necessarily said that those two processes behave at the same time and at the same speed, and change at the same speed. ADAMS: Well, should we be alarmed that spring is occurring eight hours earlier every year? Is this part of climate change, do you think? Dr. DE BEURS: It's - it looks like that. I'm not sure if we should be alarmed by it. But it's something, certainly something that we have to kind of keep our eye on and try to understand what is happening and why it's happening. ADAMS: That's Kirsten de Beurs, she teaches geography at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg.  NOAH ADAMS, host:  Here in Washington, the famed cherry trees are said to reach their peak at the end of this month. Thirty years ago, you had to wait until the 5th of April for cherry blossoms. While spring began yesterday, March 20th, scientists say we are seeing the signs of spring earlier and earlier, an average of eight hours earlier every year. Kirsten de Beurs is one of the scientists studying this phenomenon. She's an assistant professor of geography at Virginia Tech. She describes for us two satellite images, one from 1982 and one from 2006 that showed us how things are changing.  Dr. KIRSTEN DE BEURS (Assistant Professor, Geography, Virginia Tech): What you start to see is that the greener areas are the areas where start of season is earliest in the map, if you just look at 1982.

In a few minutes. . . (Soundbite of music) COHEN: A singer from Israel who's made her name in America with a song from a TV ad. I'm Alex Cohen. ALEX CHADWICK, host: I'm Alex Chadwick. First, sometime yesterday I was discussing politics with an editor here at DAY TO DAY when our attention was drawn to the CNN television news screen with a story that transcends politics and just about everything else. It was about an odd death in Florida. A large spotted eagle ray, it looks like a giant stingray, jumped into a moving boat off the Florida Keys and killed a woman on deck. To learn more about how this could happen, we're joined by fish ecologist Tracey Sutton. He's an adjunct professor at Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute at Florida Atlantic University.  Tracey, how common is it for a giant ray to leap out of the water and hit a human being hard enough to kill that person? Professor TRACEY SUTTON (Florida Atlantic University): It's very rare. I only know of one other case where this has happened. It's not unusual for them to jump - that's kind of a normal thing, especially in the springtime. But I guess as we get more and more people on the water, more and more encounters like this are going to happen. CHADWICK: That's not the answer I was expecting it to be. I thought you were going to say this was unique, but you actually do know of another case where this has happened? Prof. SUTTON: Yeah, it happened, I think, in 2005 maybe, or 2006. Another guy was hit by a stingray in South Florida, and in this case the man was actually stuck in the chest by the barb of the ray, but he survived. So he's nearly rehabilitated, I understand. CHADWICK: How big do these rays get? This is - again, this is a spotted eagle ray. That's not a true stingray, is it? Prof. SUTTON: No, it's in a different family. The stingray family are normally benthic rays that sit on the bottom. They're the ones you might step on if you're wading. CHADWICK: Right. Prof. SUTTON: The eagle ray is in a flying ray family. They normally are up in the water column, actively swimming, and they can be enormous. This was actually a small ray. They can get much larger, hundreds of pounds. CHADWICK: This was a small one? But this - didn't this weigh what, 75 pounds or something? Prof. SUTTON: Yup, yup, but still, yeah, that's a fairly small animal. It's probably not even quite mature, just getting sexually mature. They get much larger than that one. CHADWICK: And do the ones that are hundreds of - do those jump in the air too? Prof. SUTTON: Sure, sure. Occasionally you can hear a big clap sound from a mile away, knowing that it was probably a big ray that was jumping somewhere. CHADWICK: Why are these things jumping out of the water and endangering innocent boaters? Prof. SUTTON: Right, well, they jump out the water - theoretically they - often they're covered with parasites, these types of little crustaceans, and some people think that they're jumping to rid themselves of these external parasites. I don't think it's because they're spooked by anything necessarily. They just - it's kind of their habit to jump and then slap down on the water as hard as they can. CHADWICK: They have - these rays, they're such amazing-looking creatures in the water because they look like they're almost flying through the water, don't they, in their graceful moments. When they leap in the air, do they sail at all? Prof. SUTTON: I don't think so. I think they'll spin a little bit, and they can jump out of the water quite, quite high. They normally will just spin around and then will land, usually flat, and that's why people think they're trying to rid themselves of parasites by stunning them. CHADWICK: How common are these rays, and is this the kind of thing that - are people calling you up to say what can I do to protect myself against a flying spotted eagle ray? Prof. SUTTON: No, no, they're seasonal. They migrate through different areas. So they'll often be in an area, say in the spring or in the fall as they migrate to the different places. They'll congregate for mating purposes, and sometimes there are resident eagle rays on certain reefs, and nobody - as far as I know, nobody's ever really been harmed by one in the water. They're kind of skittish or whatnot. So they're generally not considered dangerous in any way. So you could say that actually we're the ones endangering the rays because it's a normal thing for them to do it. It's not particularly normal for humans to be traveling in excess of 25 knots over the water.

I'm Madeleine Brand.  ALEX CHADWICK, host:  I'm Alex Chadwick.  Far more children are being diagnosed with autism today than 25 years ago, and no one knows exactly why. It could be better reporting? Or a real surge in the number of cases? Or some combination? BRAND:  One of those children is Gibson Brown. He was born nearly four months premature, and he endured a number of life-threatening complications.  CHADWICK: Gibson is three now. Independent produces Dan Collison and Beth Meister have been following his family for reports they call the \"Autism Chronicles. \" Today part one, Gibson's mother Katrina talks about her son's diagnoses and her reaction.  Ms. KATRINA BROWN (Mother of an Autistic Child):  He came home on oxygen, and he came home on a feeding pump and on numerous medications. And he was weaned off all that over time, and so we kind of let go of our worries and were thinking, OK, he is doing fine. But when his first birthday came around, and he wasn't pointing, and he wasn't saying mama, and he wasn't saying daddy, and he wasn't waving goodbye. And even though everyday I'd sing \"head, shoulders, knees, and toes\" he wasn't pointing to those things. Ms. BROWN: (Singing) Gibby, head, shoulders knees and - knees and. . . Ms. BROWN: I started to get really worried, but people would say to me, well, he was a premature baby, so adjust his age. He's not really one, yet. Or he's a boy, now, they're slower to speak. Oh, he is going to start speaking in sentences. You know I'd be reassured, even though, in my heart I was really uncomfortable, and I was really panicky. And I started to look up speech delays on the internet, and you get ten thousand things, and it all has to do with autism. My idea of an autistic child was \"Rain Man. \"  Mr. DUSTIN HOFFMAN (Actor, Rain Man):  (As Raymond Babbitt) I don't know. That's a driver. Mr. TOM CRUISE (Actor, Rain Man): (As Charlie Babbitt) That's good. Come on. Come on.  Ms. BROWN:  Didn't want to be held. Didn't want to be touched. Screamed and cried, kicked and screamed, you know, shook their hands, turned around in circles. That is what I thought, at first.  Mr. CRUISE: (As Charlie Babbitt) You and I are going to get on this plane.  . . TEXT: Mr. HOFFMAN: (As Raymond Babbitt): No.  (Soundbite of screaming) Mr. CRUISE: (As Charlie Babbitt) Whoa, whoa.  Ms. BROWN:  I would read through the list of warning signs, and I could say, well, he doesn't do this, but he does do this. And it was like three-fourths, no and one fourth, yes because he loved being held. He wasn't a temper-tantrum thrower. So I would just, kind of, talk myself out of it a little bit, and then I would talk with other people. I talked with the pediatrician and none of them really seemed to feel like that fit him. And so I was relieved. You want to do Pattycake?  Pattycake, Pattycake, bakersman.  I think for the longest time, we just kept thinking, well, the light is going to come on, and it's going to be OK and you know, everything else worked out, and we were hoping. But at the same time, I knew something was wrong. You could not attribute it to his adjusted age anymore.  And mark it with a - and mark it with a. . . Nobody gives you a handbook with that says, your child has autism, this is what you do.  I talked to my sister, who is a nurse, and she said, you know what, just have a neurologist look at him. He was a little over two and a half. And at the point that we had that appointment, we were seeing progress, so I really wasn't expecting anything except for them to say, he just needs more time. And we go in there, and this neurologist comes right at him with these toys that he wasn't interested in. He would not even look at this doctor at all. Even things that he could do, he didn't even do it. And I remember this doctor saying, well, more than likely he is mentally retarded, and you'll just have to change your expectations and just shattered my heart. And so I'm in this office with tears down my face and just feeling like I want to crawl in a hole and just not ever come out and take my child with me and just get out of this world. We went back to this occupational therapist, and she said, I do not agree at all. Your child has made wonderful progress. He's shown us that he can learn. He shows us everyday he is willing to work. But in the back of my mind, that seed had been planted, and I had to fight it every single day.  (Soundbite of music) Ms. BROWN: I took him to see Santa last year, and I was trying to get him to smile. And he wouldn't look at the Santa at all, and all he wanted to do was play with his beard. And the Santa, the mall Santa to me said, does he have that autism thing. I just remember saying no, he doesn't have autism and took him off his lap. But now looking back, I can find humor in that, I guess, because there are so many other people that I asked, and they said no, and somehow Santa - I guess if you want a diagnosis, ask him.  Finally, someone said to me, have you ever had him taken to someone to see if he actually has autism. I said no, who do you take him to? I didn't even know there were doctors that did that. That's when she said, well, I know there's a doctor in Ann Arbor. His name is Dr. Solomon, and I know there's a waiting list six months or more. And of course, I called, and it was six months or more. And I just started crying uncontrollably on the phone, and I think the secretary just took pity on me and said well, can you get here on Friday at eight o'clock in the morning? I said yes. This was on a Tuesday, it was the day before the Fourth of July, and those four days were hell for me. I thought, he's going to say there's no hope for your child, you know, get over it and make the best of it. And we got there, and it was the complete opposite experience. Dr. RICK SOLOMON (Ann Arbor Center for Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics): OK, this is - I was afraid of that. That's the way to start the tape here. He just dumped all the blocks out, that will keep him busy for a while. So this is Dr. Solomon, Rick Solomon I'm going to make a tape on Gibson Brown, it's. . . Ms. BROWN: He looked at our child. He played with him. He initiated things with him. He got in his face. He got at his level. I just immediately, even before he said anything, I was so comforted because I thought, OK, he's seeing our child how he really is. Dr. SOLOMON: It's my style, after I'm done interviewing a family and playing with the child to then tape my recommendations. Ms. BROWN: Then he started off the tape by saying that your child very clearly has significant language delays. Dr. SOLOMON: That, there's no question, he's three years old, but he does have words, and he does have words before the age of three. . . Ms. BROWN: He likes to play by himself. Even though he can be social, he prefers to isolate himself. Dr. SOLOMON: And he's got a number of dominating interests. Ms. BROWN: He likes to play with certain things and not others, and he'll play with those certain things over and over and over again. Dr. SOLOMON: I'm sorry to say, but there's no doubt in my mind that he's on the autistic spectrum. Now, I think it's mild, I do think it's mild. Ms. BROWN: And then at that point he said, now let me stop the tape. Dr. SOLOMON: Now let me just stop there, OK. When I make a diagnosis of autism, generally I do stop the tape and wait for the parents' reaction. I often apologize to them for giving them bad news because I don't consider it good news. Ms. BROWN: And I'm waiting for him to say more. I mean, my mouth is open, and I'm waiting for him to say, your child is mentally retarded and has no future and will not be in a regular first grade classroom. And we're not saying anything. And he's looking at us, and we're looking at him, and I said, well, is there more? And he said, well, no. And I said, we're relieved, and I think he about fell out of his chair. I don't think he was expecting us to say that. Dr. SOLOMON: It takes a lot of strength to recognize that there is something that's not right with your child's development and to be able to come in and really take the risk of finding out that something really is wrong and that something needs to be done.  Ms. BROWN: He gave us a tape, and I listened to it probably a hundred times. I listen to it on the way to work almost every day. Dr. SOLOMON: And so there's reason to be very hopefully and to have high expectations. You should not lower your expectations here. Ms. BROWN: We've always know we were going to have to work hard with him. We've always known that, with our son it's not the way a typical child develops. But to know that someone else besides us believes in him, someone who has devoted his life to children like him, to hear that there are things that we can do for him to help him, I can handle that so much better. There's hope, and I definitely needed to hear that. CHADWICK: There's a photo slide show of Gibson Brown and his family at our website npr. org.

Mr. CRUISE: (As Charlie Babbitt) You and I are going to get on this plane.  . . TEXT: Mr. HOFFMAN: (As Raymond Babbitt): No.   (Soundbite of screaming)  Mr. CRUISE: (As Charlie Babbitt) Whoa, whoa.   Ms. BROWN:  I would read through the list of warning signs, and I could say, well, he doesn't do this, but he does do this. And it was like three-fourths, no and one fourth, yes because he loved being held. He wasn't a temper-tantrum thrower. So I would just, kind of, talk myself out of it a little bit, and then I would talk with other people. I talked with the pediatrician and none of them really seemed to feel like that fit him. And so I was relieved.  You want to do Pattycake?  Pattycake, Pattycake, bakersman.   I think for the longest time, we just kept thinking, well, the light is going to come on, and it's going to be OK and you know, everything else worked out, and we were hoping. But at the same time, I knew something was wrong. You could not attribute it to his adjusted age anymore.   And mark it with a - and mark it with a. . .  Nobody gives you a handbook with that says, your child has autism, this is what you do.  I talked to my sister, who is a nurse, and she said, you know what, just have a neurologist look at him. He was a little over two and a half. And at the point that we had that appointment, we were seeing progress, so I really wasn't expecting anything except for them to say, he just needs more time. And we go in there, and this neurologist comes right at him with these toys that he wasn't interested in. He would not even look at this doctor at all. Even things that he could do, he didn't even do it. And I remember this doctor saying, well, more than likely he is mentally retarded, and you'll just have to change your expectations and just shattered my heart. And so I'm in this office with tears down my face and just feeling like I want to crawl in a hole and just not ever come out and take my child with me and just get out of this world. We went back to this occupational therapist, and she said, I do not agree at all. Your child has made wonderful progress. He's shown us that he can learn. He shows us everyday he is willing to work. But in the back of my mind, that seed had been planted, and I had to fight it every single day.   (Soundbite of music)  Ms. BROWN: I took him to see Santa last year, and I was trying to get him to smile. And he wouldn't look at the Santa at all, and all he wanted to do was play with his beard. And the Santa, the mall Santa to me said, does he have that autism thing. I just remember saying no, he doesn't have autism and took him off his lap. But now looking back, I can find humor in that, I guess, because there are so many other people that I asked, and they said no, and somehow Santa - I guess if you want a diagnosis, ask him.   Finally, someone said to me, have you ever had him taken to someone to see if he actually has autism. I said no, who do you take him to? I didn't even know there were doctors that did that. That's when she said, well, I know there's a doctor in Ann Arbor. His name is Dr. Solomon, and I know there's a waiting list six months or more. And of course, I called, and it was six months or more. And I just started crying uncontrollably on the phone, and I think the secretary just took pity on me and said well, can you get here on Friday at eight o'clock in the morning? I said yes. This was on a Tuesday, it was the day before the Fourth of July, and those four days were hell for me. I thought, he's going to say there's no hope for your child, you know, get over it and make the best of it. And we got there, and it was the complete opposite experience.  Dr. RICK SOLOMON (Ann Arbor Center for Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics): OK, this is - I was afraid of that. That's the way to start the tape here. He just dumped all the blocks out, that will keep him busy for a while. So this is Dr. Solomon, Rick Solomon I'm going to make a tape on Gibson Brown, it's. . .  Ms. BROWN: He looked at our child. He played with him. He initiated things with him. He got in his face. He got at his level. I just immediately, even before he said anything, I was so comforted because I thought, OK, he's seeing our child how he really is.  Dr. SOLOMON: It's my style, after I'm done interviewing a family and playing with the child to then tape my recommendations.  Ms. BROWN: Then he started off the tape by saying that your child very clearly has significant language delays.  Dr. SOLOMON: That, there's no question, he's three years old, but he does have words, and he does have words before the age of three. . .  Ms. BROWN: He likes to play by himself. Even though he can be social, he prefers to isolate himself.  Dr. SOLOMON: And he's got a number of dominating interests.  Ms. BROWN: He likes to play with certain things and not others, and he'll play with those certain things over and over and over again.  Dr. SOLOMON: I'm sorry to say, but there's no doubt in my mind that he's on the autistic spectrum. Now, I think it's mild, I do think it's mild.  Ms. BROWN: And then at that point he said, now let me stop the tape.  Dr. SOLOMON: Now let me just stop there, OK.  When I make a diagnosis of autism, generally I do stop the tape and wait for the parents' reaction. I often apologize to them for giving them bad news because I don't consider it good news.  Ms. BROWN: And I'm waiting for him to say more. I mean, my mouth is open, and I'm waiting for him to say, your child is mentally retarded and has no future and will not be in a regular first grade classroom. And we're not saying anything. And he's looking at us, and we're looking at him, and I said, well, is there more? And he said, well, no. And I said, we're relieved, and I think he about fell out of his chair. I don't think he was expecting us to say that.  Dr. SOLOMON: It takes a lot of strength to recognize that there is something that's not right with your child's development and to be able to come in and really take the risk of finding out that something really is wrong and that something needs to be done.   Ms. BROWN: He gave us a tape, and I listened to it probably a hundred times. I listen to it on the way to work almost every day.  Dr. SOLOMON: And so there's reason to be very hopefully and to have high expectations. You should not lower your expectations here.  Ms. BROWN: We've always know we were going to have to work hard with him. We've always known that, with our son it's not the way a typical child develops. But to know that someone else besides us believes in him, someone who has devoted his life to children like him, to hear that there are things that we can do for him to help him, I can handle that so much better. There's hope, and I definitely needed to hear that.  CHADWICK: There's a photo slide show of Gibson Brown and his family at our website npr. org.

I'm Robert Siegel. Tuberculosis kills one and a half million people each year. A new World Health Organization report says there's been little progress in reducing the number of cases or deaths, and that's mainly because of the spread of HIV making people vulnerable to TB. There are drugs to treat tuberculosis. The problem for many people is getting reliable access to them. One country that is making progress is Bangladesh. Its teeming cities and crowded rural areas would normally be a perfect environment for TB, which is spread by coughing and spitting. Fred de Sam Lazaro has this report on what Bangladesh is doing right. FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Each year, about 300,000 Bangladeshis develop active TB; most will never reach a hospital or see a doctor. Instead, almost all of them will wind up in places like this dingy building called a cough collection center. Sputum samples are collected, numbered, and later tested for tuberculosis bacteria. (Soundbite of person coughing) DE SAM LAZARO: It can sound - well, pretty disgusting to the unknowing ear, but this is the sound of one of the world's most successful campaigns to curb tuberculosis. Dr. FAZLE ABED (Director, Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee): Detection rate is 90 percent, and cure rate is more than 95 percent. DE SAM LAZARO: Three and a half decades ago, Fazle Abed founded a grassroots organization to tackle this country's entrenched poverty and illiteracy called the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, or BRAC. Today, with grants from international donors, BRAC runs most of the country's TB control program. Dr. ABED: The treatment still is quite good in the sense that, you know, efficacious treatment is available and people can get well. REEVES: The challenge is finding those infected people, especially in rural areas, and getting them on and keeping them on the antibiotic treatment. That's where the Rural Advancement Committee fits in. Over the years, it's built a vast network of local associations or committees for various development and work programs. BRAC had a ready army of people like Amina Tiwari(ph) who are trained to look for people with symptoms like anemia, fever, chills, persistent coughing, things that may suggest TB. Ms. AMINA TIWARI (Village Health Worker, Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee): (Through translator) If anyone has symptoms for three weeks, I give them a cup for collection, or I take them to the cough collection center. DE SAM LAZARO: Today, this 50-year-old widow is one of 70,000 women at the front lines of a methodical health surveillance campaign. Every morning after breakfast, she sets out to visit and check up on 15 neighboring families. Ms. TIWARI: (Speaking in foreign language) Unidentified Woman: (Speaking in foreign language) DE SAM LAZARO: Tiwari has a sixth-grade education and a few days of training from the TB program to be a village health worker. She's the closest most of her neighbors will come to seeing a doctor or pharmacist. She carries a notebook to keep track of her visits and also a bag with various everyday drugs like pain killers and rehydration salts, which she dispensed at one home. Ms. TIWARI: (Speaking in foreign language) DE SAM LAZARO: She's allowed to sell this for a much needed source of income in the extended quarters she shares with a son and daughter-in-law on whom she'd otherwise be dependent. Ms. TIWARI: (Through translator) Now, I have some of my own earnings. It's very important. I can give some money to my sons, to their families, for my grandchildren. Ms. TIWARI: (Speaking in foreign language) DE SAM LAZARO: On her route, Tiwari saw a gaunt, 50-something woman she'd been admonishing for some time. I don't have any appetite, the woman complained. I've told you numerous times, Tiwari scolded, get tested. She handed her two specimen cups and promised to take her to the cough collection center. Typically, about 1 in 10 suspected cases turns out positive for TB. From these patients, the program will collect the equivalent of five U. S. dollars and begin a six-month antibiotic regimen. The medicines are given not to the patient but to the health volunteer to ensure compliance with the prescription. Dr. ABED: In most cases, what happens is that after one month of drug taking, the patient feels quite okay, normal, and then he gets up, and nobody is following up with the patient. DE SAM LAZARO: That incomplete course of antibiotics is a recipe for new drug-resistant strains of TB that are much harder to contain. A recent World Health Organization report found an alarming rise of multi-drug-resistant TB in many countries, particularly those of the former Soviet Union and China. So every day, patients like Bashanti Tiwari(ph) show up at Amina Tiwari's house - they're not related. Bashanti is three months into her treatment. Amina Tiwari will hand her patient every single pill in the six-month prescription and watch it go down. What keeps patients coming back even when they feel better? They'll get their $5 back. It doesn't seem like a lot, but by this country's per capita income, that's two a half days' wages. And the tuberculosis initiative has opened the door to other public health problems. Ms. TIWARI: (Speaking in foreign language) DE SAM LAZARO: On her daily rounds, for example, Amina Tiwari also prods mothers to immunize their kids. Today, 80 percent of Bangladeshi children are up to date on their shots, including a vaccine to prevent TB - a disease that program officials say just could be eradicated from Bangladesh in the next 10 to 15 years.

Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, host:  And I'm Renee Montagne.  When the U. S. built the atomic bomb back in World War II, the project was so secret the scientists sometimes talked in code. Given that secrecy, it may surprise you to learn that they were also furiously filing applications for patents, and describing the parts in exquisite detail.  Though only footnotes in most historical accounts, those patents have recently consumed the life of one young historian at Harvard. And he told NPR's David Kestenbaum about the massive and largely forgotten effort to patent the technology behind the bomb.  DAVID KESTENBAUM: Alex Wallerstein is 26 years old and he hopes about two years away from his PhD. This patent thing has been a bit of a detour. He says his journey began when he was reading a newspaper clipping from the 1960s. In it a scientist mentioned something Wellerstein found strange: a patent for the atomic bomb.  Mr. ALEX WELLERSTEIN (Student): I didn't know what that meant. I didn't know if it was just rhetorical, or if it really meant there was a patent on the atomic bomb. KESTENBAUM: He chuckled. Why patents? Was the unfortunately planning to sue the Germans for patent infringement if they built the bomb first? The news article quoted a Manhattan Project physicist named Philip Morrison as saying he was an author on the patent. And Morrison was still alive.  Mr. WELLERSTEIN: I was able to get in contact with him just a few weeks before he passed away actually. And he told me yes there was a patent, and he had to sign over his rights to it. And he was supposed to be paid a dollar, and they never paid him. KESTENBAUM: That patent is still secret, but others on various components have dribbled out over the years as the topics have become declassified. There's one for a \"Neutronic Reactor\" and a \"Low Impedance Switch. \" They have a kind of beauty to them, if you can set aside what they were actually used for. Elegant diagrams with simple lines and numbered parts, almost like those instructions you get for putting together Ikea furniture.  Wallerstein couldn't find anything in the historical literature about why the government filed for these patents given the apparent security risk. So he went through microfilm archives of bureaucratic correspondence, hundreds of pages that he guesses historians figured were too boring to bother with. And he found an unpublished autobiography by one of the scientists who worked as a liaison to the patent office In general, Wellerstein says, the idea behind the patents was to give the government blanket protection against contractors who might try to profit from federally funded research, as insurance against scientists who might want to control how their work was used.  Mr. WELLERSTEIN: You really see that this is not just an attempt to patent one invention. It's an attempt to get a patent monopoly on a brand new industry. So that when the U. S. government exited World War II they owned patents on practically everything related to atomic energy research at that point.  KESTENBAUM: But patenting atomic bomb technology presented obvious security problems. So the project made use of an obscure law whereby patent applications could be filed but no one would actually look at them or evaluate them. They would just be stamped secret and stored not inside a fence at Los Alamos, but in a vault at the patent office. In hindsight, Wellerstein says, it all seems a little odd. Mr. WELLERSTEIN: The patent system in general kind of goes against all of the rules of Manhattan Project security. Instead of having all the information compartmentalized and in different places and people not knowing the whole story and being used with code names for materials - instead you need everything centralized and everything written in a language that hypothetically any engineer can understand. KESTENBAUM: This actually came up in a congressional hearing after the war. According to the transcript, one U. S. senator said, quote, \"I didn't dream, frankly, up until this point that there was a patent application down there showing how the bomb was put together. Did you? \" No, said another senator, personally I regret it. Wellerstein said there was even a moment in the middle of the war when some people feared the patent project might backfire. They worried spies might be able to figure out the U. S. was working on the bomb by trying to submit their own patent applications, because if you submitted your own patent on something the government was working on, you'd get a note back in the mail saying your patent had been made secret, a clue that you'd gotten too close to something sensitive.  Mr. WELLERSTEIN: Usually these orders, and I've seen a few of them, all they do is say your patent has been made secret. Here's what the law says on that. Don't tell anybody about this. Don't call us, we'll call you. KESTENBAUM: Apparently no spies tried that, though. And the patents piled up. Wellerstein said that by 1947 the atomic bomb project had written up over 2,000 separate inventions. Wellerstein is now posting his favorites on a Web site.  Mr. WELLERSTEIN: What I really like about the atomic patents is that there's a wonderful banality to it. I mean, you really see it through the eyes of a patent lawyer. And you see the bomb, which is this, you know, incredible, sort of massive killing machine, turned into the most boring of engineering feats. KESTENBAUM: Wellerstein says, in the end, as far as he can tell, these patents had basically no effect on the course of history.  David Kestenbaum, NPR News.

I'm Farai Chideya. Black people don't starve themselves, throw up, or do any other things that constitute an eating disorder. That's what some people think, but that's wrong. Some studies show that African-Americans are just as likely as whites to struggle with eating disorders. But the professionals don't always catch the problem. We'll talk with two experts about the disorders in a moment. But first, Marna Clowney-Robinson is an eating disorder survivor. She is now an advocate for people of color who struggle with the problem and she's here now to tell us her story. Marna, thanks for coming on. Ms. MARNA CLOWNEY-ROBINSON (Eating Disorder Survivor): You're welcome. CHIDEYA: So let's start when you were a teenager. Describe who you were and your relationship with food and what food meant to you and how you chose to deal with it? Ms. CLOWNEY-ROBINSON: Well, I guess as a teenager I really wasn't sure who I was or where I fit in. Being that I'm from a multi-ethnic African-American family, it was real hard for me to make friends and to feel included within my community, and I used food as a way of, I would say, trying to find a place for myself to fit in as well as disappear. And when I say disappear, for me it meant not having people see me, not having people be able to make fun of me, to pick on me, to see the flaws that I was seeing within myself. CHIDEYA: So you, by the time you were 17, were five feet ten. How much did you weigh at your lowest point? Ms. CLOWNEY-ROBINSON: My lowest point I was about 112 pounds.  CHIDEYA: That's extreme, and did - how did your family react? Did they just say, oh, you know, you've got to eat a little bit more? Or did they recognize this was a major problem? Ms. CLOWNEY-ROBINSON: Within my family I don't think they actually saw it as a eating disorder, and myself didn't really see it as a eating disorder nor saw it as a huge problem until I got treatment. I am one out of six siblings and we all use food as a way of coping with stresses and stressful situations that came up in our lives at the time. What I was doing was pretty much normal with my siblings. So to us it was normal behavior. It's how we - I mean we used food to deal with stress. CHIDEYA: Now. . . Ms. CLOWNEY-ROBINSON: Go ahead. CHIDEYA: Why do you think that is, and what I mean is, you know, there's a lot of people who have eating disorders. I mean it's, you know, as you know, it's not uncommon. But do you think there was, I mean was there a moment in time where there was a stress when you were a child that kind of brought this out or was it just sort of a family practice? Why do you think you got caught up in it? Ms. CLOWNEY-ROBINSON: I think for myself, I took it really hard when my parents split and felt that my father leaving was my fault, and a lot of different circumstances that led up to him leaving was actually my fault. So around eight or nine years old is when I first started experimenting with controlling my food intake or getting rid of my food intake. CHIDEYA: Now, Marna, I want to get into more details of your story, but we've also got a couple other folks with us. Becky Thompson is a professor of sociology at the Simmons College in Boston. She also wrote \"A Hunger So Wide and So Deep: A Multiracial View of Women's Eating Problems. \" And Divya Kakaiya is a licensed psychologist in San Diego, California, and she's been treating eating disorders since 1985.  So welcome, guys. And Becky, let me go straight to you. When you are hearing Marna talk about this, what does it call up for you from your experience? Professor BECKY THOMPSON (Simmons College, Boston): Well, first, thanks for having me on the show. I really appreciate Marna's courage and honesty. It still takes a lot of guts to talk openly about the reasons that girls and women turn to food or away from it in order to protect themselves from a range of different traumas. So she is breaking ground in two ways, and one is to talk about her specific story, but also to really counter the notion that African-American women don't get eating problems. So I just appreciate your courage. Ms. CLOWNEY-ROBINSON: Thank you. CHIDEYA: So when you think about what she was saying about feeling like somehow her family divorce was her fault, is that something, is it common for people who have eating disorders to take on the weight of situations that they didn't control and may not have even really had a hand in? Prof. THOMPSON: Definitely. One of the things that I saw over and over again among the women that I interviewed for \"A Hunger So Wide and So Deep\" is that they didn't feel like they had much control over anything at all. And they often turn to food or away from it as a way of trying to take care of themselves. One of the women I interviewed, for example, remembers hearing her parents go at it and her father beating up her mother. And she would make little cookies with the Ritz Crackers and raisins (unintelligible) smiles; raisins and smiles for me and my sisters is what she would say when she was four years old.  She was also being sexually abused at the time by a family member and also by a babysitter, and she really thought that she was at fault for all of that. So as young as four years old and then by seven years old she had really seen food as her main companion in the world. CHIDEYA: Divya, let's dig in a little bit into what it really means to have an eating disorder. There's different types - you know, the main ones are anorexia and bulimia. Explain what those are, first of all, and then I want to ask you a little bit more about the distinctions. Ms. DIVYA KAKAIYA (Psychologist): Right, right. Thank you. Thank you for having me on the show. I appreciate it, and just as Becky said, I think that it just really is tremendously courageous on Marna's part to tell her story because I think this is how we dispel a lot of the myths that we have in our community. And you know, when we look at anorexia, you know, there is a - again, with anorexia there's a believe out there that a person who is anorexic is - has stopped eating completely, and that is not the case. A drive for thinness and sort of like this obsessiveness about needing to be thinner and never feeling like a person gets thin enough, so there's that whole piece of perfectionism that you find with anorexia; and then with bulimia, what we find is that women that tend to be prone to bulimia are more normal weight or slightly overweight women. And as I was mentioning, that a lot of times with anorexia there's a drive for thinness and with bulimia it's much more so about the control piece. And so, and of course with anorexia we have the same thing too. So the underlying issues are often, you know, pretty significant with eating disorders. CHIDEYA: When you think about some more of the distinctions around these behaviors, is there, you know, just tell us what the risks are, what can you do to yourself if you pursue either thinness or vomiting as a way of controlling what you do or any of the other methods? Ms. KAKAIYA: You know what, it's with all the years I've been treating eating disorders, the medical risks are huge and tremendous. I mean with anorexia, clearly, you know, when a woman stops having her period and her estrogen levels drop, there's a resultant decline in bone density. And eating disorders, particularly anorexia, have the highest mortality rate of all eating disorders.  And unfortunately, you know, the more assimilated young African woman - American woman is, in the mainstream dominant Caucasian culture, the more high risk she tends to be for developing anorexia or bulimia, because what she's doing then is she's internalizing the values of the dominant white culture around thinness. And so the medical pieces are what often don't get talked about in terms of the complications with eating disorders. CHIDEYA: Well, I just want to bring folks into the conversation in case they are just tuning in. This is actually the part of our, the wrap-up of our series on mental health, and you're listening to NPR's NEWS & NOTES. I'm Farai Chideya. Our guests in talking about eating disorders are Marna Clowney-Robinson, who has survived an eating disorder herself; Divya Kakaiya, a licensed psychologist; and Becky Thompson, who wrote \"A Hunger So Wide and So Deep: A Multiracial View of Women's Eating Problems. \"  Marna, did you seek help ultimately because of medical reasons? Ms. CLOWNEY-ROBINSON: Yes, I did. When I first tried to get help, I went to my regular doctor, because I was having a lot of chest pains, esophageal problems, and it was really hard for me to get a professional to actually take me serious. And I ended up struggling for another couple years until I actually finally found someone who could help me. CHIDEYA: Why do you think people, some of these professionals, didn't seem to see you as someone who needed help? Ms. CLOWNEY-ROBINSON: What one doctor told me was that they didn't see or recognize eating disorders in minority cultures, so he was not going to go down that road. He would test for other things. I had another doctor tell me eat like a boy, you'll be better, and another nurse pretty much told me that it was all in my head; I was making it up, because they didn't see a lot of minority patients with eating disorders. CHIDEYA: Becky, your book is about multiracial issues within eating disorders. Is there a lack of treatment that still affects some girls and women, and we should add, men and boys? Ms. THOMPSON: I think one of the most painful things about talking to the women who I interviewed was how many times they didn't feel as if they were seen or heard or recognized when they tried to seek different kinds of treatment, and the only silver lining there is they often created ingenious strategies on their own. You know, many of the women talked about - came to understand that the basis of their eating problems were from a number of different traumas, from exposure to racism or sexual abuse or physical abuse or poverty or the stress of acculturation or homophobia, and so for many of them healing included some form of activism, working in a rape crisis hotline or at a battered women's shelter or being part of a support group or getting money to go to college so that they could finish their education. And these were strategies that were outside of the medical model but they saw as means of empowerment, and I think what's encouraging about that is that it talks about - that healing is really a communal affair, that people can't do it on their own, and even if they are ignored by the  medical establishment, there are other ways that people can get help, including Overeaters Anonymous, which became a big tool for a lot of the women. CHIDEYA: Divya, how about men? How do men fit into this picture of eating disorders? Ms. KAKAIYA: You know, I think about maybe 10 years ago, one out of every 10 persons coming to treatment facilities was a male, and in the last five years I would say it's one out of seven that come to us that's a male, and I truly believe that the reason why we see this increase is because men's magazines are doing something very similar to what's been done for women. Women of color, men of color, it's the same. You know, I was looking at some magazines a couple days ago and just looking at the oppression that men are starting to feel that women have felt for the last three or four decades in terms of only one particular body size is acceptable size, and with men too now they're getting more and more messages that that six-pack has to be equated with sexual virility. And so even in my clinic now I'm starting to see more and more young men and men that come forward to seek help because actually the word is getting out there that this is not just a woman's disease, and it's not only a white woman's disease; it's a disease that affects all, across all socio-cultural lines and across all ethnic lines. So I think that because there's more out in the field now, that we're having it be less of a taboo, that more men are coming forward, and the issues for men clinically are the same identical issues as they are for women, which are issues around empowerment, not having a voice, there may be - it doesn't necessarily have to have trauma, but there may be some trauma in the history, a very strong history of teasing with most eating disorders. So if somebody has a certain body size and they've been teased about that, particularly for men and boys, that's a very huge traumatic event. CHIDEYA: Marna, Becky was saying that a lot of women of color have turned, you know, to really addressing the underlying issues and/or activism. You are someone who's now involved in helping other people. What do you do? What kind of outreach do you do? Ms. CLOWNEY-ROBINSON: Well, what I've done is I began working with ANAD out of Chicago, and I help coordinate their online support network, trying to get those who struggle with eating disorders linked into the right resources for their particular geographic location, and I also have run a couple of online support forum boards so that women, men and teens can go on and be able to talk openly, honestly, and express their voice. Because I know for myself it wasn't until I found my voice that the healing process could not begin for me, because with an eating disorder it quiets your voice so much that when you get it back, it's so empowering. So what I do is I try and help people who are - and I say people because it is - it's men, women and even family members help find their voice in either surviving an eating disorder or helping a loved one with an eating disorder. CHIDEYA: Becky, very briefly, what are a couple of resources that people can turn to? Ms. THOMPSON: One of the most exciting programs around is called The Body Positive in San Francisco. It's an empowerment program that includes producing videos and training adult and youth leaders to help combat body hatred and early-onset eating problems. I also think that the National Black Women's Health Project has been on the case with this for really 20 years, and I want to just celebrate the work that they've been doing. And then what Marna talked about as well, about finding voice. One of the women I interviewed said I didn't have any feelings about how I felt when I ate. I didn't know that there were any feelings there because for years they were stripped away from me. So for me, a first step in that process is talking with people about how to develop an affectionate understanding for the way that they did cope, not from a place of blame, but from a place of self-love. CHIDEYA: Well, Becky, Divya, Marna, thank you so much. Ms. THOMPSON: Thank you for having us. Ms. KAKAIYA: Thank you. Ms. CLOWNEY-ROBINSON: Thank you.

I'm Michele Norris. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. We begin today by returning to the story of one soldier who was nearly killed in Iraq. Last April, we told you about Army Sergeant Tim Ngo. He was 20 years old when he almost died from a head wound in Iraq. Like many injured soldiers, he was helped by a dedicated family member. His mother, Hong Wyberg, left her job to stay with him at Walter Reed. It can take years and years to recover from the injuries of war. And that long process sometimes takes a toll on families. Now, Tim Ngo and his mother have become estranged. NPR's Joseph Shapiro has their story. (Soundbite of people shooting pool) JOSEPH SHAPIRO: Just to look at him, you wouldn't know that the guy in this bar shooting pool almost died in Iraq. Sergeant TIM NGO (Retired, U. S. Army): That's a scratch. Unidentified Man #1: Sorry. Sgt. NGO: That's how I played it when I was in D. C. SHAPIRO: The only clue is that Tim Ngo keeps his hair cut short so you can see the long, zigzag scar where surgeons cut out a chunk of his skull. (Soundbite of door closing) SHAPIRO: Ngo steps outside for a smoke. Against the freezing Minnesota night, he wears a flimsy San Antonio Spurs basketball jersey over a white T-shirt. Another smoker says thanks for your service and asks about Iraq. Unidentified Man #2: So, you're glad to be back? Sgt. NGO: Oh, hell, yeah. I had to learn how to do everything all over again when I got to Walter Reed. SHAPIRO: Ngo tells about the three grenades and about the shrapnel that ripped through his brain and left him unable to walk or even to put simple words together. Sgt. NGO: And then I sent to all, a mass e-mail to the bunch of my friends to tell them that I'm in the hospital and everything. And I'm thinking, I'm telling the whole story. It's only two sentences. Three bang, head, grenade. Ouch, hospital. (Soundbite of laughter) Sgt. NGO: And I think my mom read that to me and I'm, like, that's not what I (bleep) wrote. (Soundbite of laughter) SHAPIRO: It's been four years since Sergeant Tim Ngo's injury in Iraq. Therapists helped him learn to walk again and talk again, then how to cope with the short-term memory loss from his head injury, and to control the anger that came with this post-traumatic stress disorder. Now, at the age of 24, he's out of the Army and making his way back into the world. (Soundbite of packing tape pulled off the roll) It's the next day. Tim Ngo is packing up the two-bedroom apartment by the highway he shares with his girlfriend, Ani Cerghizan. Ms. ANI CERGHIZAN (Tim Ngo's Girlfriend): Well, we wanted to wrap it. though. SHAPIRO: They packed up the flat screen TV. They've got carriers for the kittens and the two white doves that Tim bought as presents for Ani. (Soundbite of dove cooing) SHAPIRO: Just hours from now, Tim and Ani will drive far away from Minnesota. They are moving to Texas, to the town where Tim was stationed in the Army. They'll leave behind all the doctors, therapists, friends and family they've counted on. Sgt. NGO: It's a real big step in my life - moving - and a really big step in a relationship because we're both going down there just by ourselves and it's just going to be us. SHAPIRO: Friends and family are here to help them pack up, but there's one person missing: Tim's mother. She's been at his side throughout his injury. She hurried to the Army hospital in Germany and saw him with his head swollen grotesquely. She didn't know if her only child would live or die. Then at Walter Reed, she'd sit by his hospital bed and hold his hand until he fell asleep at night and sneak back into his room early the next morning and be holding his hand when he woke up. Tim and his mother don't talk to each other anymore. Sgt. NGO: She's got to apologize to me and Ani before any contact will happen. SHAPIRO: Apologize for what? Tim's answer rambles. It's hard to sort out what's real complaint, where the head injury plays a part, and what's simply a young man's need to assert his independence. Part of it, which is true, is that his mother doesn't see Ani, with her lip piercings and the peace sign on her car, as a good match for Tim. But his reasons seem to go deeper than just a clash between mother and girlfriend. Sgt. NGO: I think my mom judges her on how she dresses. And also she, like my mom since I got injured, all of a sudden I'm a baby again, she's got to take care of me, change my dressings and all of that. But until she apologizes to me and Ani, no contact is going to be made. SHAPIRO: Hong Wyberg hasn't spoken into her son since a phone call just before Thanksgiving, when he announced he was leaving. Ms. HONG WYBERG (Tim Ngo's Mother): I don't know how to fix it. I don't know how to change it except to let him go or let him go to Texas. Let him live on his own. He thinks that I'm too controlling living in the same state with him. SHAPIRO: But to Wyberg, after his injury, Tim needed that help. He was dependent upon his mother for things from medical care to balancing his checkbook. His body healed, but she says the head injury still affected the way he thought and acted. Ms. WYBERG: I have a hard time convincing Tim or getting Tim to understand he has changed. I mean, he physically looks the same, but after the accident, after the brain injury, he's different. He's short-tempered. He's quick to jump to conclusion, and he's almost impulsive. SHAPIRO: Families often provide heroic support to injured soldiers. That's the public story that's often told. But year after year of caregiving can pull apart even the most dedicated and loving of families. Hong Wyberg says she and her son were close until recently. For a long time, it was just the two of them. She, too, set out to be independent at a young age. She was 8 when Saigon fell and her Vietnamese family fled to America. Hong was just 17 when Tim was born, and she left her small hometown in Texas to raise him as a single mother. Ms. WYBERG: He asked me, have I ever stayed until the bar is closed? No. He goes, haven't you just gone out and just got drunk? And I'm like, no, never. I was busy working, raising a kid. I didn't go to clubs, bars. I haven't a clue how to dance. And I missed out on a lot. And, you know, Tim says what kind of life did you lead? I was a young mother. I was a young, single mom, raising him. SHAPIRO: Now, Hong wonders about the way Tim wants to lead his life. If there's any crack in a relationship, the arrival of a serious disability can find that weakness and rip it wide open. And Tim's wasn't the only serious brain injury in the family. While Hong Wyberg tended to her son at Walter Reed in Washington, back home in Minnesota, her husband was caring for his own son. Just months before, that teenage boy, Tim's stepbrother, was severely injured in a car accident. Hong Wyberg's marriage ended. Tim blamed her for leaving his stepfather, the only father he'd ever known. Now, Hong says she's had to cash in her savings and take a second job, working seven days a week to at first support her son and now, herself. As Tim packs to leave, Hong is across town in the orthodontist's office where she works as a technician. He's taking off in a few hours for Texas. You can't be there or you won't be there to be able to say goodbye. So if you had a chance to say goodbye to him, what would you say? Ms. WYBERG: Just be happy. Call me if you need anything. I'm always here. I'll always be here for him. It's - that's not a question or an issue, it's just how much does he want me to be involved in his life? SHAPIRO: Even though Tim has cut off contact with his mother, he hardly sounds like an ungrateful son. Back at his apartment, he easily expresses his appreciation for all she's done for him. Like the time they went into a restaurant and a table of women stared and laughed at Tim. In those days, he wore a kind of football helmet to protect the open spot where his skull had been removed. Sgt. NGO: She's like, hold my purse. And I'm like, okay. And she walks over to this table of these elderly women that were laughing. And she's like, you know what, why are you guys laughing at my son? Do you know why he has to wear that helmet? He went over to Iraq, and he got four grenades to the head. So now he's got to wear that because all that's there is skin and then brain. And you don't want to piss my mom off. You really don't want to piss her off. SHAPIRO: A year ago, Tim took Ani to a fancy restaurant for dinner. Another diner dropped a fork, and when it clanked on the floor, Tim ducked, the way he would in Iraq when he heard a gunshot. A year ago, Tim lost his job stacking shelves at Target because he'd get anxious, even hostile, when customers ask questions. Ani explains. Ms. CERGHIZAN: He's changed significantly from just a year ago. I mean, he was a lot angrier and more aggressive over things and - because he had untreated PTSD; the VA didn't even know. And then we've been going through \u2014 for a year, he went to Dr. Kennedy(ph), his therapist, which \u2014 amazing woman at the VA and ever since then he's changed a lot, like complete 360. SHAPIRO: There are still problems. Tim says his short-term memory is bad. He leaves notes around the house to remind him what he needs to do. But he gets full disability benefits from the VA. And just before Christmas, his disability check arrived from Social Security with $18,000 in retroactive benefits, enough to make the move to Texas. To Ani, Tim is the sweet and romantic boyfriend who lavishes her with presents. She's 22 and just graduated from training to be a veterinarian's assistant. Ask Tim about his own dreams for the future, and he talks of buying a ranch for Ani in Texas. Sgt. NGO: Well, it's kind of her dream, basically, to have a farm with all her animals that she wants and basically to have her happy. Because she's someone I want to spend the rest of my life with, and she's not even looking at me to see me look at her. But I want to make her happy. I want to give her the things that she has never been able to have. SHAPIRO: As Tim says this, he tenderly takes Ani's hand. She's curled up on a couch, softly crying. It's Ani who's having the hard time today. Ms. CERGHIZAN: This move has been such a really big step. I'm leaving behind everyone, my sister and my mother, and it is hard. And, you know, every time I see my sister, I'm like, when am I going to see her again? She's been my best friend my whole life and, I mean, I'm excited to move on with Tim, absolutely. I mean, I love him to death, and I want to spend the rest of my life with him, but it's just such an extreme step and I'm excited for it, but at the same time I'm kind of hurting to miss everybody. SHAPIRO: The next morning, Tim and Ani get up before 5. (Soundbite of program \"Fox 9 News\") Unidentified Man: And a bitterly, cold morning with dangerous wind chills out there. Eric Mailyn(ph) is up next with the forecast right here on the \"Fox 9 News. \" (Soundbite of car door opening and closing) SHAPIRO: Ani gets behind the wheel of the U-Haul. (Soundbite of car engine revving) SHAPIRO: Tim drives his new Chevy Impala to the gas station but then gets a bit lost. Ani gives directions over the walkie-talkie. Sgt. NGO: Ani. Ms. CERGHIZAN: Yes? Sgt. NGO: I turned on Willow, right? Ms. CERGHIZAN: Yeah, the one light right after the gas station. Sgt. NGO: All right. Well, I'm on my way over right now. Ms. CERGHIZAN: Hurry up before I lose a toe or a finger. SHAPIRO: They meet up nearby and check their maps for the road to Texas. For Sergeant Tim Ngo, it's a road away from war, away from injury, and the path to recovery, growth and independence. Sgt. NGO: The future looks great for me, I think. SHAPIRO: Tim Ngo reports from Texas that the other week, he asked Ani to marry him. They've set a date for September. He hasn't told his mother. Joseph Shapiro, NPR News. SIEGEL: And you can hear our first story about Tim Ngo at our Web site, npr. org.  MICHELE NORRIS, host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Michele Norris.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host:  And I'm Robert Siegel.  We begin today by returning to the story of one soldier who was nearly killed in Iraq. Last April, we told you about Army Sergeant Tim Ngo. He was 20 years old when he almost died from a head wound in Iraq. Like many injured soldiers, he was helped by a dedicated family member. His mother, Hong Wyberg, left her job to stay with him at Walter Reed.  It can take years and years to recover from the injuries of war. And that long process sometimes takes a toll on families. Now, Tim Ngo and his mother have become estranged.  NPR's Joseph Shapiro has their story.  (Soundbite of people shooting pool)  JOSEPH SHAPIRO: Just to look at him, you wouldn't know that the guy in this bar shooting pool almost died in Iraq.  Sergeant TIM NGO (Retired, U. S. Army): That's a scratch.  Unidentified Man #1: Sorry.  Sgt. NGO: That's how I played it when I was in D. C.

RACHEL MARTIN, Host: That its operation could unleash a black hole that would basically swallow the entire Earth, and all of us along with it. So, how realistic is that, and how might it happen? Joining us now to explain is David Morgan, physics professor at Eugene Lang College in Manhattan, and friend of the BPP. Welcome back, David. DAVID MORGAN: Thanks. Thanks for having me back. MARTIN: So, first we're going to wind it all the way back and talk a little bit about fundamentals. Explain to us. What is a particle accelerator? MORGAN: A particle accelerator is basically a big machine that physicists build in order to smash particles together at really, really high velocities in order to see how they behave, and what comes flying out. MARTIN: And what do you learn from that? MORGAN: What physicists are trying to learn is something about the nature, the fundamental forces that govern our universe. Forces like the electrical force that holds atoms together, the strong force that holds nuclei together, and figure out how those forces work, and how they behave at various energies. MARTIN: So, those are big questions. These machines, particle accelerators, really are at the foundation of some very big physics questions. MORGAN: Yeah. You're really sort of - we're probing the fundamental structure of matter. MARTIN: Let's talk about what these things look like. I actually visited CERN when I was a college student on a field trip, and it was a little bit overwhelming. I remember hearing some kind of vague explanation about what this big machine did, but it is physically large right, these things? MORGAN: It is physically large. Basically, the Large Hadron Collider is contained in a tunnel that is 17 miles in circumference. So picture something about the size of a subway tunnel in diameter, and picture a round subway line that's about 17 miles around. So, every time the particles go around the accelerator once, they travel about 17 miles. MARTIN: And just to clarify - CERN, there was already a particle accelerator at CERN. This is a new one that has just been built? MORGAN: That's right. MARTIN: Correct? Now, this new very large particle accelerator in Switzerland - we talked a little bit about some of the fears surrounding this thing, but why was it necessary? Why are scientists, why did they decide to build this? MORGAN: Some particle, or some interaction, or some outcome that's unexpected, and there is a long sort of laundry list of things physicists hope to see, but I think many physicists would be even happier if they saw something they didn't expect at all. MARTIN: Now, I know there's a long laundry list of things they expect to see, and I know that most of those would require a lot of explanation, but are there a couple examples on that list? MORGAN: There's another set of particles called supersymmetric particles, which are sort of partners to every particle that we normally encounter around us. So, an electron has a particle called the selectron, and a quark has a partner called the squark, and these are particles that are postulated for various sort-of technical and mathematical reasons that a lot of physicists would like it if they existed, but we've never seen one before in the lab, so. . . MARTIN: So, this accelerator can create the circumstances necessary to hopefully observe it. MORGAN: Which is basically just a lot of energy. By Einstein's equation, E equals MC squared, if you get enough energy together you can create particles of matter. And because these particles of matter are more massive than any we've found before, we need a lot of energy in order to make them. MARTIN: I want to talk about black holes. There is some speculation that this machine might be used to create small black holes. Now, why would someone want to create a black hole, and how would you even do it? MORGAN: Well, a black hole is what you get if you take a whole bunch of matter and energy and put it in a very small space. So, usually when we think about black holes we think about astronomy where a collapsing star can create such a high density that it's so dense that light would be unable to escape from its surface. But I can make anything a black hole if I squished it small enough. I can make you a black hole if I squished you about down to the size of a proton. MARTIN: You could make me a black hole? MORGAN: Well, theoretically. It would require - we would have to stick you in the particle accelerator and get you going really fast to smash you down to that size. But the idea is with this particle accelerator, if we smash together two very small particles at a very high velocity, we are packing a huge amount of energy into a very small space, and that could create a teeny tiny little black hole. STEWART: If one were to make a black hole on the radio, it might sound a little bit like what we are about to hear. NPR's esteemed science correspondent Robert Krulwich actually did a piece on this back in November 2006, in which he spoke with Professor Brian Greene from Columbia University. ROBERT KRULWICH: It would, says Brian, be entirely possible to take, for example, an ordinary common watermelon and put it inside some incredibly powerful squeezing machine that's not yet been invented, that squeezes so fiercely that the watermelon would become denser and denser. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESSURE BUILDING)KRULWICH: And so dense that at some point predicted by Einstein, the watermelon would change states and become. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SPLAT)KRULWICH: A mini black hole. BRIAN GREENE: Oh, yeah. Absolutely. KRULWICH: Now, I know we made the sounds up there, but theoretically this is a real possibility? GREENE: Oh, yeah. Absolutely. KRULWICH: In fact, in the next decade, he says, teams of scientists will try to manufacture mini-black holes. GREENE: And this is not just hypothetical. There is a new machine being built in Geneva, Switzerland, right now, called the Large Hadron Collider, and one of the things that may happen at the Large Hadron Collider is the creation of microscopic black holes in the collision between protons and protons. These will be tiny black holes, but black holes nonetheless. MARTIN: Now, that was part of an NPR piece from November 2006. Fast-forward to today, and physicists are about ready to take that Large Hadron Collider in Geneva for a spin, they are about ready to start using this. And as we said before, there are some people out there who are concerned that this machine could create a mini-black hole, which could basically suck us all into oblivion. How realistic is that, David? MORGAN: So, yes the Large Hadron Collider could make a teeny tiny little black hole, but the energy of this black hole would be about the same mass energy of a mosquito, and it has no more danger of this little black hole sucking up the Earth than a mosquito is in danger of sucking up the entire Earth with its gravitational pull. MARTIN: So, let's talk specifically about the lawsuit, then. How much merit does this suit have? And what are the arguments being put forth? MORGAN: I think it has very little. First of all, it should be noted that this same individual put forward a similar lawsuit to keep them from turning on the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, which is out on Long Island, and has been running for years, and last time I checked, Long Island is still there. MARTIN: So, this is someone who has - he has some fear, let's just say. MORGAN: So if there is any danger of a micro black hole being created to devour the Earth, it would have happened up in the top of our atmosphere sometime within the last four to five billion years. MARTIN: You're not afraid. You're not living in fear. MORGAN: I won't be losing any sleep over this. MARTIN: David Morgan, physics professor at Eugene Lang College in Manhattan, thanks as always. MORGAN: Thank you. STEWART: The conversation between Krulwich and physics professor Brian Greene was actually about efforts to create a man-made universe. We've already heard that scientists are close to creating microscopic black holes. Get out your pens and take notes as Mr. Krulwich and Greene explain the next step in creating a man-made universe is to take a tiny black hole and expand it. Do tell. GREENE: It then explodes. (SOUNDBITE OF EXPLOSION AND ORCHESTRAL MUSIC)GREENE: Roughly speaking. KRULWICH: Now, this is the universe I was waiting for. So, how do you do this? Obviously you've inserted something or you've changed something to alter the physics of the little black hole, right? GREENE: Yeah, exactly, and physics has to do with a strange feature of gravity that none of us have ever experienced, but the math shows us is true, and observations of space seem to confirm, and that is that gravity can actually be not only attractive, it could not only pull things together, it can also be repulsive, it can push things apart. KRULWICH: And this force exists in nature? GREENE: The repulsive side there is actually direct observational support for. KRULWICH: So, it is there, and if you can learn to release this repulsive force theoretically you can hit a ball into the air. (SOUNDBITE OF HITTING)KRULWICH: And instead of coming back down in to Earth. (SOUNDBITE OF WHIRRING)KRULWICH: Instead, the space between the ball and the Earth would suddenly be filled with repulsive energy pushing out, pushing on two sharp elbows, pushing the ball further, and further, and further away from Earth as the space between gets bigger, and bigger, and bigger, so this force what it does, it creates space - so much space that it can turn a little black hole into a universe. (SOUNDBITE OF ORCHESTRAL MUSIC)GREENE: Because the repulsive side of gravity is so powerful that it actually injects energy from gravity itself into the expanding space. So, from that point of view, all you need is the seed, and then gravity takes over and does the rest of the work. KRULWICH: And right now there are scientists at Ben Gurion University in Israel, Yamagata University in Japan, Stanford University in California, who are trying to manufacture first a seed, the mini-black hole, and into that seed one day they hope to place a trigger to release this repulsive force and so create, unbelievable as it may seem, the first man-made universe. MARTIN: So, I don't want to hear anyone complaining about not learning anything from the news ever again. That was NPR's esteemed science correspondent, Robert Krulwich. ALISON STEWART, Host:  You are listening to the Bryant Park Project from NPR News, online all the time at NPR. org/bryantpark. RACHEL MARTIN, Host:  That its operation could unleash a black hole that would basically swallow the entire Earth, and all of us along with it. So, how realistic is that, and how might it happen? Joining us now to explain is David Morgan, physics professor at Eugene Lang College in Manhattan, and friend of the BPP. Welcome back, David. DAVID MORGAN: Thanks. Thanks for having me back. MARTIN: So, first we're going to wind it all the way back and talk a little bit about fundamentals. Explain to us. What is a particle accelerator? MORGAN: A particle accelerator is basically a big machine that physicists build in order to smash particles together at really, really high velocities in order to see how they behave, and what comes flying out. MARTIN: And what do you learn from that? MORGAN: What physicists are trying to learn is something about the nature, the fundamental forces that govern our universe. Forces like the electrical force that holds atoms together, the strong force that holds nuclei together, and figure out how those forces work, and how they behave at various energies. MARTIN: So, those are big questions. These machines, particle accelerators, really are at the foundation of some very big physics questions. MORGAN: Yeah. You're really sort of - we're probing the fundamental structure of matter. MARTIN: Let's talk about what these things look like. I actually visited CERN when I was a college student on a field trip, and it was a little bit overwhelming. I remember hearing some kind of vague explanation about what this big machine did, but it is physically large right, these things? MORGAN: It is physically large. Basically, the Large Hadron Collider is contained in a tunnel that is 17 miles in circumference. So picture something about the size of a subway tunnel in diameter, and picture a round subway line that's about 17 miles around. So, every time the particles go around the accelerator once, they travel about 17 miles. MARTIN: And just to clarify - CERN, there was already a particle accelerator at CERN. This is a new one that has just been built? MORGAN: That's right. MARTIN: Correct? Now, this new very large particle accelerator in Switzerland - we talked a little bit about some of the fears surrounding this thing, but why was it necessary? Why are scientists, why did they decide to build this? MORGAN: Some particle, or some interaction, or some outcome that's unexpected, and there is a long sort of laundry list of things physicists hope to see, but I think many physicists would be even happier if they saw something they didn't expect at all. MARTIN: Now, I know there's a long laundry list of things they expect to see, and I know that most of those would require a lot of explanation, but are there a couple examples on that list? MORGAN: There's another set of particles called supersymmetric particles, which are sort of partners to every particle that we normally encounter around us. So, an electron has a particle called the selectron, and a quark has a partner called the squark, and these are particles that are postulated for various sort-of technical and mathematical reasons that a lot of physicists would like it if they existed, but we've never seen one before in the lab, so. . . MARTIN: So, this accelerator can create the circumstances necessary to hopefully observe it. MORGAN: Which is basically just a lot of energy. By Einstein's equation, E equals MC squared, if you get enough energy together you can create particles of matter. And because these particles of matter are more massive than any we've found before, we need a lot of energy in order to make them. MARTIN: I want to talk about black holes. There is some speculation that this machine might be used to create small black holes. Now, why would someone want to create a black hole, and how would you even do it? MORGAN: Well, a black hole is what you get if you take a whole bunch of matter and energy and put it in a very small space. So, usually when we think about black holes we think about astronomy where a collapsing star can create such a high density that it's so dense that light would be unable to escape from its surface. But I can make anything a black hole if I squished it small enough. I can make you a black hole if I squished you about down to the size of a proton. MARTIN: You could make me a black hole? MORGAN: Well, theoretically. It would require - we would have to stick you in the particle accelerator and get you going really fast to smash you down to that size. But the idea is with this particle accelerator, if we smash together two very small particles at a very high velocity, we are packing a huge amount of energy into a very small space, and that could create a teeny tiny little black hole. STEWART: If one were to make a black hole on the radio, it might sound a little bit like what we are about to hear. NPR's esteemed science correspondent Robert Krulwich actually did a piece on this back in November 2006, in which he spoke with Professor Brian Greene from Columbia University. ROBERT KRULWICH: It would, says Brian, be entirely possible to take, for example, an ordinary common watermelon and put it inside some incredibly powerful squeezing machine that's not yet been invented, that squeezes so fiercely that the watermelon would become denser and denser. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESSURE BUILDING) KRULWICH: And so dense that at some point predicted by Einstein, the watermelon would change states and become. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SPLAT) KRULWICH: A mini black hole. BRIAN GREENE: Oh, yeah. Absolutely. KRULWICH: Now, I know we made the sounds up there, but theoretically this is a real possibility? GREENE: Oh, yeah. Absolutely. KRULWICH: In fact, in the next decade, he says, teams of scientists will try to manufacture mini-black holes. GREENE: And this is not just hypothetical. There is a new machine being built in Geneva, Switzerland, right now, called the Large Hadron Collider, and one of the things that may happen at the Large Hadron Collider is the creation of microscopic black holes in the collision between protons and protons. These will be tiny black holes, but black holes nonetheless. MARTIN: Now, that was part of an NPR piece from November 2006. Fast-forward to today, and physicists are about ready to take that Large Hadron Collider in Geneva for a spin, they are about ready to start using this. And as we said before, there are some people out there who are concerned that this machine could create a mini-black hole, which could basically suck us all into oblivion. How realistic is that, David? MORGAN: So, yes the Large Hadron Collider could make a teeny tiny little black hole, but the energy of this black hole would be about the same mass energy of a mosquito, and it has no more danger of this little black hole sucking up the Earth than a mosquito is in danger of sucking up the entire Earth with its gravitational pull. MARTIN: So, let's talk specifically about the lawsuit, then. How much merit does this suit have? And what are the arguments being put forth? MORGAN: I think it has very little. First of all, it should be noted that this same individual put forward a similar lawsuit to keep them from turning on the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, which is out on Long Island, and has been running for years, and last time I checked, Long Island is still there. MARTIN: So, this is someone who has - he has some fear, let's just say.

We get a lot of letters here at the program and a fair amount of them, well they take us to task for our grammar. Here are a few mistakes that I made on the air that astute listeners caught. I said \"luggery\" instead of luxury, no g there. I also pretentiously and wrongly said \"oh-mage\" rather than homage or homage. June Casagrande also gets a lot of letters. She writes a weekly grammar column that appears in newspapers here in Los Angeles and she's collected some of her favorite language lapses in a new book, it's called \"Mortal Syntax. \" And June Casagrande is here now, welcome to the studios. Ms. JUNE CASAGRANDE (Author, \"Mortal Syntax\"): Hi, thanks for having me. BRAND: Well, you know there are no shortage of grammar books out there so why pile on? Ms. CASAGRANDE: What I hope to do was help readers navigate that big pile. I don't want to add my voice to one of the many self-appointed experts on the subjects. I want to help people navigate the world of experts, who all disagree. BRAND: The first part of your book, though, you have biggies and it says the biggies. Ms. CASAGRANDE: The biggies. BRAND: So there are some mistakes that - well there are clear-cut answers to, right? Ms. CASAGRANDE: There are. The criteria for whether something is wrong or right isn't whether your mother's grandmother's English teacher rapped her on the knuckles for saying it. It is whether it is grammatical according to the rules of English grammar, whether it is consistent with the idiom or whether the dictionary allows it. Those are the sort of three things that tell us right and wrong. In between things like someone will tell you that you can't begin a sentence with the word hopefully. That's something someone was told that's no longer true and isn't necessarily true, and there's no book of rules saying you can't do that.  BRAND: Hopefully you can just get away with that. Ms. CASAGRANDE: You can indeed, according to Webster's New World College Dictionary. Yes. BRAND: Thankfully. OK, let's go through some of these things you have in the first section of the book and one of them, happily for me, was one of my pet peeves and that is saying so fun, as in, that restaurant is so fun. Ms. CASAGRANDE: People will correct that and say it should be so much fun and traditionally that's correct. So fun, it's a question of whether or not fun is both a noun and an adjective or just a noun. So that was so much fun treats it as a noun, that was so fun treats it as an adjective and authorities disagree on whether or not you can, therefore some say you can, therefore you can. BRAND: Oh, no. I'm confused again. So I can say that restaurant was so fun. Ms. CASAGRANDE: I don't recommend it, because it raises the hair on the back of a lot of peoples' necks, but it doesn't mean its wrong. BRAND: OK, what are some of the mistakes that we make all the time that are just wrong? Ms. CASAGRANDE: There's kind of a little catch-22 in what you said, which is if we make them all the time they cease to be wrong. The rulebooks and the style guides and the dictionaries are all based on usage. And so if you and I use something wrongly, often enough, it becomes sanctioned. So, but some examples of things that are still not, that are still frowned upon by the most respected authorities, includes stuff like the word enormity, to mean enormousness to refer to size. Enormity actually refers to great evil. For the most part it refers specifically to something negative and they don't like to hear it used to mean enormousness. A lot of stuff like that. BRAND: OK what about, this is a common mistake people make all the time. Lay and lie. Ms. CASAGRANDE: There is not so much gray area on this one. The style experts all say let's respect this distinction. Lie is an intransitive verb - it does not require an object. Lay is a transitive verb that requires an object. So it's very easy. I lie down. I lie on the bed, but you lay something else on the bed. You lay the book on the bed. Very simple until you take note of the fact that the past tense of lie happens to be lay. That's where people just sort of cash it in, they give up and it's hard to blame them. But today I lie on the bed, yesterday I lay on the bed. BRAND: Right, OK. Got it. All right, so what about I feel good versus I feel well. Ms. CASAGRANDE: Well is the word traditionally used to describe a state of good health. However, if you open Webster's New World College Dictionary the very last definition of good is in good health, so technically, if you want to get technical you can say I feel good. BRAND: People say that all the time. How are you? I'm good. Ms. CASAGRANDE: They do. And that's defensible as a casualism as some experts would call it. If your minding your p's and q's stick with well because that's traditionally more accepted. BRAND: Is there something that even though is commonly used you just cant get your head around and you just can't abide. Ms. CASAGRANDE: Things that make me cringe personally? Not a big fan of the pronunciation \"nuc-u-lur. \" Don't like that. There are a number of things that make me cringe a little but I think I'm a cringer by nature. I think I'm one of those people that deep down wants to be persnickety and kind of mean about it. And that's kind of no way to live, because if you spend too much time focusing on other peoples errors, number one you'll find yourself wrong a lot. Number two you'll find yourself pretty miserable. BRAND: OK, listen up listeners, who are poised with pen in hand. All right, one thing though I feel very persnickety about and that is the increasing use of nouns for verbs and vice versa. Ms. CASAGRANDE: Beer me? Like that? BRAND: Exactly. Or something like how does that impact you? Ms. CASAGRANDE: I haven't checked that one lately, but I think that usage has become officially sanctioned by at least some dictionaries.  BRAND: That kills me. Ms. CASAGRANDE: I like beer me, though. BRAND: So, something that seems to be right but grammarians would probably shudder is ending sentences with prepositions. Ms. CASAGRANDE: There's no such rule that says you can't do it. It's a very popular myth that there is a rule. An example is, who are you going to movies with? With is the preposition - there it is hanging at the end of a sentence. There is no rule against that. However it's a little awkward at times and it's somewhat of a violation of what a preposition is supposed to do, which is they always take objects, so I'm going with her, her is the object of that preposition. When you put it at the end of a sentence it sort of causes it to break ranks from standard preposition form because it no longer has its object there right after it. BRAND: So what would you say? Ms. CASAGRANDE: I would put the preposition at the end of a sentence. A lot of people think grammar is a list of prohibitions. It's just uptight mean-spirited no you can't, and what I try to dispel is that image of grammar. Because what it really is, is a fascinating study of how we assemble words to create meaning. The English language is such a fun toy that we can play with and if we take that spirit toward it, it just makes it fun and useful and a very effective tool.

I'm Robert Siegel. MICHELE NORRIS, host: And I'm Michele Norris. In Oregon, archaeologists have found something they say is very exciting \u2014 14,000-year-old fossilized excrement. Now, stay with me here. These coprolites, as they're called by the experts, are remarkable for several reasons. For one thing, they're older than most artifacts left by the earliest Americans. For another, they contain DNA, and that gives scientists a rare opportunity to learn about the people who left them behind. NPR's Christopher Joyce reports. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: Archaeologists knew about Oregon's Paisley Caves back in the late 1930s. They were shallow and were carved into a hillside by a prehistoric lake. Inside, animal bones and stone tools and other signs that humans camped or lived there. But in 2002, a team dug deeper and found what you might call pay dirt. Dr. DENNIS JENKINS (Archaeologist, University of Oregon): At the bottom of cave number five, we recovered horse and camel bones and a coprolite, which produced human DNA. JOYCE: Archeologist Dennis Jenkins from the University of Oregon says they eventually found hundreds of coprolites. Six contained human DNA. What amazed him was how old they were \u2014 14,300 years. That radiocarbon date is important because no one has been able to agree on when people came to the Americas. The earliest clear evidence is about 13,000 years ago, but it's mostly stone tools and butchered animal bones. These were left by the Clovis people, traditionally thought of as the first Americans. But nobody had human remains that old, no bones or teeth, says Jenkins. Dr. JENKINS: We finally have human remains or cells, basically molecular evidence for human beings before the Clovis time, and they're basically the individual's signature that they left. JOYCE: And they left it at least 1,000 years before the Clovis people. And the DNA tells more. Eske Willerslev at the University of Copenhagen is the scientist who extracted the DNA. Professor ESKE WILLERSLEV (Director, Centre for Ancient Genetics, University of Copenhagen): Our result shows that the oldest evidence we have to date of human presence in North America is definitely of Native American origin. JOYCE: Native American origin because the coprolite DNA shows certain genetic patterns called haplogroups by geneticists common to present-day Native Americans. These patterns are also found among certain people in eastern Asia. That adds weight to the hypothesis that people first came here across the Bering Sea on a land bridge connecting the two continents. Jenkins says scientists are still teasing out more information from the fossil feces; not surprisingly, for example, what early American cuisine was like. Dr. JENKINS: They certainly ate sage grouse and smaller animals. I think we recovered some chipmunk bones from one of the coprolites. JOYCE: Jenkins says there are residues in the coprolites from types of plants that still can be found near the caves. Dr. JENKINS: So what we have are visitors coming for a short stay, doing some hunting and collecting. So they would have been looking out over a grassy plain, basically with a pretty rich environment, probably a few trees here and there, junipers, and some pine trees possibly, but mostly an open shrub and grassland. JOYCE: There are some puzzles raised by the mix of coprolites in the cave bottom, however. Thomas Dillehay is an archeologist at Vanderbilt University. Dr. THOMAS DILLEHAY (Archaeologist, Vanderbilt University): Some of them did not have human DNA, and others had canine, perhaps fox DNA. So those admixtures are somewhat problematic and need to be resolved in the future. JOYCE: So there's a chance that the coprolites were left by canines, or at least contaminated by them. But Jenkins notes that some of the coprolites contained human hair and human proteins in addition to human DNA. He suggests that if they were left by dogs, then there were dogs that were eating humans, which doesn't change the conclusion that people lived and died there 14,300 years ago. With hundreds more coprolites to examine, genetics expert Eske Willerslev says there's lots they can still find out from the DNA. Prof. WILLERSLEV: We can actually investigate, you know, what was the diversity of the people, the first people entering the Americas, how many different people were there, you know, how big was the population, what was the frequency of females versus males? JOYCE: The research on the Paisley Caves coprolites appears in this week's issue of the journal Science. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

In Oregon, archaeologists have found something they say is very exciting \u2014 14,000-year-old fossilized excrement. Now, stay with me here. These coprolites, as they're called by the experts, are remarkable for several reasons. For one thing, they're older than most artifacts left by the earliest Americans. For another, they contain DNA, and that gives scientists a rare opportunity to learn about the people who left them behind.  NPR's Christopher Joyce reports.  CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: Archaeologists knew about Oregon's Paisley Caves back in the late 1930s. They were shallow and were carved into a hillside by a prehistoric lake. Inside, animal bones and stone tools and other signs that humans camped or lived there. But in 2002, a team dug deeper and found what you might call pay dirt.  Dr. DENNIS JENKINS (Archaeologist, University of Oregon): At the bottom of cave number five, we recovered horse and camel bones and a coprolite, which produced human DNA.

Everyone knows it's dangerous to be a firefighter, but what you may not know is the most common cause of death among firefighters on duty. It's not getting caught in a collapsing building or suffering from smoke inhalation during a daring rescue. It's heart failure. NPR's Marcus Rosenbaum reports on a new kind of alarm clock that a Virginia firehouse hopes will ease the stress on firefighters. MARCUS ROSENBAUM: You're well into the second half of your 24-hour shift when you crawl into your bunk, pull up the covers and close your eyes. Your mind starts to drift. Green rolling hills, bright spring flowers, your wife's smile. (Soundbite of alarm) ROSENBAUM: You sit up straight in bed, your heart is racing. (Soundbite of dispatcher) ROSENBAUM: And then you realize that call was for the tower, the truck with the bucket on the end of a pole. But you're on the rescue unit so you roll over and try to go back to sleep. And just as you're nodding off. . . (Soundbite of alarm) ROSENBAUM: You sit up again with your heart pounding, but this one's not for you, either. There's got to be a better way. Well, there is. Mr. BRIAN SPRING(ph) (Firehouse Captain, Arlington County): Each of us has a bunkroom that we sleep in and you have a module next to your bed. ROSENBAUM: Brian Spring is a captain in the Arlington County Fire Department, which has installed a more discriminating system manufactured by a California company called Westnet. Mr. SPRING: When you go to bed at night, you punch into the module what unit you are on and that way, say if the tower gets a call but the rescue doesn't, only the bunk rooms that are programmed for the tower will go off and the rest of the people in the station, they don't get woke up. ROSENBAUM: That means you're only awakened a third of the times that you were under the old system. And the new alarm is kinder and gentler too. First, the light comes on, not the harsh glare of the overheads, but a softer effect from the box at the head of your bed. Then a tone. (Soundbite of tone) ROSENBAUM: Also not as jarring, and instructions about the emergency. Carl Oldberg(ph) is a firefighter in Arlington's Fire Station Number Four. Mr. CARL OLDBERG (Firefighter, Arlington): The light kind of brings you up and then about the time you kind of just sitting up and then you're getting the audio telling you what you've got. (Soundbite of alarm) Announcer: Truck rescue, building collapse. Mr. OLDBERG: The lights are on, you know you've got a call coming, but it's not blasting you. ROSENBAUM: All of the firefighters I spoke with at that Arlington station said they like the new system better. At a firehouse in nearby Fairfax City, everyone I spoke with wanted it. Battalion Chief Adrian Monday(ph) says being a firefighter is like having a new baby. You know, when you lie down to sleep it's not if you're going to be awaked, but when. Mr. ADRIAN MONDAY (Battalion Chief, Fairfax City): We're already in a not as deep a sleep state as the normal person is, and then you get jolted by that loud noise. Over a long period of time and over a career, that is definitely having an effect on your health. ROSENBAUM: Patrick Morrison of the International Association of Firefighters agrees. Mr. PATRICK MORRISON (Director of Health and Safety, International Association of Firefighters): Stress is an accumulative item, it's not a one time. If you can do this and replace that, you're reducing that accumulative effect on those firefighters. ROSENBAUM: One big problem is that retrofitting firehouses isn't cheap. Chief Monday says it would cost 50 to 75,000 dollars for a house in Fairfax City. But Patrick Morrison says it's worth every penny, even to the taxpayers. Mr. MORRISON: This is prevention. People don't want to spend a lot of money for prevention programs, but what is the cost of one firefighter dying in that municipality? That cost alone, of just one firefighter that we could reduce, could pay for the whole system. ROSENBAUM: Maybe. Michael Williams is the chief medical officer of the District of Columbia's Fire and Emergency Medical Services. He says it's true that firefighters are more likely to die of heart problems than others, and it's true that the heart problem that is most  likely to kill them is cardiac arrest, suddenly dropping dead. Which often  is related to stress, not lifestyle issues like smoking and lack of exercise, but he says that doesn't mean that reducing stress this way is worth the cost. Dr. MICHAEL WILLIAMS (Chief Medical Officer, District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services): I don't think we have concrete evidence that reducing it changes outcomes. ROSENBAUM: Doctor Williams suggests focusing on the health of firefighters who are notorious for not taking care of their bodies as well as they should. Dr. WILLIAMS: You cut down the smoking that goes on in firehouses, we'd probably have a much bigger impact on the workforce, readiness in the workforce health, than if we are trying to focus so much on trying to eliminate the adrenaline because to a degree, firefighters, trauma surgeons, combat warriors, are adrenaline junkies. We thrive on that and I include myself in that. We seek out the adrenaline rush. ROSENBAUM: Would Doctor Williams like to be awakened more gently by an alarm like Arlington's? Sure, he says. He just hasn't seen any scientific evidence to convince him it would improve his health in the long run. Marcus Rosenbuam, NPR News, Washington.  MADELEINE BRAND: Back now with Day to Day.

I'm Madeleine Brand. ALEX CHADWICK, host: I'm Alex Chadwick. Coming up, when you're a firefighter, it's tough to get a good night's sleep.  All those clanging alarm bells, they are actually bad for your health. Coming up, we're going to visit a firehouse that's reducing stress with a more soothing alarm. BRAND: First, the experts are still split on whether or not we are actually in a recession right now. At least one economist though, right now, says a key tipping point could be a dispute about big, greasy, hunks of steal and those are truck axles. Workers at the auto parts company American Axle are in the fifth week of their strike. It involves only about 36 hundred workers, but the ripple effect from their actions could have a huge impact on the U. S. economy. Dustin Dwyer of Michigan Radio reports. DUSTIN DWYER: The strike was called one minute past midnight on February 26th. Seven hours later, Darren Molten(ph) arrived for his first shift on the picket line. Mr. DARREN MOLTEN (Striker, American Axle): It was very cold that  morning, but everybody was pretty kicked up. DWYER: Molten carries his picket sign outside the plant three garage at American Axle's massive Detroit manufacturing complex. Nearby, a small fire burns inside a steel barrel. Mr. MOLTEN: The first couple weeks, you know, the enthusiasm was very high, morale is getting a little slower, you know, but everybody knows how important it is. DWYER: It is important because reports are that American Axle executives want to slash workers' pay, almost in half. They are also looking to cut benefits. That's because American Axle says when you combine the cost of both wages and benefits, the average UAW member at the company makes a whopping 73 dollars an hour. The union contests that number, but executives say other auto parts companies, such as the bankrupted Dana Corporation, got concessions in the past year and American Axle should, too. So far, both sides have made little progress toward an agreement, so life on the picket line continues. (Soundbite of picket line) Strikers: We are the Union. Unidentified Man: The mighty, mighty Union. Strikers: The mighty, mighty Union. DWYER: Last week, hundreds of people showed up to march from the local union hall to the American Axle headquarters, up the street. American Axle workers have been getting 200 dollars per week in strike pay from the union. Worker Eric Webb(ph) says, it doesn't go very far. Mr. ERIC WEBB (Striker, American Axle): By the time you get 200 dollars, if you have to go buy groceries and gas, then it's hard. It's very hard. DWYER: And as much as American Axle workers who've been affected, about 80 percent of American Axle parts go to General Motors. Because those parts are no longer being built, GM has been forced to stop production at 30 of its plants so far. GM has also temporarily laid off more than 40,000 workers. Sean McAlinden of the Center of Automotive Research said the strike could lead to another 40,000 layoffs before it's over. Dr. SEAN MCALINDEN (Chief Economist and Vice President of Research, Center of Automotive Research): It's going to affect the national economy. It's going to raise the unemployment rate in Michigan and the United States and it's - really has a big affect. DWYER: So far, GM hasn't been hurt too badly, because the strike has mostly shut down truck production and GM already had too many trucks sitting on dealer's lots. But this week, the company was forced to shut its first car plant because of the strike and with the GM plants down, dozen of other companies, like those making seats or dashboards components, are also losing business. The economic forecasting firm, Global Insight, predicts that the American Axle strike will bring down the nation's gross domestic product by three-tenths of a percent in the first quarter. That might not sound like a whole lot, but the GDP was only up six-tenths of a percent in the quarter before. Dr. BRIAN BETHUNE (Chief U. S. Financial Economist, Global Insight): In this environment, where we don't have a lot of growth, the third of a percentage point is quite significant. DWYER: Brian Bethune is the Chief U. S. Financial Economist for Global Insight. He says that three-tenths of a percentage point drop in the GDP, it could be enough to officially tip the U. S. into recession. As the strike continues, a spokeswoman for American Axle says company executives are still talking with the union, though progress is slow. For NPR News, I'm Dustin Dwyer in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

With no way to tell who she was or where she was from, she was buried in an unmarked grave and all but forgotten. Last week, the 14-year-old cold case was finally solved. The body in the grave, 17-year-old Heather Ann Schmoll, a Minnesota girl who was last heard from New Year's Day '94. RACHEL MARTIN, Host: According to federal law enforcement reports, there are more than 40,000 Jane, John, and Baby Does waiting to be identified. Joining us now to explain just what these so-called \"advocates for the dead\" do is Todd Matthews. He's a volunteer and the media director of the Doe Network, International Center for Unidentified and Missing Persons. Hi, Todd. TODD MATTHEWS: Hi. Good morning, ladies. MARTIN: Thanks for being here. So, you call the work that the Doe Network does \"technicriminology. \" Walk us through how the network handles a case like that of Heather Ann Schmoll, someone who's been missing and unidentified for such a long time. MATTHEWS: You know, it's almost - it seems difficult but it's really very, very simple. We basically get case files from law enforcement, from their website, through their direct submissions, just present them to the public, and often enough the public or law enforcement will benefit from having that information available, and will contact us with possible matches. MARTIN: So, you're not actually solving crimes usually. You're just putting information out there that other people can make the connections? MATTHEWS: Gathering the data, but often, enough some of our very own members actually make the connection in the process of gathering data. MARTIN: Now, your website details several hundreds of unidentified victims and thousands of unexplained disappearances from all over, really, North America, Europe and Australia. How do you originally get that data? How is it culled? MATTHEWS: A lot of this data is gathered through the news media, and then we have to validate it through local law enforcement and that's not very easy. That's the biggest challenge I think we have is gathering and validating the data. So, we're looking at data that has come out in the news media, but then we have to turn around and re-look at it and make sure it's still current, and still actually an open case. MARTIN: So, you do the research from media reports, you publish all that information through the network, and you eventually try to make a match. What's your success rate, then? MATTHEWS: We have over 40-plus solves, and that's direct and indirect, you know, either ourselves doing it or coming from the public or law enforcement using the site. But there are so many hours that go into that. I like to think it's a success, but you know, if you had to fund this, if this was a funded law enforcement organization, I don't think it would be possible to create that type of funding. MARTIN: Because it's just too time consuming? MATTHEWS: Oh, yeah. I mean, if you knew the thousands of hours, you know, people like me spending 40 to 60 hours a week after they come home from their day job doing this, you know, how would a government pay people to do this? There's no way, you know. You have to tap into the volunteer nature of people. MARTIN: Well, let's talk a little bit about that. Who are these people, yourself included? I mean, that's a lot of time, 40 to 60 hours a week outside of a day job? Who are the volunteers of the Doe Network? MATTHEWS: It's easier to get through so you're not submitting a tip blind. And, you know, we have over 500 fairly active members, but the core team is exactly what you see on the website. We'll get a lot of people that will want to volunteer but often you have to screen. There's so much of a screening process that you have to go through for something like this. You don't want to get the wrong person and put them out there as a potential representative of your organization. MARTIN: Well, let's talk a little bit about that. What are you trying to avoid in a volunteer? MATTHEWS: And it does say that it's closed on the website, but you can contact our membership coordinator and the directions are on the page, and it's just going to take time. We add people as we need people and, you know, you're looking for that diamond in the rough, you know? You're looking for that person that's the right person. And I think this work chooses you rather than you choosing it. MARTIN: Now, did you get any pushback from law enforcement officials now? You talk about a collaborative spirit, but at the beginning, I imagine, the FBI or police would say, listen, people, you're not professionals. MATTHEWS: Well, I think you might have read the term \"Doe-Nuts\" in some publications. I think it was, you know, an up-and-coming group, you know, what could we do? You know, that, you know, it happens a lot. You see a lot of little organizations that pop up and chat groups and things that can be annoying to law enforcement. I've been annoyed by massive emails that come in from people that think they have these theories, and you know, we were no more than that ourselves at the time. But, you know, in time. . . MARTIN: Now, Todd, you were involved - your first foray into this whole thing was a case known as \"Tent Girl,\" an unidentified woman whose body was found in 1968, and you really became so involved with this. What is it about this work that is so important to you? What keeps driving you to do this? MATTHEWS: It's the people. You know, that one case - I wish the Doe Network existed then. I might have had somebody to go to and I wouldn't have had such - you know, it caused a lot of emotional problems for me, a lot of problems in my relationship with my wife, but if I had a group of people that I could have worked with, then it would have been a lot easier. I was alone at the time. MARTIN: And it caused problems within your own family, just because of how involved you were? MATTHEWS: That case is my sole focus. It wasn't that I was neglecting my family, but I think they felt like maybe I was because I was so involved in it. Three hundred dollar phone bills when you're making minimum wage, how can you explain that? MARTIN: And so why do you do it? MATTHEWS: We get personally involved every day, don't get me wrong, but I don't want it to ever take my life over. I don't want to get to that spot again where you have to be on top of everything constantly. Now, I can step back and affect the cause as a whole. MARTIN: And help a lot of families in the process put names to these missing people. Hey, Todd Mathews, volunteer media director of the Doe Network, thank you so much for sharing your story and your work. We really appreciate it. MATTHEWS: Thank you for having me. ALISON STEWART, Host:  Back in February of 1994, the body of an unidentified teenage girl was found in the middle of a field off a Florida highway. With no way to tell who she was or where she was from, she was buried in an unmarked grave and all but forgotten. Last week, the 14-year-old cold case was finally solved. The body in the grave, 17-year-old Heather Ann Schmoll, a Minnesota girl who was last heard from New Year's Day '94. RACHEL MARTIN, Host:  According to federal law enforcement reports, there are more than 40,000 Jane, John, and Baby Does waiting to be identified. Joining us now to explain just what these so-called \"advocates for the dead\" do is Todd Matthews. He's a volunteer and the media director of the Doe Network, International Center for Unidentified and Missing Persons. Hi, Todd. TODD MATTHEWS: Hi. Good morning, ladies. MARTIN: Thanks for being here. So, you call the work that the Doe Network does \"technicriminology. \" Walk us through how the network handles a case like that of Heather Ann Schmoll, someone who's been missing and unidentified for such a long time. MATTHEWS: You know, it's almost - it seems difficult but it's really very, very simple. We basically get case files from law enforcement, from their website, through their direct submissions, just present them to the public, and often enough the public or law enforcement will benefit from having that information available, and will contact us with possible matches. MARTIN: So, you're not actually solving crimes usually. You're just putting information out there that other people can make the connections? MATTHEWS: Gathering the data, but often, enough some of our very own members actually make the connection in the process of gathering data. MARTIN: Now, your website details several hundreds of unidentified victims and thousands of unexplained disappearances from all over, really, North America, Europe and Australia. How do you originally get that data? How is it culled? MATTHEWS: A lot of this data is gathered through the news media, and then we have to validate it through local law enforcement and that's not very easy. That's the biggest challenge I think we have is gathering and validating the data. So, we're looking at data that has come out in the news media, but then we have to turn around and re-look at it and make sure it's still current, and still actually an open case. MARTIN: So, you do the research from media reports, you publish all that information through the network, and you eventually try to make a match. What's your success rate, then?

KLEFFEL:  Wagner says, that in the course of studying high-impact, sub-atomic collisions microscopic black holes could be created.  CERN has said that they have already done an independent safety study.  That there is no conceivable risk of a doomsday scenario, and that in nature, it's routine for particles to collide with much higher energy than the LHC could ever produce.

Well, female octopuses maybe they feel your pain.  A new UC Berkley on octopus mating habits has some surprising findings. Christine Huffard is the lead author of that study. She observed the octopuses' behavior firsthand while conducting research in Indonesia. And she joins us now from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. Thanks for joining us.  Dr. CHRISTINE HUFFARD (Lead Author, UC Berkeley Study; Postdoctoral Fellow, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute): Thank you for having me.  BRAND: Well, I'll tell you what piqued our interest. We read the press release that UC Berkeley sent out, and in the first paragraph it said that your research found at least one species of octopus, quote, \"engages in such sophisticated lovemaking tactics as flirting, passionate hand-holding and keeping rivals at arms length. \" Now, what did you observe? Dr. HUFFARD: Flirting really is - it's a type of courtship. The hand-holding is definitely a bit of a stretch, but it does look like it, because when we look at the two individuals mating, we can see that there's one big long arm stretched in between them, and that looks like they might be holding hands.  But what that actually is is the male's specialized mating arm. One of his eight arms has a groove along the back that's used to pass sperm packets from his body to the female. And so, by little waves of muscle action, almost like peristalsis in our guts, the little sperm packets are passed from the base of the arm all the way to the tip into the female.  BRAND: Now, you also observed male octopuses exhibiting what we might like to call \"macho\" behavior. Dr. HUFFARD: Oh, yeah. There's no doubt that males fight over females. They fight very intensely. We saw them strangling each other - so, actually cutting off the flow of water over each others' gills. We saw them wrestling to the ground and rolling around on the bottom of the sea floor.  These octopuses actually are able to drop their arms off the way a lizard does its tail. And what we found most surprising was that males have to - they have a trade-off. They can either be really choosy and find something that's really valuable and stick with it and keep at it, or they can spend their time actually looking for lots and lots of mates. So, these males. . . BRAND: So, it's like being monogamous or playing the field?  Dr. HUFFARD: Right. They will definitely spend most of their time with a big female. Once they find her, they'll stay with her as long as they can, and they don't go out seeking other females. But if smaller females happen to come across their path, they certainly don't turn down the chance to mate.  (Soundbite of laughter) BRAND: They're not stupid after all. Dr. HUFFARD: But really - exactly.  BRAND: What I also was interested in, in reading about your study, were these so-called \"sneaker males. \" They moved in on unsuspecting conquests by masquerading as females.  Dr. HUFFARD: It seems that these octopuses are able to tell each other's sex, so, whether they're male or female, by the color patterns that they're showing. So, the sneaker males, in order to mate, they actually showed the more female-typical color, so, the more camouflaged coloring, rather than showing off the male-typical coloring.  And that allowed them to mate with females right in front of the males. But they also did other behaviors like hiding behind rocks and waiting for the big male to go away, and they were really just avoiding an aggression any way they could. . . BRAND: Didn't want to lose an arm over it. Dr. HUFFARD: Exactly. (Soundbite of laughter) BRAND: Yeah. Why is this so surprising? Because a lot of animals exhibit these aggressive tendencies when it comes to mating. What were you surprised by when you observed the octopuses? Dr. HUFFARD: So many different animals fight over mates, but we were not expecting to see them in octopuses. People had generally thought that octopuses were solitary, and then after mating, it was just assumed that they went about their daily lives separately. It was also assumed that males didn't compete for females and this really just turned those ideas upside down.  BRAND: Christine Huffard, Thanks for joining us. Dr. HUFFARD: Thank you so much.

More tests than ever before are becoming available to consumers. Sometimes, they come directly to you without a doctor being involved. And in addition to the tests that screened for just one or two conditions, some companies are offering whole genome scans, detailing risks for a number of genetic conditions. Now, is this a good idea? Some experts are saying no, especially the do-it-yourself tests that leave you with sometimes confusing results, but nobody to help you make sense of those results. Plus, there's no way to know whether a special test is accurate, one particular test, how many tests, there are different makers, which one should I take since many of them are not regulated the way, let's say, prescription drugs are. So, we're going to be talking about this growing world of home genetic testing, what it promises to do, what it's delivered on so far. We'll talk about ideas about how to do it correctly, what safeguards need to be in place to protect consumers, how and when if should you get your doctor, your physician involved. What kind of counseling should you do? If you've got some ideas you'd like to share with us, please. Our number: 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK. Also, you can surf over to our Web site where you can click on the \"Second Life\" icon, and get to taking into talk with some avatars and leave us questions that way. Let me introduce my guests. Kathy Hudson is the director of the Genetics and Public Policy Center of Johns Hopkins University. She joins us today from her office. Welcome back to the program, Dr. Hudson. Dr. KATHY HUDSON (Director, Genetics and Public Policy Center of Johns Hopkins University): Thanks. Glad to be here. CONAN: You're welcome. Dr. Kenneth Offit is chief of the Clinical Genetic Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center here in New York. He joins us by phone from his office. Welcome back to the program, Dr. Offit. Dr. KENNETH OFFIT (Chief of Clinical Genetic Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center): Ira, nice to talk with you again. FLATOW: Let me begin with - let me throw this out, this cafeteria question to both of you. Is this - I mentioned it's not a new problem. Why is it becoming such a bigger problem? Is it because more and more of these tests are coming online? Dr. OFFIT: Well\u2026 FLATOW: Dr. Offit, go ahead. Dr. OFFIT: Yeah, I know, I think that clearly, the markets here are coming into play, and we've seen in the last year several commercial entities come into existence - commercial for-profit entities that are marketing their services to the consumer directly, right directly to you and your home, providing a test that can be done with a little bit of a swab from your mouth, and then to give you predictive information about your health, and in some cases, about everything from what food you should eat to what medicines you should take. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. OFFIT: So, this is a new development. FLATOW: And what's wrong with that? What's wrong with me taking one of these genetic tests? I - you know, people are used to taking, you know, pregnancy tests, right - the sort of a new-age thing? Why should I be fearful of taking any of these genetic tests? Dr. HUDSON: One of the reasons is that in the case of pregnancy test, those tests are actually reviewed and validated by the Food and Drug Administration before they are allowed to be sold over-the-counter now to consumers. And that's been a great thing. So I think with genetic tests as well, if the tests are accurate, if they're reliable, if the claims that are made about those tests, you know, are supported by the evidence, then there may be - some of these tests may be of great benefit when offered directly to consumers. For example, if there were genetic tests that would tell me whether or not an over-the-counter drug would work better or not so well or have an adverse drug reaction in me, then it seems logical that I should be able to get that test directly. Currently, there's no assurance that tests are accurate and reliable and that the claims are valid, and thus there's a good reason to be cautious. FLATOW: Why are there no watchdogs on it? Dr. HUDSON: You know, part of the reason is because this is an - a really rapidly growing new field. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. HUDSON: The regulations that do exist are of fairly low bar, where the laboratory has to show that it - you know, its refrigerator is running and it's keeping its counters clean, but it doesn't actually have to show that it can get the right answer for the test, nor does it need to show that that test result has any clinical or health-related significance. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. HUDSON: And then, finally, there is nobody who's paying close attention to whether or not the scientific evidence comports with the claims that are being made. So, there's opportunities for consumers both for their health to be impacted as well as\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Dr. HUDSON: \u2026their pocketbook. FLATOW: Ken Offit, let me just paraphrase a commercial that we see on a tax time. If you have troubles about your tax questions and you got - and you're doing a tax program out of a box, and one of the persons in the commercial says, well, ask the box for help, you know, if you're confused about what's happening. I would imagine the same thing is happening with these tests, that you take them home and there's no one to talk to about. Dr. OFFIT: Well, you know, what we're beginning to see here at Sloan-Kettering, where we have the clinics all week-long for doing what we call conventional genetic testing for these genes associated with real cancer risks, we're now beginning to see, just as you say, Ira, folks coming in with some of these reports, and they're saying, well, what do I make of this? Is this 21. 2 risk for breast cancer? How does that compare to the 40 times risk that the - you know, you guys are talking about? And what we're doing is we're kind of doing retroactively, we're doing the, what they call it, counseling, we're doing basically damage control in some cases because the information that's coming from these tests is coming, as Kathy says, essentially, in a not standardized or regulated way. So, their version of coming - consulting the box is now often coming back to us. FLATOW: Can physicians do these tests and have the laboratories that they know they - to depend on? Dr. HUDSON: You know, there's a number of tests that have been out there in the marketplace for a considerable period of time and have been well validated. And you know, the review of that evidence shows that that those tests are valid and have great clinical utility. They're beneficial for patients. And so those tests do exist. What we're seeing now in part as new results of the fruits of the human genome project, and in combination with a low barrier to market entry is that sort of - people are offering tests before they're quite ready. Dr. OFFIT: Ira, you know, we spoke about this on your show a couple of weeks ago in the context of the discovery we made of a breast cancer marker that increased risk 1. 2 times, and we spent time for those of your listeners who heard, to distinguish that type of research test from the clinical tests that I give in my clinic, where we're talking about a 40 times risk. And as Kathy said, we now spent a decade bringing in genetics to the practice of preventive medicine. We're very proud of what we have accomplished so far. We now do tests in my field for cancers of the colon, of the breast, of the ovaries, and we're giving individuals this information, they're taking preventive action, and some cases, preventive surgeries. We now have the first evidence that lives have been saved. This is a very different, though, type of genetic testing, than this genomic testing, this whole genome testing that you refer to, where the risks by and large never get more than that 1. 2 to 1. 3. And keeping these numbers in mind is not obvious, is not easy, but that's ultimately what we're talking about here. How do you really handle that level of risk? Is that going to be useful in fashioning a preventive strategy? Those are research questions. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. HUDSON: It will also be interesting, Ken, to see what happens, you know, as more and more consumers are using these tests and showing up in your office, and other doctor's offices, and perhaps requesting additional screening, additional counseling, and what kind of burden that's going to place on the healthcare system for tests and surveillance that would otherwise not be necessary. Dr. OFFIT: So Kathy is referring to here and we should just call it what it is. What we're talking about here is my concern as a physician and her concern as a leader in policy about, really, we're talking about safety here. We're talking about consumer safety. And safety in this area does come into play two ways: by giving somebody a false warning which can lead to an unnecessary test, which is what Kathy just mentioned, and, you know, tests as we know - if you're a woman having a biopsy, if you're a man having a prostate biopsy, if you've just had a colonoscopy, you know what\u2026 FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. OFFIT: \u2026I'm talking about. You know, these are medical procedures. These are interventions that one goes to that have some risk, and also, or, you know, some cost. On the other hand, there's the safety concern about false reassurance. And I've been reading some of these, these articles about individuals having these tests and leaving incredibly reassured, they pay their thousand dollars, but I'm very worried that someone actually talked to these individuals about their family history, and did somebody say to them, you know, these are the known factors that have been excluded. FLATOW: Now, let's go the phone to Chris(ph) in Syracuse. Hi, Chris. CHRIS (Caller): Hi. Hey, thanks for you and the rest of NPR being there, by the way. My comment is just that, you know, this research type of stuff is valuable information, and in the information age, we should let it be free, and we should be able to adapt, you know, to being able to use it. So, you know, whatever it takes to have people, you know, have access to this would be important, like disclaimering it, making sure that, you know, as someones getting a test - they are given a statement that, you know, you should consult your doctor. But, you know, it helps people in ways that they might have already been thinking about, you know, like, if they have other symptoms or something like that, or their family history. They can be, you know, getting a test then - and help themselves be more prepared. FLATOW: So you'd go and ask your doctor if you're interested, later on, you're saying\u2026 CHRIS: Oh, yeah, I mean\u2026 FLATOW: \u2026and don't deny me the information. I'm an adult, I know how to use it, or I'll find a way to use it correctly. CHRIS: Yeah, and I mean, sure, there would be some negatives, you know? Some people wouldn't have adapted to that but, I think, the lesson of the information age is that we can take this power - it's a natural power, you know, the world is based on information. Life itself is based on information. And, you know\u2026 FLATOW: All right, all right\u2026 CHRIS: \u2026be careful of it. And then\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. Let me get a reaction, it's good point. Kathy, how would you answer that? Dr. HUDSON: Well, I agree that for much of the genetic tests that will become available, we want to have consumers and research participants have access to that information. But they should also know how certain that information is. They should have access to what are the performance characteristics of the tests, what's the evidence that supports it. And right now, that information is not particularly obvious for some of the companies that are offering tests, particularly directly to consumers. You don't know what the variance is that's being tested for. You don't know what the - you know, how well that test performs. You don't how many false negatives are - there are. So there - I think, information is good as long as it's complete and accurate. FLATOW: Right. Dr. HUDSON: False information is a bad thing. FLATOW: So both of you in here, you're not arguing against the testing. You're arguing for some regulation and standardization. Dr. OFFIT: Well, yeah. I don't think that either one of us would disagree with the notion that five, maybe, 10 years from now, this testing will be absolutely universal. I envision that you'll get this in your doctor's office and it'll be cheap and available and accessible. I think the comparison of the information - I think of it like, you know, my kid writing a term paper and going on the Internet. They're teaching them in school and, you know, doing the proverbial Google search. A lot of what you see on the Internet, which is unvetted and unregulated - it's information, but is it true information? And what we would like to think about is this is sort of - you know, your life is your term paper, and if you're going to take a preventive medical intervention - and people act on this information; all of our studies have shown that people do take action - you want that information to be vetted and to be accurate, scientifically accurate information. There's a concern about widespread dissemination of this information before then. FLATOW: We're talking about genetic testing this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow with Ken Offit and Kathy Hudson. In a short period of time, I mean, I would almost - it looks at - looks to me, it's like where we are with, you know, ordering drugs on the Internet. You need to pig in a poke whether you're going to get the prescription from some unknown drug company. Would that be a fair comparison, Kathy? Dr. HUDSON: Not quite because even the drugs that are being sold over the Internet are drugs where they have been reviewed or approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and where the FDA has a big stick with which to bop, companies who make false and misleading claims about those drugs, whether they use that, you know, as well as they could is questionable. But they have that ability. Right now, there's sort of nobody watching over whether or not these tests are proven before they enter the market, and whether or not the statements that are made about the companies who are selling them have any support behind them at all. FLATOW: One other question from a number of people in \"Second Life\" is a question about needing laws to protect people from job discrimination based on these tests or denial of health insurance or the information from these tests being leaked out, you know? Dr. HUDSON: You know, it's - we have had legislation pending in the U. S. Congress for a decade now, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. And currently, there's a hold by a particular senator on that legislation moving through the Senate. And the House has passed it, the Senate has passed it in previous sessions, and so we await that passage\u2026 FLATOW: Who's got the hold on it? Dr. HUDSON: Senator Coburn. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And so, you think that this could be settled with the right kind of legislation? Dr. HUDSON: Absolutely. The concern about health insurance and employment discrimination could be solved. The concern about the safety and accuracy of the tests require some real leadership from the Department of Health and Human Services here. Dr. OFFIT: But to follow, Ira, you know, even in this, you know, unprotected situation as it were that we have now without the federal legislation, We've been testing here at Sloan-Kettering for the past decade thousands, I think, we're now coming up to 10,000 families. And we've got thousands of individuals with these very risk-associated genetic markers. And the insurance industry - the ones who we're the most worried about, you know, Kathy and I and others 10 years ago has - they've actually gone the other way. They're paying for all of this testing. They're not getting the results of the testing. They're paying for surgeries in my clinic, and they've - I, evidently, very strongly made this decision that this ounce of prevention is a good idea, and that they should be frankly applauded for that. And that's put us in a situation where I absolutely feel that federal legislation is very important. But, fortunately, there is no clear and present risk in the cancer genetic field for any of this information having - being abused. At least it has not been to date. Dr. HUDSON: And do you have a law in New York that prevents it being used in the health insurance sector? And that may be part reason why\u2026 Dr. OFFIT: That's interesting, actually. New York, we have very strict confidentiality laws, stricter than most. And in New York, we actually don't have a strong anti-discrimination law as exists, for example, in New Jersey. So even in the absence of that, I think this is a fundamental decision that the health insurance industry has made certainly in the realm of the common cancers that they just simply are not going there. And I don't foresee this as being a major risk for common cancer testing. But that's not to say as, I think, a Times reporter said that this is not in the public conscious mind. People do think there's an - in a very, kind of, ironic and unfortunate way perhaps, that information may send people to these direct consumer companies because they are afraid of something that may actually not be on the great radar screen of dangers. FLATOW: All right. Let me - we've run out of time. I'd like to thank both of you, Kathy Hudson, director of the Genetics and Public Policy Center at Johns Hopkins University in Washington; Ken Offit, chief of the Clinical Genetic Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center here in New York. Thank you both for taking time to be with us today and good luck to you. Dr. HUDSON: You're welcome. FLATOW: You're welcome. Dr. OFFIT: Thanks. FLATOW: We're going to take a short break and when we come back, we're going to talk about - you maybe you've heard that sound recording, the French sound recording that predates Thomas Edison but maybe don't know very much about the inventor who did it. Interesting section of history and time - we'll come back and talk right about it. Stay with us. I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  IRA FLATOW, host:  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  A bit later in the hour, the oldest recorded song and the history of the French inventor who did it. But up next, if you could take a test that would tell you whether you carry genes that predispose you to cancer, diabetes, age-related blindness, would you?  More tests than ever before are becoming available to consumers. Sometimes, they come directly to you without a doctor being involved. And in addition to the tests that screened for just one or two conditions, some companies are offering whole genome scans, detailing risks for a number of genetic conditions. Now, is this a good idea?  Some experts are saying no, especially the do-it-yourself tests that leave you with sometimes confusing results, but nobody to help you make sense of those results. Plus, there's no way to know whether a special test is accurate, one particular test, how many tests, there are different makers, which one should I take since many of them are not regulated the way, let's say, prescription drugs are.

FLATOW: One other question from a number of people in \"Second Life\" is a question about needing laws to protect people from job discrimination based on these tests or denial of health insurance or the information from these tests being leaked out, you know?  Dr. HUDSON: You know, it's - we have had legislation pending in the U. S. Congress for a decade now, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. And currently, there's a hold by a particular senator on that legislation moving through the Senate. And the House has passed it, the Senate has passed it in previous sessions, and so we await that passage\u2026  FLATOW: Who's got the hold on it?  Dr. HUDSON: Senator Coburn.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And so, you think that this could be settled with the right kind of legislation?  Dr. HUDSON: Absolutely. The concern about health insurance and employment discrimination could be solved. The concern about the safety and accuracy of the tests require some real leadership from the Department of Health and Human Services here.  Dr. OFFIT: But to follow, Ira, you know, even in this, you know, unprotected situation as it were that we have now without the federal legislation, We've been testing here at Sloan-Kettering for the past decade thousands, I think, we're now coming up to 10,000 families. And we've got thousands of individuals with these very risk-associated genetic markers.  And the insurance industry - the ones who we're the most worried about, you know, Kathy and I and others 10 years ago has - they've actually gone the other way. They're paying for all of this testing. They're not getting the results of the testing. They're paying for surgeries in my clinic, and they've - I, evidently, very strongly made this decision that this ounce of prevention is a good idea, and that they should be frankly applauded for that. And that's put us in a situation where I absolutely feel that federal legislation is very important.  But, fortunately, there is no clear and present risk in the cancer genetic field for any of this information having - being abused. At least it has not been to date.  Dr. HUDSON: And do you have a law in New York that prevents it being used in the health insurance sector? And that may be part reason why\u2026  Dr. OFFIT: That's interesting, actually. New York, we have very strict confidentiality laws, stricter than most. And in New York, we actually don't have a strong anti-discrimination law as exists, for example, in New Jersey.  So even in the absence of that, I think this is a fundamental decision that the health insurance industry has made certainly in the realm of the common cancers that they just simply are not going there. And I don't foresee this as being a major risk for common cancer testing.  But that's not to say as, I think, a Times reporter said that this is not in the public conscious mind. People do think there's an - in a very, kind of, ironic and unfortunate way perhaps, that information may send people to these direct consumer companies because they are afraid of something that may actually not be on the great radar screen of dangers.  FLATOW: All right. Let me - we've run out of time. I'd like to thank both of you, Kathy Hudson, director of the Genetics and Public Policy Center at Johns Hopkins University in Washington; Ken Offit, chief of the Clinical Genetic Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center here in New York.  Thank you both for taking time to be with us today and good luck to you.  Dr. HUDSON: You're welcome.  FLATOW: You're welcome.  Dr. OFFIT: Thanks.  FLATOW: We're going to take a short break and when we come back, we're going to talk about - you maybe you've heard that sound recording, the French sound recording that predates Thomas Edison but maybe don't know very much about the inventor who did it. Interesting section of history and time - we'll come back and talk right about it. Stay with us.  I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.

ALISON STEWART, Host: I go on a news-fast every now and again. MARTIN: That's the gist of a new cover story in New Scientist Magazine that asks the big question, are we doomed? And here's a hint. Our survival is connected to how we are connected to each other. So, what does that mean? Here to explain is Debora MacKenzie. She wrote the articles, and she is on the line from Brussels. Hi, Debora. DEBORA MACKENZIE: Hello. MARTIN: Thanks for joining us. So, your piece is all about what makes civilizations collapse. Let's start the conversation by first defining what that means. What does that mean when a society, a civilization collapses? MACKENZIE: More and more people left the cities. It didn't have enough agricultural base to keep things going. It became vulnerable to barbarians who they would have easily repulsed a few years earlier. You know, that's the analyses historians have done, and it all seems to come down to complexity, how complex your civilization gets, whether you can keep it running. MARTIN: Well, let's talk about that. For your piece, you spoke with a lot of scientists who talked about something called \"complexity theory. \" Now, understanding that it might be difficult to boil down something called complexity theory into 20 seconds or less, I'll still ask you to try to do this. What is this theory? And how does it apply to what you are talking about in the piece? MACKENZIE: And you produce more food. Your population goes up. You need more irrigation canals. They start silting up. You hire teams to dredge them. After awhile, you have to hire a management bureaucracy. You've got to pay for that, so you invent taxation. You know, as you get bigger and more complicated. MARTIN: More layers, yeah. MACKENZIE: Now, those seem intuitively to be very resilient and resistant to collapse, and in fact, they work very efficiently within sort of the conditions they are used to. But the trouble is that there are unexpected fragilities in those networks. You hit them at one place and the shock just transmits through the whole system. MARTIN: You define some of those that we wouldn't even think of as being so critical to how our society, civilization works. \"Hubs,\" you call them, and they are people like truckers, farm workers. MACKENZIE: Yeah, the old saying is that \"Civilization is four meals away from anarchy. \" If there was a plague raging of some sort in New York City, and the guys driving the trucks that carry the food into town were afraid to go in, you know, how much food have you got on Manhattan Island? Do you know? MARTIN: Gosh. I don't know, but these are freaky questions, I have to tell you. We are living in such an amazing age, though, of advances in science, medicine, and communication. I mean, don't those benefits far outweigh the risks of potential fragilities that have arisen because of our interconnectedness? MACKENZIE: It looks like it happens in civilizations, too. What we need to do is manage collapse so you get small local breakdowns that actually turn into renewals. We start doing things differently and fixing some of our problems, rather than having this thing propagate out of control into a sort of a massive collapse. He feels that's possible. MARTIN: I'm going to ask you, Debora, do you think you can - before you answer that question, can you stay on the line with me? I'm going to ask you on the other side of the break. We have to take a quick break, but I would like to get your take on how we deal with our interconnectivity, and what we can do to prevent it. Can you stay with us? MACKENZIE: Sure. MARTIN: And we were talking, Debora, about how we are so connected now in the age of the Internet, all of our systems are related to one another. That creates these fragilities, where if one part of that system breaks down, then you've got a major problem. How do we prevent this? How in the world do we start to pull back some of that momentum that has us moving very firmly in the direction of more connectivity, not less? MACKENZIE: They prune out the redundant species until they've just got what they need. Just as in globalizing and rationalizing our industries, we've pruned out a lot of redundant slaughterhouses in the meat industry, or factories. I think all buttons come from one part of China now. MARTIN: And you think we need those redundancies? MACKENZIE: So, they're going to continue to increase our close coupling and our fragility, really, unless they are paid to be redundant and inefficient in some ways that sort of increase our overall resilience as a society. MARTIN: Last question, when you finished writing these articles, did you immediately go to Costco or Wal-Mart and stock up on food and water? MACKENZIE: Well, actually I. . . MARTIN: Or are you already well-stocked? MACKENZIE: I've been covering bird flu for awhile, so yeah, I've got some food in the basement. But I don't have any illusions that having a bit of food in the basement is going to protect me or my family from a collapse of civilization. You know, that's big stuff. MARTIN: Indeed. MACKENZIE: I think it's important for people to take the possibility on board and start thinking creatively about it. MARTIN: Debora MacKenzie, author of the articles in the New Scientist Magazine on the end of civilization, or maybe not. It depends on your outlook. Hey, Debora, thank you so much. MACKENZIE: Any time. RACHEL MARTIN, Host:  OK, Alison, you know those people out there who say they try not to consume any news at all because it is all gloom and doom?

I'm Ira Flatow. A bit later in the hour, a look at biofuels research. But first, sometime later this year a massive particle accelerator, known as the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, is scheduled to start operations deep underground of the borders between France and Switzerland. Over 2,000 physicists from 34 countries have been involved in the construction of the LHC, which, the theory goes, could provide a glimpse of sub-atomic particles such as the Higgs boson, thought to be responsible for giving matter mass.  Experiments might also shed some light about the validity of string theory. But the powerful collisions created in the particle accelerator also have the potential, in theory at least, to create other exotic particles. One called the \"strangelet\" and perhaps even a black hole. Both which would be deadly, if created, for all living beings on Earth. And that has sparked a lawsuit filed in federal court in Hawaii by seven individuals seeking an injunction against the collider, arguing that it could endanger the planet.  Joining me now to talk about the Large Hadron Collider, why physicists are excited about it, what is the status of it coming online and the safety concerns being raised, is Dr. Frank Wilczek. He's the Herman Feshbach Professor of Physics at M. I. T. in Cambridge. He's also the 2004 Nobel Laureate in Physics, and one of a group of physicists that, in 1999, looked at a similar safety concern being raised at that time about a particle accelerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Long Island. He joins us by phone in Oxford. Welcome, Dr. Wilczek.  Dr. FRANK WILCZEK (Herman Feshbach Professor of Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology): Hello. FLATOW: What is the status, though - some of us thought it would already be online by now. Or next month. Dr. WILCZEK: Well, it's an extraordinarily complicated project and it's amazing that it can be made to work at all. There's many, many moving parts and it's pushing the edges of technology. So we have to be patient. But it's - the excitement is building and we are hoping that the machine will start operation early this fall and come on full speed next year. FLATOW: And why are you so excited about this machine? Dr. WILCZEK: It's going to give us insight at a whole new level into the fundamentals of physics. I have written a whole book about it, which I should plug. FLATLOW: Go ahead. Give us the name. Dr. WILCZEK: It's called \"The Lightness of Being: Mass, Ether and the Unification of Forces. \" It will be coming out in September, Perseus Books. And it's just the machine we've been waiting for. We have brilliant ideas about what might happen that have just been waiting to be tested. We have good reason to think that the universe we live in is a vast kind of exotic, cosmic superconductor and we want to see what makes it a superconductor. That's called the Higgs particle. But it's a richer story than just discovering a particle.  We have ideas about how to unite the different forces of nature and the different kinds of particles that we observe as the basic building blocks of nature, that are very beautiful concepts but need to be tested against experiment. We have ideas about what the dark matter might be, the dark matter that astronomers have discovered makes up much more of the universe, by mass, than the normal matter we are made of and we understand. So some of the best ideas about what that dark matter is suggest that it could be something that will be made at the LHC. So there is just a tremendous sense of excitement building that this is the right machine at the right time to bring fundamental physics to a new level.  FLATOW: What will be the first experiments run on it? Looking for what? The calibration. . . Dr. WILCZEK: All the experiments happen at once, really. Because the nature of the machine is that it brings together protons at very, very high energy, and you see what comes out. So. . . FLATOW: So you smash these protons together and you see what. . . Dr. WILCZEK:  Yes. FLATOW: Literally, you break it up with, like a hammer and see what comes out of it. Dr. WILCZEK:  Exactly, right. And so everything that's there we will find and all these experiments will be done - all these searches will be done at the same time.  FLATOW: And let's talk about the Higgs boson because you mentioned it and physicists always talk about finding this Higgs boson. What is it and why is it so important to look for it? Dr. WILCZEK:  Well, our theory of the basic electric and weak forces, the so-called Electroweak theory, those are two of the four fundamental forces of nature, have as a fundamental component the idea that what we perceive as empty space is not empty at all. That it has material properties and that, in fact, it's a kind of exotic superconductor. But unlike for ordinary superconductors, we don't know what makes empty space have the properties it does. And so there are hypotheses about what it is, many different hypotheses, but the way we are going to find out for sure is to break off little chips of this material that we see ordinarily as empty space, and examine them and find out what their properties are. So that goes under the name Higgs boson. And it might be just one new kind of particle that does the job, but I suspect that it's a much richer story and that we'll find that there is a whole world of phenomena connected with this superconducting property of empty space.  FLATOW: And that brings me to this unusual lawsuit I talked about earlier. Trying to stop these experiments, thinking that some sort of - one of these crashes of particles might create some interesting but deadly particles, one of them being called a \"strangelet,\" which would eventually convert all of Earth into a large strangelet huge particle. Dr. WILCZEK: Right. Or a black hole. FLATOW: Or a black hole. You investigated the possibilities of this almost 10 years ago.  Dr. WILCZEK: Yes. Some of the same people raised the same kinds of issues, and of course, in the scientific literature, the underlying phenomena of strangelets or black holes have been discussed. But I think there are three independent arguments, each of which is decisive, that should reassure everyone about these possibilities. First, nature has already done the experiment. Cosmic rays achieve energies even higher than will be explored at the LHC and have been for billions of years. And so if any of theses things were to happen or be a physical possibility, it would have happened in the cosmos and its effects would have been visible. Secondly, we have a sociological argument. As you mentioned, thousands of people work on the LHC project and have worked in the basic subject of high-energy physics and accelerators. And those people have families. They have love of life. If they had perceived the slightest danger of this kind, if they thought it was plausible, they would be screaming about it.  The idea that there is a vast conspiracy involving thousands of scientists to hush up some problem is just kind of crazy on its face. And then finally, some of us sort of were designated to be the B team or the Red squad and try to really think about how, conceivably, you know, just use your imagination, try to make everything in a worst case scenario, how conceivably, dangers could arise. And I and my colleagues really took that as a challenge. You know, we love that kind of challenge. Use our imagination and see what you can dream up, and even doing our best we couldn't come up with any scenario, any mechanism that made sense that would suggest that there was a serious danger.  FLATOW: So you just think this is just an old argument that has reared its head again? Dr. WILCZEK: Yeah, based on misunderstandings and a sort of taking words out of context. FLATOW: I only have a short time left, Dr. Wilczek. Can you give us some idea of when you think the Hadron Collider might be powering up? Should we look out at certain dates? Dr. WILCZEK: It's a matter of months, not years. The test runs are due to commence in the late summer or early fall, and then it should come up to full energy starting next year. FLATOW: As someone who likes to think about all possibilities of things, what happens if you turn it on and you don't see any of these things that you were hoping to see?  (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. WILCZEK: Well, that would be interesting, too, because it would show that our understanding of the world is fundamentally flawed. As I said, our basic theory of the forces we know about is based on the idea that empty space has a lot of structure and we had better be able to probe that structure. I mean, that structure, if it exists, will be probed by this machine. And so the biggest surprise would be for nothing to happen. I just, it would be a real shock to the system and send us back to the drawing board.  FLATOW: And this will be the biggest machine for some time to come, there's nothing. . . Dr. WILCZEK: Yes. This is the machine we have been waiting for, the super-conducting super-collider was on schedule for the United States, but got cancelled. That would have been a comparable machine. But this is the one we have been waiting for. It's the right machine at the right time, or maybe actually too late, a little late. But it's going to test very exciting ideas for the first time, so it's a thrilling prospect for fundamental physics.  FLATOW: Yeah, we'll all be watching it closely. We've been talking about this for over 10 years on Science Friday, so.  Dr. WILCZEK: Yeah. These ideas have been waiting so it's nice for the experiment to catch up with theory. FLATOW: Dr. Wilczek, thank you for staying up for us tonight.  Dr. WILCZEK:  Right. Bye-bye.  FLATOW: And have a good weekend. Dr. Frank Wilczek who was the 2004 Nobel Laureate in Physics and Professor of Physics at M. I. T. And author, I guess, of an upcoming book called \"The Lightness of Being,\" which will be out in September and we'll have him back to talk about it.  Stay with us. We are going to take a short break, talk about some interesting and intriguing new research into bio-fuels, you know, people loved it at first and now we are wondering if it is worth all this effort because it eats up a lot of food, drives up the price of grain. Some people are thinking about new ways of creating bio-fuels that may not be as expensive and energy-consuming. So stay with us, we'll be right back after this short break.  I'm Ira Flatow.

And so if any of theses things were to happen or be a physical possibility, it would have happened in the cosmos and its effects would have been visible. Secondly, we have a sociological argument. As you mentioned, thousands of people work on the LHC project and have worked in the basic subject of high-energy physics and accelerators. And those people have families. They have love of life. If they had perceived the slightest danger of this kind, if they thought it was plausible, they would be screaming about it.   The idea that there is a vast conspiracy involving thousands of scientists to hush up some problem is just kind of crazy on its face. And then finally, some of us sort of were designated to be the B team or the Red squad and try to really think about how, conceivably, you know, just use your imagination, try to make everything in a worst case scenario, how conceivably, dangers could arise. And I and my colleagues really took that as a challenge. You know, we love that kind of challenge. Use our imagination and see what you can dream up, and even doing our best we couldn't come up with any scenario, any mechanism that made sense that would suggest that there was a serious danger.   FLATOW: So you just think this is just an old argument that has reared its head again?  Dr. WILCZEK: Yeah, based on misunderstandings and a sort of taking words out of context.  FLATOW: I only have a short time left, Dr. Wilczek. Can you give us some idea of when you think the Hadron Collider might be powering up? Should we look out at certain dates?  Dr. WILCZEK: It's a matter of months, not years. The test runs are due to commence in the late summer or early fall, and then it should come up to full energy starting next year.  FLATOW: As someone who likes to think about all possibilities of things, what happens if you turn it on and you don't see any of these things that you were hoping to see?   (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. WILCZEK: Well, that would be interesting, too, because it would show that our understanding of the world is fundamentally flawed. As I said, our basic theory of the forces we know about is based on the idea that empty space has a lot of structure and we had better be able to probe that structure. I mean, that structure, if it exists, will be probed by this machine. And so the biggest surprise would be for nothing to happen. I just, it would be a real shock to the system and send us back to the drawing board.   FLATOW: And this will be the biggest machine for some time to come, there's nothing. . .  Dr. WILCZEK: Yes. This is the machine we have been waiting for, the super-conducting super-collider was on schedule for the United States, but got cancelled. That would have been a comparable machine. But this is the one we have been waiting for. It's the right machine at the right time, or maybe actually too late, a little late. But it's going to test very exciting ideas for the first time, so it's a thrilling prospect for fundamental physics.   FLATOW: Yeah, we'll all be watching it closely. We've been talking about this for over 10 years on Science Friday, so.   Dr. WILCZEK: Yeah. These ideas have been waiting so it's nice for the experiment to catch up with theory.  FLATOW: Dr. Wilczek, thank you for staying up for us tonight.   Dr. WILCZEK:  Right. Bye-bye.   FLATOW: And have a good weekend. Dr. Frank Wilczek who was the 2004 Nobel Laureate in Physics and Professor of Physics at M. I. T. And author, I guess, of an upcoming book called \"The Lightness of Being,\" which will be out in September and we'll have him back to talk about it.   Stay with us. We are going to take a short break, talk about some interesting and intriguing new research into bio-fuels, you know, people loved it at first and now we are wondering if it is worth all this effort because it eats up a lot of food, drives up the price of grain. Some people are thinking about new ways of creating bio-fuels that may not be as expensive and energy-consuming. So stay with us, we'll be right back after this short break.   I'm Ira Flatow.

It is one of those truths that has been borne out in study after study after study, but what if your marriage is like \"The Honeymooners\"? Mr. JACKIE GLEASON (Actor, \"The Honeymooners\"):  (as Ralph Kramden): Don't steam me, Alice. Don't steam me because I'm already steamed.  BRAND:  Ralph Kramden's blood pressure must have been off the charts, and that, according to new research, is not healthy for any married person.  Here with more is Dr. Sydney Spiesel.  He's a professor at Yale Medical School.  He's a pediatrician, and he's a columnist at slate. com.  Hi, Syd. Dr. SYDNEY SPIESEL (Professor, Yale Medical School and Columnist, Slate. com):  Hi, Madeleine. BRAND:  So these researchers, they looked at marriage and blood pressure and the connection there. Dr. SPIESEL:  Yeah.  And they did it for a couple of reasons.  One is that previous studies showed that there's a health benefit, there seemed to be a health benefit to marriage.  And so these researchers wanted to look to see if the health benefit applied to all marriages or just happy ones. And so what they did, they advertised for people to participate, so that's a non-random sample already.  They found about 300 people.  Two-thirds of them, that's about 200 of them, were married, ranging from one to 42 years.  The sample was only for one day. BRAND:  So for some people, it was a really bad day, I guess. Dr. SPIESEL:  Well, I guess it could have been a really bad day.  And the way they did the study was kind of interesting, which is that they said, well, the only thing we're going to look at is cardiovascular effects, which we can't - we don't know what the long term cardio - we can't even measure what long term cardiovascular effects for this.  It's only a one day study. So, what we're going to do is, we're going to give people a blood pressure monitor.  And the idea is that we know that people who have high levels of blood pressure in general are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease, are at greater risk for illness and early death, and this particularly applies if people don't have a dip in blood pressure at night, if their blood pressure remains high day and night. BRAND:  So did they find that good marriages produce low blood pressure and vice versa? Dr. SPIESEL:  Well, yes, they did.  They found that people whose marriages were described as, you know, as happy or satisfied or well-adjusted, that had a lot of satisfaction in their marriage, their blood pressure was lower.  And this was in contrast to single people, whose blood pressure was higher, and, interestingly enough, it was also in contrast to married people who were not satisfied in their marriages or whose marriages were poorly - showed poor adjustment. BRAND:  So how bad a marriage would it have to be, though?  I mean, is this an argument over who takes out the trash or is this an argument over who cheated on whom? Dr. SPIESEL:  You know, that's one of the weaknesses of the study.  It was very hard to figure that out.  They gave some sort of standardized questionnaires to people, which are well known in the literature as measuring marital satisfaction, for example. BRAND:  Well, you know, they always say that being married is especially good in terms of health for the man because he eats better when he's married.  So I'm wondering if, perhaps, let's say you get in an argument, but then you have a really good piece of fish and fresh veggie dinner, would that cancel it out? (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. SPIESEL:  It might well.  You know, the ultimate question is whether staying single is better than a kind of terrible marriage.  I don't know the answer to that, but, in terms of blood pressure, yes, it seems to be a little bit better.  But there may be other benefits to marriage, even unhappy marriages, which are not measured in this and which might contribute to better healthy.  We just don't know. For example, marriage, good or bad, might result in better caring for each other in old age.  Well, that could of great health benefits.  There might be less loneliness which, even thought it wouldn't be reflected, apparently, in stress and blood pressure, might change the quality of a person's life in other ways. So, it may be that this measurement they're using is very removed from ultimate outcome.  So it may be that blood pressure measurements might not be a marker for good health in general. BRAND:  That's opinion from the happily married, and I think, I would venture to say very happily married, Dr. Sydney Spiesel.  He's a professor at the Yale Medical School, and you can read his column at slate. com.  Thanks, Syd. Dr. SPIESEL:  Thank you. BRAND:  There's more to come on Day to Day after this.

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. The debate over stem cells and cloning stirs deep passions, but experts expect much more profound and much more divisive arguments as reproductive technology advances. On a very limited level, some couples already choose their children on the basis of genetics.  In vitro fertilization offers a chance to test different embryos and select the one without, for example, Down syndrome. In 10 or 20 years, science may give us many more choices, not just to prevent disease, but to engineer smarter, taller, thinner, stronger children and pass those traits on to later generations.  We could, in short, control human evolution. The ethical questions are staggering. To pick just one, might we breed two strains of human, the genetically-enhanced and the natural? Today, how policy and public debate lag behind fast moving science. Later in the hour, we'll talk with about the elaborate preparations for the visit of Pope Benedict. How do you provide communion for 57,000 people in 14 minutes?  But first, designing babies. If you have questions about the ethics of genetic engineering or what this technology means, we want to hear from you. 800-989-8255 is the phone number. Email talk@npr. org, and you can also join the conversation on our blog at npr. org/blogofthenation.  We begin with Ronald Green, professor for the study of ethics and human values at Dartmouth College and author of \"Babies by Design: The Ethics of Genetic Choice,\" with us today, from the studios of Dartmouth University in Hanover, New Hampshire. And it's nice to have you on the program.  Dr. RONALD M. GREEN (Director, Ethics Institute, Dartmouth College; Author, \"Babies by Design: The Ethics of Genetic Choice\"): Very nice to be here, Neal. CONAN: And we're going to focus mostly on ethics and policy, on the implications of these technologies. But let me start by asking you, just how far along are we now? Dr. GREEN: Well, I think we're beginning to take what I would call our first baby steps in this direction. Just last year, the British authority responsible for this authorized genetic selection to help avoid the birth of a child with late-onset breast cancer. This is not an immediately life-threatening disease.  A child can live for many decades, grow up. Some people say that this was a step across the line into designer babies. Others said it was an effort actually to provide a healthy life for a child. So we are already beginning to move with these technologies and ethical choices into this area. CONAN: And were people troubled by the implication of saying you, who might live 40 years before developing this disease, you, who might never develop this disease, you're not going to be born?  Dr. GREEN: Well, I think there certainly were voices raised to that effect. On the other side, the physicians and the clinicians who worked with these families said they had seen cancer generation after generation in their family. Why did that have to go on forever? Couldn't we produce an individual who could face a healthy and long life? CONAN: The debate on this question, as we pointed out, already acrimonious, on what might be considered preliminary issues.  Dr. GREEN: That's correct. I actually think that this is going to be the major bioethics issue of the decades ahead. It's going to replace our disputes about stem cells and cloning and whatever. Because our technologies are carrying us forward. Parents are already making choices for such things as a child's sex and the list of abilities is growing with the technology. CONAN: And you also point out in your book, and in an article that you've written, as well, for the Washington Post, that this is not necessarily a popular choice.  Dr. GREEN: Oh, I don't think so at all. In fact, in my experience, most people are opposed to this. I was teaching a class at Dartmouth Medical School just a few days ago and I asked the class, how do they feel about making choices to have children that have fewer susceptibilities to disease?  Maybe enhanced stabilities? Do you support that? And 80 percent of the class raised their hand, no. Said they did not support it. These are medical students. So I think the feeling here is overwhelming against. But I think it's a feeling that is going to fade as the technologies become available. CONAN: Nevertheless, a lot of people have that visceral reaction that this is - this is hubris. This is playing God.  Dr. GREEN: I understand that. Let's remember that 20 or 30 years ago, people had a similar visceral reaction against the first test-tube babies and said this is going to replace parenting, change parenting. A million children have been born since baby Louise Brown and they have made their lives, the lives of their families, as bright and happy as can be. We learn to adapt to new technologies.  CONAN: We want to invite a lot of callers in on this conversation. 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr. org, and why don't we begin with Marlene, Marlene calling us from St. Louis in Missouri. Marlene, are you there? Marlene? There we are, Marlene can hear us now.  MARLENE (Caller): Yes. CONAN: Go ahead, please. MARLENE: OK. I have two comments. The first is that there is a very bright line between preventing disease, something, that if we had the capacity to correct after birth, we would do so then, as well, and modifying something like hair color or eye color, that are inconsequential.  And the second point is that the real problem with the latter is that of unreasonable expectations. You've decided what this child is going to be and nothing they do is ever going to be good enough unless they are better than Michael Jordan at basketball because you decided they're going to be seven-foot-two.  CONAN: Unreasonable expectations, it's going to change the nature of parenting. What do you think, Robert Green? Dr. GREEN: Well, I think Marlene's concerns are very legitimate. And I, to some extent, share them. But I think we have to think a little bit beyond what we know and are expecting. First of all, this bright line between disease and what is called improvement or enhancement, making people better than well.  Medicine is now actively involved in the second, whole reaches of medicine. Plastic surgery, cosmetic surgery, forms of sports medicine are already involved in going beyond disease prevention. And doctors are involved. So I think we are going to see this extended as well to the reproductive genetic area. Unreasonable expectations, yes, a concern.  One of the most commonly-voiced concerns. My response to that, it's a funny kind of a statement. Parents love what they get. Parents can expect a Michael Jordan or a Tiger Woods, and they will put up with a kid who is just middling. Not merely put up with, they think they will love that child. So I think we underestimate parental affection and parental bonding and parental love as we express that fear.  CONAN: Marlene, what do you think? MARLENE: I think that's true for the majority of parents, but not all, and I'm afraid that the exceptions would self-select for - my child has to be the tallest, the strongest, the smartest, the most beautiful. Whatever.  CONAN: And that - go ahead. I'm sorry, Ron. Dr. GREEN: Yes, again, I think Marlene is making a very solid point. Some people will be irresponsible. Marlene, let's remember, a lot of parents are irresponsible right now without any genetic technology at all.  MARLENE: True. Dr. GREEN: They pressure children way beyond their capabilities. So I think this is a persistent problem in parenting that we'll just have to live with. CONAN: It sounds like you've got some expectations there with you, Marlene. MARLENE: Yes, two of them. CONAN: Two of them. How are they working out? MARLENE: Oh, they are doing pretty well. CONAN: All right, well, take care of them.  MARLENE: Thanks. CONAN: Thanks very much for the call. Let's see if we can get, this is Drew. Drew is with us form Tallahassee, Florida. DREW (Caller): Hi. How are you doing? CONAN: Very well, thank you.  DREW: I actually - my initial question, kind of, was more what Marlene was asking, but it led me to start thinking that, if you offer this kind of genetic engineering, this selectivity for children, to what degree does that play into how it is available to what socioeconomic class? Do we just now say, OK, all you rich people can have healthy babies, but poor people, this technology is not available to you, sorry?  CONAN: Ronald Green, you call this the development of the genobility. Dr. GREEN: Exactly. And it's again one of the most frequently voiced concerns in this area. The rich will not only be rich. The haves will not only have. But they'll have and get more. They'll add to their financial resources, genetic aptitudes and abilities. That will create this terrible class divide until such time as maybe we'll have two species so different biologically and socially that they no longer even interbreed with one another.  Those are concerns that I think we're going to have to adjust - respond to them by making certain that those things which really assist development, and achievement, and well-being, are available to everyone. I see these genetic technologies as a part of our debate about a national health system of some sort. And I think we're going to have to see these.  Let's remember this, a lot of people forget the point, there are many problems that hold people back. I had a nephew who was seriously impeded in his advancement by reading problems. If we can address those problems early, rather than going through of years of effort in school, maybe we could help people avoid falling to the bottom of our social ladder.  CONAN: Drew, thanks very much for the call.  DREW: Thank you. CONAN: Also with us today is Marcy Darnovsky, associate director at the Center for Genetics and Society in Oakland, California. She's with us today from the studios at the University of California at Berkley's School of Journalism. It's nice to welcome you to Talk of the Nation, too.  Dr. MARCY DARNOVSKY (Associate Director, The Center for Genetics and Society): Thank you, Neal.  CONAN: And where do we cross the line between legitimate medical purposes, elimination of disease, and cosmetic genetics? Is there a bright line? Dr. DARNOVSKY: I think there is a bright line. But the bright line isn't between therapy and enhancement. The bright line is really between the kinds of genetic technologies that we use on ourselves, or on other existing individuals, on the one hand.  And between what we would do to future generations, to our own children. And I think that's the line that we have to observe. And it's the line that, in fact, dozens of countries around the world, who have thought about this, and debated it, have already adopted as policy.  So, while a lot of these genetic and reproductive technologies raise very troubling questions, questions of ethics, questions of social implications, questions that Marlene and Drew already brought up, the line that divides what we do to ourselves and what we do to our children, and our children's children, is one that is like the hydrogen bomb of these technologies. That's the one we have to be careful of.  CONAN: But if, like these couples in Britain, you could breed breast cancer out of your family line. What's wrong with that? Dr. DARNOVSKY: Well, they're not - what they're doing is selecting embryos. And while there is a lot to talk about there, pro, con, maybe, maybe not, when we talk about actually genetically engineering, when we talk about going in and mucking around with the genes, that's where we cross the Rubicon. That's where, I think we say, you know, we have to say off the table.  That one is too dangerous to the children, because we haven't talked yet about safety concerns which I know that Ron Green is concerned about. But what we've seen with animal experiments, in cloning, and in genetic engineering, is that there's hundreds and hundreds of mistakes along the way. And while that's one thing in animals, it's quite another thing to think about doing that in human beings. We just don't allow that kind of experimentation, and I hope we never will.  CONAN: Ten fingers and ten toes used to be enough. What if you could also choose sex, health, even the eye color of your children? More on reproductive genetics next. If you'd like to get in on the conversation, 800-989-8255. Email us at talk@npr. org. Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan. It's the Talk of the Nation from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music) CONAN: This is Talk of the Nation. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. As genetic engineering advances steadily, the ethical implications are staggering. We may be able to make choices about our children that could be social as well as medical. We're talking about some of the policy questions we may have to consider in the future.  Our guests are Ronald Green, professor for the study of ethics in human values at Dartmouth College, as well as Marcy Darnovsky. She's associate director at the Center for Genetics in Society in Oakland, California. Of course, we want to hear from you. If you have questions about the ethics of genetic engineering, or what this technology means, 800-989-8255.  Email us, talk@npr. org, and you can read what other listeners have to say on our blog at npr. org/blogofthenation. Ronald Green, as we were going to the break, Marcy Darnovsky was raising questions about safety and certainly in the experiments with animals - more than experiments at this point with animals, that is a major issue.  Dr. GREEN: Oh, definitely so. I think that we are going to have to watch very carefully as these first experiments are done. As we go beyond selection to actual gene targeting and gene manipulation.  But I don't think safety is going to shut this off forever and indefinitely. I would remind Marcy, and once again, the first experiments in reproductive technologies, IVF, Intracytoplasmic sperm injection, to help infertile men. All of these involve an initial risk. There's always that first set of experiments.  You try to make those as safe as possible. In the realm of genetics, we may be able to make our changes reversible, so that if problems develop, they can be cancelled. All of this will have to be looked into. But we will, I believe, certainly step across that line and do those first experiments some years from now.  CONAN: Marcy Darnovsky, you agree? Dr. DARNOVSKY: I don't. I think that would be terribly unethical, human experimentation. I think we would also would be engaging on a huge social and political experiment of the kind that Drew, your caller Drew, raised before. I think we would be starting toward - down the road toward a Gattaca-like world.  CONAN: Gattaca, the famous science fiction movie where there were two breeds of people, the superior enhanced people and they looked down on the poor pitiful naturals.  Dr. DARNOVSKY: That's right. They were called the valids and invalids in Gattaca. And the genobility is another term, and the genrich, and the naturals. But the basic story is you're going to have genetically enhanced people, a small percentage of the population, they'll run the show, the government, the academia.  And the rest of us, the naturals, will sweep the floors. And on both sides of this debate, both those like Ronald Green, who are promoting the use of this technologies, and people like myself, who want to draw some lines, there's an acknowledgement that that is a very likely outcome of using technologies of genetic enhancement in future generations.  And I think it's commendable that Ron Green raises this as a concern, which he does in his book, in his articles. But then his response is, well, I think that's overblown, that's not so dire. Don't panic, he says in his book. But he really doesn't propose any mechanisms of democratic control to deal with that problem.  CONAN: Ronald Green? Dr. GREEN: Well, I really have to differ with Marcy a little bit on that point. I do propose some mechanisms. I believe in a decentralized, pluralistic system of oversight that would include some federal government initiatives at the research level. Practitioners have standards of care. They have to be responsible to the patient, in some cases, to the child that they produce.  I think parental education plays a role. I think what I'm really opposed to only is some kind of centralized, super genetic agency, because I think that such an agency would stop everything. In this country, for example, we've begun to permit couples to use sex selection at the embryonic level, just for family balance.  Not to have, necessarily, a favored child, but if they've had two boys in a row, and want a girl, we've begun to permit that. In more authoritarian societies, that's forbidden. People don't have that liberty. And I'm really trying to defend parental genetic choices, I say in the title of my book. CONAN: And Marcy Darnovsky, there's another aspect of this, which some might say you're overlooking. Which is, yes some countries have considered it. Others have not. And if this technology arrives in the next ten years, 20 years, say, there's going to be places where people are going to be able to do this. And there's going to always be people with money who want to do it.  Dr. DARNOVSKY: Well, that's one of the concerns. So, I think it's important for us, in this country, which we're the outlier really. Almost all the countries with any substantial biotechnology program have considered it, and have put these lines into place. There's lots of - still areas to talk about.  But there's lots of decisions to be made, and I think the lines will, you know, shift here and there and the other place. But I think there are just one or two very dangerous applications that ought to be taken off the table. And those are reproductive cloning and what we've called inheritable genetic modification. That allows the enhancement of future children.  And I think to say that, you know, we have allowed, in this country, sex selection is really to say that the marketplace has allowed it. And in the United States that, I think, to our detriment, is really the public policy that we have. We allow those with money to determine what research is done, what applications are developed, and who gets to buy the goods - the consumer goods on offer, in which, in this case, are goods about selecting the traits of our children.  CONAN: Let's go to Daniel, Daniel calling us from San Antonio, Texas.  DANIEL (Caller): Yes, my question relates to Gattaca. In that movie, wasn't the insurance company making the policies about who became a valid and invalid? And how to prevent that the insurance companies from saying, hey, your baby has to have this gene, or that gene and what not? Because I don't want to live in a world like that.  CONAN: Or that, if you don't program to get rid of it, the - your rates will go through the roof, or become unsupportable, or something like that. So are we - is Hartford like to be the source of our next dystopia, do you think? Marcy, what do you think? Dr. DARNOVSKY: Well, I think that we do have to be concerned about genetic discrimination. And there are proposals for prohibiting that. And I think that is a good example of the way that the government does have to get involved. Because we need public policy, we need - you know, we elect candidates, and we have our representatives debate about tax policies.  But we really have not developed democratic mechanisms for shaping powerful technologies that effect our lives, that effect our life and death chances that each of us has. I think we really need those, and I think it's going to involve public policy and government regulation. CONAN: Ronald Green, I know you were trying to get in there. I apologize.  Dr. GREEN: Well, I think the insurance thing is a real issue. We've just seen a proposal before Congress to prohibit insurance companies from doing just that kind of thing. I think I would support that very strongly. I think we're going to have to see more of that. But let me caution once again about the heavy hand of government here. Not too long ago, the Italian government passed a law that limited IVF very radically. The number of procedures. . . CONAN: In vitro fertilization, yes.  Dr. GREEN: Exactly. It was driven by religious and other individuals. They seized the levers of governmental power. Now Italian couples are traveling elsewhere to have children. I think we have to be very careful about having super-government control and oversight. I would rather see parents playing a role. I'd rather see physicians playing a role. I'd rather see some regulation of government, but in a pluralistic system.  CONAN: Daniel, thanks very much for the call.  DANIEL: Thank you very much.  CONAN: Let's go now to Jeff, Jeff calling us from Grand Rapids in Michigan.  JEFF (Caller): Hello. Thank you for taking my call.  CONAN: Go ahead, please.  JEFF: My issue concerns - I read somewhere, I can't remember. I believe it might have been in The Advocate, which concerned issues, would parents play into sexual orientation, that possibly you could have parents where their attitude might be, I don't have a problem with gay or lesbian people, but I don't want one as a child.  To the point, where they could pick and choose things such as their sexual orientation. So, I guess to make a long story short, where would you say you draw the line where it becomes actual concern over things such as health. And situations where they just want certain undesirable, quote, unquote, elements going in, or just simply just want to have a child but they can write brag letters at Christmas.  CONAN: Ronald Green? Dr. GREEN: Well, once again, the justice issue is really acute there. Do we want to decimate the communities of people with different sexual orientation and the like, using this? I'm concerned about this. I can see a professional standard that says we do not assist people selecting for sexual orientation.  On the other hand, I would remind us of something that a colleague of mine, who's responsible, in part, for the discovery of what has been called the gay gene, has said repeatedly. For every straight set of parents who might not want to have a gay child, there might be a gay set of parents who'd want to have a gay child. So I'm not sure that, in the end, parental choice, informed parental choice, free parental choice, won't mostly address these problems.  JEFF: All right. Thank you very much.  CONAN: Okay, Jeff, thanks for the call. Here's an email from Dan. All moral, ethical concerns aside, can you ask your guests about the dangers of monoculture? How do we know which traits we keep or eliminate are beneficial in the larger, longer-term sense of the species? Marcy Darnovsky, is that a concern for you?  Dr. DARNOVSKY: That's somewhat of a concern, and in fact, we don't know. But for me, the really major concern, it really is about equality. It really is about setting up a world where, you know, based on the very basic thing we know about the dynamics of inequality in a market society. We are setting ourselves up for this genobility, this world of the genrich, this world in which if you're wealthy enough to get the right gene cassettes implanted in you when you - by your parents, then you have a chance to get ahead in the world, and the 90 percent or 95 percent who don't, are going to be one down and stay there, and it's going to be inscribed in our genes.  CONAN: And Ronald Green, you say in your book and in your piece that this might be a transitional phase until many of these things are available generally to the entire population, but there's many a slip between step A and step B.  Dr. GREEN: Certainly that is the case, and sometimes those people who spend their money and think they're going to get something really extraordinary will be very disappointed. That young Einstein may turn out to be a ne'er-do-well. But I think there is a self correction here. Let me say that I think - I certainly agree with what Marcy is saying, but I also see genetics as a way of addressing social inequities. Take the issue of reading.  We were not evolved to read. Reading is a very recent development. And millions and millions of people around the world have reading disorders of one sort or the other. If we could tag the genes that contribute to that and just tweak those genes so that every youngster has a good opportunity at school, we might actually begin to address these problems in ways that are far better than all of our after-a-child-is-born efforts.  CONAN: Marcy, let me ask you that same question but in the form of this email from Paul in Boise, Idaho. I have to admit that the idea of genetic fiddling makes me nervous, but when I try to think of a moral objection, I come up empty. We have no objection when surgery is performed to correct for eyesight or physical disabilities after birth. Why not correct for these before birth?  Dr. DARNOVSKY: I think the objection is that we're opening up the door to a society of the genrich and the naturals, and I think we've been working for so many centuries to address inequalities and to establish civil rights and to increase our toleration of differences.  And I think, you know, to say that we're going to go down this road to address dyslexia, I mean, we know if we want to improve the lives of our children, I think we know how to do that. We give kids basic medical care. We give them loving families. We give them good educations. That's the way to improve the lives of children, not to be fiddling around with their genes.  CONAN: Marcy Darnovsky of the Center for Genetics and Society in Oakland, California. Also with us, Ronald Green, professor for the study of ethics and human values at Dartmouth College, and the author of \"Babies by Design: The Ethics of Genetic Choice. \" You're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News. Let's see if we can get Richard on the line, Richard with us from Springfield, Pennsylvania.  RICHARD (Caller): Yes, I was wondering, has anybody thought what happened before World War II, the ten years where they pronounced that, you know, gene selection and not letting people intermarry that were semi-retarded. . . CONAN: I think he's talking about eugenics, or what some called Social Darwinism. Ronald Green?  RICHARD: Look what happened during World War II in Germany.  CONAN: Yes, that's where we're going to ask Ronald Green to respond to.  Dr. GREEN: Well, I've thought about this, certainly, Richard, and actually address it at somewhat - some great length in my book. I think this is, again, a real fear, we certainly never want to go back to anything like that, but I would point out two things. First of all, those - that eugenics movement, in this country and Germany and England, was first of all based on complete crackpot science.  There was no scientific foundation to almost anything that they said or did. We've entered a period of much greater responsibility in genetic information. The second thing I would say is that it was a government-run program. It was the government trying to promote something, and what I've been fighting for in this work and in other things is precisely getting the government, to a large extent, out of this area. So that parents by themselves can make responsible and informed choices. Sure, some of those parents are going to make bad choices, but I want to protect reproductive liberty, and that includes the liberty to think about the ways in which you can improve your child's genetic inheritance.  Dr. DARNOVSKY: You know, when you call that bad science, though, Ron, at the time, that was the science of the day. Now, certainly we have greater scientific knowledge now, but 50 years from now, our science today, we're going to see all kinds of errors and erroneous ways of thinking in it.  So I think that is a weak argument. And you know, I think also we should keep in mind that the eugenics of the 20th century was not just government run. There were all these contests at the state fairs about the fitter families.  There were people in Germany who were encouraged to have better children because they were thought to have better genes. So I think it's not really so clear cut that the eugenics - the consumer market-driven eugenics that we're talking about today would be so different in its outcome from what we saw in the 20th century.  CONAN: Let's get John on the line, John with us from Minneapolis.  JOHN (Caller): I think a lot of the argument that they've had in the show so far unfortunately is moot, because any technology like this will be done somewhere in the world at some point. It's already happening.  In my field, I'm a general surgeon, and natural orifice surgery is sort of the new thing, meaning taking out the appendix or other organs out the mouth or out the backside, and a lot of Third World countries are doing this, not doing it in trials, they're just doing it because it can be done. And once this sort of technology can be proven to be done, it will be done.  CONAN: And that gets back to that policy question, Marcy Darnovsky.  Dr. DARNOVSKY: Well, you know, we make policies not because we think that that's going to cover every single instance in the world, and we have laws against murder and people are still killed, but we would live in a different world if we didn't have those laws.  CONAN: OK. John - well, this is an important part of your argument, Ronald Green, that this is inevitable, so we have to figure out a way to moderate it.  Dr. GREEN: Very much so. I'm not one who thinks that because something is inevitable, we have to go along with it. We can mold it, shape it, change it, and I think we should do all those things. But I feel with a great degree of certainty that we're going to carry this technology into our own self-modification. Maybe not in ten years, more like decades ahead, but I think it's almost a certainty.  So the question is, how do we do it so that we minimize the damage and produce the humane society that we want? For me, the key to that - the key to that is informing parents, guiding parents, helping parents. Parents, I believe, want the best for their children, and I really would trust parents more than I would any kind of regulatory authority to make these decisions.  CONAN: John, thank you very much for the call. Marcy Darnovsky and Ronald Green, thank you both for your time today. We appreciate it.  Dr. GREEN: Thank you.  Dr. DARNOVSKY: Thank you.  CONAN: Just this final thought, an email from Jeremy in Jackson, Michigan. I've heard redheads are going to disappear from the genetic pool in the near future. Might this technology allow us to ensure the possibility of a continuation of the gene that creates redheads? Just a thought. Coming up, the Papal visit poses logistical problems and a few sartorial ones. We'll explain. It's Talk of the Nation from NPR News.   NEAL CONAN, host:  This is Talk of the Nation. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. The debate over stem cells and cloning stirs deep passions, but experts expect much more profound and much more divisive arguments as reproductive technology advances. On a very limited level, some couples already choose their children on the basis of genetics.   In vitro fertilization offers a chance to test different embryos and select the one without, for example, Down syndrome. In 10 or 20 years, science may give us many more choices, not just to prevent disease, but to engineer smarter, taller, thinner, stronger children and pass those traits on to later generations.   We could, in short, control human evolution. The ethical questions are staggering. To pick just one, might we breed two strains of human, the genetically-enhanced and the natural? Today, how policy and public debate lag behind fast moving science. Later in the hour, we'll talk with about the elaborate preparations for the visit of Pope Benedict. How do you provide communion for 57,000 people in 14 minutes?   But first, designing babies. If you have questions about the ethics of genetic engineering or what this technology means, we want to hear from you. 800-989-8255 is the phone number. Email talk@npr. org, and you can also join the conversation on our blog at npr. org/blogofthenation.   We begin with Ronald Green, professor for the study of ethics and human values at Dartmouth College and author of \"Babies by Design: The Ethics of Genetic Choice,\" with us today, from the studios of Dartmouth University in Hanover, New Hampshire. And it's nice to have you on the program.   Dr. RONALD M. GREEN (Director, Ethics Institute, Dartmouth College; Author, \"Babies by Design: The Ethics of Genetic Choice\"): Very nice to be here, Neal.  CONAN: And we're going to focus mostly on ethics and policy, on the implications of these technologies. But let me start by asking you, just how far along are we now?  Dr. GREEN: Well, I think we're beginning to take what I would call our first baby steps in this direction. Just last year, the British authority responsible for this authorized genetic selection to help avoid the birth of a child with late-onset breast cancer. This is not an immediately life-threatening disease.   A child can live for many decades, grow up. Some people say that this was a step across the line into designer babies. Others said it was an effort actually to provide a healthy life for a child. So we are already beginning to move with these technologies and ethical choices into this area.  CONAN: And were people troubled by the implication of saying you, who might live 40 years before developing this disease, you, who might never develop this disease, you're not going to be born?   Dr. GREEN: Well, I think there certainly were voices raised to that effect. On the other side, the physicians and the clinicians who worked with these families said they had seen cancer generation after generation in their family. Why did that have to go on forever? Couldn't we produce an individual who could face a healthy and long life?  CONAN: The debate on this question, as we pointed out, already acrimonious, on what might be considered preliminary issues.   Dr. GREEN: That's correct. I actually think that this is going to be the major bioethics issue of the decades ahead. It's going to replace our disputes about stem cells and cloning and whatever. Because our technologies are carrying us forward. Parents are already making choices for such things as a child's sex and the list of abilities is growing with the technology.  CONAN: And you also point out in your book, and in an article that you've written, as well, for the Washington Post, that this is not necessarily a popular choice.   Dr. GREEN: Oh, I don't think so at all. In fact, in my experience, most people are opposed to this. I was teaching a class at Dartmouth Medical School just a few days ago and I asked the class, how do they feel about making choices to have children that have fewer susceptibilities to disease?   Maybe enhanced stabilities? Do you support that? And 80 percent of the class raised their hand, no. Said they did not support it. These are medical students. So I think the feeling here is overwhelming against. But I think it's a feeling that is going to fade as the technologies become available.  CONAN: Nevertheless, a lot of people have that visceral reaction that this is - this is hubris. This is playing God.   Dr. GREEN: I understand that. Let's remember that 20 or 30 years ago, people had a similar visceral reaction against the first test-tube babies and said this is going to replace parenting, change parenting. A million children have been born since baby Louise Brown and they have made their lives, the lives of their families, as bright and happy as can be. We learn to adapt to new technologies.   CONAN: We want to invite a lot of callers in on this conversation. 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr. org, and why don't we begin with Marlene, Marlene calling us from St. Louis in Missouri. Marlene, are you there? Marlene? There we are, Marlene can hear us now.   MARLENE (Caller): Yes.  CONAN: Go ahead, please.  MARLENE: OK. I have two comments. The first is that there is a very bright line between preventing disease, something, that if we had the capacity to correct after birth, we would do so then, as well, and modifying something like hair color or eye color, that are inconsequential.   And the second point is that the real problem with the latter is that of unreasonable expectations. You've decided what this child is going to be and nothing they do is ever going to be good enough unless they are better than Michael Jordan at basketball because you decided they're going to be seven-foot-two.   CONAN: Unreasonable expectations, it's going to change the nature of parenting. What do you think, Robert Green?  Dr. GREEN: Well, I think Marlene's concerns are very legitimate. And I, to some extent, share them. But I think we have to think a little bit beyond what we know and are expecting. First of all, this bright line between disease and what is called improvement or enhancement, making people better than well.   Medicine is now actively involved in the second, whole reaches of medicine. Plastic surgery, cosmetic surgery, forms of sports medicine are already involved in going beyond disease prevention. And doctors are involved. So I think we are going to see this extended as well to the reproductive genetic area. Unreasonable expectations, yes, a concern.   One of the most commonly-voiced concerns. My response to that, it's a funny kind of a statement. Parents love what they get. Parents can expect a Michael Jordan or a Tiger Woods, and they will put up with a kid who is just middling. Not merely put up with, they think they will love that child. So I think we underestimate parental affection and parental bonding and parental love as we express that fear.   CONAN: Marlene, what do you think?  MARLENE: I think that's true for the majority of parents, but not all, and I'm afraid that the exceptions would self-select for - my child has to be the tallest, the strongest, the smartest, the most beautiful. Whatever.   CONAN: And that - go ahead. I'm sorry, Ron.  Dr. GREEN: Yes, again, I think Marlene is making a very solid point. Some people will be irresponsible. Marlene, let's remember, a lot of parents are irresponsible right now without any genetic technology at all.   MARLENE: True.  Dr. GREEN: They pressure children way beyond their capabilities. So I think this is a persistent problem in parenting that we'll just have to live with.  CONAN: It sounds like you've got some expectations there with you, Marlene.  MARLENE: Yes, two of them.  CONAN: Two of them. How are they working out?  MARLENE: Oh, they are doing pretty well.  CONAN: All right, well, take care of them.   MARLENE: Thanks.  CONAN: Thanks very much for the call. Let's see if we can get, this is Drew. Drew is with us form Tallahassee, Florida.  DREW (Caller): Hi. How are you doing?  CONAN: Very well, thank you.   DREW: I actually - my initial question, kind of, was more what Marlene was asking, but it led me to start thinking that, if you offer this kind of genetic engineering, this selectivity for children, to what degree does that play into how it is available to what socioeconomic class? Do we just now say, OK, all you rich people can have healthy babies, but poor people, this technology is not available to you, sorry?   CONAN: Ronald Green, you call this the development of the genobility.  Dr. GREEN: Exactly. And it's again one of the most frequently voiced concerns in this area. The rich will not only be rich. The haves will not only have. But they'll have and get more. They'll add to their financial resources, genetic aptitudes and abilities. That will create this terrible class divide until such time as maybe we'll have two species so different biologically and socially that they no longer even interbreed with one another.   Those are concerns that I think we're going to have to adjust - respond to them by making certain that those things which really assist development, and achievement, and well-being, are available to everyone. I see these genetic technologies as a part of our debate about a national health system of some sort. And I think we're going to have to see these.   Let's remember this, a lot of people forget the point, there are many problems that hold people back. I had a nephew who was seriously impeded in his advancement by reading problems. If we can address those problems early, rather than going through of years of effort in school, maybe we could help people avoid falling to the bottom of our social ladder.   CONAN: Drew, thanks very much for the call.   DREW: Thank you.  CONAN: Also with us today is Marcy Darnovsky, associate director at the Center for Genetics and Society in Oakland, California. She's with us today from the studios at the University of California at Berkley's School of Journalism. It's nice to welcome you to Talk of the Nation, too.   Dr. MARCY DARNOVSKY (Associate Director, The Center for Genetics and Society): Thank you, Neal.   CONAN: And where do we cross the line between legitimate medical purposes, elimination of disease, and cosmetic genetics? Is there a bright line?  Dr. DARNOVSKY: I think there is a bright line. But the bright line isn't between therapy and enhancement. The bright line is really between the kinds of genetic technologies that we use on ourselves, or on other existing individuals, on the one hand.   And between what we would do to future generations, to our own children. And I think that's the line that we have to observe. And it's the line that, in fact, dozens of countries around the world, who have thought about this, and debated it, have already adopted as policy.   So, while a lot of these genetic and reproductive technologies raise very troubling questions, questions of ethics, questions of social implications, questions that Marlene and Drew already brought up, the line that divides what we do to ourselves and what we do to our children, and our children's children, is one that is like the hydrogen bomb of these technologies. That's the one we have to be careful of.   CONAN: But if, like these couples in Britain, you could breed breast cancer out of your family line. What's wrong with that?  Dr. DARNOVSKY: Well, they're not - what they're doing is selecting embryos. And while there is a lot to talk about there, pro, con, maybe, maybe not, when we talk about actually genetically engineering, when we talk about going in and mucking around with the genes, that's where we cross the Rubicon. That's where, I think we say, you know, we have to say off the table.   That one is too dangerous to the children, because we haven't talked yet about safety concerns which I know that Ron Green is concerned about. But what we've seen with animal experiments, in cloning, and in genetic engineering, is that there's hundreds and hundreds of mistakes along the way. And while that's one thing in animals, it's quite another thing to think about doing that in human beings. We just don't allow that kind of experimentation, and I hope we never will.   CONAN: Ten fingers and ten toes used to be enough. What if you could also choose sex, health, even the eye color of your children? More on reproductive genetics next. If you'd like to get in on the conversation, 800-989-8255. Email us at talk@npr. org. Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan. It's the Talk of the Nation from NPR News.   (Soundbite of music)  CONAN: This is Talk of the Nation. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. As genetic engineering advances steadily, the ethical implications are staggering. We may be able to make choices about our children that could be social as well as medical. We're talking about some of the policy questions we may have to consider in the future.   Our guests are Ronald Green, professor for the study of ethics in human values at Dartmouth College, as well as Marcy Darnovsky. She's associate director at the Center for Genetics in Society in Oakland, California. Of course, we want to hear from you. If you have questions about the ethics of genetic engineering, or what this technology means, 800-989-8255.   Email us, talk@npr. org, and you can read what other listeners have to say on our blog at npr. org/blogofthenation. Ronald Green, as we were going to the break, Marcy Darnovsky was raising questions about safety and certainly in the experiments with animals - more than experiments at this point with animals, that is a major issue.   Dr. GREEN: Oh, definitely so. I think that we are going to have to watch very carefully as these first experiments are done. As we go beyond selection to actual gene targeting and gene manipulation.   But I don't think safety is going to shut this off forever and indefinitely. I would remind Marcy, and once again, the first experiments in reproductive technologies, IVF, Intracytoplasmic sperm injection, to help infertile men. All of these involve an initial risk. There's always that first set of experiments.   You try to make those as safe as possible. In the realm of genetics, we may be able to make our changes reversible, so that if problems develop, they can be cancelled. All of this will have to be looked into. But we will, I believe, certainly step across that line and do those first experiments some years from now.   CONAN: Marcy Darnovsky, you agree?  Dr. DARNOVSKY: I don't. I think that would be terribly unethical, human experimentation. I think we would also would be engaging on a huge social and political experiment of the kind that Drew, your caller Drew, raised before. I think we would be starting toward - down the road toward a Gattaca-like world.   CONAN: Gattaca, the famous science fiction movie where there were two breeds of people, the superior enhanced people and they looked down on the poor pitiful naturals.   Dr. DARNOVSKY: That's right. They were called the valids and invalids in Gattaca. And the genobility is another term, and the genrich, and the naturals. But the basic story is you're going to have genetically enhanced people, a small percentage of the population, they'll run the show, the government, the academia.   And the rest of us, the naturals, will sweep the floors. And on both sides of this debate, both those like Ronald Green, who are promoting the use of this technologies, and people like myself, who want to draw some lines, there's an acknowledgement that that is a very likely outcome of using technologies of genetic enhancement in future generations.   And I think it's commendable that Ron Green raises this as a concern, which he does in his book, in his articles. But then his response is, well, I think that's overblown, that's not so dire. Don't panic, he says in his book. But he really doesn't propose any mechanisms of democratic control to deal with that problem.   CONAN: Ronald Green?  Dr. GREEN: Well, I really have to differ with Marcy a little bit on that point. I do propose some mechanisms. I believe in a decentralized, pluralistic system of oversight that would include some federal government initiatives at the research level. Practitioners have standards of care. They have to be responsible to the patient, in some cases, to the child that they produce.   I think parental education plays a role. I think what I'm really opposed to only is some kind of centralized, super genetic agency, because I think that such an agency would stop everything. In this country, for example, we've begun to permit couples to use sex selection at the embryonic level, just for family balance.   Not to have, necessarily, a favored child, but if they've had two boys in a row, and want a girl, we've begun to permit that. In more authoritarian societies, that's forbidden. People don't have that liberty. And I'm really trying to defend parental genetic choices, I say in the title of my book.  CONAN: And Marcy Darnovsky, there's another aspect of this, which some might say you're overlooking. Which is, yes some countries have considered it. Others have not. And if this technology arrives in the next ten years, 20 years, say, there's going to be places where people are going to be able to do this. And there's going to always be people with money who want to do it.   Dr. DARNOVSKY: Well, that's one of the concerns. So, I think it's important for us, in this country, which we're the outlier really. Almost all the countries with any substantial biotechnology program have considered it, and have put these lines into place. There's lots of - still areas to talk about.   But there's lots of decisions to be made, and I think the lines will, you know, shift here and there and the other place. But I think there are just one or two very dangerous applications that ought to be taken off the table. And those are reproductive cloning and what we've called inheritable genetic modification. That allows the enhancement of future children.   And I think to say that, you know, we have allowed, in this country, sex selection is really to say that the marketplace has allowed it. And in the United States that, I think, to our detriment, is really the public policy that we have. We allow those with money to determine what research is done, what applications are developed, and who gets to buy the goods - the consumer goods on offer, in which, in this case, are goods about selecting the traits of our children.   CONAN: Let's go to Daniel, Daniel calling us from San Antonio, Texas.   DANIEL (Caller): Yes, my question relates to Gattaca. In that movie, wasn't the insurance company making the policies about who became a valid and invalid? And how to prevent that the insurance companies from saying, hey, your baby has to have this gene, or that gene and what not? Because I don't want to live in a world like that.   CONAN: Or that, if you don't program to get rid of it, the - your rates will go through the roof, or become unsupportable, or something like that. So are we - is Hartford like to be the source of our next dystopia, do you think? Marcy, what do you think?  Dr. DARNOVSKY: Well, I think that we do have to be concerned about genetic discrimination. And there are proposals for prohibiting that. And I think that is a good example of the way that the government does have to get involved. Because we need public policy, we need - you know, we elect candidates, and we have our representatives debate about tax policies.   But we really have not developed democratic mechanisms for shaping powerful technologies that effect our lives, that effect our life and death chances that each of us has. I think we really need those, and I think it's going to involve public policy and government regulation.  CONAN: Ronald Green, I know you were trying to get in there. I apologize.   Dr. GREEN: Well, I think the insurance thing is a real issue. We've just seen a proposal before Congress to prohibit insurance companies from doing just that kind of thing. I think I would support that very strongly. I think we're going to have to see more of that. But let me caution once again about the heavy hand of government here. Not too long ago, the Italian government passed a law that limited IVF very radically. The number of procedures. . .  CONAN: In vitro fertilization, yes.   Dr. GREEN: Exactly. It was driven by religious and other individuals. They seized the levers of governmental power. Now Italian couples are traveling elsewhere to have children. I think we have to be very careful about having super-government control and oversight. I would rather see parents playing a role. I'd rather see physicians playing a role. I'd rather see some regulation of government, but in a pluralistic system.   CONAN: Daniel, thanks very much for the call.   DANIEL: Thank you very much.   CONAN: Let's go now to Jeff, Jeff calling us from Grand Rapids in Michigan.   JEFF (Caller): Hello. Thank you for taking my call.   CONAN: Go ahead, please.   JEFF: My issue concerns - I read somewhere, I can't remember. I believe it might have been in The Advocate, which concerned issues, would parents play into sexual orientation, that possibly you could have parents where their attitude might be, I don't have a problem with gay or lesbian people, but I don't want one as a child.   To the point, where they could pick and choose things such as their sexual orientation. So, I guess to make a long story short, where would you say you draw the line where it becomes actual concern over things such as health. And situations where they just want certain undesirable, quote, unquote, elements going in, or just simply just want to have a child but they can write brag letters at Christmas.   CONAN: Ronald Green?  Dr. GREEN: Well, once again, the justice issue is really acute there. Do we want to decimate the communities of people with different sexual orientation and the like, using this? I'm concerned about this. I can see a professional standard that says we do not assist people selecting for sexual orientation.   On the other hand, I would remind us of something that a colleague of mine, who's responsible, in part, for the discovery of what has been called the gay gene, has said repeatedly. For every straight set of parents who might not want to have a gay child, there might be a gay set of parents who'd want to have a gay child. So I'm not sure that, in the end, parental choice, informed parental choice, free parental choice, won't mostly address these problems.   JEFF: All right. Thank you very much.   CONAN: Okay, Jeff, thanks for the call. Here's an email from Dan. All moral, ethical concerns aside, can you ask your guests about the dangers of monoculture? How do we know which traits we keep or eliminate are beneficial in the larger, longer-term sense of the species? Marcy Darnovsky, is that a concern for you?   Dr. DARNOVSKY: That's somewhat of a concern, and in fact, we don't know. But for me, the really major concern, it really is about equality. It really is about setting up a world where, you know, based on the very basic thing we know about the dynamics of inequality in a market society.  We are setting ourselves up for this genobility, this world of the genrich, this world in which if you're wealthy enough to get the right gene cassettes implanted in you when you - by your parents, then you have a chance to get ahead in the world, and the 90 percent or 95 percent who don't, are going to be one down and stay there, and it's going to be inscribed in our genes.   CONAN: And Ronald Green, you say in your book and in your piece that this might be a transitional phase until many of these things are available generally to the entire population, but there's many a slip between step A and step B.   Dr. GREEN: Certainly that is the case, and sometimes those people who spend their money and think they're going to get something really extraordinary will be very disappointed. That young Einstein may turn out to be a ne'er-do-well. But I think there is a self correction here. Let me say that I think - I certainly agree with what Marcy is saying, but I also see genetics as a way of addressing social inequities. Take the issue of reading.   We were not evolved to read. Reading is a very recent development. And millions and millions of people around the world have reading disorders of one sort or the other. If we could tag the genes that contribute to that and just tweak those genes so that every youngster has a good opportunity at school, we might actually begin to address these problems in ways that are far better than all of our after-a-child-is-born efforts.   CONAN: Marcy, let me ask you that same question but in the form of this email from Paul in Boise, Idaho. I have to admit that the idea of genetic fiddling makes me nervous, but when I try to think of a moral objection, I come up empty. We have no objection when surgery is performed to correct for eyesight or physical disabilities after birth. Why not correct for these before birth?   Dr. DARNOVSKY: I think the objection is that we're opening up the door to a society of the genrich and the naturals, and I think we've been working for so many centuries to address inequalities and to establish civil rights and to increase our toleration of differences.   And I think, you know, to say that we're going to go down this road to address dyslexia, I mean, we know if we want to improve the lives of our children, I think we know how to do that. We give kids basic medical care. We give them loving families. We give them good educations. That's the way to improve the lives of children, not to be fiddling around with their genes.   CONAN: Marcy Darnovsky of the Center for Genetics and Society in Oakland, California. Also with us, Ronald Green, professor for the study of ethics and human values at Dartmouth College, and the author of \"Babies by Design: The Ethics of Genetic Choice. \" You're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News. Let's see if we can get Richard on the line, Richard with us from Springfield, Pennsylvania.   RICHARD (Caller): Yes, I was wondering, has anybody thought what happened before World War II, the ten years where they pronounced that, you know, gene selection and not letting people intermarry that were semi-retarded. . .  CONAN: I think he's talking about eugenics, or what some called Social Darwinism. Ronald Green?   RICHARD: Look what happened during World War II in Germany.   CONAN: Yes, that's where we're going to ask Ronald Green to respond to.   Dr. GREEN: Well, I've thought about this, certainly, Richard, and actually address it at somewhat - some great length in my book. I think this is, again, a real fear, we certainly never want to go back to anything like that, but I would point out two things. First of all, those - that eugenics movement, in this country and Germany and England, was first of all based on complete crackpot science.   There was no scientific foundation to almost anything that they said or did. We've entered a period of much greater responsibility in genetic information. The second thing I would say is that it was a government-run program. It was the government trying to promote something, and what I've been fighting for in this work and in other things is precisely getting the government, to a large extent, out of this area.  So that parents by themselves can make responsible and informed choices. Sure, some of those parents are going to make bad choices, but I want to protect reproductive liberty, and that includes the liberty to think about the ways in which you can improve your child's genetic inheritance.   Dr. DARNOVSKY: You know, when you call that bad science, though, Ron, at the time, that was the science of the day. Now, certainly we have greater scientific knowledge now, but 50 years from now, our science today, we're going to see all kinds of errors and erroneous ways of thinking in it.   So I think that is a weak argument. And you know, I think also we should keep in mind that the eugenics of the 20th century was not just government run. There were all these contests at the state fairs about the fitter families.   There were people in Germany who were encouraged to have better children because they were thought to have better genes. So I think it's not really so clear cut that the eugenics - the consumer market-driven eugenics that we're talking about today would be so different in its outcome from what we saw in the 20th century.   CONAN: Let's get John on the line, John with us from Minneapolis.   JOHN (Caller): I think a lot of the argument that they've had in the show so far unfortunately is moot, because any technology like this will be done somewhere in the world at some point. It's already happening.   In my field, I'm a general surgeon, and natural orifice surgery is sort of the new thing, meaning taking out the appendix or other organs out the mouth or out the backside, and a lot of Third World countries are doing this, not doing it in trials, they're just doing it because it can be done. And once this sort of technology can be proven to be done, it will be done.   CONAN: And that gets back to that policy question, Marcy Darnovsky.   Dr. DARNOVSKY: Well, you know, we make policies not because we think that that's going to cover every single instance in the world, and we have laws against murder and people are still killed, but we would live in a different world if we didn't have those laws.   CONAN: OK. John - well, this is an important part of your argument, Ronald Green, that this is inevitable, so we have to figure out a way to moderate it.   Dr. GREEN: Very much so. I'm not one who thinks that because something is inevitable, we have to go along with it. We can mold it, shape it, change it, and I think we should do all those things. But I feel with a great degree of certainty that we're going to carry this technology into our own self-modification. Maybe not in ten years, more like decades ahead, but I think it's almost a certainty.   So the question is, how do we do it so that we minimize the damage and produce the humane society that we want? For me, the key to that - the key to that is informing parents, guiding parents, helping parents. Parents, I believe, want the best for their children, and I really would trust parents more than I would any kind of regulatory authority to make these decisions.   CONAN: John, thank you very much for the call. Marcy Darnovsky and Ronald Green, thank you both for your time today. We appreciate it.   Dr. GREEN: Thank you.   Dr. DARNOVSKY: Thank you.   CONAN: Just this final thought, an email from Jeremy in Jackson, Michigan. I've heard redheads are going to disappear from the genetic pool in the near future. Might this technology allow us to ensure the possibility of a continuation of the gene that creates redheads? Just a thought. Coming up, the Papal visit poses logistical problems and a few sartorial ones. We'll explain. It's Talk of the Nation from NPR News.

Last year, a biologist in New York State reported finding thousands of bats dead, or soon-to-be-dead bats, that had an unusual, white, fuzzy coating around their noses. And that fuzz turned out to be a fungus.  And that's the only visible symptom of the disease which scientists have dubbed \"white-nose syndrome. \" The illness hits bats that are hibernating in caves or mines and it causes them to lose weight. They emerge early. They are premature, right in the middle of the snow, presumably going out looking for food. And so far, hundreds of thousands have died, and scientists are scrambling to find out the cause.  The disease is not isolated to just New York State. It has spread to other parts of the Northeast, including Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts and possibly Pennsylvania. And if you'd like to visit one of those bat caves, we have a video for us. Flora Lichtman, our digital producer, went to upstate New York into a bat cave.  And you can take it towards the bat cave and see the bats, the dead and dying bats, and the scientists there taking samples, on our Web page, sciencefriday. com. Talking to me now - talking with me now to elucidate are my next guests. Elizabeth Buckles is a veterinary pathologist. She is also assistant professor of pathology at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell. Thanks for being with us today. Dr. ELIZABETH BUCKLES (Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University): Hi, Ira. How are you doing? FLATOW: You're welcome. Thomas Kunz is a professor of biology and director of the Center of Ecology and Conservation Biology at Boston University. And I want to thank you, Dr. Kunz, for taking time to visit with us today. Dr. THOMAS KUNZ (Director, Center of Ecology and Conservation Biology, Boston University): Thank you, Ira. FLATOW: How mysterious, Tom, is this? Dr. KUNZ: Well, it is very mysterious. In my lifetime - I've been studying, doing research on bats for over 40 years, and I must say this is an unprecedented event. We really have never seen anything like it. FLATOW: How was it discovered? Dr. KUNZ: Well, basically, cavers and biologists who annually - or actually every two years, visit caves to do a census, and when they were visiting some of these winter hibernacula in New York State, they noticed this very unusual fungus on the nose. And in the year 2006, 2007, that winter, there weren't a lot of them.  There were only a few caves in which they saw a few bats that had this fungus, and it was an alarm, you know, was set off at that time, but really, there was nothing other than trying to survey other caves to see the extent of this. This year - and there were a number of - several thousand bats killed in that year. I think there were three caves that white-nose was discovered in, but you know, it was people - and I think Beth can probably address some of this.  There were samples that were sent off to different laboratories to try to identify the fungus, to try to identify whether they had certain pathogens or there were contaminants and so on, but nothing to date. Even in specimens that had been examined this year show any signs of this contamination or pathogenicity. FLATOW: We're talking about the mysterious deaths of bats all over the Northeast this hour. Talk of the Nation Science Friday from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow, with Elizabeth Buckles and Thomas Kunz. Beth, I was watching a video that we went into the bat cave. Flora went in there and it's just amazing. She was showing us that the bats have little white speckles on their skin. Dr. BUCKLES: Right, right. That is the first sign that there's something wrong with the cave, and I want to emphasize that this is a syndrome and the fungus appears to be a sign of a sick bat or a sick cave, rather than, necessarily, the cause of death. So, it's just the most visible marker that something is going wrong in the hibernacula. FLATOW: But the whiskers, tell us about why the whiskers are white. Dr. BUCKLES: Well, what it seems to be is fungal colonies that are actually growing on the nose and on and around the skin of the nose. If you were to pick up one of these bats and spread its wings, you can also find similar colonies on the skin of the wings, the patagium and the tail skin. FLATOW: And so, there are people now taking samples and trying to figure out where or what it is. As you say, it's a syndrome, we don't know what the agent is yet. Dr. BUCKLES: Right, or if there is the agent. So, you know, it's - when we were contacted by the New York Department of Environmental Conservation, the veterinary school initiated a disease-outbreak investigation. And because we were dealing with dead animals, what we did is we began with growth necropsy examinations.  And looking at the histology, the microscopic examination of their tissues, we also submitted tissues to numerous labs including our own animal health and diagnostic lab, to survey for viruses, fungi, and bacteria. To date, we have no consistent findings.  We can culture fungus from the skin of bats, but when I look at that underneath the microscope, there doesn't seem to be any reaction to the fungus that is on their skin. So, the bats aren't responding to it and it's very superficial. We also don't see any damage to the internal organs because of the fungus or any other pathogens. FLATOW: So, what it looks like - from seeing the video, it looks like the bats wake up in the middle of the hibernation season. . . Dr. KUNTZ: Well, Ira. . . FLATOW: They fly out, and they die of hunger. Dr. KUNZ: Yes. I mean, one of the clearer conditions of these bats, as you pointed out early on, is that they basically have used up most of their fat by midwinter. Normally, they'll have fat reserves that sustain them through the winter. It makes it possible for them to arouse and go out and to start feeding.  And this is usually by mid- to late April is when they - they're starting to emerge now, on warmer days or warmer evenings. But the curious thing is that the fat is basically depleted by midwinter, and in fact, some of the bats cannot arouse. And there are actually two different kinds of fat that hibernators have, and that they have what is called brown fat and white fat.  The brown fat is just a little pad of a very highly-vascularized, with a large number of mitochondria in it, which is basically like a little furnace. And this makes it possible for bats to undergo the first stage of arousal. The bat's a hibernator, the first stage of arousal, what is known as non-shivering thermogenesis.  It's a metabolic heat, basically, produced by the metabolism that goes on in this little brown fat. The fuel is the white fat that we, all of us have, but this fuel has been depleted, and also the furnace seems to be also - that is, the brown fat, seems to be depleted. . . FLATOW: Right. Tom, I'm going to have to interrupt a little. We'll talk more about the bat physiology with this, right after the short break. Stay with us. We'll be right back.  (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is Talk of the Nation Science Friday from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to Talk of the Nation Science Friday.

We're talking this hour about the bats that were mysterious die off in upstate New York, and parts of New England, now spreading around, maybe even into Pennsylvania. Hundreds of thousands of bats dying of a mysterious syndrome that's killing them. They're losing weight and we - Flora Lichtman went into one of these bat caves in upstate New York and here's what. . . (Soundbite of bats)  FLATOW: That's the sound of a little brown bat.  (Soundbite of bats)  FLATOW: And we have video of that trip that Flora went in there and you can see the cave, and the scientists are trying to figure out what's killing off these bats, on our Web site, on sciencefriday. com.  Here with me to talk about what the possibilities are and to talk more about the disease are, back with us, are my guests, Elizabeth Buckles, a veterinary pathologist, and Thomas Kunz, a professor of biology at Boston University. Tom, you were - when I interrupted you, you were talking to us about how the bats were starving slowly to death by the loss of the fat that they normally would have. Dr. KUNZ: Yes, Ira. What it turns out is that many of the bats that are afflicted by white-nose syndrome, either - some are able to arouse and they do go out and fly around, as you pointed out in midwinter. There's snow on the ground and so on.  But many of them simply don't arouse at all and die right in the caves, and that's the part of the reason why we're concerned that, you know, that they've lost the body fat, they've - and why they are metabolizing or losing so much fat over the winter. There are the other hypotheses about why they run out of fat in midwinter, and one of them is they may not have put on enough fat in the fall. Typically, they put on fat in September and early October and then enter hibernation.  It's very possible that, for reasons that we don't know, that maybe insect populations happened to be low due to the spraying of pesticides. They may have eaten insects that were sprayed with pesticides. That may have affected their ability to deposit fat. They're just - there're a number of just unknowns at this point. FLATOW: So, if people are going out now, the weather is getting better. They may be finding sick or dead and dying bats littering all over the cave spaces. Dr. BUCKLES: That and on the landscape, and what we caution is, whenever you approach any wild animal, you should do so with extreme caution. If the public does encounter a bat that they believe is sick or injured or may be affected by this, what we're recommending is they contact, at least in New York, the Regional Department of Environmental Conservation Office or the Department of Health. FLATOW: Mm hm. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to the phone, Alex in Dearborn. Hi, Alex. ALEX (Caller): Hi, Ira, I'm glad to be on the air. I have a question. Last year, I heard about the bees that were abandoning their hives. . . FLATOW: Right. ALEX: And I know that bats consume large quantities of insects. And I just wondered if there was any kind of cross-correlation between insect populations crashing or abandoning their normal habitats, and if this could be affecting the bats, because they are kind of the top of the food chain. FLATOW: Good question, yeah. Good question. Dr. KUNZ: Well, it's a good question and one we don't have a good answer to. I think I could you know, simply point out that, you know, first of all, bats don't eat bees, but as you suggest, that whatever is affecting the bees or something similar to that may be affecting other insect populations.  And there is simply not enough insects to go around at that time of year when they're depositing fat, they may not be putting on sufficient amounts of fat.  There is always a threshold of when the insects, whatever they happen to be, there may be a threshold level that will not sustain these bats. Dr. BUCKLES:  The one thing that bees and bats do have in common, they are animals that have very different physiology, obviously.  But the reason bees get a lot of press and people notice is because these are animals that congregate in large numbers.  So, if something happens to affect them, large numbers of them are affected, and we get these spectacular die-offs.  So it is concerning that we have die-offs in animals that tend to roost together, but as far as a direct correlation, that would be something that would be purely speculative. FLATOW:  Tom, if all of these hundreds of thousands of bats, and who knows, could be more that we haven't discovered yet are dying, don't bats eat a lot of mosquitoes and things like that? Dr. KUNZ:  Well, it turns out that bats don't eat as many mosquitoes as sometimes people say they do.  They do eat lots of insects, and many of the insects they do eat are pests, particularly pests of gardens, garden crops, and agricultural crops, and forest trees, and so on.  So they do play a very important role in suppressing insect populations. In terms of actually having their impact on mosquitoes is probably overblown. FLATOW:  But there is a niche in the ecosystem that they occupy. Dr. KUNZ:  Absolutely.  These are all bats that feed on insects, and they, you know, they forage long distances away from where they roost.  They can fly, you know, several kilometers a night in feeding.  They eat up to their body weight a night in insects, when, if there are enough insects there.  So it's a very important role that they do play. FLATOW:  We have a question from Tammy(ph), on Second Life.  And she says, is it possible they're being preyed upon less.  And hence, they are over populated and being stressed more of that, who eats bats is what. . . Dr. KUNZ:  I would say they are not over populated.  In fact, over the years, bat populations have declined worldwide.  They have been declining in New York State.  They have been declining, in fact, throughout the rate most species have.  Not only bats that roost in and hibernate in caves, and roost in buildings and so on, but also, ones that roost in trees, and are migratory species.  They have actually been - there are high mortalities that are occurring.  In fact, interestingly - the previous - when you're previous part of the program, when you were talking about renewable energy and so on, wind energy is one of those forms of renewable energy.  And it turns out that wind turbines are killing large numbers of bats that previously have never been killed before like that.  So, you know, they were sort of getting hit, the tree-dwelling bats are getting hit by the wind turbines and whatever white nose is, is also affecting those.  I would say, there is not an over population of bats anywhere. FLATOW:  1-800-989-8255.  Our listeners are trying to scratch their heads and think about them.  What, could it be themselves?  John in Ellerbe in North Carolina, right? JOHN (Caller):  Right.  My question is, have you done some investigation into their immune system?  I know, it's hard to isolate the viruses that seem to cause HIV.  Could it be that if you look into their T-cells and whatnot, you could find some explanation for this disease? Dr. BUCKLES:  Those are on-going studies, and I think some people that Tom works with, up in Boston have been doing those studies.  So they have some good baseline data.  But that is a question that we are asking ourselves, if there could be an immuno-suppressant virus or other immunosuppressive affects.  Even if you had an immuno-suppressive agent, you know, people who have HIV or immuno-suppression, don't die of HIV.  They die of all the concomitant infections, opportunistic infections that inhabit their body.  So, although the immune system is very important and it's something we need to investigate, we're not seeing an overwhelming infection in these bats with an opportunistic bacteria, or virus, or fungus. FLATOW:  Could there be some environmental factor from something man-made, some kind of pollution, or lead, or something, mercury, something like that? Dr. BUCKLES:  Yes, the toxicology studies are also ongoing.  Unfortunately, toxicology is very complex.  It's not like on television where you just submit a piece of tissue and say, run toxicology. FLATOW:  Oh! No! Dr. BUCKLES:  Oh! It's not.  So, you have to ask for a certain test.  So, we've done basically the first initial line of testing for common pesticides, lead, and other heavy metals.  That has not turned up anything but now we have to look in to some other pesticides that aren't as common, some other chemicals in the environment or could the chemical in the environment be having a secondary effect on the bats by killing insects?  So, there may not be a straight line to this answer. FLATOW:  Well, the reason I asked is because all that wind keeps blowing in the Northeast you know, from everywhere else.  It winds up there with all the schmutz in it and that comes from all the power plants and things up wind. Dr. KUNZ:  That's right. FLATOW:  And you know, we've had insects right, the insects with high levels of heavy metals in them dying.  And you've had - you know, it first started out with acidified lakes and things like that. Dr. KUNZ:  There examples in recent years of declines of moth populations are not just here in the Northeast, in other parts of the world.  So, I think we have to really take a very close look at - not only what is possibly causing the declines of these insect populations, but again, if there's a link to the decline in the insect populations and white nose.  That's something we're all scrambling with various kinds of hypothesis.  A group has been formed, a group of scientists from several different laboratories across the U. S.  We're going to be meeting in June to try to put our heads together to try to figure out where we go next with this.  But clearly it's a problem that we're going to have to try to face, and you know, many of us here are putting our heads together to do that. FLATOW:  If you do find out that there is vector like a virus or a bacteria, something like that.  Is there anything you could do about you know, giving medicine, so to speak, or antibiotics, whatever we might need, to the bats?  Can you give them, you know? Dr. KUNZ:  Well, I don't think that's a practical solution.  You know, this has been, people have discussed this with regard the rabies.  Can we immunize all wild animals?  And certainly it's been done to some extent with wolves and canids in certain parts of the world.  But it would be very impractical to try to immunize bats in their caves or other roosts.  I mean you raised a very good question.  What do we do if we identified something, whether it's a virus or whether it's a bacterium, or whether it's a contaminant or so on?  All we can do is raise the issue that if it is something like a contaminant, then it's a little bit more easily solved.  When it is say a pathogen of some sort, it may take its toll on the population.  As in most organisms, you know, there's a certain distribution of different kinds of characteristics that organisms have.  There's a variation, and there's going to be some that will survive. Dr. BUCKLES:  And what we would do is we had talked to the management expert the Fish and Wild Life Service, Department of Environmental Conservation, the agencies in the different states.  And talk to them about what we do to optimize either the survival of these animals through the winter.  Are there ways we can relieve certain stresses that we'd have to identify or are there ways we can optimize the potential for the survivors to breed during the summer?  So if they do, if we do get a group of survivors, how can we help them best repopulate? FLATOW:  Talking about the bat die-off going on here in the Northeast on Talk of the Nation Science Friday from NPR News.  I imagine that the bell has gone out and people around the country, if not the world, are also looking for signs of these.  Would I be correct in assuming that? Dr. KUNZ:  Well, there are people looking in other states.  Certainly, and these bats that live here in the Northeast, also you know, live out in the Midwest and extend out into the western states and into the southern states, and so, it is a concern that if in fact it does spread, whatever it may be, we are going to have to really take a very careful look. FLATOW:  But if it doesn't spread, wouldn't that tell you something also? Dr. KUNZ:  It definitely would. Dr. BUCKLES:  It definitely would. Dr. KUNZ:  It would tell us something about there is something here in this region that may be causing this.  Now, one of the very curious things, many of the sites where white nose has been found are mines, that is, they are old abandoned mines.  There are a few caves in which white nose has been found, but most of them are mines, and you know, whether there is something affiliated, associated with conditions in the mines, there is one very curious observation that has been made, and that is that the sites where white nose has been found are largely those which have very high humidity, obviously cold, as the temperatures are in these caves, but the sites that do not have any evidence of at least the external manifestation like the white nose, are in very dry caves and mines.  So, there may be some link to water, there may be some link to the water - you know, the atmospheric conditions in you know, in moist environment versus a dry environment.  These are all things that we just simply are trying to grope with. FLATOW:  With the new outbreak of something not seen before, do you have new funding to take care of?  You know, with doing all this research? Dr. BUCKLES:  New funding?  That is always one of those things we have to talk about in strategic meetings is how to find funding to do these things.  Most states and some federal agencies do have a limited amount of funding to do disease research in wildlife for outbreak investigations, but what we are looking at here is finding funding for some fairly long-term studies, and that is one thing we're going to have to talk about. FLATOW:  And states these days don't have a lot of money to throw around. Dr. BUCKLES:  Yes.  The economy is not in a position right now where we think we're going to be particularly flushed with money to do a lot of things. FLATOW:  Maybe the Gates Foundation is listening. Dr. KUNZ:  We are exploring various options.  Certainly, private foundations, the federal government, as we know, the federal government moves very slowly on these things.  I mean, there are funding sources either through the potential sources, through the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health that we can explore.  But often times, those, it takes time to get those proposals together and get them reviewed and so on, but you know, what we're really looking for in the short run here are funds that can make it possible to really mobilize. Dr. BUCKLES:  Yes, something we could, to rattle it. . . FLATOW:  Are you looking for individual donations then? Dr. KUNZ:  Absolutely.  The individual donations, foundation donations. . . FLATOW:  If people want to donate, how should they contact this project? Dr. KUNZ:  Well, Bat Conservation International, based in Austin, Texas is one that is helping coordinate some of the research going on, and you know, they are a private foundation that is well-linked to this particular effort and certainly, the universities are involved.  There are a number of them and other state institutions, but I think it is best probably, funnel it toward Bat Conservation International. Dr. BUCKLES:  And you can certainly, again through our universities, you know contacting either Boston College or the College of Veterinary Medicine.  We could certainly help people who wanted to find a way to help with this issue.  FLATOW:  OK. Good mystery around it.  Thank you, and don't pick up those bats.  You see them lying them around in the caves. Dr. BUCKLES:  But call someone if you see them. FLATOW:  Yeah, yeah. Thank you, Elizabeth.  Elizabeth Buckles is Veterinary Pathologist and an Assistant Professor of Pathology at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell.  Thomas Kunz is Professor of Biology and Director of the Center for Ecology and Conservation at Boston University. Good luck to you. Dr. KUNZ:  Thank you, Ira. Dr. BUCKLES:  Thank you, Ira. FLATOW:  We'll stay in touch. Dr. KUNZ:  Okay, thanks. Bye. FLATOW:  You're welcome.  Greg Smith, composed our theme music, and we had help today from NPR Librarian, Kim Moleski(ph).

Have a great weekend.  Have a Happy Passover.  I'm Ira Flatow in New York.  IRA FLATOW, host:   For the rest of the hour, we're going to take a look at a mysterious epidemic that is killing bats by the hundreds of thousands. Last year, a biologist in New York State reported finding thousands of bats dead, or soon-to-be-dead bats, that had an unusual, white, fuzzy coating around their noses. And that fuzz turned out to be a fungus.   And that's the only visible symptom of the disease which scientists have dubbed \"white-nose syndrome. \" The illness hits bats that are hibernating in caves or mines and it causes them to lose weight. They emerge early. They are premature, right in the middle of the snow, presumably going out looking for food. And so far, hundreds of thousands have died, and scientists are scrambling to find out the cause.   The disease is not isolated to just New York State. It has spread to other parts of the Northeast, including Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts and possibly Pennsylvania. And if you'd like to visit one of those bat caves, we have a video for us. Flora Lichtman, our digital producer, went to upstate New York into a bat cave.   And you can take it towards the bat cave and see the bats, the dead and dying bats, and the scientists there taking samples, on our Web page, sciencefriday. com. Talking to me now - talking with me now to elucidate are my next guests. Elizabeth Buckles is a veterinary pathologist. She is also assistant professor of pathology at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell. Thanks for being with us today.  Dr. ELIZABETH BUCKLES (Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University): Hi, Ira. How are you doing?  FLATOW: You're welcome. Thomas Kunz is a professor of biology and director of the Center of Ecology and Conservation Biology at Boston University. And I want to thank you, Dr. Kunz, for taking time to visit with us today.  Dr. THOMAS KUNZ (Director, Center of Ecology and Conservation Biology, Boston University): Thank you, Ira.  FLATOW: How mysterious, Tom, is this?  Dr. KUNZ: Well, it is very mysterious. In my lifetime - I've been studying, doing research on bats for over 40 years, and I must say this is an unprecedented event. We really have never seen anything like it.  FLATOW: How was it discovered?  Dr. KUNZ: Well, basically, cavers and biologists who annually - or actually every two years, visit caves to do a census, and when they were visiting some of these winter hibernacula in New York State, they noticed this very unusual fungus on the nose. And in the year 2006, 2007, that winter, there weren't a lot of them.   There were only a few caves in which they saw a few bats that had this fungus, and it was an alarm, you know, was set off at that time, but really, there was nothing other than trying to survey other caves to see the extent of this. This year - and there were a number of - several thousand bats killed in that year. I think there were three caves that white-nose was discovered in, but you know, it was people - and I think Beth can probably address some of this.   There were samples that were sent off to different laboratories to try to identify the fungus, to try to identify whether they had certain pathogens or there were contaminants and so on, but nothing to date. Even in specimens that had been examined this year show any signs of this contamination or pathogenicity.  FLATOW: We're talking about the mysterious deaths of bats all over the Northeast this hour. Talk of the Nation Science Friday from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow, with Elizabeth Buckles and Thomas Kunz. Beth, I was watching a video that we went into the bat cave. Flora went in there and it's just amazing. She was showing us that the bats have little white speckles on their skin.  Dr. BUCKLES: Right, right. That is the first sign that there's something wrong with the cave, and I want to emphasize that this is a syndrome and the fungus appears to be a sign of a sick bat or a sick cave, rather than, necessarily, the cause of death. So, it's just the most visible marker that something is going wrong in the hibernacula.  FLATOW: But the whiskers, tell us about why the whiskers are white.  Dr. BUCKLES: Well, what it seems to be is fungal colonies that are actually growing on the nose and on and around the skin of the nose. If you were to pick up one of these bats and spread its wings, you can also find similar colonies on the skin of the wings, the patagium and the tail skin.  FLATOW: And so, there are people now taking samples and trying to figure out where or what it is. As you say, it's a syndrome, we don't know what the agent is yet.  Dr. BUCKLES: Right, or if there is the agent. So, you know, it's - when we were contacted by the New York Department of Environmental Conservation, the veterinary school initiated a disease-outbreak investigation. And because we were dealing with dead animals, what we did is we began with growth necropsy examinations.   And looking at the histology, the microscopic examination of their tissues, we also submitted tissues to numerous labs including our own animal health and diagnostic lab, to survey for viruses, fungi, and bacteria. To date, we have no consistent findings.   We can culture fungus from the skin of bats, but when I look at that underneath the microscope, there doesn't seem to be any reaction to the fungus that is on their skin. So, the bats aren't responding to it and it's very superficial. We also don't see any damage to the internal organs because of the fungus or any other pathogens.  FLATOW: So, what it looks like - from seeing the video, it looks like the bats wake up in the middle of the hibernation season. . .  Dr. KUNTZ: Well, Ira. . .  FLATOW: They fly out, and they die of hunger.  Dr. KUNZ: Yes. I mean, one of the clearer conditions of these bats, as you pointed out early on, is that they basically have used up most of their fat by midwinter. Normally, they'll have fat reserves that sustain them through the winter. It makes it possible for them to arouse and go out and to start feeding.   And this is usually by mid- to late April is when they - they're starting to emerge now, on warmer days or warmer evenings. But the curious thing is that the fat is basically depleted by midwinter, and in fact, some of the bats cannot arouse. And there are actually two different kinds of fat that hibernators have, and that they have what is called brown fat and white fat.   The brown fat is just a little pad of a very highly-vascularized, with a large number of mitochondria in it, which is basically like a little furnace. And this makes it possible for bats to undergo the first stage of arousal. The bat's a hibernator, the first stage of arousal, what is known as non-shivering thermogenesis.   It's a metabolic heat, basically, produced by the metabolism that goes on in this little brown fat. The fuel is the white fat that we, all of us have, but this fuel has been depleted, and also the furnace seems to be also - that is, the brown fat, seems to be depleted. . .  FLATOW: Right. Tom, I'm going to have to interrupt a little. We'll talk more about the bat physiology with this, right after the short break. Stay with us. We'll be right back.   (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is Talk of the Nation Science Friday from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to Talk of the Nation Science Friday. I'm Ira Flatow. A brief program note. This Wednesday, Neal Conan broadcasts live from the Newseum in Washington. And if you're going to be in Washington and you want a special event to go to, you can join the live audience there with Neal and all the gang in the Newseum.   But if you want tickets, this is what you have to do. Get your pencil out. You have to send an e-mail to talk - that's talk@npr. org, and in the subject line, put \"tickets. \" Don't put lunch or anything else. You want \"tickets,\" for talk@npr. org and that'll get you - hopefully there's tickets, there's room left, to get tickets there.   We're talking this hour about the bats that were mysterious die off in upstate New York, and parts of New England, now spreading around, maybe even into Pennsylvania. Hundreds of thousands of bats dying of a mysterious syndrome that's killing them. They're losing weight and we - Flora Lichtman went into one of these bat caves in upstate New York and here's what. . .  (Soundbite of bats)   FLATOW: That's the sound of a little brown bat.   (Soundbite of bats)   FLATOW: And we have video of that trip that Flora went in there and you can see the cave, and the scientists are trying to figure out what's killing off these bats, on our Web site, on sciencefriday. com.   Here with me to talk about what the possibilities are and to talk more about the disease are, back with us, are my guests, Elizabeth Buckles, a veterinary pathologist, and Thomas Kunz, a professor of biology at Boston University. Tom, you were - when I interrupted you, you were talking to us about how the bats were starving slowly to death by the loss of the fat that they normally would have.  Dr. KUNZ: Yes, Ira. What it turns out is that many of the bats that are afflicted by white-nose syndrome, either - some are able to arouse and they do go out and fly around, as you pointed out in midwinter. There's snow on the ground and so on.   But many of them simply don't arouse at all and die right in the caves, and that's the part of the reason why we're concerned that, you know, that they've lost the body fat, they've - and why they are metabolizing or losing so much fat over the winter. There are the other hypotheses about why they run out of fat in midwinter, and one of them is they may not have put on enough fat in the fall. Typically, they put on fat in September and early October and then enter hibernation.   It's very possible that, for reasons that we don't know, that maybe insect populations happened to be low due to the spraying of pesticides. They may have eaten insects that were sprayed with pesticides. That may have affected their ability to deposit fat. They're just - there're a number of just unknowns at this point.  FLATOW: So, if people are going out now, the weather is getting better. They may be finding sick or dead and dying bats littering all over the cave spaces.  Dr. BUCKLES: That and on the landscape, and what we caution is, whenever you approach any wild animal, you should do so with extreme caution. If the public does encounter a bat that they believe is sick or injured or may be affected by this, what we're recommending is they contact, at least in New York, the Regional Department of Environmental Conservation Office or the Department of Health.  FLATOW: Mm hm. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to the phone, Alex in Dearborn. Hi, Alex.  ALEX (Caller): Hi, Ira, I'm glad to be on the air. I have a question. Last year, I heard about the bees that were abandoning their hives. . .  FLATOW: Right.  ALEX: And I know that bats consume large quantities of insects. And I just wondered if there was any kind of cross-correlation between insect populations crashing or abandoning their normal habitats, and if this could be affecting the bats, because they are kind of the top of the food chain.  FLATOW: Good question, yeah. Good question.  Dr. KUNZ: Well, it's a good question and one we don't have a good answer to. I think I could you know, simply point out that, you know, first of all, bats don't eat bees, but as you suggest, that whatever is affecting the bees or something similar to that may be affecting other insect populations.  And there is simply not enough insects to go around at that time of year when they're depositing fat, they may not be putting on sufficient amounts of fat.  There is always a threshold of when the insects, whatever they happen to be, there may be a threshold level that will not sustain these bats.  Dr. BUCKLES:  The one thing that bees and bats do have in common, they are animals that have very different physiology, obviously.  But the reason bees get a lot of press and people notice is because these are animals that congregate in large numbers.  So, if something happens to affect them, large numbers of them are affected, and we get these spectacular die-offs.  So it is concerning that we have die-offs in animals that tend to roost together, but as far as a direct correlation, that would be something that would be purely speculative.  FLATOW:  Tom, if all of these hundreds of thousands of bats, and who knows, could be more that we haven't discovered yet are dying, don't bats eat a lot of mosquitoes and things like that?  Dr. KUNZ:  Well, it turns out that bats don't eat as many mosquitoes as sometimes people say they do.  They do eat lots of insects, and many of the insects they do eat are pests, particularly pests of gardens, garden crops, and agricultural crops, and forest trees, and so on.  So they do play a very important role in suppressing insect populations. In terms of actually having their impact on mosquitoes is probably overblown.  FLATOW:  But there is a niche in the ecosystem that they occupy.  Dr. KUNZ:  Absolutely.  These are all bats that feed on insects, and they, you know, they forage long distances away from where they roost.  They can fly, you know, several kilometers a night in feeding.  They eat up to their body weight a night in insects, when, if there are enough insects there.  So it's a very important role that they do play.  FLATOW:  We have a question from Tammy(ph), on Second Life.  And she says, is it possible they're being preyed upon less.  And hence, they are over populated and being stressed more of that, who eats bats is what. . .  Dr. KUNZ:  I would say they are not over populated.  In fact, over the years, bat populations have declined worldwide.  They have been declining in New York State.  They have been declining, in fact, throughout the rate most species have.  Not only bats that roost in and hibernate in caves, and roost in buildings and so on, but also, ones that roost in trees, and are migratory species.  They have actually been - there are high mortalities that are occurring.  In fact, interestingly - the previous - when you're previous part of the program, when you were talking about renewable energy and so on, wind energy is one of those forms of renewable energy.  And it turns out that wind turbines are killing large numbers of bats that previously have never been killed before like that.  So, you know, they were sort of getting hit, the tree-dwelling bats are getting hit by the wind turbines and whatever white nose is, is also affecting those.  I would say, there is not an over population of bats anywhere.  FLATOW:  1-800-989-8255.  Our listeners are trying to scratch their heads and think about them.  What, could it be themselves?

Dr. BUCKLES:  Yes, the toxicology studies are also ongoing.  Unfortunately, toxicology is very complex.  It's not like on television where you just submit a piece of tissue and say, run toxicology.  FLATOW:  Oh! No!  Dr. BUCKLES:  Oh! It's not.  So, you have to ask for a certain test.

So, there may not be a straight line to this answer.  FLATOW:  Well, the reason I asked is because all that wind keeps blowing in the Northeast you know, from everywhere else.  It winds up there with all the schmutz in it and that comes from all the power plants and things up wind.  Dr. KUNZ:  That's right.

I imagine that the bell has gone out and people around the country, if not the world, are also looking for signs of these.  Would I be correct in assuming that?  Dr. KUNZ:  Well, there are people looking in other states.  Certainly, and these bats that live here in the Northeast, also you know, live out in the Midwest and extend out into the western states and into the southern states, and so, it is a concern that if in fact it does spread, whatever it may be, we are going to have to really take a very careful look.  FLATOW:  But if it doesn't spread, wouldn't that tell you something also?  Dr. KUNZ:  It definitely would.  Dr. BUCKLES:  It definitely would.  Dr. KUNZ:  It would tell us something about there is something here in this region that may be causing this.  Now, one of the very curious things, many of the sites where white nose has been found are mines, that is, they are old abandoned mines.  There are a few caves in which white nose has been found, but most of them are mines, and you know, whether there is something affiliated, associated with conditions in the mines, there is one very curious observation that has been made, and that is that the sites where white nose has been found are largely those which have very high humidity, obviously cold, as the temperatures are in these caves, but the sites that do not have any evidence of at least the external manifestation like the white nose, are in very dry caves and mines.  So, there may be some link to water, there may be some link to the water - you know, the atmospheric conditions in you know, in moist environment versus a dry environment.  These are all things that we just simply are trying to grope with.  FLATOW:  With the new outbreak of something not seen before, do you have new funding to take care of?  You know, with doing all this research?  Dr. BUCKLES:  New funding?  That is always one of those things we have to talk about in strategic meetings is how to find funding to do these things.  Most states and some federal agencies do have a limited amount of funding to do disease research in wildlife for outbreak investigations, but what we are looking at here is finding funding for some fairly long-term studies, and that is one thing we're going to have to talk about.  FLATOW:  And states these days don't have a lot of money to throw around.  Dr. BUCKLES:  Yes.  The economy is not in a position right now where we think we're going to be particularly flushed with money to do a lot of things.  FLATOW:  Maybe the Gates Foundation is listening.  Dr. KUNZ:  We are exploring various options.  Certainly, private foundations, the federal government, as we know, the federal government moves very slowly on these things.  I mean, there are funding sources either through the potential sources, through the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health that we can explore.  But often times, those, it takes time to get those proposals together and get them reviewed and so on, but you know, what we're really looking for in the short run here are funds that can make it possible to really mobilize.  Dr. BUCKLES:  Yes, something we could, to rattle it. . .  FLATOW:  Are you looking for individual donations then?  Dr. KUNZ:  Absolutely.  The individual donations, foundation donations. . .  FLATOW:  If people want to donate, how should they contact this project?  Dr. KUNZ:  Well, Bat Conservation International, based in Austin, Texas is one that is helping coordinate some of the research going on, and you know, they are a private foundation that is well-linked to this particular effort and certainly, the universities are involved.  There are a number of them and other state institutions, but I think it is best probably, funnel it toward Bat Conservation International.  Dr. BUCKLES:  And you can certainly, again through our universities, you know contacting either Boston College or the College of Veterinary Medicine.  We could certainly help people who wanted to find a way to help with this issue.   FLATOW:  OK. Good mystery around it.  Thank you, and don't pick up those bats.  You see them lying them around in the caves.  Dr. BUCKLES:  But call someone if you see them.  FLATOW:  Yeah, yeah. Thank you, Elizabeth.  Elizabeth Buckles is Veterinary Pathologist and an Assistant Professor of Pathology at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell.  Thomas Kunz is Professor of Biology and Director of the Center for Ecology and Conservation at Boston University. Good luck to you.  Dr. KUNZ:  Thank you, Ira.  Dr. BUCKLES:  Thank you, Ira.  FLATOW:  We'll stay in touch.  Dr. KUNZ:  Okay, thanks. Bye.  FLATOW:  You're welcome.  Greg Smith, composed our theme music, and we had help today from NPR Librarian, Kim Moleski(ph). If you want to know more about the bat - if you want to see the bat video?  Surf over to our website.  It's sciencefriday. com.  We've got a really good video up there showing you the bats in the caves and the die-off that's going on and the research and links how to reach the bat people if you are interested.    Also, in Second Life, you can talk to some other avatars and discuss the issues and talk to us and they were broadcasting and blogging and looking for your videos.  Please send us your videos.  We'd like to feature them.  Anything having to do with science, technology, medicine, and the environment, you know.  We'll take a look at them and try to feature them on our website.  Have a great weekend.  Have a Happy Passover.  I'm Ira Flatow in New York. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I'm Robert Siegel. MELISSA BLOCK, Host: And I'm Melissa Block. Today in our series Climate Connections with National Geographic, we travel to a West Virginia classroom. When science teachers address topics like global warming and greenhouse gases, they court controversy. In some cases, classrooms have become battlegrounds. NPR'S Claudio Sanchez visited a school in mining country where one teacher is trying to help her students understand the environment without getting political. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CLAUDIO SANCHEZ: It's been raining all week in western West Virginia. The grounds outside Lewis County High School are soggy and not easy to walk on. But students have agreed to show me what they like most about their environmental science class - being outdoors. (SOUNDBITE OF RAIN)ANDREW BRENT DARBY: Whenever we first get there, we go and look at what other vegetation's around and look to see if we see anything running off the banks, and then we take the turbidity tube to measure about how clear the water is and how much sediment is in the water. SANCHEZ: All year, Andrew Brent Darby and his classmates have been testing the water and streams that feed the West Fork River. It flows no more than a hundred yards from their school. Their teacher is Tiffany Litton. BLOCK: We found some excess soil running off into the stream. And that has a direct effect on the bugs that live on the bottom of the stream because it destroys their habitat. So, we found some neat information on this stream. SANCHEZ: Litton, 27 years old, shoulder-length blond hair, is a rarity among environmental science teachers. She actually has an undergraduate degree in the subject and was about to start law school, hoping she'd work for the Environmental Protection Agency some day. She chose teaching instead, because she realized she could have a bigger impact on young people, like 17-year-old Mariah Hemrick(ph), who says Litton's class has opened her eyes. BLOCK: I started realizing things that I am doing in my life that aren't environmentally sustainable. And I started unplugging my, you know, electronics. That was probably what hit home most with me, was nonrenewable energy sources, because I think that's probably going to be, you know, the biggest problem that our generation has to deal with. SANCHEZ: Now, if only her father could take Ms. Litton's class, says Mariah. He sells coal-mining equipment. BLOCK: When I went to a conference with Mrs. Litton, my dad made a comment, well, I don't want my daughter to become one of those crazy tree-huggers. You know, I don't think that that generation really realizes the extent of the damage that is being done to the world and I think. . . SANCHEZ: Do you see yourself as a tree-hugger? BLOCK: Well, not particularly. I mean, I'm not an extremist but as I'm progressing through the class, I do realize that Mrs. Litton has a lot of hands-on experience. And I trust pretty much everything that she says as factual, and I try to apply it to my life. SANCHEZ: What Litton has done quite skillfully is teach hands-on science that's relevant to students' lives. She's won their trust by respecting their views and not preach to them. BLOCK: My science classroom is not the place for someone to promote any agenda. It's the place to promote facts. It should not be a battleground. Did you do your reading? Honestly, come on. Okay, well, we're talking about solar energy, hydropower and wind power today. So, just the first three sections. SANCHEZ: Litton's lesson about non-renewable energy today is typical of how she prods her students. BLOCK: We've already looked at oil supplies and coal supplies and how long they're going to last. We're going to need alternative energy. SANCHEZ: Especially alternative sources of energy that don't pollute. Litton continues. BLOCK: Carbon dioxide. What's the importance of carbon dioxide? LITTON: Greenhouse gases. BLOCK: Okay, it's a greenhouse gas. So the importance of. . . SANCHEZ: Litton tries but fails to get a discussion going. She loves debates and has been known to give A's to students who disagree with her about clear cutting and the coal industry's practice known as mountaintop removal. As long as her papers are well researched. And this year, she had her students read \"Meltdown,\" a book by Patrick Michaels who teaches at the University of Virginia. Michaels doesn't say climate change is a hoax, but he says global warming is part of a natural cycle. The role of humans is minimal. But news coverage, he argues, has been dominated by hysteria. There's no doubt, though, that Litton is the absolute gatekeeper when it comes to her classroom because there's so much material competing to get in. In West Virginia, for example, some of the biggest coal, timber and gas companies hand out lots of free literature to schools promoting their views about the environment. They fund several industry-friendly projects - including the statewide environmental student competition, the Enviro-thon. Last year, Litton asked one of those companies to fund her own project. She was turned down. BLOCK: Because it was a little environmentally friendly and was told to revamp it and I did not choose to do so. As an educator, I'm going to take resources where I can, but I'm not going to let them tell me what I need to teach in my classroom. SANCHEZ: Jerry Wheeler, president of the National Science Teachers Association, says Litton, because of her knowledge in training, is the exception, not the rule. BLOCK: The science teacher, out in the classroom, is relatively isolated. And so what happens in the classroom - in the science teacher's classroom, he or she will scrounge what they can. They'll look it, they'll hope that they're not putting a bias in - that's not a guarantee they're not. But they'll hope they're not putting a bias in. SANCHEZ: Poorly trained science teachers, though, are just one problem. Wheeler says local school boards often view environmental science the same way they view the evolution versus creationism debate - as too hot to handle. So, they avoid it. A good example: Al Gore's film \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" which some school systems consider controversial. The film's producers wanted NSTA to help distribute and promote it. Wheeler says NSTA refused. BLOCK: The general feeling of people that I respect said the science is basically right. Yes it is a movie, yes it is drama. SANCHEZ: But the bottom line is that NSTA has an non-endorsement policy. It doesn't matter if you're the producer of \"An Inconvenient Truth\" or the producer of coal, Wheeler says. NSTA cannot promote anybody's message. BLOCK: Now, that said, we have a lot of funders. We have a lot of big corporations or corporation-foundations that give us big money. I mean, millions of dollars. SANCHEZ: This year, the biggest corporate exhibitors and sponsors at NSTA's conference in Boston included Weyerhaeuser. SANCHEZ: We are farmers, we just happen to grow trees. SANCHEZ: Weyerhaeuser has a catchy slogan and distributes Project: Learning Tree in lots of schools even though some teachers consider it one big ad for the timber industry. Dow Chemical this year sponsored a teacher-training workshop that looked like fun. But the lady at the DuPont exhibit got testy when I pointed out that the company's educational material seemed more promotional. SANCHEZ: We don't tell you how to think, okay? SANCHEZ: But they sure do try. Environmentalists say having corporations cozy up to schools often undermines teachers - teachers like Tiffany Litton. BLOCK: What are the environmental impacts of hydropower? SANCHEZ: Litton says corporate messages about the environment in schools aren't a problem, as long as they don't get in the way of what she wants to accomplish. BLOCK: I'm not in it to be a high school teacher. I'm in it to spread the word about the environment. And that's why if I were told that I couldn't teach environmental science, I would not be a teacher anymore. Litton says she's committed to scientific inquiry and accuracy. But more importantly, Litton confides, she simply wants her students to become better stewards of the environment. BLOCK: Besides from a dam, what are other types of hydropower?

Not surprisingly, this is happening in the poorer areas, Appalachia, the Deep South, and the lower Midwest. This is according to a new study by the Harvard School of Public Health and the University of Washington. And joining us now is Harvard's Majid Ezzati. Welcome to the program. Dr. MAJID EZZATI (Harvard University, School of Public Health): Thank you very much. It's good to be on NPR. BRAND: Now, you are one of the co-authors of this study, and let's talk about the numbers. What is the average life expectancy nationally, and what has it dropped to in these areas? Dr. EZZATI: Well, the average life expectancy in the U. S. as a whole in 1999 was just over 74 years for men and close to 80 years for women. In the areas that are doing worse than others, it was around 78 years in 1993, which was actually relatively close to the national average, but then it went down by 1. 3 years. So even though the country as a whole for women went up by 1. 6 years, these counties went down by 1. 3 years. They almost have sort of a mirror image of the country as a whole in the opposite way. BRAND: Now, one year doesn't sound like a lot, but, statistically, is it? Dr. EZZATI: Ah, well, one year is actually a fairly large number. I mean, over a 20-year period, American women as a whole gained less than two years. So that's the gain for all women over almost a two-decade period, and, for it to go down by over one year in a group of counties, that's actually a relatively large number. BRAND:  How many women are we talking about? Dr. EZZATI: We are talking about 20 percent of American women, so we are talking about one out of five American women that things either have not gotten better, or have gotten worse for them. BRAND:  And what about men? Dr. EZZATI:  Well, men have had a similar experience, but the worsening or the stagnation has happened in a smaller number of counties. So it's been about four percent of American men are living in the counties that things either have not gotten better or have gotten worse. BRAND:  And the male life expectancy is lower anyway? Dr. EZZATI:  The male life expectancy is lower, although, as a result of the fact that a large number of counties for women are not doing well, things are catching up. BRAND:  What's causing this decrease?  What's your hypothesis? Dr. EZZATI:  Well, we have looked at the diseases that are causing this, so that one we can say with a fair amount of certainty. And what has happened is that, in these counties, a set of chronic diseases like lung cancer, like diabetes have gone up over this period, and then heart disease, other cardiovascular diseases have been going down. But they are not going down nearly as fast as they used to.   So, in some sense, they are being, you know, overshadowed by the increase in things like lung cancer. And we generally associate these diseases with things like smoking, with high blood pressure, with obesity, so it seems that there is a set of factors that have a geographical concentration, have gone up more in women recently, and are causing the set of chronic diseases that is really stopping the longevity gain. BRAND:  Lung cancer, diabetes, these are largely preventable diseases. Dr. EZZATI:  These are very-much-preventable diseases, and I think what's sort of arguably more important is that, you know, we have had examples of success of preventing these in many parts of the countries. So, in some sense, the fundamental question is that why are things that we are know extremely well how to do, and we have done it in many parts of the country, not reaching other parts of the country, and especially the parts that need these sorts of interventions the most. BRAND:  Well, smoking, obesity, which is a contributing factor to diabetes, these have been the focus of public-health campaigns for years now.  I mean, almost everybody knows that smoking is bad for you. Dr. EZZATI: That's right. And there have - you are absolutely right, and there has been a focus of successful public-health campaigns.  It's not just health education.  There has been a whole range of things that have happened.  You know, there has been regulations. There have been advertising bans. There has been taxation. In the case of blood pressure, there has been, you know, both interventions that might affect diet, the amount of salt that is in packaged food, or things that are for individuals.   So, you know, taking anti-hypertensives, having blood pressure checked, and, again, these have happened very successfully in many parts of the country.  So there should be something about the health system and the way that we deliver health and public health interventions that is very different in those parts than from other parts of the country that have done this successfully. BRAND:  That's Majid Ezzati. He's at the Harvard School of Public Health, coauthor of a new study that says about 20 percent of American women now have lower life expectancy.  Thank you very much. Dr. EZZATI:  Thank you. CHADWICK:  And now here is a program note, something we often feel the need to explain on an election day, and this is one, of course.  This is the primary day in Pennsylvania, very important vote for the Democrats. BRAND:  And you're not hearing about it on our program or anywhere else on NPR.  That's because NPR doesn't want to sway voters on this actual election day by airing an interview with a candidate, for instance, or even an opinion from a passionate voter. CHADWICK:  Because people can say something that should call for balance from the other side, and we cannot be sure that we present that response in last-minute day-of reporting.  We do, of course, have reporters in Pennsylvania.  We are covering the story.  NPR will report turnout in our newscasts, and we'll have full results when they are available. BRAND:  Trust us, we are not skimping on political coverage, not us. CHADWICK:  It's just until the polls close in Pennsylvania, and then we'll have plenty to say. Stay with us on Day to Day from NPR News.  MADELEINE BRAND, host:  The life expectancy for women in certain parts of the country is shorter now than it was in the 1980s.

So, in some sense, the fundamental question is that why are things that we are know extremely well how to do, and we have done it in many parts of the country, not reaching other parts of the country, and especially the parts that need these sorts of interventions the most.  BRAND:  Well, smoking, obesity, which is a contributing factor to diabetes, these have been the focus of public-health campaigns for years now.  I mean, almost everybody knows that smoking is bad for you.  Dr. EZZATI: That's right. And there have - you are absolutely right, and there has been a focus of successful public-health campaigns.  It's not just health education.  There has been a whole range of things that have happened.  You know, there has been regulations. There have been advertising bans. There has been taxation. In the case of blood pressure, there has been, you know, both interventions that might affect diet, the amount of salt that is in packaged food, or things that are for individuals.    So, you know, taking anti-hypertensives, having blood pressure checked, and, again, these have happened very successfully in many parts of the country.  So there should be something about the health system and the way that we deliver health and public health interventions that is very different in those parts than from other parts of the country that have done this successfully.  BRAND:  That's Majid Ezzati. He's at the Harvard School of Public Health, coauthor of a new study that says about 20 percent of American women now have lower life expectancy.  Thank you very much.  Dr. EZZATI:  Thank you.  CHADWICK:  And now here is a program note, something we often feel the need to explain on an election day, and this is one, of course.  This is the primary day in Pennsylvania, very important vote for the Democrats.  BRAND:  And you're not hearing about it on our program or anywhere else on NPR.  That's because NPR doesn't want to sway voters on this actual election day by airing an interview with a candidate, for instance, or even an opinion from a passionate voter.  CHADWICK:  Because people can say something that should call for balance from the other side, and we cannot be sure that we present that response in last-minute day-of reporting.  We do, of course, have reporters in Pennsylvania.  We are covering the story.  NPR will report turnout in our newscasts, and we'll have full results when they are available.  BRAND:  Trust us, we are not skimping on political coverage, not us.  CHADWICK:  It's just until the polls close in Pennsylvania, and then we'll have plenty to say.

To measure a hurricane's strength, though, one would still need to fly a special plane right through the storm. That's dangerous and it's expensive, so scientists have come up with a very different approach, as NPR's Jon Hamilton reports. JON HAMILTON: You can learn a lot by listening to a hurricane. Its high winds produce a signature sound as they whip across the earth's surface. The sound is so powerful, you can even hear it underwater. Military sensors have been picking up that sound since World War II, but no one did much with it until a couple of MIT professors ran into each other at a meeting. Professor NICK MAKRIS (Mechanical and ocean engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology): It was the first time Kerry and I met and, you know, he works in the atmosphere. I work in the ocean. HAMILTON: Nick Makris studies underwater acoustics. The Kerry he's talking about is Kerry Emanuel, a big time hurricane expert. Makris said their conversation led to a place where their fields converge - the surface of the ocean and what it sounds like during a hurricane. Emanuel asked a question. Prof. MAKRIS: Do you think that you could use the noise measured underwater to determine the destructive power of a hurricane? I told him, well, yes, I actually think you can, because, in fact, we've known since at least World War II that there's a very good correlation between the intensity of underwater sound and wind speed. HAMILTON: Great idea, but how do you test it? If you're at MIT, you give that problem to a graduate student. Makris picked Joshua Wilson. Wilson - who is now Dr. Wilson - began looking for an undersea microphone that might have recorded a hurricane, and he found one. It was suspended in the middle of the Atlantic half a mile down. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, was using sensors like this one to listen for underwater earthquakes. Prof. MAKRIS: And it turned out that a hurricane - Hurricane Gert - did pass right over those sensors. HAMILTON: Back in 1999. The actual recording is a low, low rumble. Prof. MAKRIS: Very low frequency. We're talking about frequencies that are barely audible for humans, the frequencies of thunder and cannons or a bass guitar, the low notes on a bass guitar. HAMILTON: But they're easy to hear when they're shifted up a couple of octaves. The recordings were an amazing find, but did that sound correspond to the power of hurricane? Once again, help came from NOAA. The agency had flown a plane through Hurricane Gert on the very same day that it made the underwater recordings. Makris and Wilson combined all the data, and viola. Prof. MAKRIS: What we found was the power of the wind was directly proportional to the power of the underwater sound. HAMILTON: In fact, the sound was just as good at measuring a hurricane's wind speed as an airplane. Makris says underwater microphones are a lot cheaper than airplanes, and it's easier to drop them into the path of an oncoming hurricane. Scientists like Makris and Wilson owe a lot to the military, which created the field that's now known as ocean acoustics. George Frisk at Florida Atlantic University says the first acoustic oceanographers were just guys in a submarine. Dr. GEORGE FRISK (Ocean Engineering, Florida Atlantic University): Some of the best sonar officers are able to identify the sources of sound just by listening to them. HAMILTON: In war time, they used that skill to identify ships and to estimate their speed. Frisk says the military set up the first network of underwater microphones to listen for enemy submarines. Now, he says, these microphones are monitoring everything in the ocean, from shrimp and ships to the weather above. Jon Hamilton, NPR News.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. Scientists are puzzling over a find they believed couldn't be possibly exist -bits of soft tissue from a dinosaur. Fossil hunters retrieved the tissue from the broken leg bone of a Tyrannosaurus rex. Skeptics have challenged its authenticity. But now, there's new evidence suggesting that the tissue is the real thing. NPR's Christopher Joyce reports. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: A bedrock rule of paleontology is that there's no way soft tissue - skin, blood vessels, organs - can possibly last millions of years. But in 2003, fossil hunters dug up a 68-million-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex in Montana. They accidentally broke one of its bones and gave some fragments to Mary Schweitzer at North Carolina Sate University, and she's been studying the pieces ever since. In 2005, she found collagen - a fibrous material that's common in connective tissue in bones. Lots of experts didn't believe it, but now, scientists have recovered a tiny sequence of proteins from that collagen. Dr. MARY SCHWEITZER (Professor of Paleontology, North Carolina University): The ultimate controversy is, can anything really exist for this long? And, with sequence data, we've taken a gigantic step forward in saying, yes, that it can. JOYCE: Not that only are the  proteins recognizable, their chemical structure can be read much the way DNA can be read. It's like an animal's molecular signature, says John Asara from Harvard Medical School. He says that after comparing the sequence from the T-Rex to those from 21 present-day animals, the team could place T-Rex on what you might call the evolutionary tree of life. Dr. JOHN ASARA (Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School): Based on this molecular data, it really suggests that the T-Rex is clearly closer to a bird than a reptile. JOYCE: The team also did a similar analysis on tissue from a mastodon that's hundreds of thousands of years old. They found it closely related to elephants. These findings confirm what fossil hunting scientists already believed, dinosaurs and birds are closely related and so are mastodons and elephants. But the technique finding intact microscopic proteins from such ancient material is a first. Asara says it's not likely to happen very often. Dr. ASARA: So it brings us - in order to basically find this protein, you really have to start with the bone that has exceptional preservation. And it's really amazing that we can get sequence at all from something that old. JOYCE: But if the sequencing technique proves reliable, says Mary Schweitzer, it would give scientists a remarkable tool for reconstructing the biological past. Dr. SCHWEITZER: The evolutionary story of how dinosaurs are related to one another and how they're related to modern birds and other animals, we can only determine so far from markings on the bone. JOYCE: Protein sequences might even provide insight into the animals themselves, how their bodies worked, for example. But scientists will need more dinosaur bones with a lot more intact tissue. Those are rare, though Schweitzer says she may have already found some from another dinosaur. She acknowledges that she'll need more evidence to convince skeptics that these proteins are from some modern animal that somehow contaminated the specimen. And she herself remains puzzled at how the dinosaur collagen survived so long. Dr. SCHWEITZER: Does it have something to do with the fact that these things are incorporated into bone? Does it have something to do with the dinosaurs? Does it have something to do with the environment at the time? I mean, we don't know.

Coming up, he became a voice for American families long before he had one of his own.  Senator Chris Dodd talks about why he's been fighting for family leave and other family-friendly policies.  And, Part Two of our conversation with the former U. N. Ambassador, Andrew Young, about why he has turned his attention to Africa. But first, the kind of news we do not expect to see in the United States.  A new report says that for the first time in almost a century, life expectancy is falling for a significant number of women.  In nearly a thousand counties that are home to 12 percent of American women, life expectancy is now shorter than it was in the early 1980s.  The study also found a decline in life expectancy for some men, but in fewer places, for a smaller percentage of men.   The study was led by Dr. Christopher Murray, a physician and professor at the University of Washington, and he's with us to talk about it now, and we're also joined by Dr. Wendy Klein, professor emeritus of medicine obstetrics and gynecology at Virginia Commonwealth University.  I welcome you both.  Thank you so much for speaking with us. Dr. WENDY KLEIN (Specialist, Women's Health, Virginia Commonwealth University):  Thank you for having us. Dr. CHRISTOPHER MURRAY (Lead Author, Life Expectancy Among Women Study, University of Washington):  Thanks for having us. MARTIN:  Dr. Murray, as I understand it, we haven't seen a decline like this since the Spanish flu epidemic at the turn of the century. What is behind this?  Why is this happening? Dr. MURRAY:  Well, it's - the details of why it's happening in some places and not others - one way to address that is to ask, what are the causes of death behind this?  Why are more women dying? And if you drill down and look at it, it's a rise in death rates from diabetes, other chronic diseases, chronic lung disease and lung cancer. And so then, of course, the next question is, why are those going up?  And to answer that question, we have to go some of the root causes behind the rise of chronic disease in the country. MARTIN:  Why - and some of the places where this is most pronounced are the deep South, Appalachia, lower Midwest, and one county in Maine.  Why these places and not others? Dr. MURRAY:  Well, in fact, this pattern of rising death rates in young and middle-aged adults, adult women, from chronic conditions, is more general.  It's happening all over the country.  The reason life expectancy is dropping in those particular counties is that in the rest of the country this adverse health trend is being masked by continued progress and reducing heart disease, but - where life expectancy is dropping, the reduction in heart disease is not enough to make up for the fact that these other causes of death are going up. MARTIN:  And finally, well, not finally, because we're going to ask you to stand by, but why are women more profoundly affected than men? Dr. MURRAY:  Well, I think there's three reasons behind that.  First, the decline in heart disease is still bigger in men,  so there's more masking going on in men.  Secondly, women, they start to smoke more, and men's smoking went down.  So, the gap between men and women in terms of the smoking has been narrowing.  We're seeing the effect of smoking showing up now. MARTIN:  I'm sorry, Dr. Murray, we're having a little trouble with your line, so I'm going to talk to Dr. Klein for a few minutes and let's see if we can call you back and get a little clearer line.  So, if you'll just stand by for a minute.   Dr. Klein, anybody who works with specific groups notices things.  I notice that when I went to my college reunion a while back, I noticed that I thought a disproportionate number of my classmates had died of strokes or heart attacks, and I was wondering to myself, what's going on here, given their ages and what I thought should have been their relatively good health?  So, as a person who's worked in women's health for all these years, particular in areas like the ones in the study, have you noticed this or were you surprised by these findings? Dr. KLEIN:  Actually, I was not surprised.  You know, it is well established - this reflects disparities that have long been identified.  The literature, the medical literature, is replete with studies that tell us that health outcomes are worst for those who are the least educated and those in the lowest socioeconomic strata. It's been well known.  We know that smoking rates, prevalence of smoking in the United States has declined in general, but among people who are the least educated, in particular women, they are three times as likely to smoke as those who are in higher socioeconomic strata and who are better educated.  We know this.  It's not new.  There's been a lack of attention to those people who are the most vulnerable. MARTIN:  If you're just joining us, we're talking about new findings that suggest that life expectancy for a significant number of women in the U. S. is actually falling, and we're talking with one of the authors of the study, Dr. Christopher Murray, and women's health expert, Dr. Wendy Klein.  And Dr. Klein, I wanted to ask you, is it your take that - is it tobacco or obesity that you think is the most prominent factor here?  Smoking or obesity? Dr. KLEIN:  Great question.  Great question.  Tobacco is a toxin that I can tell you that the leading cause of cancer death in women is lung cancer, that women who smoke have a ten times risk of dying of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, which is one of the factors, one of the causes of death that Dr. Murray identified.  We're seeing this now because this is the end effect of the fact that women have been now smoking for a couple of decades.  Obesity, as you know, is epidemic, and again, the prevalence of obesity is greatest among those who are most disadvantaged.  You know, fast- food is cheap food. MARTIN:  But talk to me about smoking for a minute.  We've had decades of public advocacy against smoking.  Is the message not getting through to this particular population, or do you think that there are some reasons why these women are not able to heed it? Dr. KLEIN:  Both.  We are not reaching the people who need to hear the message, the women who need to hear the message, and also, we are only just beginning to understand sex and gender-based differences in health and disease.  If we have - we have hundreds of years' worth of data that's based on the male model, but women are not small men, and we only have just a decade or two of research that's helping us to understand these differences. MARTIN:  And why do you think that the - there is such a significant difference between the U. S. and our sort of peer countries like Canada or Japan or even Western Europe? Dr. KLEIN:  I think that is because our model of health care is an illness-based model rather than wellness-based model.  We put a lot of money into acute care and critical care, and not enough into prevention.  And the prevention - go ahead. MARTIN:  No.  I was going to ask you.  So, as a doctor, you're both a professor who looks at these things,  an academic who looks at these things, and you also see, sort of, patients.  How do you deal with this with patients, given that there seem to be high hurdles to people actually following the advice that we know they should follow, right?  It seems to be harder for people to modify their behavior than we'd like it to be. How do you handle that?  Dr. KLEIN: Very much so. You know, it's using the platform that we're given as health-care providers. I mean, it is imperative that we use that platform much more aggressively to reach out, again, to young women. As you well know, the media makes smoking look attractive. Smoking is still marketed heavily. And we know that women, in particular, are vulnerable to peer pressure. So there are certainly better ways that we can reach out to the communities, but also, we are - we need to continue to foster research that helps us understand the differences, and why women struggle, what are the other issues. You now, I have to quote, also, paraphrase Marian Wright Edelman, who once made a very powerful statement. MARTIN: Who's the founder of the Children's Defense Fund, a children's advocacy organization, for those who don't know. Dr. KLEIN: Yes. And she once said something to the fact - of the fact that we live in a time of painful discordance between our capacity to prevent disease and our political will to do so. I think that really sort of points to the issue. We are still promoting smoking. And we are still - it is being marketed to young women. And clearly, especially among disadvantaged women, the prevalence of smoking is greater. And we're seeing the end effects smoking makes. Cardiovascular disease worse, makes diabetes worse, heightens the risk of peripheral vascular disease, obviously leads to lung cancer, leads to COPD, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, these are all the causes of death that Dr. Murray identified.  MARTIN: Obviously, there's no quick fix for people when you have a situation in this broad of an area, with this significant result from these behaviors. But what would an initiative to address this look like to you?  Dr. KLEIN: What a difficult question. You know, it's tricky. Change takes time and money. It takes reaching out to communities. It takes community engagement. We have an unfortunate situation where women's health is somewhat politicized. And for example, there was a network of Centers of Excellence in Women's Health, of which 11 were in rural areas. And many were based in communities. There was a network around the country that had been begun in the '90s and grew and was very effectively reaching out into underserved communities. They were de-funded. All 48 of them were de-funded this past fall by the Department of Health and Human Services.   MARTIN: Because? Dr. KLEIN: Good question.  MARTIN: Well, we - I have Dr. Murray back with us. And so, Dr. Murray, briefly, we're talking about what kinds of - obviously, there's no quick fix for a problem like this - but what would you like to see? What would a public health initiative to address something like this look like, in your view?  Dr. MURRAY: I think the response here is somewhat clear, because it's both a combination of public health interventions around tobacco and obesity, but also, if you look at the root causes in women, in these target communities, hypertension, cholesterol and high blood sugar are as important. And that's really, probably the most effective routes to tackle those issues are through better primary health care. So it's not simply a question of, you know, promoting public health or healthier lifestyles. It's also a question of addressing the fact that, you know, 60 percent of women with high blood pressure are untreated, and another 20 percent of 100 percent are poorly treated. Those types of opportunities mean that targeted intervention to the communities where things are getting worse, I think, are likely to succeed.  MARTIN: We're going to have to leave it there. Dr. Christopher Murray is a physician and epidemiologist at the University of Washington. He lead this study on declining life expectancies among women in 1,000 counties across the U. S. He joined us on the phone from Minneapolis. We were also joined by Dr. Wendy Klein. She's an associate professor emeritus of medicine, obstetrics and gynecology at Virginia Commonwealth University, and she joined us from there. And I thank you both so much for speaking with us.

And so then, of course, the next question is, why are those going up?  And to answer that question, we have to go some of the root causes behind the rise of chronic disease in the country.  MARTIN:  Why - and some of the places where this is most pronounced are the deep South, Appalachia, lower Midwest, and one county in Maine.  Why these places and not others?  Dr. MURRAY:  Well, in fact, this pattern of rising death rates in young and middle-aged adults, adult women, from chronic conditions, is more general.  It's happening all over the country.  The reason life expectancy is dropping in those particular counties is that in the rest of the country this adverse health trend is being masked by continued progress and reducing heart disease, but - where life expectancy is dropping, the reduction in heart disease is not enough to make up for the fact that these other causes of death are going up.  MARTIN:  And finally, well, not finally, because we're going to ask you to stand by, but why are women more profoundly affected than men?  Dr. MURRAY:  Well, I think there's three reasons behind that.  First, the decline in heart disease is still bigger in men,  so there's more masking going on in men.  Secondly, women, they start to smoke more, and men's smoking went down.  So, the gap between men and women in terms of the smoking has been narrowing.  We're seeing the effect of smoking showing up now.  MARTIN:  I'm sorry, Dr. Murray, we're having a little trouble with your line, so I'm going to talk to Dr. Klein for a few minutes and let's see if we can call you back and get a little clearer line.  So, if you'll just stand by for a minute.    Dr. Klein, anybody who works with specific groups notices things.  I notice that when I went to my college reunion a while back, I noticed that I thought a disproportionate number of my classmates had died of strokes or heart attacks, and I was wondering to myself, what's going on here, given their ages and what I thought should have been their relatively good health?  So, as a person who's worked in women's health for all these years, particular in areas like the ones in the study, have you noticed this or were you surprised by these findings?  Dr. KLEIN:  Actually, I was not surprised.  You know, it is well established - this reflects disparities that have long been identified.  The literature, the medical literature, is replete with studies that tell us that health outcomes are worst for those who are the least educated and those in the lowest socioeconomic strata. It's been well known.  We know that smoking rates, prevalence of smoking in the United States has declined in general, but among people who are the least educated, in particular women, they are three times as likely to smoke as those who are in higher socioeconomic strata and who are better educated.  We know this.  It's not new.  There's been a lack of attention to those people who are the most vulnerable.  MARTIN:  If you're just joining us, we're talking about new findings that suggest that life expectancy for a significant number of women in the U. S. is actually falling, and we're talking with one of the authors of the study, Dr. Christopher Murray, and women's health expert, Dr. Wendy Klein.  And Dr. Klein, I wanted to ask you, is it your take that - is it tobacco or obesity that you think is the most prominent factor here?  Smoking or obesity?  Dr. KLEIN:  Great question.  Great question.  Tobacco is a toxin that I can tell you that the leading cause of cancer death in women is lung cancer, that women who smoke have a ten times risk of dying of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, which is one of the factors, one of the causes of death that Dr. Murray identified.  We're seeing this now because this is the end effect of the fact that women have been now smoking for a couple of decades.  Obesity, as you know, is epidemic, and again, the prevalence of obesity is greatest among those who are most disadvantaged.  You know, fast- food is cheap food.  MARTIN:  But talk to me about smoking for a minute.  We've had decades of public advocacy against smoking.  Is the message not getting through to this particular population, or do you think that there are some reasons why these women are not able to heed it?  Dr. KLEIN:  Both.  We are not reaching the people who need to hear the message, the women who need to hear the message, and also, we are only just beginning to understand sex and gender-based differences in health and disease.  If we have - we have hundreds of years' worth of data that's based on the male model, but women are not small men, and we only have just a decade or two of research that's helping us to understand these differences.  MARTIN:  And why do you think that the - there is such a significant difference between the U. S. and our sort of peer countries like Canada or Japan or even Western Europe?  Dr. KLEIN:  I think that is because our model of health care is an illness-based model rather than wellness-based model.  We put a lot of money into acute care and critical care, and not enough into prevention.  And the prevention - go ahead.  MARTIN:  No.  I was going to ask you.  So, as a doctor, you're both a professor who looks at these things,  an academic who looks at these things, and you also see, sort of, patients.  How do you deal with this with patients, given that there seem to be high hurdles to people actually following the advice that we know they should follow, right?  It seems to be harder for people to modify their behavior than we'd like it to be. How do you handle that?   Dr. KLEIN: Very much so. You know, it's using the platform that we're given as health-care providers. I mean, it is imperative that we use that platform much more aggressively to reach out, again, to young women. As you well know, the media makes smoking look attractive. Smoking is still marketed heavily. And we know that women, in particular, are vulnerable to peer pressure. So there are certainly better ways that we can reach out to the communities, but also, we are - we need to continue to foster research that helps us understand the differences, and why women struggle, what are the other issues. You now, I have to quote, also, paraphrase Marian Wright Edelman, who once made a very powerful statement.  MARTIN: Who's the founder of the Children's Defense Fund, a children's advocacy organization, for those who don't know.  Dr. KLEIN: Yes. And she once said something to the fact - of the fact that we live in a time of painful discordance between our capacity to prevent disease and our political will to do so. I think that really sort of points to the issue. We are still promoting smoking. And we are still - it is being marketed to young women. And clearly, especially among disadvantaged women, the prevalence of smoking is greater. And we're seeing the end effects smoking makes. Cardiovascular disease worse, makes diabetes worse, heightens the risk of peripheral vascular disease, obviously leads to lung cancer, leads to COPD, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, these are all the causes of death that Dr. Murray identified.   MARTIN: Obviously, there's no quick fix for people when you have a situation in this broad of an area, with this significant result from these behaviors. But what would an initiative to address this look like to you?   Dr. KLEIN: What a difficult question. You know, it's tricky. Change takes time and money. It takes reaching out to communities. It takes community engagement. We have an unfortunate situation where women's health is somewhat politicized. And for example, there was a network of Centers of Excellence in Women's Health, of which 11 were in rural areas. And many were based in communities. There was a network around the country that had been begun in the '90s and grew and was very effectively reaching out into underserved communities. They were de-funded. All 48 of them were de-funded this past fall by the Department of Health and Human Services.    MARTIN: Because?  Dr. KLEIN: Good question.   MARTIN: Well, we - I have Dr. Murray back with us. And so, Dr. Murray, briefly, we're talking about what kinds of - obviously, there's no quick fix for a problem like this - but what would you like to see? What would a public health initiative to address something like this look like, in your view?   Dr. MURRAY: I think the response here is somewhat clear, because it's both a combination of public health interventions around tobacco and obesity, but also, if you look at the root causes in women, in these target communities, hypertension, cholesterol and high blood sugar are as important. And that's really, probably the most effective routes to tackle those issues are through better primary health care. So it's not simply a question of, you know, promoting public health or healthier lifestyles. It's also a question of addressing the fact that, you know, 60 percent of women with high blood pressure are untreated, and another 20 percent of 100 percent are poorly treated. Those types of opportunities mean that targeted intervention to the communities where things are getting worse, I think, are likely to succeed.   MARTIN: We're going to have to leave it there. Dr. Christopher Murray is a physician and epidemiologist at the University of Washington. He lead this study on declining life expectancies among women in 1,000 counties across the U. S. He joined us on the phone from Minneapolis. We were also joined by Dr. Wendy Klein. She's an associate professor emeritus of medicine, obstetrics and gynecology at Virginia Commonwealth University, and she joined us from there. And I thank you both so much for speaking with us.   Dr. KLEIN: Thank you so much for the opportunity.  ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Pierre was arguably this year, the world's best dressed penguin. In reality, he was probably also the world's only dressed penguin. And here to talk about this is Pam Schaller who is senior aquatic biologist at the academy. Tell us the story of Pierre and why he needed clothes in the first place. Ms. PAM SCHALLER (Senior Aquatic Biologist, California Academy of Sciences, San Francisco): Penguins are birds. They require feathers to stay warm. And in 2004, Pierre replaced all of his feathers with brand new feathers. And in 2005, those feathers were not replaced. And in 2006, he began to show signs that they would not be replaced again by having some bald patches on his tail and around his head. And as he got into late 2006 and early 2007, we decided to do some medical testing to find out what that reason was. And there was no conclusive studies to tell us what that reason was. SIEGEL: He was fairly advanced than years as this was happening. Ms. SCHALLER: Yes. Normally penguins live for about 15 years in the wild, and about 20 years in captivity. He was turning 25 this past February. SIEGEL: Hmm. And the loss of the feathers posed real problems for him. Ms. SCHALLER: A number of reasons, first of all that's their insulation that's what keeps them warm. And it's also how they identify each other. And so, with these bald patches that were beginning to appear, he was getting picked on quite a bit by some of the other birds, and he was also not swimming very often because he was very cold. SIEGEL: So, what did you do? Ms. SCHALLER: So, I tried to come up with a solution that will allow him to stay with the colony, and allow him to swim and stay warm, and looked at my own wet suit as a design, and clothes that I'd seen on dogs, and found what I thought to be something user-friendly for him. And it ended up being a neoprene vest that allowed his wings - flippers - to move. SIEGEL: How long did Pierre wear this suit? Ms. SCHALLER: He had it on for about six weeks. And what I started to notice because his tail's exposed that he was actually growing his feathers in, but as the feathers really began to grow in in full force, took the wet suit off, and he's been wet-suit free ever since. SIEGEL: So, you came up with a treatment for baldness among penguins. Ms. SCHALLER: That's what I'm hoping, if nothing else, we came up with a way to keep a bird comfortable in a similar situation. SIEGEL: And what is the - what's the report on Pierre's social relations with the other penguins in the group? Ms. SCHALLER: He is behaving as though he is once again the patriarch of the colony. SIEGEL: Oh, he was mister big before all this began? Ms. SCHALLER: Oh, yes, he was. SIEGEL: I see. So, this was overturning of the social order when he was losing his feathers?  Ms. SCHALLER: Right, right. It really forced him to have to defend himself quite a bit. And now he's standing tall and strong - can swim and behave normally. SIEGEL: Are there lots of pictures of Pierre from his - what he should wearing, wearing days? Ms. SCHALLER: Lots. SIEGEL: Lots. Ms. SCHALLER: You can't help but take pictures of a penguin in a wetsuit. SIEGEL: But nobody put goggles on him or things like that. . . Ms. SCHALLER: No goggles or surfboard.

I'm Ira Flatow. Spring is here.  Perhaps you are already barbecuing in these warm spring, almost summer days. What if your next tasty tenderloin came from a test tube instead of a cattle ranch?  Or the chicken in that shish kebab was grown in a laboratory instead of on a poultry farm?  Would you feel any different about eating it?  And if you are a vegetarian, would the lab-grown beef or chicken turn you into a nouveau meat eater?  Well, animal rights organization PETA is beta testing a - and they are betting that the test tube meat is the way of the future and it is offering a one-million-dollar prize.  Are you listening?  You can win a prize here.  A lot of science is being done by prizes these days.   You can win a million bucks to be the first scientist who gets there first, if you can develop test-tube tenderloin.  That is what we are going to dub it this hour.  They will pay the money to any scientist who makes chicken in the lab that looks and feels and tastes the same as the real thing, or tenderloin or beef, and not only do you have to make it.  You have to be able to ramp it up to commercial scale and get it all in the stores and in the meat freezers by 2012.  You have got until 2012 to come up with your test-tube tenderloin.  Joining us now is a scientist who is working in the field.  He is here to talk about the science behind test-tube meat, and the problems that still need to be worked out if that million-dollar meat will make it out of the lab and onto the table. If you would like to get in on the discussion, our number is 1-800-989-8255.  1-800-989-TALK.  You can also find us in Second Life on Science Friday Island.  Vladimir Mironov is an associate professor in the Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston.  Doctor Mironov joins us by phone from Singapore, where he is currently the Tan Chin Tuan Fellow at the Nanyang Technical University.  Welcome to the program, Dr. Mironov.  Dr. VLADIMIR MIRONOV (Associate Professor, Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, Medical University of South Carolina):  Welcome.  Hello. FLATOW:  Hello.  Tell us how, how - is there new science that has to happen here, or is this basically an engineering problem?   Dr. MIRONOV:  Oh, that is a very good question.  Because you know, scientists usually investigate world which already exists. Engineers create world which is never exist.  So I think when you talk about tissue engineering meat, it is not so much scientific task.  It is more engineering task.  And if you ask me about scientific aspect, then in 1907, American Ross Harrison was the first, probably, scientist who isolate cells and start to grow cells in cell culture.  Therefore, from scientific point of view, this is one-hundred-year-old technology. FLATOW:   So the idea is to take cells, grow them in culture, and allow them to grow enough that you recreate the meat? Dr. MIRONOV:  Yes.  Basically, it is the field what is moving already, last 20 years, called tissue engineering.  But tissue engineering focusing on creating tissue and organs for repair and replacement in human body, and the novelty of our approach is that we want to think about another aspect of tissue engineering to create basically food.  And there are several challenges which is left of course, but basically, from my perspective, I don't see unsolvable problem how to transfer this technology in that scalable technology.  But I'm really skeptical that one million dollars will be enough. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW:  Yes, we have had other prizes in the 10 and 20 million dollar range.  This is not that much, is it?  Dr. MIRONOV:  Yeah.  FLATOW:  Now tell us about the challenges that you just mentioned.  What are some of the challenges that await you? Dr. MIRONOV:  I can say that basically there is five main challenges.  Number one, you must of course find appropriate cell source.  And there is two groups of the people - two point of views.  One belief that you must start from embryonic cells because they are multipotent, and they have high proliferation potential.  But because they are not differentiated, you know, you must spend a lot of effort to force them to go to skeletal muscle lineage and it needs special grow factors or transcription factors, therefore it is challenging. But the good sense of it, embryonic cells that they can - embryonic stem cells that they can proliferate and they have very low conflict(ph) effect. So, the second group of the people believe that it is better to start from so-called myoblast. It's a progenitor cell - it is a cell which has a periphery of skeletal fibers, which is already committed to be a skeletal muscle. But from another side, their proliferation potential, so-called traffic number, is a little bit limited.  So what will be the decision? What will be solution? It will show the time. FLATOW:  And what do you grow the cells in? Dr. MIRONOV:  Oh, that's very good question. That's the second question because in standard cell culture, people use, of course, some kind of fluid which imitate blood, without erythrocytes of course, and the main component of cell culture media is serum which has animal origin.  So there's not any point to create animal-free tissue-engineered meat if you still use animal-derived serum. So the challenge is to design so-called defined cell culture media which contain all necessary and sufficient elements to allow cells to grow and don't contain any unknown element like black box, like serum, and also which is relatively economically reasonable, because I can say that serum and cell culture is very expensive now. FLATOW:  How close to texture feel taste would the synthetic meat, so to speak, the test-tube meat come to normal real meat from an animal? Dr. MIRONOV: This is again an interesting point, but I don't believe - and I don't believe it's necessary that tissue-engineered meat must have taste and texture of real chicken meat. There's two reasons for this. Number one, if you go to grocery store, there's a lot of product which doesn't have any taste of real meat or real skeletal muscle like nuggets or sausage, you know.  So the point is to create a protein which - healthy animal protein. That's one aspect. The second aspect is technological.  If you really want to create meat with the taste and texture, that's became much more challenging because then you must produce not only skeletal fibers from myoblast, you must also produce fat tissue which is not a big deal and also produce blood vessels because if the tissue became very thick then you must have blood culture and then you must have connective tissue which create this texture, and that became very, very complicated. And most important it's not scalable, and if it's not scalable then it's not industrial-friendly. If it's not industrial-friendly, then you'll never produce this in a large scale. FLATOW:  We have a question here from Bauer(ph) in Second Life, who says, \"would it be a good idea to combine genes of animals and mushrooms for example in such a way the meat could be cultured as mushrooms are or to have plants make the meat for us? \" Dr. MIRONOV:  Yeah, there's some people who believe - actually there's a discussion Web site in Europe, and they don't like the idea of tissue-engineered meat. They call this American cultural imperialism, McDonald's again, but one name for this technology. They call this hydroponic meat, and I think this reflects the point. We don't use any genetical engineering. We don't modify the cells. We use natural cells and try to put them in natural or, we call this bio-mimicking environment, and we want to create tissue which look like natural tissue.  So, there's no any genetical modification here.  And concerning the mushrooms, I hear of two type of discussion.  One people say that you can use this for cell culture media which I don't understand completely.  And another interesting idea that if you look at mushrooms, they have so-called chitosan and chitosan is very interesting polymer because, number one, it's eatable and number two, it absorbs fat.  So, basically, you can create - if you combine - use chitosan as a scaffold or temporal support for these cells, and cells need support because they are attachment-dependent.  If you grow them all in suspension, they will not grow.  They must attach to something. If you attach them to the bottom, then you have only limit scaffold(ph).  So, fills(ph) or sponges that will increase surface area for cells and to make technology more effective.  So, chitosan, which is eatable and which also absorbs fat, can create tissue-engineering meat which will be not only useful, but also can be sold as a functional food because it can reduce fat consumption.   FLATOW:  So, you could have a big giant portabello mushroom that already looks and tastes almost like beef, but actually have real beef in it? Dr. MIRONOV: Look, I'm an animal specialist, OK?  And you ask me questions about mushrooms. FLATOW:  OK, we'll move on to it.  We'll move on to stuff that's right here a little more - our listeners are very eager to talk about this.  But you could make the meat, as you say, to specification.  You could make it less fatty, or for example, or more nutritious as you'd like to produce it? Dr. MIRONOV:  I think if you - the taste of the meat depends on percent of fat.  Therefore, we can take again stem cells and force them to be fat cells.  And then we can make mixture of skeletal fibers with the fat cells.  Therefore, in this context it's not a big challenge.  The second aspect is how to make texture. I think that's the challenging stuff. FLATOW:  Yeah, making tex. . . - 1-800-989-8255.  Lots of people want to ring in on this.  Hi, Dan, in Washington.  Welcome. DAN (Caller):  Hi.  How are you? FLATOW:  Hi there. DAN:  I think this is a great program. FLATOW:  Thank you. DAN:  I have been a vegan for about five years, and I'm a vegan just because of the way I understand animals are treated in factory farms.  So, I'm a big supporter of this.  I would certainly eat this meat if it becomes marketable. One question I have, I understand that there is a big environmental impact on - when factory farms produce meat, and was wondering if this sort of test-tube meat would be better for the environment. FLATOW:  Good question. Dr. MIRONOV:  Yeah, it's a very good question.  And one of my friends, Jason who run this Web site, New Harvest, he is especially focusing on this area.  And according to his calculations is, in proper environment of tissue engineering, meat technologies are enormous because it's actually the use of area which are occupied by growing wheat and other stuff which you need to grow animals.  And, I believe, another important impact is also that if you do it indoors, then you can use land on the earth much more effectively. And because it will be with the FDA-controlled environment, it will be probably very clean, very high-tech technology. FLATOW:  This is Talk of the Nation: Science Friday from NPR News.  I'm Ira Flatow, talking with Vladimir Mironov about test-tube meat.  Lots of people have various opinions about it.  Let's get a couple of more from Lucy in Chicago. Hi, Lucy.   LUCY (Caller):  Yes, hello. My husband of - I wish he were here.  He's currently at work.  But he went through MIT in the Department of Nutrition and Food Technology with a NASA scholarship.  His fellowship and scholarship required him to find ways to produce food including meat on space flight through using waste product, specifically Escherichia coli.  And I just wanted to say that, you know, using a tissue culture is not the only the only way to do this.  You can use waste product, as unpleasant as it sounds, and come out with a great number of food products that could resemble very closely the real thing.  I just wanted to have your - just comment on that.   FLATOW:  OK.  Let me get a comment.   Dr. MIRONOV:  Yeah.  In Soviet Union there was a secret experiment to use an Escherichia coli to produce protein.  And they succeed in this.  There was only one problem.  Yes, they can produce protein, but the smell was so terrible that nobody want to even to taste it.   FLATOW:  Details, details.   Dr. MIRONOV:  That's number one.  Number two, yes, you can use also transgenic plants and they can produce one or maximum two proteins.  The beauty of tissue engineering approach that you create authentic natural-like tissue which contain not just one protein, which you can use when you use transgenic plants.  You can create complex protein.  Complex protein which have very high nutritional value.  That's what my collaborator Dewerth Maxim(ph) told me, from Dakota.  FLATOW:  How - would you have to flavor it in any way or add artificial flavors or, you know, make it taste more like real meat that people are used to? Dr. MIRONOV:  If you look carefully, what is the tendency now in food industry, especially in the United States, and it's very well described in the book \"Fast Food Nation. \"  In New Jersey, there are 27 plants which produce so-called artificial flavor.  Therefore, the question of flavors now is not the question of original product, it's a question of artificial flavors.   FLATOW:  Would you think this meat would cost less than regular meat that we have now?   Dr. MIRONOV:  If you look in the history of technology, you know, any high-tech product, in the beginning, especially at the initial stage, costs a lot of money because that's how much money you must invest in development of this technology, in development of building block. And if you look on microelectronics, for example, there is some interest in example which demonstrates that original product who have certain price but after marketing implementation and scalable technology implementation the price reduce 1,000 times.   FLATOW:  Well, you know what, the price agriculture is. . . Dr. MIRONOV:  So, I believe just - to say that we can produce, right now, product with comparable price will be not realistic.  But eventually, eventually I think it will be - maybe even cheaper than the recent technology.  FLATOW:  Oh, with the price of oil going up near $120 a barrel and agriculture so energy-intensive, you may be right about that.  I want to thank you for taking time to be with us today, Doctor.   Dr. MIRONOV:  OK.  FLATOW:  You're welcome.   Dr. MIRONOV:  Thank you for having me.   FLATOW:  Thank you for staying up so late there for us - across the globe.  Vladimir Mironov is the associate professor in the Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston.  And he was on the phone today from Singapore, which is a few time zones ahead of us.  So as early in the morning hours, we'd like to thank him for being with us.  We're going to take a short break, and come back and change direction once again about a story you heard about. We started it about a year ago.  New information about soft tissue findings and a T. Rex dinosaur that - make sure that it's just, just as close to birds as we think it might be.  So stay with us, we'll be right back.   IRA FLATOW, host:    You're listening to Talk of the Nation: Science Friday.  I'm Ira Flatow. Spring is here.  Perhaps you are already barbecuing in these warm spring, almost summer days. What if your next tasty tenderloin came from a test tube instead of a cattle ranch?  Or the chicken in that shish kebab was grown in a laboratory instead of on a poultry farm?  Would you feel any different about eating it?  And if you are a vegetarian, would the lab-grown beef or chicken turn you into a nouveau meat eater?  Well, animal rights organization PETA is beta testing a - and they are betting that the test tube meat is the way of the future and it is offering a one-million-dollar prize.  Are you listening?  You can win a prize here.  A lot of science is being done by prizes these days.    You can win a million bucks to be the first scientist who gets there first, if you can develop test-tube tenderloin.  That is what we are going to dub it this hour.  They will pay the money to any scientist who makes chicken in the lab that looks and feels and tastes the same as the real thing, or tenderloin or beef, and not only do you have to make it.  You have to be able to ramp it up to commercial scale and get it all in the stores and in the meat freezers by 2012.  You have got until 2012 to come up with your test-tube tenderloin.  Joining us now is a scientist who is working in the field.  He is here to talk about the science behind test-tube meat, and the problems that still need to be worked out if that million-dollar meat will make it out of the lab and onto the table.  If you would like to get in on the discussion, our number is 1-800-989-8255.  1-800-989-TALK.  You can also find us in Second Life on Science Friday Island.  Vladimir Mironov is an associate professor in the Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston.  Doctor Mironov joins us by phone from Singapore, where he is currently the Tan Chin Tuan Fellow at the Nanyang Technical University.  Welcome to the program, Dr. Mironov.   Dr. VLADIMIR MIRONOV (Associate Professor, Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, Medical University of South Carolina):  Welcome.  Hello.  FLATOW:  Hello.  Tell us how, how - is there new science that has to happen here, or is this basically an engineering problem?    Dr. MIRONOV:  Oh, that is a very good question.  Because you know, scientists usually investigate world which already exists. Engineers create world which is never exist.  So I think when you talk about tissue engineering meat, it is not so much scientific task.  It is more engineering task.  And if you ask me about scientific aspect, then in 1907, American Ross Harrison was the first, probably, scientist who isolate cells and start to grow cells in cell culture.  Therefore, from scientific point of view, this is one-hundred-year-old technology.  FLATOW:   So the idea is to take cells, grow them in culture, and allow them to grow enough that you recreate the meat?  Dr. MIRONOV:  Yes.  Basically, it is the field what is moving already, last 20 years, called tissue engineering.  But tissue engineering focusing on creating tissue and organs for repair and replacement in human body, and the novelty of our approach is that we want to think about another aspect of tissue engineering to create basically food.  And there are several challenges which is left of course, but basically, from my perspective, I don't see unsolvable problem how to transfer this technology in that scalable technology.  But I'm really skeptical that one million dollars will be enough.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW:  Yes, we have had other prizes in the 10 and 20 million dollar range.  This is not that much, is it?   Dr. MIRONOV:  Yeah.   FLATOW:  Now tell us about the challenges that you just mentioned.  What are some of the challenges that await you?  Dr. MIRONOV:  I can say that basically there is five main challenges.  Number one, you must of course find appropriate cell source.  And there is two groups of the people - two point of views.  One belief that you must start from embryonic cells because they are multipotent, and they have high proliferation potential.  But because they are not differentiated, you know, you must spend a lot of effort to force them to go to skeletal muscle lineage and it needs special grow factors or transcription factors, therefore it is challenging.  But the good sense of it, embryonic cells that they can - embryonic stem cells that they can proliferate and they have very low conflict(ph) effect. So, the second group of the people believe that it is better to start from so-called myoblast. It's a progenitor cell - it is a cell which has a periphery of skeletal fibers, which is already committed to be a skeletal muscle. But from another side, their proliferation potential, so-called traffic number, is a little bit limited.  So what will be the decision? What will be solution? It will show the time.  FLATOW:  And what do you grow the cells in?  Dr. MIRONOV:  Oh, that's very good question. That's the second question because in standard cell culture, people use, of course, some kind of fluid which imitate blood, without erythrocytes of course, and the main component of cell culture media is serum which has animal origin.  So there's not any point to create animal-free tissue-engineered meat if you still use animal-derived serum. So the challenge is to design so-called defined cell culture media which contain all necessary and sufficient elements to allow cells to grow and don't contain any unknown element like black box, like serum, and also which is relatively economically reasonable, because I can say that serum and cell culture is very expensive now.  FLATOW:  How close to texture feel taste would the synthetic meat, so to speak, the test-tube meat come to normal real meat from an animal?  Dr. MIRONOV: This is again an interesting point, but I don't believe - and I don't believe it's necessary that tissue-engineered meat must have taste and texture of real chicken meat. There's two reasons for this. Number one, if you go to grocery store, there's a lot of product which doesn't have any taste of real meat or real skeletal muscle like nuggets or sausage, you know.  So the point is to create a protein which - healthy animal protein. That's one aspect. The second aspect is technological.   If you really want to create meat with the taste and texture, that's became much more challenging because then you must produce not only skeletal fibers from myoblast, you must also produce fat tissue which is not a big deal and also produce blood vessels because if the tissue became very thick then you must have blood culture and then you must have connective tissue which create this texture, and that became very, very complicated. And most important it's not scalable, and if it's not scalable then it's not industrial-friendly. If it's not industrial-friendly, then you'll never produce this in a large scale.  FLATOW:  We have a question here from Bauer(ph) in Second Life, who says, \"would it be a good idea to combine genes of animals and mushrooms for example in such a way the meat could be cultured as mushrooms are or to have plants make the meat for us? \"  Dr. MIRONOV:  Yeah, there's some people who believe - actually there's a discussion Web site in Europe, and they don't like the idea of tissue-engineered meat. They call this American cultural imperialism, McDonald's again, but one name for this technology. They call this hydroponic meat, and I think this reflects the point. We don't use any genetical engineering. We don't modify the cells. We use natural cells and try to put them in natural or, we call this bio-mimicking environment, and we want to create tissue which look like natural tissue.  So, there's no any genetical modification here.  And concerning the mushrooms, I hear of two type of discussion.  One people say that you can use this for cell culture media which I don't understand completely.  And another interesting idea that if you look at mushrooms, they have so-called chitosan and chitosan is very interesting polymer because, number one, it's eatable and number two, it absorbs fat.  So, basically, you can create - if you combine - use chitosan as a scaffold or temporal support for these cells, and cells need support because they are attachment-dependent.  If you grow them all in suspension, they will not grow.  They must attach to something. If you attach them to the bottom, then you have only limit scaffold(ph).  So, fills(ph) or sponges that will increase surface area for cells and to make technology more effective.  So, chitosan, which is eatable and which also absorbs fat, can create tissue-engineering meat which will be not only useful, but also can be sold as a functional food because it can reduce fat consumption.    FLATOW:  So, you could have a big giant portabello mushroom that already looks and tastes almost like beef, but actually have real beef in it?  Dr. MIRONOV: Look, I'm an animal specialist, OK?  And you ask me questions about mushrooms.  FLATOW:  OK, we'll move on to it.  We'll move on to stuff that's right here a little more - our listeners are very eager to talk about this.  But you could make the meat, as you say, to specification.  You could make it less fatty, or for example, or more nutritious as you'd like to produce it?  Dr. MIRONOV:  I think if you - the taste of the meat depends on percent of fat.  Therefore, we can take again stem cells and force them to be fat cells.  And then we can make mixture of skeletal fibers with the fat cells.  Therefore, in this context it's not a big challenge.  The second aspect is how to make texture. I think that's the challenging stuff.  FLATOW:  Yeah, making tex. . . - 1-800-989-8255.  Lots of people want to ring in on this.  Hi, Dan, in Washington.  Welcome.  DAN (Caller):  Hi.  How are you?  FLATOW:  Hi there.  DAN:  I think this is a great program.  FLATOW:  Thank you.  DAN:  I have been a vegan for about five years, and I'm a vegan just because of the way I understand animals are treated in factory farms.  So, I'm a big supporter of this.  I would certainly eat this meat if it becomes marketable. One question I have, I understand that there is a big environmental impact on - when factory farms produce meat, and was wondering if this sort of test-tube meat would be better for the environment.  FLATOW:  Good question.  Dr. MIRONOV:  Yeah, it's a very good question.  And one of my friends, Jason who run this Web site, New Harvest, he is especially focusing on this area.  And according to his calculations is, in proper environment of tissue engineering, meat technologies are enormous because it's actually the use of area which are occupied by growing wheat and other stuff which you need to grow animals.  And, I believe, another important impact is also that if you do it indoors, then you can use land on the earth much more effectively. And because it will be with the FDA-controlled environment, it will be probably very clean, very high-tech technology.  FLATOW:  This is Talk of the Nation: Science Friday from NPR News.  I'm Ira Flatow, talking with Vladimir Mironov about test-tube meat.  Lots of people have various opinions about it.  Let's get a couple of more from Lucy in Chicago. Hi, Lucy.    LUCY (Caller):  Yes, hello. My husband of - I wish he were here.  He's currently at work.  But he went through MIT in the Department of Nutrition and Food Technology with a NASA scholarship.  His fellowship and scholarship required him to find ways to produce food including meat on space flight through using waste product, specifically Escherichia coli.  And I just wanted to say that, you know, using a tissue culture is not the only the only way to do this.  You can use waste product, as unpleasant as it sounds, and come out with a great number of food products that could resemble very closely the real thing.  I just wanted to have your - just comment on that.    FLATOW:  OK.  Let me get a comment.    Dr. MIRONOV:  Yeah.  In Soviet Union there was a secret experiment to use an Escherichia coli to produce protein.  And they succeed in this.  There was only one problem.  Yes, they can produce protein, but the smell was so terrible that nobody want to even to taste it.    FLATOW:  Details, details.    Dr. MIRONOV:  That's number one.  Number two, yes, you can use also transgenic plants and they can produce one or maximum two proteins.  The beauty of tissue engineering approach that you create authentic natural-like tissue which contain not just one protein, which you can use when you use transgenic plants.  You can create complex protein.  Complex protein which have very high nutritional value.  That's what my collaborator Dewerth Maxim(ph) told me, from Dakota.   FLATOW:  How - would you have to flavor it in any way or add artificial flavors or, you know, make it taste more like real meat that people are used to?  Dr. MIRONOV:  If you look carefully, what is the tendency now in food industry, especially in the United States, and it's very well described in the book \"Fast Food Nation. \"  In New Jersey, there are 27 plants which produce so-called artificial flavor.  Therefore, the question of flavors now is not the question of original product, it's a question of artificial flavors.    FLATOW:  Would you think this meat would cost less than regular meat that we have now?    Dr. MIRONOV:  If you look in the history of technology, you know, any high-tech product, in the beginning, especially at the initial stage, costs a lot of money because that's how much money you must invest in development of this technology, in development of building block. And if you look on microelectronics, for example, there is some interest in example which demonstrates that original product who have certain price but after marketing implementation and scalable technology implementation the price reduce 1,000 times.

But eventually, eventually I think it will be - maybe even cheaper than the recent technology.   FLATOW:  Oh, with the price of oil going up near $120 a barrel and agriculture so energy-intensive, you may be right about that.  I want to thank you for taking time to be with us today, Doctor.

BRAND:  Corey lives near Reno, Nevada, and for the past two months the area and its residents have been shaken by a series - well, a swarm, really, of quakes.  Now, here is what is crazy.

Mr. COREY FARLEY (Radio Host, KBZZ Reno, Nevada):  Oh, it's a pleasure to be here, Alex. CHADWICK:  So, how did you sleep last night? Mr. FARLEY:  Well, between about the 10:57 to 10:58 p. m. earthquake, and the six o'clock this morning when the 60 mile per hour winds began, I got a nice nap. CHADWICK:  How big was the quake last night? Mr. FARLEY:  I haven't checked.  It was fairly small.  It shook our house, our old two-story house is a little flexible anyway, but it shook the house a little bit.  And then we dozed off, and then we woke up, and the wind was shaking the house to about the same degree. CHADWICK:  So, there was a pretty big earthquake on Friday.  Things fell off the shelves, and somewhat smaller one earlier yesterday, but two months of this is going on.  How are people doing there? Mr. FARLEY:  Well, a lot of people thought they were get - we have a number of people who moved here from California in the last five or 10 years, and they thought they were getting out of the earthquake zone. And I understand real estate people are not always reliable in explaining all the hazards of when you buy a house up here, but people are starting to get worn a little thin.  Normally you have one earthquake and then a series of decreasing aftershocks, and these have gotten steadily stronger from the 20th of February.  CHADWICK:  Yeah. Mr. FARLEY:  It's grinding people down. CHADWICK:  Doesn't that kind of suggest something to everyone there? Mr. FARLEY:  We hope not.  The seismologists will not commit because it's a difficult thing to predict, but they are saying that they can't rule out a larger quake. CHADWICK:  Reno, you know, this is kind of a gambling town, isn't it? Mr. FARLEY:  It is, and it's also a very seismically active town.  But we haven't - I've got a water heater strap that's been sitting in my closet for five years, and it's still sitting on the floor of my closet - haven't strapped on the water heater yet. CHADWICK:  You're supposed to use that to strap the thing down so it doesn't fall over! Mr. FARLEY:  I used to write stories urging people to do that!

There's a scientist there who thinks one small solution to manmade climate change could be found in the stomach of the kangaroo.  Independent producer Josh Kurz brings us this report. JOSH KURZ:  It's a well-known fact that cows can lick their own nostrils.  Another well-known fact is that they have a gas problem. (Soundbite of cow mooing) KURZ:  Namely, methane, a greenhouse gas that's 21 times more bad than CO2. Unidentified Man # 1:  Methane! KURZ:  That's why with all these cows producing methane there's all these environmentalists producing hubbub. Unidentified Man # 1:  Hubbub! KURZ:  The big question is can we go green and still eat beef and dairy products?  Well, perhaps the answer is a definite maybe, but that depends on a furry Australian mammal that's famous for punching people out. (Soundbite of punch) Dr. ATHEL KLIEVE (Senior Principal Research Scientist, Queensland Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries):  The eastern grey kangaroo and the red kangaroo. . . KURZ:  That's Doctor Athol Klieve, senior principal research scientist with the Queensland Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries.  Dr. Klieve's goal is to cure cows of their gas problems.  That's why he studies animals that eat plants, herbivores.  Lately he's been looking at cows and kangaroos, two totally different animals that have one thing in common. Unidentified Man # 1:  They're both furry? KURZ:  Close.  They're both herbivores, and it turns out that it doesn't matter if you're a cow or a kangaroo, if you like eating plants you're not actually eating plants.   Dr. KLIEVE:  Herbivores basically are not able to break down and digest grasses themselves. KURZ: Instead, they pass the buck to a bunch of microbes.  These microbes eat the plants and then the animal eats the microbes.  It's a little more complicated than that, but basically here's how it works in a cow.  Grass gets chewed up in the mouth, then it travels down the esophagus into a chamber called the rumen. Unidentified Man # 1:  The rumen!  Come on, I'll show you around!  It's like a hangout spot where microbes come to party! KURZ:  And by party they mean ferment grass. Unidentified Man # 1:  It's all you can eat!  Just multiply and start fermenting. Dr. KLIEVE:  Than the microbes flush out of the rumen into the gastric stomach and digest it there.  So, really the animal is getting all of its energy and protein requirements from all the fermentation by all these microbes.   KURZ:  But there's a problem with all this partying, or fermenting. Dr. KLIEVE:  During that process you get hydrogen being formed.  Now, if you don't remove the hydrogen from the fermentation than the fermentation slows down. Unidentified Man # 1:  Total dry. Dr. KLIEVE:  Now, in sheep and cow, the way of getting rid of that is to form methane. Unidentified Man # 1:  Methane! Dr. KLIEVE:  And so really the formation of methane is actually a solution to a problem that the animal has, and that's how to get rid of the hydrogen. Unidentified Man # 1:  Methane! KURZ:  But, it's not just cows that need to get rid of this hydrogen. Dr. KLIEVE:  Now, the interesting thing is that not all herbivorous animals actually produce methane. KURZ:  Enter the kangaroo.  Kangaroos have a party chamber too, but it's called the foregut. Unidentified Man # 1:  Welcome to the foregut. Dr. KLIEVE:  Kangaroos have a different group of bacteria in their gut that instead of forming methane they form acetic acid. Unidentified Man # 2:  Acetic acid?  You mean like vinegar? Dr. KLIEVE:  Yes, it's basically the same as vinegar. KURZ:  This vinegar gets absorbed by the kangaroo and is used for energy.  What Dr. Klieve wants to do is take the microbes from the foregut in the kangaroo and transfer them into the rumen of the cow, affectively replacing methane making cow microbes with non-methane making kangaroo microbes.  The result is an eco-friendly methane-less cow that uses microbes just like a kangaroo. Unidentified Man # 3:  Oh! KURZ:  And there's a bonus. Dr. KLIEVE:  Sometimes when this comes with farmers and they ask, you know, why are we bothering, you say well, you know, if we came and said look, take 15 percent of your feed and burn it and throw it away, you'd reckon I was mad, but effectively that's really what methane is.  It's really a waste of feed energy.  The feed energy is going up into the atmosphere instead of being able to be used by the animal. KURZ:  If kangaroo microbes lived in cows we'd not only solve their gas problem, but we'd also get more efficient cows, which means more beef and more milk with the same amount of feed. Unidentified Man 4 #:  Man, all you have to do is take the bugs from the bouncy animal and stick them into the milky animal?  This sounds like a piece of cake. Dr. KLIEVE:  It's not going to work just to try to take these bugs straight out of kangaroos and put them straight into cattle.  Really there's been very little in this area previously, so we're really starting in a whole new area with a whole new set of bugs, and we need to understand them.  So, it's going to be about three years, I reckon. KURZ:  Yeah, and that's just for preliminary tests.  Then there's the challenge of developing an actual product.  The investors, the regulatory committees, more tests, more research, and blah blah blah.  How long do we have to wait before we can expect to see some gasless super cows? Dr. KLIEVE:  Considerably longer. KURZ:  For NPR News, I'm Josh Kurz. BRAND:  Stay with us.  NPR's Day to Day continues.  MADELEINE BRAND, host:  Let's go down under now to Australia.

KURZ:  The big question is can we go green and still eat beef and dairy products?  Well, perhaps the answer is a definite maybe, but that depends on a furry Australian mammal that's famous for punching people out.  (Soundbite of punch)  Dr. ATHEL KLIEVE (Senior Principal Research Scientist, Queensland Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries):  The eastern grey kangaroo and the red kangaroo. . .  KURZ:  That's Doctor Athol Klieve, senior principal research scientist with the Queensland Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries.  Dr. Klieve's goal is to cure cows of their gas problems.  That's why he studies animals that eat plants, herbivores.  Lately he's been looking at cows and kangaroos, two totally different animals that have one thing in common.  Unidentified Man # 1:  They're both furry?  KURZ:  Close.  They're both herbivores, and it turns out that it doesn't matter if you're a cow or a kangaroo, if you like eating plants you're not actually eating plants.    Dr. KLIEVE:  Herbivores basically are not able to break down and digest grasses themselves.  KURZ: Instead, they pass the buck to a bunch of microbes.  These microbes eat the plants and then the animal eats the microbes.  It's a little more complicated than that, but basically here's how it works in a cow.  Grass gets chewed up in the mouth, then it travels down the esophagus into a chamber called the rumen.  Unidentified Man # 1:  The rumen!  Come on, I'll show you around!  It's like a hangout spot where microbes come to party!  KURZ:  And by party they mean ferment grass.  Unidentified Man # 1:  It's all you can eat!  Just multiply and start fermenting.  Dr. KLIEVE:  Than the microbes flush out of the rumen into the gastric stomach and digest it there.  So, really the animal is getting all of its energy and protein requirements from all the fermentation by all these microbes.    KURZ:  But there's a problem with all this partying, or fermenting.  Dr. KLIEVE:  During that process you get hydrogen being formed.  Now, if you don't remove the hydrogen from the fermentation than the fermentation slows down.  Unidentified Man # 1:  Total dry.  Dr. KLIEVE:  Now, in sheep and cow, the way of getting rid of that is to form methane.  Unidentified Man # 1:  Methane!  Dr. KLIEVE:  And so really the formation of methane is actually a solution to a problem that the animal has, and that's how to get rid of the hydrogen.  Unidentified Man # 1:  Methane!  KURZ:  But, it's not just cows that need to get rid of this hydrogen.  Dr. KLIEVE:  Now, the interesting thing is that not all herbivorous animals actually produce methane.  KURZ:  Enter the kangaroo.  Kangaroos have a party chamber too, but it's called the foregut.  Unidentified Man # 1:  Welcome to the foregut.  Dr. KLIEVE:  Kangaroos have a different group of bacteria in their gut that instead of forming methane they form acetic acid.  Unidentified Man # 2:  Acetic acid?  You mean like vinegar?  Dr. KLIEVE:  Yes, it's basically the same as vinegar.  KURZ:  This vinegar gets absorbed by the kangaroo and is used for energy.  What Dr. Klieve wants to do is take the microbes from the foregut in the kangaroo and transfer them into the rumen of the cow, affectively replacing methane making cow microbes with non-methane making kangaroo microbes.  The result is an eco-friendly methane-less cow that uses microbes just like a kangaroo.  Unidentified Man # 3:  Oh!  KURZ:  And there's a bonus.  Dr. KLIEVE:  Sometimes when this comes with farmers and they ask, you know, why are we bothering, you say well, you know, if we came and said look, take 15 percent of your feed and burn it and throw it away, you'd reckon I was mad, but effectively that's really what methane is.  It's really a waste of feed energy.  The feed energy is going up into the atmosphere instead of being able to be used by the animal.  KURZ:  If kangaroo microbes lived in cows we'd not only solve their gas problem, but we'd also get more efficient cows, which means more beef and more milk with the same amount of feed.  Unidentified Man 4 #:  Man, all you have to do is take the bugs from the bouncy animal and stick them into the milky animal?  This sounds like a piece of cake.  Dr. KLIEVE:  It's not going to work just to try to take these bugs straight out of kangaroos and put them straight into cattle.  Really there's been very little in this area previously, so we're really starting in a whole new area with a whole new set of bugs, and we need to understand them.  So, it's going to be about three years, I reckon.  KURZ:  Yeah, and that's just for preliminary tests.  Then there's the challenge of developing an actual product.  The investors, the regulatory committees, more tests, more research, and blah blah blah.  How long do we have to wait before we can expect to see some gasless super cows?  Dr. KLIEVE:  Considerably longer.  KURZ:  For NPR News, I'm Josh Kurz.  BRAND:  Stay with us.  NPR's Day to Day continues. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.

Every year, the coots flock to Southern California looking for sunshine. We're not talking about elderly tourist, we're talking about migratory birds. They arrive every year, but recently some of these seasonal visitors in search of warmth have received a chilly reception in one wealthy subdivision. As Gloria Hillard reports. GLORIA HILLARD: The first thing you notice about Bridgeport, a subdivision in the middle of the rolling hills of Southern California, is the nautical theme. There's a fake lighthouse that serves as a community center and houses that looks straight out of Cape Cod with white picket fences and manicured rose gardens. And then there's the 15-acre man-made lake. (Soundbite of duck quacking)  HILLARD: It appears the homeowners aren't the only ones enjoying the lifestyle here. Ducks swim and splash, a Canadian goose is lounging on the grass, and so are about a dozen American coots. They are smaller than the ducks. They're black with white beaks, big feet and according to the Bridgeport Homeowners Association, a couple bad habits. Number one, they eat the grass, says president Brady Ballantine(ph). Number two. . . Mr. BRADY BALLANTINE (President, Bridgeport Homeowners Association): The fecal matter from the coots is all over the landscaping and along many of the paved walkways along the lake, making it difficult at best to have a nice walk around the lake. HILLARD: It's the coot poop that's prompted the Homeowners Association to seek a permit from U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service to kill some of the birds, which are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The board has obtained permits before. Brad Bortner, a migratory bird coordinator with the federal agency, says in 2003, 27 coots were killed. Mr. BRAD BORTNER (Division of Migratory Bird and Habitat Programs): They were authorized to either shoot them or capture them and euthanize them with carbon dioxide. HILLARD: They chose the euthanasia method and that would be their choice this time around. The current president of the Homeowners Association, Brady Ballantine says he's not keen on the shooting idea. Mr. BALLANTINE: It's certainly not our intent to have any method used that would involve firing weapons at the community. HILLARD: The Homeowners Association would contract with a pest control company to bait the coots with a drug-laced corn that knocks them out before euthanizing them. That caused some concern with Bridgeport resident Debra Volk(ph). Ms. DEBRA VOLK (Bridgeport resident): What about the other birds? They're not going to eat that? HILLARD: Ms. Volk was on a walk around the lake with her dog, Wolfgang. On this day there didn't appear to be any coot poop along the sidewalk. She suggests that I check out the dock where the canoes and paddle boats were tied up. And there was a fair amount of droppings, but there was no way to ascertain if they were left by the coots, ducks or the somewhat cranky Canadian goose. Ms. THERESA SAVEYKI(ph) (Audubon Society): They go to the bathroom, like the rest of living creatures. HILLARD: Theresa Saveyki is a former chairwoman with the local chapter of the Audubon Society. Ms. SAVEYKI: You can't put man-made waterways in a state that's lost, you know, over 90 percent of their wetlands and not expect to attract wildlife. HILLARD: Continuing my stroll, I found Linda Howard(ph) sitting in her yard looking out over the lake - a huge smile on her face. She's a new resident. Ms. LINDA HOWARD (Bridgeport resident): It's always quiet like this too. It's just lovely. You know, it's just lovely. HILLARD: Yes, just the other day she heard some talk of the coot issue.

That's how birds are able to migrate thousands of miles with such accuracy. COHEN:  Scientists in England now think they've found a chemical reaction that may help explain this biological compass.  NPR's Joe Palca has more. JOE PALCA:  Peter Hore is a physical chemist of the University of Oxford in England.  He appears in this story because he has a very particular research interest. Dr. PETER HORE (Physical Chemistry, University of Oxford):  All of my research life I have looked at magnetic effects of various sorts in chemistry. PALCA:  It turns out that certain chemicals act a bit like magnets.  About a decade ago, Hore became intrigued by the suggestion that there might be a chemical reaction that was so sensitive to magnetic effects that it could even detect the extremely weak magnetic field of the Earth.  So, he began looking for just such a reaction. And, as he and his colleagues write in the current issue of the journal Nature, they think they've found one.  It's a reaction based on a chemical that's similar to one found inside a bird's eye.  Now, that's an important point because Hore says experiments with birds show that light appears to be essential for a bird's magnetic sense to work. Dr. HORE:  There's a requirement for blue light.  Without blue or green light, the birds can't use their compass. PALCA:  The theory that birds have this kind of chemical compass has been around for 40 years.  Thorsten Ritz is a physicist by training.  He's at the University of California at Irvine.  He proposed a theory eight years ago that attempted to explain how this chemical compass would work. Dr. THORSTEN RITZ (Physicist, University of California at Irvine):  There are lots of theoretical speculations out there, and arguments why this should work in principle. PALCA:  But Ritz says its one thing to have theories.  What Hore and his colleagues have done is provide data. Dr. RITZ:  This is the first study that actually shows that there are Earth strength magnetic field effects on a photochemical reaction. And, so, that's the big contribution here. PALCA:  Ritz says Peter Hore has not found a chemical reaction that exists in birds, just a chemical reaction that could exist in birds. And Ritz says Hore and his colleagues have only shown that their reaction responds to magnetic fields in the laboratory. Dr. RITZ:  Now, that is of course different from the question of saying if this was actually happening in an organism, and that requires completely different tests in some sense. PALCA:  But Ritz says those tests can, and will be carried out.  Ritz has actually done some of the tests on how robins navigate, and the results are encouraging.  He says research on how animals perceive magnetic fields has become extremely exciting recently. Dr. RITZ:  It's not every day that you can work on discovering a new sense, you know.  It's like when you look around we know pretty much a lot about vision, hearing, and smell, and so on. And the magnetic sense is really one of these big mysteries.

The video, along with a radio story, kicked off the series. You can see the video on our website, but first, Robert's radio story of a single, very important atom. ROBERT KRULWICH: To get to the heart of the global-warming story, the very heart of it, it turns out that the scientific explanation hangs on the behavior of one very particular atom.  Dr. DANIEL G. NOCERA (Chemistry, Massachusetts Institute of Technology): That atom being carbon. KRULWICH: The more you know about carbon, says Professor Dan Nocera, who teaches chemistry at MIT, the more you'll know about global warming. Carbon is the key. First, because it's everywhere. The lead in a lead pencil? Really carbon. Diamonds? Carbon. Professor Nocera. . . Dr. NOCERA: Yeah. KRULWICH: He's - well, mostly he's water, but if I squeeze him with a sponge and got all the water out of Dan, well, his dry weight, the non-water part, is what part carbon? Dr. NOCERA: It's a big percentage. Boy, I don't know that number. KRULWICH: Well, we looked it up, and all dry, Dan's about two-thirds carbon. Dr. NOCERA: Yeah. Carbon is the central element of life. KRULWICH: So much so that everything that is alive, and I mean everything, a housefly, a rooster, a tiger, from the smallest yeast to the biggest thing you can imagine. . . (Soundbite of whale calls) KRULWICH: This is a singing whale. Inside every cell of every creature, bar none, if you look you will find, carbon, and why? Because, says science writer Natalie Angier, carbon is the duct tape of life. It's what holds living things together. That's carbon's job. Dr. NOCERA: Carbon next to carbon next to carbon are holding hands. KRULWICH: In a limp sort of way? Or in a firm-grip sort of way? Dr. NOCERA: In a grim grip sort of way. Unidentified Man: (Singing) Grab your partner, don't let go. Grab them hard and do-si-do. KRULWICH: If you think of carbon atoms at, say, a square dance, not that you would, but why not? You are looking at a very social atom which likes to grab hold of a partner, and not just one partner, but sometimes four simultaneously. Unidentified Man: (Singing) OK, carbons, grab a friend, promenade and grab again. Keep on grabbing, form a chain, hold on tight and shout your name. Carbon!  KRULWICH: The thing to remember here is that when a carbon atom grabs hold of another atom. . . Unidentified Man: (Singing) Grab your partner! KRULWICH: Like that. You do it with real force, like a really tight handshake, so there's energy in the bond. Dr. NOCERA: That's right. That's the nature of the grip or the bond. It's stored right in that - stored right in that firm handshake. KRULWICH: So what holds the atoms together then, and what holds creatures together, in the end, is energy, but now here's the surprise. When a creature dies, the atoms inside still hold on, says MIT professor Donald Sadoway. Dr. DONALD R. SADOWAY (Materials Chemistry, Massachusetts Institute of Technology): The idea is that those bonds are strong and they remain strong. They don't require. . . KRULWICH: Even in death? Dr. SADOWAY: Yes. Yes.  KRULWICH: So, a long, long time ago there was a sea, it was a shallow sea in what we now call the Middle East, and in that sea, there were little creatures called zoaplankton, kind of like jellyfish, and they would swim around all day long filled with carbon atoms gripped inside, and then they died, and their corpses upon corpses upon corpses, millions of years worth, sank to the bottom of the sea and got squeezed into a mush. Dr. SADOWAY: But didn't get so mushed that it gave up its handholding with other carbon atoms. That's why it's called fossil fuels. Fossils, sort of - the fossil of decaying corpses of plants and living things got pressed into oil. KRULWICH: Oil, yes. So oil, then, is ancient life, but it's liquefied? Dr. SADOWAY: That's right. KRULWICH: But if the energy is still in there, now the question is, how do you get the energy out? Well, if you can make a bond, you can break a bond. We do this all the time, you just don't realize it. Set a log on fire, the fire excites the carbon atoms inside the log, and they break their connections. (Soundbite of fire crackling) Dr. SADOWAY: So, you're really just freeing that carbon from all of its bonds, its handholding. It's the releasing the grip. KRULWICH: And as the atoms unclasp and switch around, they release energy in the form of heat, which is why you get warm when you sit by a fire. Or here's another form of bond breaking, eat a carrot. (Soundbite of chewing) KRULWICH: Carrots have carbon locked inside, but when the carrot gets into your stomach, your digestive juices break down the bonds, and release calories. Dr. SADOWAY: Calorie is a measure of energy, and that helps you get around, that powers you. KRULWICH: Same thing happens when you put a spark to gasoline. (Soundbite of car starting) KRULWICH: That excites the carbon atoms, breaks the bonds, releases energy, and off you go. So, we break carbon bonds all the time, and every time we do the waste product is the same. Whether it's a fire, a carrot, or an engine, when you break carbon you get carbon dioxide. Dr. SADOWAY: And guess what, when you burn coal, you get the same thing. KRULWICH: And this isn't an accident. Carbon deep down, yes, is a very social atom. It doesn't like ever, ever being alone. (Soundbite of music) KRULWICH: The instant its bonds are broken it immediately seeks a new mate. Dr. SADOWAY: Immediately, that's right. KRULWICH: And whenever it can, whenever possible, what carbon really wants, what makes it most stable, most settled, is to bond permanently with oxygen. Dr. SADOWAY: Oxygen is a very happy mate for carbon. KRULWICH: And not just one oxygen. It likes two. Carbon is a polygamist. One carbon plus two oxygens, CO2. That's the perfect union. Dr. SADOWAY: That relationship of carbon's lifestyle with oxygen is so happy that it is incredibly stable. KRULWICH: So, once carbon finds two oxygens, it clings to them fiercely. Once CO2 is formed, it's very, very hard to pry apart. Dr. SADOWAY: Made in heaven. Yeah. It's for a long time. KRULWICH: So, the more we break those carbon bonds, the more we form CO2 bonds. It's all about the bonds, says Professor Sadoway. Dr. SADOWAY: Absolutely. It's all about bonds. It's about making bonds, and breaking bonds. It's all about the bond. (Soundbite of movie \"James Bond\") Mr. SEAN CONNERY: (As James Bond) Bond, James Bond. KRULWICH: No. Not that \"Bond,\" but bonds do matter. One could argue that civilization began when man learned to tame fire, learned how to break carbon bonds, and those fires then became furnaces, and then factories, and engines breaking more carbon bonds. Then people got cars, and planes, and appliances breaking more carbon bonds. And as people on earth get richer, they use more and more and more carbon, and when they break bonds we get more and more and more carbon dioxide. Dr. SADOWAY: The richer you are the more carbon dioxide you're making, because you're using more carbon, because you're using more energy. KRULWICH: And carbon that's been hiding for eons deep in the Earth gets pulled to the surface. Dr. SADOWAY: Now we've freed it, and it's out there, and it's in our oceans, it's in our sky, and it's in our ground. KRULWICH: And because CO2 doesn't dissolve or go away, the oceans can absorb some, trees can absorb some, but we're making more than our trees and oceans can handle, so we end up with more and more CO2 in the air. Dr. SADOWAY: That's scientific fact. We know scientists have been monitoring this for years, and the world is filling up with carbon dioxide. KRULWICH: And the problem is when sunshine hits the Earth and then bounces back up to the sky, it now bumps into all those new carbon dioxide molecules floating up there in the air, which warms those molecules, which then warms the air, which warms the oceans, which melts the glaciers, which raises the seas, and that's when you get a greenhouse effect, classic global warming, not to mention global-warming movies. (Soundbite of movie \"The Day After Tomorrow\") Mr. TERRY RHOADS: (As L. A. Anchorman) We could see a wind-driven storm surge that could threaten the entire eastern seaboard. . . KRULWICH: But even if you think this is unbelievable, which it is, still, says Professor Nocera. . . Dr. NOCERA: We should be worrying about this carbon dioxide. . . KRULWICH: Because we can't afford to get too much warmer. So, what are our options? Well, we can't stop people from using carbon, we can't stop people from wanting to get richer, and most of all we can't stop a carbon atom from behaving like a carbon atom. Dr. NOCERA: Because that's what the laws of nature say, and it does what it's supposed to do. KRULWICH: But while carbon's nature is fixed, people happily can be flexible. There may be ways, new ways, to use less carbon, or capture carbon dioxide, but they will not be cheap. Dr. NOCERA: It's going to be really tough, scientifically and engineering-wise. I think we can do it, but it's going to be the will of the people how much they want to do it. KRULWICH: Because in the end, global warming is less about science than it is about choice. Carbon can't choose. People can. Robert Krulwich, NPR News, New York.

In the Northeast, the endangered India bat is one of many bat species in trouble. A mysterious disease named for one of its symptoms, white-nose syndrome, has been killing off bat populations. In New York State alone, environmental officials estimate hundreds of thousands of bats, a large majority, may have the disease. Scientists are trying to identify the infected bats using thermal imaging cameras, and producer Jim Metzner has been training scientists to make audio recordings of their field research. Among those scientists are some biologists in New York's Ulster Country. They're trying to get to the bottom of white-nose syndrome in some deep, dark places. Mr. ALAN HICKS (Wildlife Biologist, New York State's Department of Environmental Conservation): This mine, it's, I think, the seventh largest Indiana bat site in the country. Oh, it's a 120 feet down to the bottom, and then we've got to go 20, 30 yards to the left before you get into any bats. Keep a hold of this end. As you guys start getting down there - do you want to go two at a time? We've got two lines, if you want to. My name is Alan Hicks. I'm a wildlife biologist with New York States' Department of Environmental Conservation. I started working on bats in New York State in 1979, and have been the bat specialist for the endangered species program ever since. Every two years, biologists like myself across the eastern US go into all the caves and mines that have Indiana bats, and they count them. And so we've had this trend information since the '80s. Just in the last few years, that trend had turned around and is going up again, and everybody was very excited about it, until last year. We were doing one of our surveys, and we found literally thousands of dead animals laying in the cave. And all of the 700 Indiana bats that had been there since the 1930's - there's always been Indiana bats in every winter survey that, even the early researchers had done - they're gone. And that caused us to start looking in other sites in the area, and we found a total of four places that had this - whatever their problem was. There were affected sites in that we found dead animals. And that was last year. We started again this year to survey even more closely. We visited sites that, last year, were clean. And now they are affected as well. Unidentified Man #1: This is the most difficult part right here. Is that all (unintelligible) where you are? That stuff below you? Unidentified Man #2: I'm not here. Mr. JUSTIN BOYLE (Ph. D. Student, Indiana State University): Justin Boyle, Ph. D. student at Indiana State University. What we're trying to do today is get pictures, thermal images, of bats as they hibernate. So we're going to try to get into this mine as quietly as we can. We have thermal imaging equipment. We're going to take pictures of clusters of a hibernating bats, trying to see what temperature they're hibernating at compared to the rocks where they're hibernating on. Mr. HICKS: Forty five and 46, and there's one individual with a white nose right in the middle. (Soundbite of rustling) Mr. HICKS: Here, here. Hold up. Stop right there while I get this guy. Mr. BOYLE: In this specific case, we're actually here because of this fungus, the white-nose syndrome. One of the ideas that we've - that has been proposed by several people is that these bats have a lowered immunity response because of their hibernating. One of the ways they might be able to avoid that is to warm up a little bit, which would possibly increase their immunity response. We don't actually know that. So what we're doing today is trying to take thermal images to see if the infected bats are, in fact, warmer than the uninfected bats. Mr. HICKS: Forty seven, 48. . . Mr. BOYLE: We're hoping to have some practical application with this, if we can't find the infected bats using thermal energy. If we could find the bats are a little bit warmer and they are infected, we might be able to remove those from the population or to help avoid the spread of those individuals. Mr. HICKS: Forty nine, 50. It is amazingly cold down here for these guys. I don't think they want to come out of hibernation. Four. . . Mr. BOYLE: There were - in a section we were in, there were probably 1,500 to 2,000 bats, a few fairly good sized clusters. They were behaving a little oddly this trip. They didn't actually wake up when we were in there. And we were in there for almost two hours, right underneath them, talking and working, and there was no response at all. It could be that the bats are out of energy, and they just don't want to wake up, or there could be something else going on. But, at least in my experience, that's an odd behavior. Mr. HICKS: They're more congregated near the entrance of other caves, mines, and in colder regions than they typically roost. There's something unusual is going on with them. And physically, something's happening to them, and I don't know what that is yet, but we're working on it. (Soundbite of clicking) Mr. HICKS: Fifty five, 56, and that individual does have white nose. One does. NORRIS: Our Science Diary was produced by Jim Metzner. He hosts the public radio show PULSE OF THE PLANET. The clicking and whirring sounds you heard are made by a thermal imaging camera. You can learn more about white-nose syndrome, and you can watch a video of the infected bats at our Web site, npr. org.

Every two years, biologists like myself across the eastern US go into all the caves and mines that have Indiana bats, and they count them. And so we've had this trend information since the '80s. Just in the last few years, that trend had turned around and is going up again, and everybody was very excited about it, until last year. We were doing one of our surveys, and we found literally thousands of dead animals laying in the cave. And all of the 700 Indiana bats that had been there since the 1930's - there's always been Indiana bats in every winter survey that, even the early researchers had done - they're gone. And that caused us to start looking in other sites in the area, and we found a total of four places that had this - whatever their problem was. There were affected sites in that we found dead animals. And that was last year. We started again this year to survey even more closely. We visited sites that, last year, were clean. And now they are affected as well.  Unidentified Man #1: This is the most difficult part right here. Is that all (unintelligible) where you are? That stuff below you?  Unidentified Man #2: I'm not here.  Mr. JUSTIN BOYLE (Ph. D. Student, Indiana State University): Justin Boyle, Ph. D. student at Indiana State University. What we're trying to do today is get pictures, thermal images, of bats as they hibernate. So we're going to try to get into this mine as quietly as we can. We have thermal imaging equipment. We're going to take pictures of clusters of a hibernating bats, trying to see what temperature they're hibernating at compared to the rocks where they're hibernating on.  Mr. HICKS: Forty five and 46, and there's one individual with a white nose right in the middle.  (Soundbite of rustling)  Mr. HICKS: Here, here. Hold up. Stop right there while I get this guy.  Mr. BOYLE: In this specific case, we're actually here because of this fungus, the white-nose syndrome. One of the ideas that we've - that has been proposed by several people is that these bats have a lowered immunity response because of their hibernating. One of the ways they might be able to avoid that is to warm up a little bit, which would possibly increase their immunity response. We don't actually know that.  So what we're doing today is trying to take thermal images to see if the infected bats are, in fact, warmer than the uninfected bats.  Mr. HICKS: Forty seven, 48. . .  Mr. BOYLE: We're hoping to have some practical application with this, if we can't find the infected bats using thermal energy. If we could find the bats are a little bit warmer and they are infected, we might be able to remove those from the population or to help avoid the spread of those individuals.  Mr. HICKS: Forty nine, 50. It is amazingly cold down here for these guys. I don't think they want to come out of hibernation. Four. . .  Mr. BOYLE: There were - in a section we were in, there were probably 1,500 to 2,000 bats, a few fairly good sized clusters. They were behaving a little oddly this trip. They didn't actually wake up when we were in there. And we were in there for almost two hours, right underneath them, talking and working, and there was no response at all. It could be that the bats are out of energy, and they just don't want to wake up, or there could be something else going on. But, at least in my experience, that's an odd behavior.  Mr. HICKS: They're more congregated near the entrance of other caves, mines, and in colder regions than they typically roost. There's something unusual is going on with them. And physically, something's happening to them, and I don't know what that is yet, but we're working on it.  (Soundbite of clicking)  Mr. HICKS: Fifty five, 56, and that individual does have white nose. One does.  NORRIS: Our Science Diary was produced by Jim Metzner.

Over the weekend, six sea lions were found dead near the Bonneville Dam along the Columbia River between Oregon and Washington. Sea lions have been coming in recent years to feed on the spring run of Chinook salmon. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife set traps to catch the sea lions, and that's where the animals were found. Initially, it was thought the sea lions were shot. But now that appears not to be the case.  Rick Hargrave is a spokesman for Fish and Wildlife. Mr. RICK HARGRAVE (Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife): From the very beginning, although it appeared that they had been shot, we were, you know, we wanted to make sure that, you know, that was confirmed. So in this case, what we thought was gunshot wounds are certainly not now. So now they're going to move forward and try to find out what the cause of death is of these animals. BLOCK: Now, why was it assumed that they had been shot originally? Mr. HARGRAVE: Well, I think there were some markings on the animals, possibly, that indicated that they may have been shot. And then when they looked into it closer, what they saw were shallow puncture wounds that were attributed to sea lion bite marks. When they initially pulled the animals off the trap and ran metal detectors over them, they did get some hits on there. These sea lions are sometimes shot at, whether it be on the Columbia River or elsewhere. What they found was old buck shot and some - a . 22 slug that - nothing that indicated that those were the cause of death for those animals. BLOCK: Why would people be shooting sea lions in the first place? Mr. HARGRAVE: Well, that's a good question, Melissa. I think they believe that these sea lions possibly don't belong there in the Columbia River. And they, unfortunately, make poor choices to shoot them. BLOCK: And this has been a problem for some time, I gather. The salmon stocks have been going down. And the numbers of sea lions coming to feed on them have been going way up. Mr. HARGRAVE: Yeah. This is a new phenomena, having this number of sea lions up this far in the Columbia River system, and where they are is where there's a lot of fishing opportunities. And so you get fishermen and sea lions in the mix, and they create some problems. BLOCK: Let's describe these traps where the sea lions were found. There are platforms floating on the river surrounded by metal fencing, and the idea is the sea lions come in to rest and they're trapped. If someone on the island, which is restricted, there's restricted access on the island - someone on the island pulls a cord and shuts the door. Mr. HARGRAVE: These doors are always kept open because we want the sea lions to come up and off. That's what they're used to doing, is hauling out of the water, lounging around, and then getting back in the water. And they've gotten comfortable with those floating platforms out there. And then during those times when we were doing our trapping and transfer operations, you'd peek over the rail, you'd see if there were sea lions on those particular traps that you wanted to keep, then you would pull that rope pretty hard, and then that would release a latch and then the door would come down. BLOCK: And this is part of the mystery, because when you found the dead sea lions, those doors on the traps had been sprung, they were closed. Mr. HARGRAVE: They were closed, yes. BLOCK: So how could that have happened? Mr. HARGRAVE: And that's one of the facets of the investigation. They have to, you know, piece together some information to see how those doors had come down.

Ogden Nash established his reputation with poetry, not biology, and yet we can't resist introducing this next scientific story with a few lines of Nash's verse. Take it away, Melissa. BLOCK: Here we go. I like the duck-billed platypus because it is anomalous. I like the way it raises its family, partly birdly, partly mammaly. I like its independent attitude; let no one call it a duck-billed platitude. NORRIS: Actually, that's pretty accurate. Scientists have now completed a draft DNA sequence of the platypus genome. And as NPR's Joe Palca reports, the platypus is, in fact, partly birdly, partly mammaly. JOE PALCA: The platypus is definitely unusual - not just because it only lives in Australia. Richard Wilson directed the platypus genome project at Washington University in St. Louis.  Dr. RICHARD WILSON (Washington University School of Medicine): When the first specimens were brought back to England in the 18th century, most of the naturalists that looked at them thought that they were some sort of a fake - a taxidermist had gotten creative and sewn the bill of a duck on some sort of beaver-like creature and added webbed feet for grins. PALCA: But the platypus is, of course, real, even if its genome is a bit strange. Most genes in the platypus make things typical of mammals - genes for fur, genes for making milk. But unlike most mammals, the platypus lays eggs. And as Wilson reports in this week's issue of the journal Nature, the platypus has the same genes birds have for making hard-shelled eggs. And that's not the only odd thing.  Dr. WILSON: They also have very bizarre sex chromosomes. PALCA: Wilson says the sex chromosomes of platypuses - yes, I checked, it's platypuses - are more like the sex chromosomes of birds.  Dr. WILSON: A male platypus has five X chromosomes, no two alike, and five Y chromosomes. PALCA: In addition to bird and mammal-like genes, the platypus also has reptile-like genes. Male platypuses make a kind of venom that they transmit using a spur on their hind legs.  Jerry Siegel is a neuroscientist at UCLA who's studied the platypus. He says you really want to steer clear of this venom. Dr. JERRY SIEGEL (UCLA): It causes intractable pain which lasts for months. There's some thought that this is used primarily in mating rather than predation. PALCA: Mating? That doesn't sound like any fun. (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. SIEGEL: It doesn't sound like fun for the matee, but they've been around for a long time, so it must work. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. SIEGEL: Like a bad marriage, you know, they've worked out a relationship. PALCA: Siegel says the platypus can tell us a lot about how animals evolved. That's because platypuses split off from the rest of the mammal line more than 150 million years ago. So if a platypus has a particular trait, you know it's an ancient mammalian trait, not something that showed up more recently. Take REM sleep. Siegel says some scientists argue that REM sleep only evolved after mammals got bigger brains. So Siegel studied sleeping platypuses. Dr. SIEGEL: And what we saw is that in the platypus, the REM sleep is absolutely unequivocal. PALCA: Meaning mammals had REM sleep long before our bulging brains evolved. The platypus is just one of many species that are currently having their genomes probed, but geneticist Richard Wilson says there are still plenty of gaps in the genetic record that scientists would like to fill. Dr. WILSON: If we think about the platypus and the chicken, there's a couple hundred million years of evolution in between. So you'd like to sequence things in between. PALCA: That's not a problem.

Lindsay Lohan's mug shot is a tabloid mainstay, but this one was part of an ad. Ignition interlocks are a good idea for Lindsay, the ad said, but a bad idea for us. They defined \"us\" with pictures of a bride and groom toasting and a few guys in button-down shirts raising beer glasses.  Basically, the ad says ignition interlocks, or in-car breathalyzers, are a great tool for getting hardcore drunks off our roads. However, the ad asserts, activists now want to put one in every car in America. That means the end of moderate and responsible drinking prior to driving. The ad directs the reader to interlockfacts. com, a website with a slew of anti-mandatory interlock statistics.  So, who's behind the ad? The American Beverage Institute, supported by the restaurant industry. The main activists said to want mandatory interlocks on all cars is Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Chuck Hurley, the CEO of MADD, objects to the ads. He says his group doesn't want in-car breathalyzers everywhere. It isn't against legalizing moderate drinking and driving, and it doesn't favor lowering the definition of legally drunk. Mr. CHARLES A. HURLEY (Chief Executive Officer, Mothers Against Drunk Driving): We do support, in fact, are very interested in the exploration of advanced technologies that could be in all vehicles on a voluntary basis that would not allow them to be driven above the legal limit of . 08. The ads by the chain restaurants intensely distorted our position on that.  PESCA: Sarah Longwell is a spokesperson for the American Beverage Institute. She joins us from our studio in Washington, D. C. Hi, Sarah. Ms. SARAH LONGWELL (Spokesperson, American Beverage Institute): Hi. Thanks for having me. PESCA: Sure. What is - who is the American Beverage Institute? Ms. LONGWELL: Ah, well, we're a restaurant trade association, and we promote moderate and responsible consumption, and simply protect people's right to drink moderately and responsibly prior to driving. PESCA: Any restaurants we know behind it? Ms. LONGWELL: Ah, yes, I mean. . . PESCA: Any sort of big names? Ms. LONGWELL: It's sort of generally, you know, America's favorite family chain restaurants, so you know, probably some that you were talking about just before in your segment on the review. PESCA: Right. So summarize the major point of this ad campaign, which, I should say, was not only in the New York Post, but USA Today, and I don't know if it was anywhere else. Ms. LONGWELL: Yeah, and we're going to continue the campaign, because, you know, we're trying to educate the public about the fact that there are these groups out there who want to put this technology in all cars. They want it to come as standard equipment. And the fact is, Chuck's really parsing his words carefully, you know, in what he was saying before.  The fact is, MADD has gone on the record repeatedly advocating for mandatory ignition interlocks in all cars, and it's not just them. You know, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is, you know, the traffic-safety branch of the federal government, has just committed ten million dollars to developing the technology to the point where it can be in all cars and can be, sort of, unobtrusive.  I mean, they've got technology now that's going to read BAC levels through the moisture in your hands, that has, you know, retinal scans, or little sniffers that sniff out alcohol, and you know, they're doing this because they want it to be able to be like airbags, where it's there in the car but you don't notice it unless, you know, you need it, or it's triggered. PESCA: Couple questions. If it stops drunk driving, why is that a bad thing? Ms. LONGWELL: Well, you know, that's the point of the ad, though. I mean, we're advocating for the technology to stop drunk driving. What we don't want is for it to be applied to people who are not drunk. And the fact is, you know, Chuck doesn't believe - because we debate them all the time. We deal with them all the time. Mothers Against Drunk Driving, a lot of times, has said - has gone on the record saying this, they don't think it's OK to have one drink prior to driving.  And once this technology is in all cars, it is not going to be set at . 08. You know, I've heard Chuck say it before, that they would advocate that it be set at . 08, but the fact is, Mothers Against Drunk Driving talks about - constantly about, you cannot drink and drive, and the fact is, it is legal in all 50 states to drink moderately and responsibly prior to driving. . . PESCA: Well, that's a - that point is something that Chuck Hurley, when I talked to him earlier, made exactly. Let me just play a little of that. Ms. LONGWELL: Sure. Mr. HURLEY: In fact, it is legal to drink and drive in all 50 states. We don't recommend it. We do believe best policy is not drink and drive, but it shouldn't be criminalized until . 08. PESCA: So there he says, and he expanded with me, that he doesn't believe there should be any technology that bars someone who's not already an offender from getting into their car after having a drink or two drinks, as long as they're under the legal limit. Do you think he's lying? Ms. LONGWELL: Well, what I think that Chuck is trying to do is that they know that the public is not on their side on this issue just yet, and they're trying to normalize the equipment in the eyes of the public before the - before they can get it in all cars. And so, what I think he's doing is I think he's choosing his words carefully right now so that they can take incremental steps to get the technology in all cars. I mean, what they're trying to do right now, I mean, where the legislation is, for the most part now is trying to get the technology mandated for low-BAC, first-time offenders. So people can. . . PESCA: That's blood-alcohol content. . . Ms. LONGWELL: Right. PESCA: Get it mandatory for people who've been convicted of drunk driving so that they can't start their cars even - with a beer or two - with even a beer in them. Ms. LONGWELL: Yes, because they would be set very, very low. . . PESCA: And what's wrong with that? Ms. LONGWELL: Well, what - we think that it's fine - I mean, again, the reason that we ran the ad was to go after hardcore repeat offenders, or high-BAC drunk drivers, like Lindsey Lohan. . . PESCA: Well, what's wrong with going after. . .  Ms. LONGWELL: So we. . . PESCA: What's wrong with going after just a one-time offender? Ms. LONGWELL: Well, because then you're talking about somebody who might be one sip over . 08. I mean, a 120-pound woman can drink two six-ounce glasses of wine and be at . 08, and so, do you think that she should be punished the same way as the guy who's had ten beers? I mean, we don't. The fact is, you know, we have graduated penalties in this country, where the punishment fits the crime, and it, you know, you don't punish somebody who's driving 30 miles over the speed limit the same way you'd punish somebody going five miles over the speed limit. . . PESCA: Well, is the question. . . Ms. LONGWELL: Those are two different levels of crime. . . PESCA: It's. . . Ms. LONGWELL: It's like - sorry. . . PESCA: Sorry. Is the question one of punishing that person? Or one of protecting everyone else? Lindsey Lohan, you point to, because she's well-known and the ad worked well. It got picked up everywhere. But you say that she is a repeat offender. Ms. LONGWELL: Right. PESCA: And what MADD wants to do is put the technology in cars even if someone has been convicted once. Why do you object to it be - being put in cars if someone has a drunk-driving conviction under their belt? Ms. LONGWELL: Well, again, I mean, what we're talking about is a distinction where the punishment fits the crime. You know, we're - we fully support the technology for high-BAC repeat offenders like Lohan, but think that it's going too far to mandate the technology for somebody who might be one sip over the legal limit. Those people have presented two very different levels of threat to traffic safety, and they should be treated differently.  And so - and the other reason that we object to it is that we know that what's going on here is, for these groups, and it's MADD, et cetera, they're trying to normalize the equipment in the minds of the public by getting it in more cars now, by passing more legislation, so that ultimately they can put it in all cars. And I mean, we're essentially trying to draw a line to keep sort of this \"creeping\" mandating of interlocks from going further. PESCA: Your site says, quote, \"that interlocks create de facto Prohibition,\" and it even forecasts into the future and says that, \"by the year 2019, the legal limit will be . 03. \" How could you know that? Ms. LONGWELL: Well, I mean, it's just experience. I mean, we deal with this stuff all the time. PESCA: No, experience is things that happened already. I'm asking you how do you know. . . ? Ms. LONGWELL: Well, yeah, sure. . . PESCA: About stuff that happens in the future? Ms. LONGWELL: Sure, OK, well, let's look at things that have happened already. So we know that Mothers Against Drunk Driving constantly talks about the fact that they don't think it's OK to have one drink prior to driving. And so. . . PESCA: Well, they - you know, he - but he said to me that whether he thinks it's OK, Mothers Against Drunk Driving does not advocate for a change in the law. Ms. LONGWELL: Exactly, and as I was saying before, you know, what he's trying to do is, you know, parse his words carefully now, because as soon as this technology is in all cars, they are going to work tirelessly to get the BAC levels set lower. And the fact is, once they're in all cars, there are things called \"presumptive-intoxication laws\" in 24 states. That means that if you are at a . 04 or a . 05 in at least 24 states, you can be presumed to be intoxicated and convicted if you get stopped, you know, at a sobriety checkpoint and they find you to have a BAC of . 04 or . 05. You know, so these - the technology will have to be set at those levels, and then there's also liability concerns.  You know, if you blow into your breathalyzer or the car doesn't detect any alcohol, it lets you drive. And then you get pulled over, or you get in an accident, and they do find that you've been drinking, you know, you can sue the interlock company. So there's going to have to be a cushion there. And by the time you factor in any - and then you're going to have activist group pressure to put - to have these things set much, much lower, because they obviously don't believe that you should be able to have one drink prior to driving.  And that - those confluence of events is going to end up with these things set prohibitively low. I mean, that's how you get the de facto prohibition. And what we're trying to do, I mean, you talked about looking into the future, is yeah, we're trying to warn the public that this is where we're headed. Because if people don't realize that there are these groups that want to go in this direction, I mean, I've heard Chuck personally say that he wants to see interlocks in all cars, and that the way to get there. . . PESCA: Well, he personally - he personally told me that he doesn't think that interlocks. . . Ms. LONGWELL: OK. PESCA: Would be the technology, that it would be other technology. Ms. LONGWELL: Well, that's - well, what he's talking about, though, is he's talking about what I was just talking about, the new technology, the steering-wheel sensors, the retinal scans, and maybe those aren't called interlocks. I don't know. But it's - he's talking about unobtrusive technology. And so, again, I think it's a parsing of words. . . PESCA: So you don't believe any government official who says that we're going to have interlocks at . 08. You just think that as soon as they say . 08, they really mean one drink. There's - it's got to be a slippery slope no matter what. Ms. LONGWELL: No, I - I know that it can't be set at . 08. I know that there's 24 states where, right now, you could be convicted at . 04, so - or . 05. So, I know that in those states they can't set them at . 08, and I know for liability concerns they're not going to be set - not going to set them at . 08. I mean, we - yes, we can know those things now. PESCA: Well, I - does your group think . 08 is too low? As. . . Ms. LONGWELL: Ah, we did. I mean, the fact is, you are more dangerous talking on a hands-free cell phone than you are driving at . 08. And we definitely fought, when they were trying to lower the legal limit from . 10 to . 08, we definitely fought that, because the problem is that there's a misunderstanding about where drunk-driving deaths occur.  I mean, the average blood-alcohol-content level of somebody in an alcohol-related fatality is . 19. These deaths - I mean, that's more than twice the legal limit. The - these dangerous people are driving to extremely high BAC levels, and those are the people that do damage out on the highway. And everybody wants them off the road. But if you get down to . 08, you know, . 10, these are not where fatalities are occurring. PESCA: But has it - do statistics show that . 08 has lowered fatalities? I have a ream of statistics which. . . Ms. LONGWELL: No! No, absolutely not! In fact, that's one of the most interesting things is that. . . PESCA: Well, here's some of the things that. . . Ms. LONGWELL: Mothers Against Drunk Driving said that it was going to save thousands and thousands of lives, and it hasn't been borne out at all. PESCA: Well, in - here's - Illinois enacted a . 08 law in 1997, 13. 7 decline in the number of drunk-driving fatal crashes. California experienced a 12-percent reduction in alcohol fatalities after they went to . 08. National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration found in 16 states lowering the limit to . 08 resulted in eight-percent decrease in alcohol - fatal, alcohol-related crashes. Perhaps not a huge increase, but those are all lives saved. Ms. LONGWELL: Right. Well, obviously, I don't know the statistics you're looking at. I don't have those in front of me. But I know that the national statistics, over the last about eight years, have pretty much flatlined in terms of whether or not we're saving more lives. And you know, you're looking - they're obviously cherry-picking data there from different states, so I. . . PESCA: No, that was just National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but are you saying they've flatlined since. . . Ms. LONGWELL: But they were saying they looked at 16 states. PESCA: Are you saying they've flatlined since it went to . 08? Ms. LONGWELL: Yes. PESCA: So it hasn't gotten better since it went to . 08, but it did get better from . 10, no? Ms. LONGWELL: No, no, no, no, no. I mean, I'm talking about - I mean, I guess it's been the last, like, seven or eight years, where there's really been no change. In fact, there's been - they were doing a congressional review recently, over the course of the last few years, to actually determine why drunk-driving deaths weren't going down anymore.  And the reason is, is that we've completely taken our eye off the ball. We're not actually going after drunk drivers anymore. If you concentrate your efforts on moderate and responsible social drinkers who are drinking below . 08, then of course you're not going to save lives, because those aren't the places where lives are being lost.  You need to concentrate on the high-BAC, repeat-offender types who are really causing fatalities on the highway. Those people need treatment. They need to be off the roads. I mean, put the technology in their car. We are all for it. Nobody wants drunk drivers on the road. I mean, you know, we all have families. We all drive on the roads. There's nobody in the universe who is going to say they want drunk drivers on the road. PESCA: When you talk about wanting these interlock technology in repeat offenders, but not necessarily first offenders, because it's the point you were - made, the punishments should be different. Ms. LONGWELL: Right. PESCA: First offenders, well, you tell me if you have different statistics on this. But the best statistics I've seen is that first offenders - in other words, people who are caught - are not first-time drunk drivers. They're repeat drunk drivers, even if they're first offenders. Ms. LONGWELL: I know that MADD cites that a lot. I'm not sure - I've never seen the study where that comes from, the - that people drive sort of - I mean, because I - if they're getting that number, it's because they're asking drunk drivers, how many times do you drive drunk? Is that - I mean, that must be where they're getting it. I've never believed that study - that number. I hear it thrown around a lot.  PESCA: It doesn't - I mean, does it make sense? You think the people who are caught the first time, that's the first time they've driven drunk? Ms. LONGWELL: I mean, maybe for some of them, but I. . . PESCA: Yeah. Ms. LONGWELL: I've never seen some kind of, like - I've never seen an academic study that says, you know, we've really looked at this and we've found that - we've determined that, you know, first-time offenders truly drink - I mean, they say something like 80 times. I've just never seen any proof of it. PESCA: All right. Well, Sarah Longwell, who is the spokesperson for the American Beverage Institute, it was a good discussion, and by the way, congratulations, because this ad got picked up everywhere. So your point is out there. Ms. LONGWELL: It did. Thanks a lot. PESCA: All right. Thanks, Sarah. (Soundbite of music) RACHEL MARTIN, host: That does it for this hour of the BPP. We don't go away online, though. Join us at npr. org/bryantpark. I'm Rachel Martin. PESCA: And I am Mike Pesca, and this is the Bryant Park Project from NPR News.  MIKE PESCA, host:  The other day the New York Post ran a picture of Lindsay Lohan looking a little worse for wear after a drunk-driving arrest, not unusual. Lindsay Lohan's mug shot is a tabloid mainstay, but this one was part of an ad. Ignition interlocks are a good idea for Lindsay, the ad said, but a bad idea for us. They defined \"us\" with pictures of a bride and groom toasting and a few guys in button-down shirts raising beer glasses.   Basically, the ad says ignition interlocks, or in-car breathalyzers, are a great tool for getting hardcore drunks off our roads. However, the ad asserts, activists now want to put one in every car in America. That means the end of moderate and responsible drinking prior to driving. The ad directs the reader to interlockfacts. com, a website with a slew of anti-mandatory interlock statistics.   So, who's behind the ad? The American Beverage Institute, supported by the restaurant industry. The main activists said to want mandatory interlocks on all cars is Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Chuck Hurley, the CEO of MADD, objects to the ads. He says his group doesn't want in-car breathalyzers everywhere. It isn't against legalizing moderate drinking and driving, and it doesn't favor lowering the definition of legally drunk.  Mr. CHARLES A. HURLEY (Chief Executive Officer, Mothers Against Drunk Driving): We do support, in fact, are very interested in the exploration of advanced technologies that could be in all vehicles on a voluntary basis that would not allow them to be driven above the legal limit of . 08. The ads by the chain restaurants intensely distorted our position on that.   PESCA: Sarah Longwell is a spokesperson for the American Beverage Institute. She joins us from our studio in Washington, D. C. Hi, Sarah.  Ms. SARAH LONGWELL (Spokesperson, American Beverage Institute): Hi. Thanks for having me.  PESCA: Sure. What is - who is the American Beverage Institute?  Ms. LONGWELL: Ah, well, we're a restaurant trade association, and we promote moderate and responsible consumption, and simply protect people's right to drink moderately and responsibly prior to driving.  PESCA: Any restaurants we know behind it?  Ms. LONGWELL: Ah, yes, I mean. . .  PESCA: Any sort of big names?  Ms. LONGWELL: It's sort of generally, you know, America's favorite family chain restaurants, so you know, probably some that you were talking about just before in your segment on the review.  PESCA: Right. So summarize the major point of this ad campaign, which, I should say, was not only in the New York Post, but USA Today, and I don't know if it was anywhere else.  Ms. LONGWELL: Yeah, and we're going to continue the campaign, because, you know, we're trying to educate the public about the fact that there are these groups out there who want to put this technology in all cars. They want it to come as standard equipment. And the fact is, Chuck's really parsing his words carefully, you know, in what he was saying before.   The fact is, MADD has gone on the record repeatedly advocating for mandatory ignition interlocks in all cars, and it's not just them. You know, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is, you know, the traffic-safety branch of the federal government, has just committed ten million dollars to developing the technology to the point where it can be in all cars and can be, sort of, unobtrusive.   I mean, they've got technology now that's going to read BAC levels through the moisture in your hands, that has, you know, retinal scans, or little sniffers that sniff out alcohol, and you know, they're doing this because they want it to be able to be like airbags, where it's there in the car but you don't notice it unless, you know, you need it, or it's triggered.  PESCA: Couple questions. If it stops drunk driving, why is that a bad thing?  Ms. LONGWELL: Well, you know, that's the point of the ad, though. I mean, we're advocating for the technology to stop drunk driving. What we don't want is for it to be applied to people who are not drunk. And the fact is, you know, Chuck doesn't believe - because we debate them all the time. We deal with them all the time. Mothers Against Drunk Driving, a lot of times, has said - has gone on the record saying this, they don't think it's OK to have one drink prior to driving.   And once this technology is in all cars, it is not going to be set at . 08. You know, I've heard Chuck say it before, that they would advocate that it be set at . 08, but the fact is, Mothers Against Drunk Driving talks about - constantly about, you cannot drink and drive, and the fact is, it is legal in all 50 states to drink moderately and responsibly prior to driving. . .  PESCA: Well, that's a - that point is something that Chuck Hurley, when I talked to him earlier, made exactly. Let me just play a little of that.  Ms. LONGWELL: Sure.  Mr. HURLEY: In fact, it is legal to drink and drive in all 50 states. We don't recommend it. We do believe best policy is not drink and drive, but it shouldn't be criminalized until . 08.  PESCA: So there he says, and he expanded with me, that he doesn't believe there should be any technology that bars someone who's not already an offender from getting into their car after having a drink or two drinks, as long as they're under the legal limit. Do you think he's lying?  Ms. LONGWELL: Well, what I think that Chuck is trying to do is that they know that the public is not on their side on this issue just yet, and they're trying to normalize the equipment in the eyes of the public before the - before they can get it in all cars. And so, what I think he's doing is I think he's choosing his words carefully right now so that they can take incremental steps to get the technology in all cars. I mean, what they're trying to do right now, I mean, where the legislation is, for the most part now is trying to get the technology mandated for low-BAC, first-time offenders. So people can. . .  PESCA: That's blood-alcohol content. . .  Ms. LONGWELL: Right.  PESCA: Get it mandatory for people who've been convicted of drunk driving so that they can't start their cars even - with a beer or two - with even a beer in them.  Ms. LONGWELL: Yes, because they would be set very, very low. . .  PESCA: And what's wrong with that?  Ms. LONGWELL: Well, what - we think that it's fine - I mean, again, the reason that we ran the ad was to go after hardcore repeat offenders, or high-BAC drunk drivers, like Lindsey Lohan. . .  PESCA: Well, what's wrong with going after. . .   Ms. LONGWELL: So we. . .  PESCA: What's wrong with going after just a one-time offender?  Ms. LONGWELL: Well, because then you're talking about somebody who might be one sip over . 08. I mean, a 120-pound woman can drink two six-ounce glasses of wine and be at . 08, and so, do you think that she should be punished the same way as the guy who's had ten beers? I mean, we don't. The fact is, you know, we have graduated penalties in this country, where the punishment fits the crime, and it, you know, you don't punish somebody who's driving 30 miles over the speed limit the same way you'd punish somebody going five miles over the speed limit. . .  PESCA: Well, is the question. . .  Ms. LONGWELL: Those are two different levels of crime. . .  PESCA: It's. . .  Ms. LONGWELL: It's like - sorry. . .  PESCA: Sorry. Is the question one of punishing that person? Or one of protecting everyone else? Lindsey Lohan, you point to, because she's well-known and the ad worked well. It got picked up everywhere. But you say that she is a repeat offender.  Ms. LONGWELL: Right.  PESCA: And what MADD wants to do is put the technology in cars even if someone has been convicted once. Why do you object to it be - being put in cars if someone has a drunk-driving conviction under their belt?  Ms. LONGWELL: Well, again, I mean, what we're talking about is a distinction where the punishment fits the crime. You know, we're - we fully support the technology for high-BAC repeat offenders like Lohan, but think that it's going too far to mandate the technology for somebody who might be one sip over the legal limit. Those people have presented two very different levels of threat to traffic safety, and they should be treated differently.   And so - and the other reason that we object to it is that we know that what's going on here is, for these groups, and it's MADD, et cetera, they're trying to normalize the equipment in the minds of the public by getting it in more cars now, by passing more legislation, so that ultimately they can put it in all cars. And I mean, we're essentially trying to draw a line to keep sort of this \"creeping\" mandating of interlocks from going further.  PESCA: Your site says, quote, \"that interlocks create de facto Prohibition,\" and it even forecasts into the future and says that, \"by the year 2019, the legal limit will be . 03. \" How could you know that?  Ms. LONGWELL: Well, I mean, it's just experience. I mean, we deal with this stuff all the time.  PESCA: No, experience is things that happened already. I'm asking you how do you know. . . ?  Ms. LONGWELL: Well, yeah, sure. . .  PESCA: About stuff that happens in the future?  Ms. LONGWELL: Sure, OK, well, let's look at things that have happened already. So we know that Mothers Against Drunk Driving constantly talks about the fact that they don't think it's OK to have one drink prior to driving. And so. . .  PESCA: Well, they - you know, he - but he said to me that whether he thinks it's OK, Mothers Against Drunk Driving does not advocate for a change in the law.  Ms. LONGWELL: Exactly, and as I was saying before, you know, what he's trying to do is, you know, parse his words carefully now, because as soon as this technology is in all cars, they are going to work tirelessly to get the BAC levels set lower. And the fact is, once they're in all cars, there are things called \"presumptive-intoxication laws\" in 24 states. That means that if you are at a . 04 or a . 05 in at least 24 states, you can be presumed to be intoxicated and convicted if you get stopped, you know, at a sobriety checkpoint and they find you to have a BAC of . 04 or . 05. You know, so these - the technology will have to be set at those levels, and then there's also liability concerns.   You know, if you blow into your breathalyzer or the car doesn't detect any alcohol, it lets you drive. And then you get pulled over, or you get in an accident, and they do find that you've been drinking, you know, you can sue the interlock company. So there's going to have to be a cushion there. And by the time you factor in any - and then you're going to have activist group pressure to put - to have these things set much, much lower, because they obviously don't believe that you should be able to have one drink prior to driving.   And that - those confluence of events is going to end up with these things set prohibitively low. I mean, that's how you get the de facto prohibition. And what we're trying to do, I mean, you talked about looking into the future, is yeah, we're trying to warn the public that this is where we're headed. Because if people don't realize that there are these groups that want to go in this direction, I mean, I've heard Chuck personally say that he wants to see interlocks in all cars, and that the way to get there. . .  PESCA: Well, he personally - he personally told me that he doesn't think that interlocks. . .  Ms. LONGWELL: OK.  PESCA: Would be the technology, that it would be other technology.  Ms. LONGWELL: Well, that's - well, what he's talking about, though, is he's talking about what I was just talking about, the new technology, the steering-wheel sensors, the retinal scans, and maybe those aren't called interlocks. I don't know. But it's - he's talking about unobtrusive technology. And so, again, I think it's a parsing of words. . .

So, I know that in those states they can't set them at . 08, and I know for liability concerns they're not going to be set - not going to set them at . 08. I mean, we - yes, we can know those things now.  PESCA: Well, I - does your group think . 08 is too low? As. . .  Ms. LONGWELL: Ah, we did. I mean, the fact is, you are more dangerous talking on a hands-free cell phone than you are driving at . 08. And we definitely fought, when they were trying to lower the legal limit from . 10 to . 08, we definitely fought that, because the problem is that there's a misunderstanding about where drunk-driving deaths occur.   I mean, the average blood-alcohol-content level of somebody in an alcohol-related fatality is . 19. These deaths - I mean, that's more than twice the legal limit. The - these dangerous people are driving to extremely high BAC levels, and those are the people that do damage out on the highway. And everybody wants them off the road. But if you get down to . 08, you know, . 10, these are not where fatalities are occurring.  PESCA: But has it - do statistics show that . 08 has lowered fatalities?

I'm Alex Chadwick. MADELEINE BRAND, host: And I'm Madeleine Brand.  In a few a minutes, we'll hear about a new documentary that explores alternatives to traditional hospital births. CHADWICK:  First though, drug companies are getting criticisms for deceptive TV ads.  Three of the biggest pharmaceutical companies were forced to defend themselves yesterday before House Democrats.   BRAND:  The Democrats want stronger regulation of these ads.  One of them, which is now pulled, sparked the controversy. CHADWICK:  It features the inventor of the artificial heart, Dr. Robert Jarvik, promoting the cholesterol drug Lipitor.  But Dr. Jarvik, it turns out, is not actually a medical doctor, and Pfizer paid him more than one million dollars to be in the ad.  Other prominent doctors and researchers are rethinking their relationship with pharmaceutical companies. BRAND:  Dr. Peter Libby is one of these doctors.  He's head of cardiovascular medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.  Which companies were you accepting money from, and for what? Dr. PETER LIBBY (M. D. Chief, Cardiovascular Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston):  Well, I work in cardiovascular prevention, and I would say that I've worked with virtually every company that has produced, manufactured, sold, or even thought about producing, manufacturing, or selling any product which could be used in cardiovascular prevention. BRAND:  So, you were very happy for a while to take money from these companies?  And what happened?  What changed? Dr. LIBBY:  What's changed really is the climate.  I found that my credibility was really impaired by financial relationships with the industry.  And so, I decided that my platform as a public spokesperson for cardiovascular prevention was more important than the personal remuneration, and so I decided to make a clean break. BRAND:  Was there something specific that prompted you to make that break? Dr. LIBBY:  Well, you know, I worked on a public service documentary series that was aired by PBS.  We aired this television series last October.  And almost immediately, there were comments in the blogosphere that pointed out that certain of us who had been medical advisers had relationships with industry, and the integrity of the process in the program seemed to be impugned.  This was a real wake-up call for me because I realized no matter how much good you think you're doing, and how much time and effort you put into a project which is meant for the public good, that you can be perceived as being biased because of relationships with industry. BRAND:  You talk about being perceived as being biased.  Do you think that you were, in fact, biased by taking money from industry, even if it was just unconsciously? Dr. LIBBY:  No, for a number of reasons.  One is that I consult for so many companies that I'm not biased towards any particular product, because I have been involved with virtually all of the marketed products.  And secondly, I was never susceptible to pressure, because I can walk away, because I have my own research and clinical portfolio, and never had to alter my message for anyone's agenda. BRAND:  You know, a lot of your colleagues do admit that they are unconsciously affected by, maybe not the money per se, but by the close relationship that they have with these companies.  They actually like the people that they work with, and that it's a very tough thing to be able to tease out whether or not they are being influenced, even subtly,unconsciously, by these companies. Dr. LIBBY:  Well, in fact, when we're in consulting groups with the pharmaceutical industry, we're their severest critics.  So in fact, I think that one of the functions of the high-level consultants to industry is to help them with preserving the public good. BRAND:  I guess a lot of this public criticism came about because a number of high-profile drugs have been called into question, precisely because the doctors who worked on these trials were paid for, in part, by big pharma.  Do you think that it has swung too far in the other direction? Dr. LIBBY:  No.  I think that the academic investigators need to be involved with pharma in order to assure the integrity of trials. And I think some of the lessons that we should learn is that there always should be an academic steering committee that is independent, that controls the trial, that owns the data of trials, even if they're fully sponsored by industry.  And where, I think, we've run into rocky roads, is where there have been shortcuts of this fundamental principle of assuring the integrity of trials. BRAND:  Dr. Libby, thank you very much for joining us. Dr. LIBBY:  It's a pleasure to share my thoughts with you. BRAND:  That's Dr. Peter Libby.  He's head of cardiovascular medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. (Soundbite of music)  ALEX CHADWICK, host:  This is Day to Day.  I'm Alex Chadwick.  MADELEINE BRAND, host:  And I'm Madeleine Brand.  In a few a minutes, we'll hear about a new documentary that explores alternatives to traditional hospital births.  CHADWICK:  First though, drug companies are getting criticisms for deceptive TV ads.  Three of the biggest pharmaceutical companies were forced to defend themselves yesterday before House Democrats.    BRAND:  The Democrats want stronger regulation of these ads.  One of them, which is now pulled, sparked the controversy.  CHADWICK:  It features the inventor of the artificial heart, Dr. Robert Jarvik, promoting the cholesterol drug Lipitor.  But Dr. Jarvik, it turns out, is not actually a medical doctor, and Pfizer paid him more than one million dollars to be in the ad.  Other prominent doctors and researchers are rethinking their relationship with pharmaceutical companies.  BRAND:  Dr. Peter Libby is one of these doctors.  He's head of cardiovascular medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.  Which companies were you accepting money from, and for what?  Dr. PETER LIBBY (M. D. Chief, Cardiovascular Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston):  Well, I work in cardiovascular prevention, and I would say that I've worked with virtually every company that has produced, manufactured, sold, or even thought about producing, manufacturing, or selling any product which could be used in cardiovascular prevention.  BRAND:  So, you were very happy for a while to take money from these companies?  And what happened?  What changed?  Dr. LIBBY:  What's changed really is the climate.  I found that my credibility was really impaired by financial relationships with the industry.  And so, I decided that my platform as a public spokesperson for cardiovascular prevention was more important than the personal remuneration, and so I decided to make a clean break.  BRAND:  Was there something specific that prompted you to make that break?  Dr. LIBBY:  Well, you know, I worked on a public service documentary series that was aired by PBS.  We aired this television series last October.  And almost immediately, there were comments in the blogosphere that pointed out that certain of us who had been medical advisers had relationships with industry, and the integrity of the process in the program seemed to be impugned.  This was a real wake-up call for me because I realized no matter how much good you think you're doing, and how much time and effort you put into a project which is meant for the public good, that you can be perceived as being biased because of relationships with industry.  BRAND:  You talk about being perceived as being biased.  Do you think that you were, in fact, biased by taking money from industry, even if it was just unconsciously?  Dr. LIBBY:  No, for a number of reasons.  One is that I consult for so many companies that I'm not biased towards any particular product, because I have been involved with virtually all of the marketed products.  And secondly, I was never susceptible to pressure, because I can walk away, because I have my own research and clinical portfolio, and never had to alter my message for anyone's agenda.  BRAND:  You know, a lot of your colleagues do admit that they are unconsciously affected by, maybe not the money per se, but by the close relationship that they have with these companies.  They actually like the people that they work with, and that it's a very tough thing to be able to tease out whether or not they are being influenced, even subtly,unconsciously, by these companies.  Dr. LIBBY:  Well, in fact, when we're in consulting groups with the pharmaceutical industry, we're their severest critics.  So in fact, I think that one of the functions of the high-level consultants to industry is to help them with preserving the public good.  BRAND:  I guess a lot of this public criticism came about because a number of high-profile drugs have been called into question, precisely because the doctors who worked on these trials were paid for, in part, by big pharma.

Well, they have 'til now had three basic parts, the resistor, capacitor and the inductors, sort of like a coil. And back in the 1970s, a graduate student at UC Berkeley theorized that there was a fourth part to circuits. Something he called the memristor. The memristor, the theory claimed had properties that could not be explained by any of the other three elements in the circuit.  Well, more than 35 years later, scientists at Hewlett Packard have proven that the memristor exists. They found it and its existence helps explain some of the strange results scientists have noticed over the years, particularly when they work with nanoscale circuits. Joining me now to talk more about it is Stan Williams. He is the HP senior fellow and director of Information and Quantum Systems lab at the Hewlett Packard Company. He joins us from Palo Alto. Thank you for talking with us, Dr. Williams. Dr. STAN WILLIAMS (Senior Fellow and Director, Information and Quantum Systems Lab, Hewlett Packard): Thank you very much for having me, Ira. FLATOW: You know, whenever I - I love to talk about this stuff. But whenever I talk about it, people say, I can't explain it. Can you make it so I can understand what a memristor is? Dr. WILLIAMS: Well, a memristor is the contraction for memory resistor. And it has the very interesting and unusual property and that the resistance of the device changes depending upon how much current flowed through the device. And in fact, it depends upon the direction of current flow, if I push current through the device in one direction, the resistance of the device will increase, and if I turn it around and push the current through in the opposite direction, the resistance will decrease. FLATOW: Wow! That is so it works different in two different directions. Dr. WILLIAMS: That's correct. It's a very unusual element. You know, considering the fact that we've known about the capacitor since about 1745 and both the resistor and the inductor were both discovered in the early 1800s, the fact that it took nearly 200 years for Leon Chua to even theorize that a memristor exist is - on the one hand, it's surprising. But when you look at its properties, perhaps it isn't so unusual. I mean, it's a very unusual type of device, and it has properties that as you mentioned really only strongly emerge when we get into the nanoscale size regime. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Yeah, well that's what I was about to ask, why we haven't, you know cared about this fourth piece before? Dr. WILLIAMS: Well, frankly, it hasn't been that important in our traditional circuitry because this is a property that only strongly emerges as devices become very small. We've been able to build our circuits and operate them perfectly fine without actually having to include memristance as a part of our circuit models.  But in fact, for at least 50 years, there have been lots of reports by a scientists who have published papers in the literature who have seen funny things in their circuits. Where they looked at devices and found little loops in their current voltage traces that they see or just a funny stuff where they go in voltage and measure of resistance may come back and it's different.  And that hasn't been understood for the most part or it's been described by some sort of ad hoc model as a perturbation on normal circuit properties. He's especially on capacitors. But in fact, Leon Chua showed that it's a true fundamental property of materials and now that we're really getting into the nanoscale regime, it's becoming a lot more important and really is going to need. . . FLATOW: Right. Dr. WILLIAMS: To be considered explicitly in circuit design. FLATOW: Let me ask you a couple of questions. You know, when I - when I, in the old days, when I used to make electronic circuits as a hobbyist, I could go buy a resistor, a capacitor, you know, a coil, can I go out and buy a memristor? Does it actually exist? Dr. WILLIAMS: Well, I mean if you come to our lab, we could give you one. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. WILLIAMS: And there are actually several other people who have built them without realizing that's what they were building. FLATOW: Is that right? Dr. WILLIAMS: Yes. As I mentioned, people have been observing this stuff for 50 years. So, there's plenty of - there's actually plenty of people who have built them or at least built devices that have a strong memristance character. FLATOW: Now a resistor has a unit called an \"ohm. \" Dr. WILLIAMS: Correct. FLATOW: What does a memristor have? Dr. WILLIAMS: It's a real tongue twister, isn't it? Well, it turns out, interestingly enough that the unit for the memristor is also the ohm. So, it has the same units as resistance but - and as I said, the whole issue is that the resistance changes as the function of current. But it's a very different beast from. . . FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. WILLIAMS: A resistor. FLATOW: Well, so if I put my little meter to measure the resistance on one side of it, and I switched it around to measure the other side, that I reversed the polarity, am I going to get the same reading? Dr. WILLIAMS: It depends on the type of memristor. I mean, what you're describing there is a static measurement on a device. And so, if you did that with a diode, you would get a different reading. So, diodes are devices in which the resistance differs depending upon the polarity of the voltage attached to it. The difference about a memristor is that the resistance will change as the function of the amount of current that goes through it. So, if you put your ohm meter on a memristor and you're flowing current through it, what you'll see is that the resistance will change with time. FLATOW: So, are you building circuits with this device now? Dr. WILLIAMS: Yes, we are. We've been - when we first really kind of understood what we had about a year and a half ago, and you know, before we actually published a paper on this, we knew that this is a very extraordinary claim. And so extraordinary claims require, shall we say, extraordinary verification. So, we don't. . . FLATOW: You need Carl Sagan. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. WILLIAMS: Something like that, yes. And so we have worked very hard both on individual devices. Simple circuits containing several memristors and now, even mixed circuits containing transistors and memristors in the same circuit to look at their properties and understand what they would be good for. FLATOW: Yeah, you're not sure what they would be good for yet, huh? Dr. WILLIAMS: Well, you know my guess is that the real utilization of these things is going to come from some bright young person who is either, you know still in high school or maybe even in college right now. But you know, we've got some ideas of things that we're going to look at and so one of those ideas actually involves a - what we call a non-volatile random access memory. And then another one involves what we call essentially a synaptic circuit. FLATOW: And now, I noticed that part of your title is that you work in the Quantum Systems Lab. Dr. WILLIAMS: That's correct. FLATOW: This is not a quantum device then? I mean, it doesn't behave quantumly, does it? Dr. WILLIAMS: Well, in the Quantum Systems Laboratory which has been around in various guises for nearly 13 years at Hewlett Packard, our primary you know, claim the fame in some senses. We can make very small things. And so, the whole issue is that of course, quantum mechanical properties emerge as you specially get into the nanoscale regime. Well, you know, not only did quantum properties emerge in some systems, but when we're looking at these nanoscale devices, we saw that memristance emerged. So, really the common factor here is working at the nanometer scale. FLATOW: We're today about the memristors on Talk of the Nation Science Friday from NPR News with Stan Williams of Hewlett Packard. So, let's see. There's some - couple of really interesting questions. Let's get to them on the phone now. Amshu (ph) in Elk Grove, California. Hi. AMSHU Caller): Hi there. I just wanted to ask your host - thanks for taking my call. I just wanted to ask your host that, does the Ohms Law's change in quantum circuitry or is there no valid Ohms Law because you got voltage and you got a resistance and the current there are constant parameters and if you will (unintelligible) quite changes, the resistance still remains the same proportionally? So, does that in quantum circuitry or it doesn't exist? FLATOW: Yeah, can you use Ohm's Law in the memrister? Dr. WILLIAMS: All right, Ohms Law, of course, is the direct proportionality of current and voltage as expressed through resistance because memristance changes with amount of charge. It does not obey Ohms law. So, it's a non-linear element, we call it. So, no memristance has its own behavior which you know, it's a little bit hard to explain on the air but for anyone who knows what an (unintelligible) is - I mean, what happens is that a memristor will have a current voltage characteristic that is an (unintelligible) figure. In other words, it's loops. It looks like a bow tie or a figure eight instead of just a straight line. FLATOW: So, it's sort of like when it goes out, it doesn't come back in the same direction. Dr. WILLIAMS: That's exactly correct. It goes out and comes back in a completely different place. FLATOW: And in that difference, there is that where you can store information. Dr. WILLIAMS: That's exactly correct, because you can think of it as - what the memristor does is that somehow integrates over its history and carries with it the information about its history. So, if you run current through it in one direction, you can increase the resistance, and you can call that a zero for the purposes of a computer.  If you run current through it in the opposite direction, you can decrease the resistance, you can call that a one and because you can - the memristor will remember its state, it will remember the resistance even after you turn off the current. You then have what's called a non-volatile element. It will remember its state long after you turn the current off. FLATOW: So, you can keep computer memory theoretically alive so to speak, where you either pick up where you left off before. Dr. WILLIAMS: That's exactly correct. So, one of the ideas that we've been positing is having a computer that never has to be booted up or perhaps only booted up once because with a memristor based memory, when you turn the computer off, you will - all of the information that you had about your operating system in your various applications will just be stored right there, and it'll be immediately available as you as you turn the computer back on. FLATOW: So, it can actually save power. Dr. WILLIAMS: Absolutely right. I mean, that's one of the interesting things that memristors offer is the ability to dramatically actually decrease the amount of power that's required in a variety of integrated circuits, both memory circuits and perhaps even logic circuits. FLATOW: So, you can shrink them down, too, because they don't need much power. Dr. WILLIAMS: Well, that's the other interesting issue is that a memristor is a passive device. It doesn't require power to operate but if you want to mimic the properties of the memristor, it takes a very large number of transistors. FLATOW: Right. Dr. WILLIAMS: When in principle, we should be able to look through our existing transistor circuits and then pull out significant numbers of transistors and replace groups of transistors by a single memristor. FLATOW: And how - I got about 30 seconds. Doctor, how far away are we from doing - actually doing that? Dr. WILLIAMS: Well, you know the standard answer is somewhere on the five year time frame. We've actually turned the corner already from pure research and the development, we're making actual circuits with the transistors and memristors now. Then we'll just see how long it takes for them to appear in something that's useful. FLATOW: Stan, I want to thank you for taking time to be with us. Good luck to you.

Up next, coming, continuing debate about a commonly used weedkiller. While it's banned in much of Europe, atrazine is the second most commonly used weedkiller in the United States. It's sprayed on cornfields in the Midwest, and on lawns in suburbia, and out comes a report in the journal Public Library of Science One that shows that atrazine interacts with genes in fish. Joining me now to talk about it is my guest, Holly Ingraham, is professor of cellular and molecular pharmacology at the University of California. She joins us by phone. And welcome to Science Friday Dr. Ingraham. Dr. HOLLY INGRAHAM (Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, University of California): Well, thanks for your interest on our work at UCSF. FLATOW: What new have you uncovered about atrazine that hasn't been published before? Dr. INGRAHAM: Well, I think what's new is that we've really confirmed and clarified the suspicion that atrazine is an endocrine disruptor, and that's, you know, if you actually go on the manufacturer's website, one of the things that they say is that, it does not disrupt endocrine function, and I think we clearly showed that in zebra fish, and we were able to use zebra fish.  They're a fantastic laboratory organism that really allow you to probe the generic machinery and dig in to the - we were able to dig into the mechanism of atrazine using these virtues of zebra fish, and other people have looked at the effects of atrazine in other wildlife, such as frogs, and alligators, and salmon, but we really don't know nearly as much genetic information as we do for zebra fish. So we think using zebra fish was really a key to our finding and really showed - linked atrazine to a factor that controlled endocrine tissue development in both us and in fish. FLATOW: We're talking about atrazine in this hour in Talk of the Nation Science Friday from NPR News. I'm talking with Holly Ingraham. Did you use it in doses that would be found in nature? Dr. INGRAHAM: Well, actually that was the surprising thing. You know, we're not environmental toxicologists, we're molecular biologists working on very, very basic scientific questions, and when we put on these doses, we really had to, sort of, get with the lingo of the toxicologist, and we were really surprised to find some gene changes that occur at two parts per billion, and I was so surprised about this calculation.  I went in to the laboratory, and actually, I should say that Dr. Suzallo (ph) was the lead off on this study, but we went in to our laboratory, and we made them work through the calculation with us at least 10 times, and discovered that, at doses of two parts per billion, which is actually less than the maximum dose that is allowed in our drinking water, we would see these genetic effects, and so, that really, sort of, blew me away. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: And we got a note from the Syngenta Corporation, which makes atrazine, and they commented into us, saying contrast this with the study you'll be discussing - this achieved, talking about your study, achieved effects only after exposure to atrazine in concentrations greater than 2,000 parts per billion, which do not even approach environmentally relevant levels. Dr. INGRAHAM: Well, you know, I mean, that's not true for the fish studies. We definitely saw effects at 220 and 200 without any problem whatsoever, and then, we were starting to see effects in human cells at 200 parts per billion, and I think, you know, if that gets really to the controversy about, you know, what kind of doses are out there, and what kind of exposures do people that are working with this herbicide get. And again, I'm not an environmental toxicologist, and I don't feel comfortable answering those questions, but we saw genetic effects in human cells that were profound. FLATOW: So, you're not talking about the epidemiology of this, how people get it, or whatever. You're just talking about what you found in your laboratory studies. Dr. INGRAHAM: That's right. That's what. . . FLATOW: And there were profound changes that you did not expect? Dr. INGRAHAM: That's right. So, in terms of the zebra fish, we saw the effects, and then we looked in human endocrine cell types, and we - what was startling is when we looked at atrazine, we found, in the genes that changed the most, about over 30 percent of them were related to some hormone signaling, and how we make our hormones, either how we make our hormones, or affecting the hormones - synthesis of the hormones themselves. FLATOW: All right, let me - I'm going to stop you there, because we have to take a break, and I want to hear the rest of your explanation, so I don't want to have to interrupt you again. Dr. INGRAHAM: OK. FLATOW: So, stay with us. We'll get back, and talk more about atrazine with Holly Ingraham, who is a professor of cellular and molecular pharmacology at the UC San Francisco. We'll be right back after this break. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is Talk of the Nation Science Friday from NPR News. You're listening to Talk of the Nation's Science Friday. I'm Ira Flatow. A brief program note. Wednesday, next Wednesday, Neil Conan broadcasts live from the Newseum again with Talk of the Nation's political junkie, Ken Rudin, and presidential candidate, Ron Paul, for the latest on the 2008 campaign, and as always, our weekly trivia question.  And now, if you're going to be in Washington on Wednesday, and want to join the live audience, send an email to tickets@npr. org to reserve your complimentary tickets. We're talking this hour about atrazine, and its effects on human cells in a laboratory dish with my guest, Holly Ingraham, professor of cellular and molecular pharmacology at the University of California, and when I rudely interrupted Dr. Ingraham, she was about to tell us about that study.  (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. INGRAHAM: Let's see, yes, OK, so I was telling you about the genes that actually changed when you put atrazine onto human placental cells, we used human placental cells for these studies. And as I said, we were, I was actually very startled to see that so many of the genes that actually were unregulated were amplified, so they changed in response to atrazine when you add them to, when you add atrazine onto these cells. The majority of the genes are involved in hormone signaling, either by changing genes that produce our steroids in our body, or by changing other hormone-signaling mechanisms. FLATOW: And so, where do you go from here? What would be your next line of study? Dr. INGRAHAM: Well, so, I think the next thing we're going to do is we want to actually know what atrazine is doing to cells that are in the center of your brain that controls (unintelligible) and metabolism, because the factor that is targeted by atrazine is actually found in that location, so we'd like to know that. And then, I think we'd also like to know why atrazine, why endocrine-type cells, and endocrine-type tissues are so sensitive to atrazine. We still really haven't figured that out. FLATOW: Is it possible that we're filtering out, even though you put the atrazine in there in this Petri dish that we might be filtering it out of our bodies, or out of the cells? Dr. INGRAHAM: Well, I'm sure that's the case. I mean, it's complicated. Again, you know, I'm not a toxicologist, and people have looked at bio-accumulation of atrazine in species, and it's definitely there. It stays around for a long time. It's moderately soluble in water, and what's interesting is that the metabolites of atrazine, so the breakdown of atrazine, some of those metabolites are themselves active.  We haven't looked at that, but other people have. And a recent study last year actually shows that if they look in urine of humans, for the most part, they've only been measuring one metabolite, and they're thinking that to really get an accurate picture, they need to measure more, so I, you know, I think there's a lot more that needs to be done at that level, and then there's really a lot more that needs to be done at a basic science level. FLATOW: Just collecting the data, figuring out how it's working. Dr. INGRAHAM: Right, right, absolutely. FLATOW: All right, Dr. Ingraham, I want to thank you for taking time to be with us. Dr. INGRAHAM: OK, great. FLATOW: Holly Ingraham is professor of cellular and molecular pharmacology, University of California-San Francisco, and she joined us by phone.  IRA FLATOW, host:  We'll take a very short break. Up next, coming, continuing debate about a commonly used weedkiller. While it's banned in much of Europe, atrazine is the second most commonly used weedkiller in the United States. It's sprayed on cornfields in the Midwest, and on lawns in suburbia, and out comes a report in the journal Public Library of Science One that shows that atrazine interacts with genes in fish. Joining me now to talk about it is my guest, Holly Ingraham, is professor of cellular and molecular pharmacology at the University of California. She joins us by phone. And welcome to Science Friday Dr. Ingraham.  Dr. HOLLY INGRAHAM (Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, University of California): Well, thanks for your interest on our work at UCSF.

Dr. CLAUDE DE VILLE DE GOYET (United Nations Consultant, Disaster Relief Aid): Dead bodies of healthy people do not spread disease.  In fact in the infectious person, it's much more a risk when it is alive than when it is dead.  You deal with bodies which are already decomposing and so the traditional human-to-human germ cell, microbes, are not anymore present because they cannot survive in the condition of the bodies.

SEABROOK: Where does this idea, then, come from that dead bodies, a large amount of dead bodies in a disaster like this, spread disease? Dr. DE VILLE DE GOYET: It's very difficult to know because it seems to be really going back very much.  I believe it's maybe from the European fear of the great plague, where really dead bodies were a source of flea contaminations and a source of plague.

It's not the public health problem, it's the logistical problems.  So you have to have a burial, but you have to do it showing some type of respect, not dumping dead bodies with carcass of animals, but showing some respect, because people need a grievance process.  People need to feel respected and this is shown by the way you treat dead bodies.  In all cultures, some ritual, some respect is very much required. That's what makes a difference between human and animals. SEABROOK: Dr. De Ville de Goyet says more developed nations can afford to take greater care with corpses than less developed countries. In Thailand after the tsunami four years ago, for instance, officials were able to fingerprint bodies and keep them refrigerated.

His defense? He didn't mean to touch that girl, he was sleepwalking - or sleep-groping, to be more accurate - and the jury agreed. It's certainly an unusual case, but it's hardly unique, not even this month. Earlier, a man in Singapore was cleared of molestation charges. He, too, was found to be sleep-fondling when it happened.  Incidents of sleep-driving, sleepwalking, sleep-slapping, and sleep-snuggling - or more than snuggling - are becoming frequent, or at least more frequently-reported. To find out about the strange things we do while sleeping, here to talk with us is Dr. Ana Krieger. She's the director of the NYU Sleep Disorders Center. Hello, Dr. Krieger. Dr. ANA C. KRIEGER: (Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, NYU School of Medicine): Hello, good morning.  PESCA: Is that a new thing, the Sleep Disorder Center? It seems like recently we've been more obsessed with sleep than we ever have as a society. Dr. KRIEGER: Well, I would say that that's because most of us lack sleep.  PESCA: Mm hm. RACHEL MARTIN, host:  We know nothing of this.  (Soundbite of laughter) PESCA: So, I know you haven't examined the patient in the Florida case, so you can't offer diagnoses from, you know, a thousand miles away. But does the situation seem plausible to you? Sleepwalking, and while you're sleeping, to unknowingly fondle someone? Dr. KRIEGER: Well, it is well-known that some patients with sleepwalking have very complex behaviors at night, and they have been found to be driving, to be eating, to be preparing meals. So that's a well-known complex. \"Parasomnia,\" we call it.  PESCA: Parasomnia, which means sleeping while doing something. Dr. KRIEGER: Yeah, doing something while you sleep. PESCA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's not an isolated incident, you know, you just listed some examples. More tangibly, recently in Britain a sleeping tourist walked out a window and he died. You know, are people capable of just about any activity that they do while awake while sleeping? Dr. KRIEGER: Very possibly, because I've seen people that say they wrote checks and the checks may not necessarily make sense. PESCA: Right. Dr. KRIEGER: But they did write and they signed.  PESCA: And they sign their check. They sign their name. Dr. KRIEGER: Exactly. PESCA: So anything that you can do by rote, you seem to be able to do while sleeping. Dr. KRIEGER: Right.  PESCA: That's pretty amazing. How much of this activity can be blamed on drugs, like Ambien or other sleep aids? Dr. KRIEGER: Well, some medications are capable of exacerbating it. So usually, if a person has a tendency to develop some type of parasomnia, a medication that induces that particular stage of sleep may exacerbate the underlying disease. PESCA: So, in other words, the medication may make it worse but not cause it? Dr. KRIEGER: Exactly. PESCA: I see. And so, as more and more people are taking the medications, does the rate of sleepwalking rise? Is there even any way to study it? Dr. KRIEGER: Well, there's some studies looking at high doses of some of the medications available, and they have shown that people tend to have more of the parasomnias, more sleepwalking, more sleep-talking, as the dosage goes up. PESCA: Mm hm. Is it usually a habit with one of these parasomniacs? Or do some people just do it once and never do it again? Dr. KRIEGER: Yes. Some people don't even know that they do it because it's just so rare and you don't have a witness, so you may not even know. PESCA: Other than drugs causing this activity, is it more common in exhausted people, like morning radio hosts for instance - than well-rested people, like directors of sleep disorder clinics? (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. KRIEGER: Yes. I would say that any - factors that trigger it are anxiety, sleep deprivation, any other illness. If you have a high fever for - for instance, in kids we can see that. They have higher fevers. That induces a deeper stage of sleep and they manifest some strange behaviors during the sleep.  PESCA: And what can we do to stop it, either as the individual or for a loved one? Dr. KRIEGER: Well, so a very important thing is, I would say, is it's very hard to stop it, even with medication. So you need to look at the aggravating factors.  PESCA: I see. Dr. KRIEGER: Being the sleep deprivation, anxiety, stress. And medications are not a hundred percent effective. So you need to be safe. Safety is the key. MARTIN: Dr. Krieger, I remember - I don't know if this is myth or I saw it on a movie - but somewhere in my subconscious is this edict that you're not supposed to wake someone up if they're sleepwalking. That that is dangerous or something. You should guide them safely back to their bed. What's the base - is that a myth? PESCA: I think I saw that movie, too. You're right. (Soundbite of laughter) PESCA: Once you mentioned it, I said, yeah. . . MARTIN: But why is that so bad? Why can't you just wake them up? Dr. KRIEGER: Well, the major reason is because they're very confused. So if you wake them up, they may even act out aggressively. Because. . . PESCA: Right. Dr. KRIEGER: They don't know what's going on. In their minds, they are asleep. They don't know you're there. They don't where they are. So that's the reason why you should try to safely guide them back to bed and continue their sleep. PESCA: Another effective strategy is convince them to make the check out to you. (Soundbite of laughter) PESCA: So that could work. What's actually going on, as best you can describe it? What's going on inside the brain of a sleepwalker? Are they just dreaming? Dr. KRIEGER: Well, no, it's actually not a dream state. It's a different stage of sleep that some of the processes that are underlying in the brain that are going on during sleep, somehow manifest themselves in actions, in behaviors, and in words. And we don't really know exactly what triggers that, and why some people are more susceptible to having it. We know that it has a genetic trait. Some families tend to have a lot more. If you have a relative that has sleepwalking, you probably have a higher tendency of having it. PESCA: And I have read that - well, you talked about anxiety and I said the example of the British tourist who walked out a window. I know that some hotels are training their staffs how to deal with sleepwalking. They keep towels on hand to cover naked sleepwalkers. Well, let's talk about the link between travel - which could be a source of anxiety - and sleepwalking. It tends to go up when you travel? There's some evidence for that? Dr. KRIEGER: Well, traveling, sometimes, depending if it's for pleasure or business, or jet lag involved. . . PESCA: But even when it's for pleasure, there's often a lot of business, and you've got to stay on your schedule, and there's a lot of stress. Yeah. Dr. KRIEGER: Right, it is a different environment, so the change in environment, per se, is a stressful situation. You sleep in a bed that faces a wall or doesn't face the wall, it has a different position. So you do feel that there's some difference and that it will be triggering some anxiety. MARTIN: Dr. Krieger, we started out talking about all the cases that are linked to sleepwalking. How in the world do you go about proving this? If someone can just claim once, hey, I was sleepwalking, after the fact in a trial setting, there's no way to prove that. Dr. KRIEGER: It's very difficult, because you don't really know what happened in that particular incident. So. . . MARTIN: Are there any tests you can do later?  Dr. KRIEGER: We have. . . MARTIN: If someone is prone to that? Dr. KRIEGER: Yes, we can test. Usually some people may be tested. Even beforehand, they may carry a diagnosis, then something may happen, and then you retest, and you find this out. But on the particular incident, there's no way of knowing, because you were not monitoring the person during that incident.  But one thing that we know is that there is a major change in behavior. This is a person that has this, you know, one steady, normal life, and suddenly there's something completely off. And that really would kind of make sense. PESCA: And so the behaviors that one engages in while sleepwalking, you feel aren't really any reflection on the character of the person? At all? Dr. KRIEGER: No, that has not been found. PESCA: Ah, that's interesting. So does it then trigger - I mean, I don't know if you believe in the Freudian parts of the brain, but are the actions we undertake sleepwalking more related to the id? Or more, you know, more impulse-type actions, as opposed to something methodical? Dr. KRIEGER: Yes. PESCA: Oh. Dr. KRIEGER: Some people, though, can be very methodical, and they can go and prepare a whole meal, prepare a sandwich, while others can go out and eat their plants.  PESCA: Yeah. Dr. KRIEGER: So it's very hard to predict who's going to be. . . MARTIN: What's the most bizarre thing that you've ever heard of someone doing? Dr. KRIEGER: I think it was the eating her plant.  (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. KRIEGER: Like one person, that you know, woke up, and you know, she had this very neat orchid in the house, and she had some greenish stuff in her mouth. And she woke up so disgusted, feeling like, oh, my goodness, I've been eating my plant. PESCA: When people come to the sleep disorder clinic, and they say, my problem is sleepwalking, for you to cure them, you have to - what, cure their overall sleeping picture? You can't just set target the sleepwalking? You just have to make them better sleepers in general? Dr. KRIEGER: Yes, because there are many factors that may be triggering the sleepwalking, and any other strange behaviors at night. And that will be the first thing, to rule out any underlying sleep fragmentation. If you have sleep apnea, for instance, you brain is going to wake up multiple times at night. And if it wakes out of one of those deep stages of sleep, you may manifest that with a strange behavior. PESCA: Are there any statistics on it? Do we know what percentage of people sleepwalk, or par ah, sorry, somna, per, per - what is it? MARTIN: Para. . . Dr. KRIEGER: Parasomnia. PESCA: Parasomnia, yes. It's sleep-anything. Dr. KRIEGER: I would say that sleepwalking is about maybe one to two percent of the population, but is, again, very hard for you to measure because we don't really go out there and measure everybody. PESCA: And do you think that sleepwalking instances have risen? Or is it just media reporting about sleepwalking? Is it just that we're more cognizant of the behavior? Dr. KRIEGER: I think we've become more cognizant. PESCA: So it's always been going on, yeah. Dr. KRIEGER: Absolutely. And I think now that we have medications that may be inducing it a little bit more, then it is becoming a big issue. Because then many people can say, you know, this has never happened at this level, except when I take a medication. PESCA: And what about the rates of sleepwalking in children, has that been going up? Dr. KRIEGER: I don't think so. PESCA: But there are children who sleepwalk? Dr. KRIEGER: Yes, oh, yes. MARTIN: I did when I was young. PESCA: You slept-walked? MARTIN: Yes, I did. I don't know, like ten years old. It's very freaky when you wake up, and you're not where you went to sleep. PESCA: It's scary. MARTIN: It's very scary. PESCA: Dr. Ana Krieger, director of the NYU Sleep Disorder Center, thanks very much for coming in. Dr. KRIEGER: My pleasure. PESCA: I assume you were awake during this interview, but there's no way to know, is there? (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: Never know. . . Dr. KRIEGER: We'll find out. PESCA: We're taking off then.  (Soundbite of music) PESCA: Thank you, Dr. Krieger. Dr. KRIEGER: My pleasure.  $00. 00  MIKE PESCA, host:  A Florida man was just acquitted of lewd-conduct charges. His defense? He didn't mean to touch that girl, he was sleepwalking - or sleep-groping, to be more accurate - and the jury agreed. It's certainly an unusual case, but it's hardly unique, not even this month. Earlier, a man in Singapore was cleared of molestation charges. He, too, was found to be sleep-fondling when it happened.   Incidents of sleep-driving, sleepwalking, sleep-slapping, and sleep-snuggling - or more than snuggling - are becoming frequent, or at least more frequently-reported. To find out about the strange things we do while sleeping, here to talk with us is Dr. Ana Krieger. She's the director of the NYU Sleep Disorders Center. Hello, Dr. Krieger.  Dr. ANA C. KRIEGER: (Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, NYU School of Medicine): Hello, good morning.   PESCA: Is that a new thing, the Sleep Disorder Center? It seems like recently we've been more obsessed with sleep than we ever have as a society.  Dr. KRIEGER: Well, I would say that that's because most of us lack sleep.   PESCA: Mm hm.  RACHEL MARTIN, host:   We know nothing of this.   (Soundbite of laughter)  PESCA: So, I know you haven't examined the patient in the Florida case, so you can't offer diagnoses from, you know, a thousand miles away. But does the situation seem plausible to you? Sleepwalking, and while you're sleeping, to unknowingly fondle someone?  Dr. KRIEGER: Well, it is well-known that some patients with sleepwalking have very complex behaviors at night, and they have been found to be driving, to be eating, to be preparing meals. So that's a well-known complex. \"Parasomnia,\" we call it.   PESCA: Parasomnia, which means sleeping while doing something.  Dr. KRIEGER: Yeah, doing something while you sleep.  PESCA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's not an isolated incident, you know, you just listed some examples. More tangibly, recently in Britain a sleeping tourist walked out a window and he died. You know, are people capable of just about any activity that they do while awake while sleeping?  Dr. KRIEGER: Very possibly, because I've seen people that say they wrote checks and the checks may not necessarily make sense.  PESCA: Right.  Dr. KRIEGER: But they did write and they signed.   PESCA: And they sign their check. They sign their name.  Dr. KRIEGER: Exactly.  PESCA: So anything that you can do by rote, you seem to be able to do while sleeping.  Dr. KRIEGER: Right.   PESCA: That's pretty amazing. How much of this activity can be blamed on drugs, like Ambien or other sleep aids?  Dr. KRIEGER: Well, some medications are capable of exacerbating it. So usually, if a person has a tendency to develop some type of parasomnia, a medication that induces that particular stage of sleep may exacerbate the underlying disease.  PESCA: So, in other words, the medication may make it worse but not cause it?  Dr. KRIEGER: Exactly.  PESCA: I see. And so, as more and more people are taking the medications, does the rate of sleepwalking rise? Is there even any way to study it?  Dr. KRIEGER: Well, there's some studies looking at high doses of some of the medications available, and they have shown that people tend to have more of the parasomnias, more sleepwalking, more sleep-talking, as the dosage goes up.  PESCA: Mm hm. Is it usually a habit with one of these parasomniacs? Or do some people just do it once and never do it again?  Dr. KRIEGER: Yes. Some people don't even know that they do it because it's just so rare and you don't have a witness, so you may not even know.  PESCA: Other than drugs causing this activity, is it more common in exhausted people, like morning radio hosts for instance - than well-rested people, like directors of sleep disorder clinics?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. KRIEGER: Yes. I would say that any - factors that trigger it are anxiety, sleep deprivation, any other illness. If you have a high fever for - for instance, in kids we can see that. They have higher fevers. That induces a deeper stage of sleep and they manifest some strange behaviors during the sleep.   PESCA: And what can we do to stop it, either as the individual or for a loved one?  Dr. KRIEGER: Well, so a very important thing is, I would say, is it's very hard to stop it, even with medication. So you need to look at the aggravating factors.   PESCA: I see.  Dr. KRIEGER: Being the sleep deprivation, anxiety, stress. And medications are not a hundred percent effective. So you need to be safe. Safety is the key.  MARTIN: Dr. Krieger, I remember - I don't know if this is myth or I saw it on a movie - but somewhere in my subconscious is this edict that you're not supposed to wake someone up if they're sleepwalking. That that is dangerous or something. You should guide them safely back to their bed. What's the base - is that a myth?  PESCA: I think I saw that movie, too. You're right.  (Soundbite of laughter)  PESCA: Once you mentioned it, I said, yeah. . .  MARTIN: But why is that so bad? Why can't you just wake them up?  Dr. KRIEGER: Well, the major reason is because they're very confused. So if you wake them up, they may even act out aggressively. Because. . .  PESCA: Right.  Dr. KRIEGER: They don't know what's going on. In their minds, they are asleep. They don't know you're there. They don't where they are. So that's the reason why you should try to safely guide them back to bed and continue their sleep.  PESCA: Another effective strategy is convince them to make the check out to you.  (Soundbite of laughter)  PESCA: So that could work. What's actually going on, as best you can describe it? What's going on inside the brain of a sleepwalker? Are they just dreaming?  Dr. KRIEGER: Well, no, it's actually not a dream state. It's a different stage of sleep that some of the processes that are underlying in the brain that are going on during sleep, somehow manifest themselves in actions, in behaviors, and in words. And we don't really know exactly what triggers that, and why some people are more susceptible to having it. We know that it has a genetic trait. Some families tend to have a lot more. If you have a relative that has sleepwalking, you probably have a higher tendency of having it.  PESCA: And I have read that - well, you talked about anxiety and I said the example of the British tourist who walked out a window. I know that some hotels are training their staffs how to deal with sleepwalking. They keep towels on hand to cover naked sleepwalkers. Well, let's talk about the link between travel - which could be a source of anxiety - and sleepwalking. It tends to go up when you travel? There's some evidence for that?  Dr. KRIEGER: Well, traveling, sometimes, depending if it's for pleasure or business, or jet lag involved. . .  PESCA: But even when it's for pleasure, there's often a lot of business, and you've got to stay on your schedule, and there's a lot of stress. Yeah.  Dr. KRIEGER: Right, it is a different environment, so the change in environment, per se, is a stressful situation. You sleep in a bed that faces a wall or doesn't face the wall, it has a different position. So you do feel that there's some difference and that it will be triggering some anxiety.  MARTIN: Dr. Krieger, we started out talking about all the cases that are linked to sleepwalking. How in the world do you go about proving this? If someone can just claim once, hey, I was sleepwalking, after the fact in a trial setting, there's no way to prove that.  Dr. KRIEGER: It's very difficult, because you don't really know what happened in that particular incident. So. . .  MARTIN: Are there any tests you can do later?   Dr. KRIEGER: We have. . .  MARTIN: If someone is prone to that?  Dr. KRIEGER: Yes, we can test. Usually some people may be tested. Even beforehand, they may carry a diagnosis, then something may happen, and then you retest, and you find this out. But on the particular incident, there's no way of knowing, because you were not monitoring the person during that incident.   But one thing that we know is that there is a major change in behavior. This is a person that has this, you know, one steady, normal life, and suddenly there's something completely off. And that really would kind of make sense.  PESCA: And so the behaviors that one engages in while sleepwalking, you feel aren't really any reflection on the character of the person? At all?  Dr. KRIEGER: No, that has not been found.  PESCA: Ah, that's interesting. So does it then trigger - I mean, I don't know if you believe in the Freudian parts of the brain, but are the actions we undertake sleepwalking more related to the id? Or more, you know, more impulse-type actions, as opposed to something methodical?  Dr. KRIEGER: Yes.  PESCA: Oh.  Dr. KRIEGER: Some people, though, can be very methodical, and they can go and prepare a whole meal, prepare a sandwich, while others can go out and eat their plants.   PESCA: Yeah.  Dr. KRIEGER: So it's very hard to predict who's going to be. . .  MARTIN: What's the most bizarre thing that you've ever heard of someone doing?  Dr. KRIEGER: I think it was the eating her plant.   (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. KRIEGER: Like one person, that you know, woke up, and you know, she had this very neat orchid in the house, and she had some greenish stuff in her mouth. And she woke up so disgusted, feeling like, oh, my goodness, I've been eating my plant.  PESCA: When people come to the sleep disorder clinic, and they say, my problem is sleepwalking, for you to cure them, you have to - what, cure their overall sleeping picture? You can't just set target the sleepwalking? You just have to make them better sleepers in general?  Dr. KRIEGER: Yes, because there are many factors that may be triggering the sleepwalking, and any other strange behaviors at night. And that will be the first thing, to rule out any underlying sleep fragmentation. If you have sleep apnea, for instance, you brain is going to wake up multiple times at night. And if it wakes out of one of those deep stages of sleep, you may manifest that with a strange behavior.  PESCA: Are there any statistics on it? Do we know what percentage of people sleepwalk, or par ah, sorry, somna, per, per - what is it?  MARTIN: Para. . .  Dr. KRIEGER: Parasomnia.  PESCA: Parasomnia, yes. It's sleep-anything.

And aid workers in Myanmar think as many as 200,000 may have died as a result of the cyclone that hit that country earlier this month. Many people fear, with all these bodies, that there could be an increase in the spread of disease. Probably not, says Dr. Oliver Morgan, he's a researcher with the U. S. Centers for Disease Control. He studies the risk of infection from dead bodies. He joins us from Geneva, Switzerland. Dr. Morgan, based on your research, what risk do corpses pose for the living? Dr. OLIVER MORGAN (Researcher, U. S. Centers for Disease Control):  Well, we found that the risk to the public is negligible. And the risk to individuals directly recovering and identifying the dead is small, and can really be reduced really simply by using measures such as wearing gloves and washing hands. CHADWICK: Well why is it then, that there are often outbreaks of disease with all these corpses resulting from big natural disasters? Dr. MORGAN: Actually the number of disasters which result in the outbreaks of disease is surprisingly small, and where disease outbreaks do occur, they are almost exclusively due to infections that are passed between the living survivors of the disaster, rather than the dead themselves. It's also worth bearing in mind that really in a short period of time, let's say a day to two days after a person has died, the types of diseases that can live inside us and cause outbreaks tend not to be able to survive in a dead body for very long.  CHADWICK: Hasn't it long been a sort of common wisdom that after a disaster you should deal with the dead as quickly as possible either through cremation or mass burials? People want to get these bodies out of the way, and often the kind of presumption is that you are doing it for health reasons.  Dr. MORGAN: That is actually very common, and it's something that we're working very hard to counter, is this fear that these dead bodies are going to cause an outbreak, and then, which would precipitate in a knee jerk reaction by the authorities to dispose of them rapidly. The main problem with this rapid disposal, as we have often seen on television, of throwing bodies into mass graves is that it really causes risk of psychological damage to the survivors, the relatives and the friends. And that occurs because you are unable to identify the deceased, and that interrupts the natural grieving process that we all go through when a family member dies. And also there's a trauma associated with people seeing mass graves, and treatment of dead bodies in such a crude way.  CHADWICK: Dr. Morgan, could I ask how is it that you came to be interested in this? Why did you start studying this subject? Dr. MORGAN: Well, it is rather an unusual topic to be interested in. But I got interested in it from my firsthand experiences working disasters, and on several occasions was asked by local authorities and other ministries of health, what should be done, and what the risks were. And to my surprise, I found that there was no clear information available to people responding to these big disasters. So it really came out of my firsthand experience that I saw the necessity for this type of information to become available. CHADWICK: Oliver Morgan is an epidemiologist with the U. S.

I'm Alex Chadwick. MADELEINE BRAND, host:  I'm Madeleine Brand. Alex, maybe you've heard of rainbow parties?  CHADWICK: Well, all I can say is this next story has some sensitive material. BRAND: It does. And rainbow parties, maybe they exist, maybe they don't. But they've been bandied about in the media for some time. They're oral sex parties for teens. In the last several years, the media have reported that teens are having a lot of oral sex as a way to maintain their virginity.  Well, a new national study debunks that. Rachel Jones of the Guttmacher Institute is one of the authors of this study, and she's here now. And Rachel, there's a perception out there that teens are having oral sex as a way to avoid intercourse, having intercourse. And that's not what you found. Ms. RACHEL JONES (Researcher, Guttmacher Institute): Right, right. That's not what we found. So contrary to popular perception, our study suggests that large numbers of teens are not substituting oral or anal sex for vaginal intercourse.  BRAND: So they are just going ahead and having sex? Ms. JONES: Well, half of teens are having sex. We found in our study, again looking at adolescents between the ages of 15 and 19, half of them had engaged in vaginal intercourse. And a slightly higher proportion, 55 percent, had engaged in oral sex. BRAND: Those are the same ones that were having vaginal sex? Ms. JONES: That includes all adolescents, whether they've had vaginal sex or not. If you separate it out, among teens who have had vaginal sex, the overwhelming majority, 87 percent, have had oral sex. If you look at teens who haven't had vaginal sex, 23 percent have had oral sex. BRAND: So a quarter of teens have had. Ms. JONES: A quarter of virgins, a quarter of teens who have not had vaginal sex, have had oral sex. BRAND: I see. Ms. JONES: And it does, another thing that came out of our study is that the overwhelming majority of teens who have had vaginal sex, within six months of having their first experience of vaginal sex, have had oral sex. BRAND: So, I don't know. Are parents listening to this? Should they take comfort in this or not? Ms. JONES: Well, I mean, I guess that depends on the parent. Because it seems like the main message that comes out of this, is that we need to give teens a whole range of information about sex and sexual activity and ways to protect themselves from not just pregnancy but from STIs. Again, because oral sex does pose some risk of STIs, as does vaginal intercourse.  And then, of course, another finding from our study is that one in 10 adolescents is engaging in anal sex. And when you focus on teens who have had vaginal sex, we found that 20 percent, or one in five teens, have engaged in anal intercourse. And so again, we need to make sure that teens are getting information so that they can protect themselves from STIs, and from HIV in particular. BRAND: STIs being sexually transmitted infections. Ms. JONES: Right. BRAND: The National Abstinence Education Association has greeted your study by saying, well what this means is that we need to encourage teens to delay all forms of sexual activity. What do you think needs to be done in terms of sex ed? Ms. JONES: Well, again, the main message, for us, that seems to come out of the study is that we need to talk to teens about all different types, the whole range of sexual activities that they may be engaging in, and how to protect themselves, again, from sexually transmitted infections and from pregnancy. BRAND: But what about abstinence? Ms. JONES: Well, certainly teens need to be told about abstinence, what it is, strategies that they can engage in to delay sexual intercourse until they're ready to have sex. But certainly, we can't support a message that tells teens abstinence is the only strategy that's out there to avoid these types of risks. BRAND: Rachel Jones is with the Guttmacher Institute, and we've been talking about their new study that debunks the idea that teens engage in oral sex as a way to avoid intercourse. Rachel Jones, thank you for joining us. Ms. JONES: Oh, yeah, thank you for the opportunity to speak with you.   ALEX CHADWICK, host:  This is Day to Day. I'm Alex Chadwick.

Ms. JONES: Well, half of teens are having sex. We found in our study, again looking at adolescents between the ages of 15 and 19, half of them had engaged in vaginal intercourse. And a slightly higher proportion, 55 percent, had engaged in oral sex.  BRAND: Those are the same ones that were having vaginal sex?  Ms. JONES: That includes all adolescents, whether they've had vaginal sex or not. If you separate it out, among teens who have had vaginal sex, the overwhelming majority, 87 percent, have had oral sex. If you look at teens who haven't had vaginal sex, 23 percent have had oral sex.  BRAND: So a quarter of teens have had.  Ms. JONES: A quarter of virgins, a quarter of teens who have not had vaginal sex, have had oral sex.  BRAND: I see.  Ms. JONES: And it does, another thing that came out of our study is that the overwhelming majority of teens who have had vaginal sex, within six months of having their first experience of vaginal sex, have had oral sex.  BRAND: So, I don't know. Are parents listening to this? Should they take comfort in this or not?  Ms. JONES: Well, I mean, I guess that depends on the parent. Because it seems like the main message that comes out of this, is that we need to give teens a whole range of information about sex and sexual activity and ways to protect themselves from not just pregnancy but from STIs. Again, because oral sex does pose some risk of STIs, as does vaginal intercourse.   And then, of course, another finding from our study is that one in 10 adolescents is engaging in anal sex. And when you focus on teens who have had vaginal sex, we found that 20 percent, or one in five teens, have engaged in anal intercourse. And so again, we need to make sure that teens are getting information so that they can protect themselves from STIs, and from HIV in particular.  BRAND: STIs being sexually transmitted infections.  Ms. JONES: Right.  BRAND: The National Abstinence Education Association has greeted your study by saying, well what this means is that we need to encourage teens to delay all forms of sexual activity. What do you think needs to be done in terms of sex ed?  Ms. JONES: Well, again, the main message, for us, that seems to come out of the study is that we need to talk to teens about all different types, the whole range of sexual activities that they may be engaging in, and how to protect themselves, again, from sexually transmitted infections and from pregnancy.  BRAND: But what about abstinence?  Ms. JONES: Well, certainly teens need to be told about abstinence, what it is, strategies that they can engage in to delay sexual intercourse until they're ready to have sex. But certainly, we can't support a message that tells teens abstinence is the only strategy that's out there to avoid these types of risks.  BRAND: Rachel Jones is with the Guttmacher Institute, and we've been talking about their new study that debunks the idea that teens engage in oral sex as a way to avoid intercourse. Rachel Jones, thank you for joining us.  Ms. JONES: Oh, yeah, thank you for the opportunity to speak with you.  ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.

It's currently being tested by the Department of Defense. We read about it in Sue Halpern's column in the last New Yorker, and we're joined now by the man who's the driving force behind the program, Albert \"Skip\" Rizzo, who's a clinical psychologist at the University of Southern California. Thanks for coming in. Dr. ALBERT \"SKIP\" RIZZO (Clinical Psychologist, University of Southern California): Thanks for having me. PESCA: Where did the idea behind Virtual Iraq come from? What was lacking in the regular ways you were trying to treat veterans who were still going through trauma from their experiences? Dr. RIZZO: Well, until virtual reality came on the scene, exposure therapy was typically done by having a therapist guide the patient in imagination and to narrate their story verbally. The problem with PTSD is that one of the cardinal symptoms of the disorder is avoidance of cues and reminders.  So, you know, it's a pretty tall order to ask somebody, in imagination, to revisit some of these painful memories of things that they've gone through, some of their experiences and so forth. And you never know what's going on in the hidden world of imagination. So, what VR does is put a person back into the sights, smells, sounds, feelings of the scene, and it serves a very useful tool, where you know what the patient is seeing and you can help prompt them to go through the experience in a very safe and supportive fashion. PESCA: How do you make the virtual reality experience specific to each individual soldier or Marine or service member? Dr. RIZZO: We've built into the software the capacity for the clinician to have complete flexible control of the environment. So, we can put a patient in a desert road, in a Humvee, as a passenger in a Humvee, as a driver, up in the turret. We can put them in a foot patrol, walking through a Fallujah-like city in 18 blocks where we can adjust the time of day, the weather conditions, the ambient sounds.  You know, a patient may come in, and their trauma was a vehicle blowing up in front of them on a desert road. So, they may sit in the Humvee, in the driver's position, without any sound, maybe the sound of wind, for the first session and begin to talk about what they experienced. And you know, part of that, their story may have been I was driving a Humvee, and the vehicle in front of me blew up, and somebody died.  Whereas as you go through the therapy then the patient may be invited to turn on the motor and we have a vibrating platform so you feel the motor. We may have the smell of body odor that gets pumped into the space because the vehicle is filled with soldiers that might not have bathed in a few days or whatever.  And then they are invited to drive out on the road and as they start driving out on the road and they start telling their story, different things, sounds, helicopters, jets flying over, insurgents coming out of palm groves, vehicles blowing up, IEDs, so forth can be delivered into the environment as the patient is ready to handle those things and begin to tell their story.  And eventually, as they tell their story you find out that, you know, it wasn't just a vehicle in front, it was a vehicle with five of their friends that they'd been in theatre with for, you know, nine months, and the guy that died was, you know, just going to be, you know, discharged in two months and he was looking forward to his family - seeing his family and so forth. So, you know, you start to see a rich depth of emotion emerge as you gradually progress the patient through the various scenarios that the clinician is in full control of. PESCA: And the process of populating the scene, is it like when you go to the eye doctor and the patient might say, there was a helicopter, and then the person programming the virtual reality says, well, was it an Osprey or a Black Hawk? Was it here or here? Is it like that? You go through different cycles and they say, does this look right? Does that look right? Dr. RIZZO: Yes. You know, what we do find is that it doesn't have to be an exact replica in order for it to have this prompting affect or this evoking process with the patient. You know, a helicopter is a helicopter. The sound of the helicopter is really the emotional driver, so we don't have to have an Osprey versus an Apache, although we do have many of those features to try to make it more real and more relevant to the specific patient. And they do notice things that are not right. So, sometimes you want to err on the side of being vague in the application. Let the patient take it away as opposed to adding things. PESCA: So, they can fill it in themselves, right? Rather than getting something wrong. Dr. RIZZO: Right. Sometimes you add too many things in there and one thing - we took a photograph of the inside of a Humvee that we modeled the interior with, and the photograph was taken when the Humvee was parked and not on and when we modeled it, the switch to turn the vehicle on was in the off position. And believe it or not, our first person to go through it said hey, I can't be driving this Humvee. The switch is turned in the wrong direction. So, we had to go back and remodel that little section. So, a lot of times you get yourself into trouble by trying to be overly detailed and not getting it right. PESCA: So, you talked about things like body odor, and you could rumble their seat with a big base speaker. The non-visual elements, all the other senses, what role does that play in evoking the memories and, you know, dealing with the trauma? Dr. RIZZO: I think that the visuals sort of put the person in a place, but the sound and the smell and the vibration really drive the emotion. Somebody may be driving in a Humvee through a desert scene and it may look like Arizona at first, but then you start adding in elements that are more Iraq-like.  And that gets them back to the - that space, but then, all of a sudden, the sound of an AK-47 belting out some rounds, all of a sudden you see a big spike in the physiology, the heart rate, the skin conductance. In the city scenario we've gotten a lot of comments from the ambient soundtrack of a baby crying. So, we have an ambient city soundscape, so to speak, and one element is a baby crying, and people react to that. PESCA: As they experience this by looking through the virtual reality goggles, what are they using to move throughout the virtual reality environment? Dr. RIZZO: For the navigation interface we use a game controller. And that works quite well for driving in the Humvee. That's not a problem for that. But soldiers giving us feedback, they've said, look, this game controller just doesn't cut it. This is not something I would have in my hand as I'm walking on foot patrol through a city. I'd have my weapon in my hand.  So, what we did was we found these molded-resin training replica weapons, M-4 replicas that are fully weighted so that they had the feel of a weapon, and we mounted a very low-cost thumb mouse on the top of the barrel so that this person can actually hold the weapon in their hand and use the thumb mouse and their body movement to navigate through the virtual environment.  Now another important point here is that the gun doesn't fire, and that's a key element in all of our work here is that we don't have the functionality, we have not put the functionality on, purposely for people to fire back and start shooting things, because we are not in the business of fostering some sort of revenge fantasy. We think that's at odds with the process of exposure therapy. It's not about trying to kill as many Iraqis and get back at the space. It's about dealing with your own emotional memories and processing it, and hopefully healing in that way. PESCA: All right.

Well, now we're going talk about what's happening underground, about six miles below the surface. We're joined by Walter Mooney. He's a seismologist with U. S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, California. He's also worked with Chinese authorities on earthquake studies for 25 years. Walter Mooney, welcome to the program. Dr. WALTER MOONEY (Seismologist, U. S. Geological Survey): Thank you very much. Nice to be here. BLOCK: We've been reporting for a couple of days now on a pretty widespread panic here, because there have been predictions made and broadcasts on local TV radio that a big aftershock is about to hit. Can scientists predict aftershocks with any accuracy at all? Dr. MOONEY: Well, fortunately, we can say quite a bit about the nature of aftershocks. And the maximum aftershock that we expect would be about a 6. 5. In this case, the largest aftershock so far has been about a 6. 1. So that kind of prediction has held. BLOCK: What would the warning signs be that something might be about to happen? What would you be looking for? Dr. MOONEY: I think that we would be perhaps alarmed if there was a sudden burst of activity, in that there were a rapid increase in the numbers and magnitudes of the aftershocks. So given that we can't predict earthquakes, we can only look at patterns which are unusual. And in this case, I'm glad to say that we haven't seen any unusual pattern in the aftershocks. BLOCK: I saw a quote from one of your USGS colleagues, Tom Parsons, who was quoted as saying there's a high risk of new aftershocks much bigger than those so far, especially in the area around Dujiangyan. That all sounds very specific. Dr. MOONEY: Well, fortunately, we are able to see the kind of changes in the earth's crust that are accompanied by a large earthquake. You might imagine if you slip a rug, on one half of the rug, that the second half is kind of loaded and prepared to move. It's just the loading of adjacent faults by the main shock. As Tom Parsons has seen, this earthquake ruptured and moved in a northerly direction, actually northeasterly direction, and as a consequence the faults that are located in that area now have to carry an additional load from the Earth's crust. So that's the area that we expect there to be greater numbers of earthquakes, and at some future time, a larger earthquake. BLOCK: Larger than what we saw last week? Mr. MOONEY: We wouldn't expect it to be larger than what we saw last week, but it would be larger than the average aftershock that's been accompanying this earthquake. BLOCK: And when you say, at some future time, what sort of a time frame are we talking about? Mr. MOONEY: The delay time between the main shock and the larger event that follows, can easily be as much as three months. And in other cases it can be twice that or longer. Unfortunately, we really can't say when the crust will unzip and the larger event will occur. BLOCK: What are you hearing from your Chinese counterparts here, about what they've learned since the earthquake and what they still hope to learn? Mr. MOONEY: The primary reaction that the - my Chinese colleagues have had - is one of disappointment and shock at the amount of destruction. They have tried for two decades to find a reliable technique that can give a warning that they can predict in the short term, the impending event of an earthquake of this magnitude. And unfortunately the Earth is very complicated, and that process of predicting earthquakes is simply not possible. Now the challenge that's before them, is to think about their building codes, and the land use policy in China. You know, despite the growing population, not every area is suitable for the construction of habitations and schools and hospitals, and people have to be relocated to more stable regions. BLOCK: Would you say, knowing what you know what happened here and what might happen in the future, would you say that these communities that were the worst hit should not be rebuilt where they were, they should be relocated. Mr. MOONEY: Many of the communities are located far too close to steep mountain sides, and you know, you can build a very strong building with modern engineering techniques and you can you have the best possible warning procedures for people to move quickly, as quickly as possible out of their residences once an earthquake occurs, but with a rapid moving landslide, you really don't have much of a change. So, in many cases, the communities simply cannot be rebuilt on the slopes of the very steep ravines and towering mountains, because the landslides are just inevitable.

He's talking about a tiny, shiny, metallic green insect called the Emerald Ash Borer. It's an interloper from Asia that was found near Detroit in 2002. It's killed more than 30 million ash trees in Michigan alone, with tens of millions more lost in Ohio and Indiana.  Prof. HERMS: As is spreads and kills these trees it'll have devastating, staggering economic impacts.  HEDLEY: Here's what happens. The Emerald Ash Borer lays its eggs inside the trees. The larvae feed voraciously on the inner bark. That's where all the nutrients are that the tree needs to survive. Get enough hungry larvae inside a tree and the tree dies. Mr. CHRISTOPHER CANNING (Village President, Wilmette, Illinois): You can see the fresh cut there and in the logs down at the end of the block. HEDLEY: Christopher Canning is pointing out stumps on both sides of his street in Wilmette, Illinois.  Mr. CANNING: So this block probably lost, I would estimate, somewhere between eight and ten trees.  HEDLEY: Canning is the president of this little village, and he's in the unfortunate position of having to pull down thousands of ash trees that are infested with EAB.  Mr. CANNING: The entire budget over five years is 2. 5 million dollars, and that includes hiring a forester dedicated just to Emerald Ash Borer efforts. HEDLEY: That forester is Jennifer Staats.  Ms. JENNIFER STAATS (Forester, Wilmette, Illinois): Nobody who works as a municipal arborist wants to knock on someone's door and say we are taking down your tree. HEDLEY: But the village of Wilmette, only five miles wide and one mile long, could lose up to 11,000 trees over the next two years. That's a lot of stumps. And although the city is the city is planting new trees, it'll be years before the streets look the same. Ms. STAATS: A lot of residents laugh, they've been living in the community for about 40 years and they all say, well I won't be here to see this tree when it's done, but I will water it so it looks nice for somebody else. Mr. JOHN FOX (Third Grader, Wilmette, Illinois): I though it wouldn't do that much damage, because it was small, but it turn out it did a lot of damage. HEDLEY: Third grader John Fox plays on a Little League Team in Wilmette. He and his teammates have received a number of wooden bats made from dead ash trees that once towered above the city streets. Tom Royce is the owner of Bats By Buck and he's manufactured dozens of wood bats from the trees of Wilmette. Mr. TOM ROYCE: All over the place. They were burning, cutting these trees down and burning them, because of this beetle. I don't know what that quality was, but in my thought processes it's a shame to destroy products, to destroy a natural, destroy wood. HEDLEY: The kids say they're glad to have the bats, but it bothers them a little that so many trees had to die to provide the wood. Christopher Canning's son, Chris, says his dad even had to cut down the trees near his house.  Mr. CHRIS CANNING, Jr. (Child, Wilmette, Illinois): Actually, some of the trees were in my backyard, but. . HEDLEY: Oh? Mr. CANNING, Jr. : Yeah, it feels kind of weird, cause all the trees came down and we actually had a tire swing.  HEDLEY: Take the North line Train south and you'll see even more stumps, even more gaps in the skyline above Chicago's parkways. Chicago has been infested with the Emerald Ash Borer for about six years. Edith Macra is with the Morton Arboretum, just outside Chicago. Ms. EDITH MACRA (Morton Arboretum, Illinois): So we were the ones that actually did the survey to find out how many ash trees we have in the Chicagoland area. So in terms of communicating why you should care, we found out that one in five ash trees, or one in five trees in the Chicagoland area are ash trees. HEDLEY: I want you to stop what you're doing right now and look out the window if you can. Count the trees you see, and try to imagine the landscape if one out of every five were gone. And then imagine the wildlife that lives in those trees, the shade they provide to homes and businesses in the summer. And remember, it'll take decades for another tree to reach maturity in those newly vacant spots. Getting the picture?  Ms. MACRA: The one scary thing about this particular pest is that it has the ability to effect the entire genus.  HEDLEY: And that's why some biologists are mentioning the word extinction when they talk about EAB. This bug kills every type of ash tree, healthy or weak, young or old. Scientists aren't sure they can find a solution to the problem before these bugs spread across North America. Prof. HERMS: And as the population in Michigan is getting larger, the infestation is spreading faster and faster, and it's spreading now at about a rate of 15 to 20 miles per year. At least in terms of that's how fast the dead trees are spreading.   HEDLEY: Dan Herms says Emerald Ash Borers aren't actually a pest in their native Asia. Prof. HERMS: And that's because it does have natural enemies, and it's also because trees, ash trees in Asia, are naturally resistant. HEDLEY: Woodpeckers eat the bugs, but they can't keep up. So the Department of Agriculture is experimenting with a tiny stingless wasp, common in China, that lays it's eggs inside the larvae of the Ash Borer. Prof. HERMS: And so they feed on the internal organs of the Emerald Ash Borer and then emerge to disperse and reproduce. So you can kind of think of \"Alien,\" if you remember the movie.  HEDLEY: But Edith Macra says bio-controls are notoriously unpredictable.  Ms. MACRA: Most of them have gotten out of control so that hasn't really gone well.  HEDLEY: Who knows if these wasps will thrive and what impact they'll have on other native species. Another idea is to cross-bread American ash trees with Chinese trees that have a natural resistance to the pest, but that will take a minimum of five to ten years. And no one is sure how far the bug will have spread by that time. Warren Gosh, of the Illinois Department of Agriculture says, Americans apparently didn't learn their lesson after Dutch Elm Disease wiped out more than 70 million trees in the 1950s and 60s. We again planted too many of the same kind of tree. Prof. HERMS: That's perhaps one of the saddest tragedies about this whole situation. What did we do especially in our urban areas? We replaced these beautiful tree-lined streets of elm trees with ash. And so now, here we are experiencing the same kind of catastrophe.  HEDLEY: It took 20 years to find and distribute a tree that was resistant to Dutch Elm Disease. Scientists aren't sure they have that long to stop the Emerald Ash Borer before it spreads from coast to coast. From NPR News I'm Celeste Hedley, in Detroit.  ALEX CHADWICK, host:   Back now with Day to Day. What does a guitar have in common with a pool cue, and a baseball bat? They're all commonly made out of ash. And Celeste Hedley reports, millions of ash trees are being killed by a tiny green bug.  CELESTE HEDLEY: We're not talking about the death of a few trees, or even a few thousand trees. This bug is an ecological serial killer of epic proportions.  Prof. DAN HERMS (Professor of Entomology, Ohio State University): Well I think there's a very real possibility of extinction.

I'm Michele Norris. It's nearly hurricane season in the Atlantic and that means it's time for hurricane predictions. Government scientists are forecasting more than the usual number of storms, but they're also doing something different this year. They're downplaying the exact number of hurricanes they expect. NPR's Jon Hamilton reports. JON HAMILTON: The government's cautious approach comes after two consecutive years in which hurricane seasons didn't quite live up to their hype. In 2006, forecasters at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration called for eight to 10 hurricanes. They only got five. Last year's prediction was closer, but still high. So this year scientists at NOAA are hedging their bets. Jerry Bell is in charge of seasonal forecasts. Mr. JERRY BELL (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration): We're indicating a 90% chance of a near normal or above normal season. Looks like an above normal season will be most likely with a 65% chance, but there's still a 25% chance of a near normal season. HAMILTON: The forecast does include some numbers, but with caveats. It's says there is a better than even chance that there will be between six and nine hurricanes. The forecast makes no prediction about whether any of these storms will strike land. If that seems to indicate a fair amount of uncertainty, Bell says it's suppose to. Mr. BELL: One of our goals this year was to really convey that for a given set of climate patterns you can sometimes see a wide range of activity. HAMILTON: And this year's climate patterns contain a decidedly mixed message. On the one hand, the Atlantic has been churning out lots of hurricane since the mid 1990s, and many scientists expect that trend to continue for at least another couple of decades. On the other hand, most big hurricane seasons come during La Nina conditions. That's when waters in certain parts of the Pacific are unusually cold. And Bell says that right now the water appears to be getting warmer. Mr. BELL: La Nina seems to be weakening but it's certainly possible that it's still going to be impacting the atmospheric winds even after it dissipates. And for the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, La Nina favors increased hurricane activity as well. HAMILTON: Hugh Willoughby of Florida International University says years like this one are tough on forecasters. He should know. He used to be responsible for the seasonal forecasts at NOAA. Willoughby says there's a dirty little secret in the forecasting business. Mr. HUGH WILLOUGHBY (Florida International University): We don't really know if there are going to be six or seven or eight or 11 or three or 16 hurricanes. HAMILTON: But he says it's tempting to trot out exact numbers anyway, because they get the public's attention. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: People love numbers, even when they're meaningless. It conveys an idea of precision and accuracy, that you really know what you're talking about. HAMILTON: And then people in vulnerable areas are more likely to actually prepare for hurricane season. But if people start to feel they've been mislead by the numbers, they'll ignore them. Willoughby says all the focus on seasonal forecasts sometimes obscures just how good NOAA is at its primary job of protecting people from devastating storms. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: We've got a really, really good record in terms of loss of life. Your odds of being killed by a hurricane right now or this year are about a hundredth of what they were at the turn of the century. HAMILTON: Willoughby says that's primarily because once a hurricane has formed, forecasters are extremely good at predicting where it will go. Jon Hamilton, NPR News.

I'm Alex Chadwick. MADELEINE BRAND, host: I'm Madeleine Brand. Coming up, thousands of children in tent cities in China's quake zone go back to school with little more than crayons and paper. CHADWICK: First, the earthquake in China, the cyclone in Myanmar, what about here? In Washington today, a congressional subcommittee asks, are we ready for disaster where experts say one is likely coming, right here in Southern California? For that hearing, earthquake scientists from the U. S. Geological Survey and the California Geological Survey today release a study that they call the Big One. Seismologists Lucy Jones headed the study. Lucy Jones, welcome to Day to Day. Describe the imagined scenario for the Big One.  Dr. LUCILE M. JONES (Project Chief, Urban Earth: A Multi-hazards Demonstration Project in Southern California, U. S. Geological Survey): We designed a plausible earthquake on the San Andreas Fault, magnitude 7. 8. To be that long, the fault has to be at least about 200 miles long, just like we've seen in China last week. And then to rupture that long a piece of fault, the earthquake has to last for 100 seconds. The consequences of that mean that we have over 10 million people that will be in the areas of heavy shaking, and therefore, the financial losses become very, very large. The casualties are not nearly as large as we are seeing in China, for instance, because the California building codes have focused for a long time on life safety. CHADWICK: I noticed in the study that a lot of the loss came about because you anticipate a lot of - it's not just the earthquake. It's the fires that break out from the earthquake, and these cause enormous damage, in your predictions.  Dr. JONES: California's already fire territory. Then when we add to this the shaking against our electrical systems, we expect a very large number of ignitions getting started because of problems with electric lines and gas lines, and then we break a water pipe, so we're going to have trouble getting water to fight a lot of the fires. And you put all these things together and we have a very real potential that fires will get out of control and not be able to be stopped. And this was in a picture where we specified there would be no Santa Ana winds for this scenario. Of course, the reality could be different. CHADWICK: You mentioned the China earthquake and the similarity between that one and the one that you project. Indeed, they are almost identical, same magnitude, same size of rupture. Is that coincidence or is this some kind of class of earthquake? Dr. JONES: It's a certain amount coincidence. To have these really great earthquakes, you need these really long faults, and you get the really long faults at major tectonic boundaries. And both the San Andreas Fault and the Longmenshan Fault are well-recognized, major players in global tectonics and expected to have these types of events. CHADWICK: Forty-six-percent chance, this study said last month, in the next 30 years in southern California.  Dr. JONES: That's the chance that there will be a big earthquake on the southern San Andreas Fault, even odds that in the next 30 years something like this will happen. CHADWICK: Lucy Jones, why do you put out this kind of study, other than to scare the bejeezus out of us? (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. JONES: I'm actually very much trying not to scare people. The first reason we did it was because our partners asked it of us. That's what the emergency managers really wanted, to be able to do a better job of getting ready. The second use of this is to prevent it from happening, because once we see where the problems are, we can do a much better job of deciding as a society which ones we're willing to spend the money to stop. Because most of the losses that we're seeing are things that could be changed if we decided it was worth it.  CHADWICK: So when you present these details to political leaders and business leaders, how do they respond? Dr. JONES: They start by being scared, and we usually end up in a really interesting discussion. As you said, the fire losses are the potentially most catastrophic. We've already taken this to the California Seismic Safety Commission, which is, at this point, chaired by a fire chief. We're now turning to the fire professionals to say, what would the solutions be? And they're going to be making recommendations to the state before the end of the year on ways we could reduce the losses. And that's exactly what we want to see happen. And so a lot of this is just attitude and personal responsibility. Many of the things really are things that individuals can do. And I will say that I've changed some of my things. After going through this and really looking at it, I store more water than I used to because it's very clear that the water is going to be a big problem after the event. And I went and bought a new fire extinguisher and made sure my kids knew how to use it, because stopping the fires individually is the best way to avoid that fire storm.

After going through this and really looking at it, I store more water than I used to because it's very clear that the water is going to be a big problem after the event. And I went and bought a new fire extinguisher and made sure my kids knew how to use it, because stopping the fires individually is the best way to avoid that fire storm.   CHADWICK: Seismologist Lucy Jones headed the disaster earthquake study, The Big One, released today. Lucy, thank you.  Dr. JONES: Thank you.

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. This week, many of us learned a new word, glioma. It's a type of malignant brain tumor, and on Tuesday, news broke that Senator Ted Kennedy has one. Since then, we've received a crash course in brain tumors. We've seen cross-sections of what Kennedy's brain might look like, and we've heard about his treatment options. Whether he and his family like it or not, Senator Kennedy's illness is a very public story, which often happens with celebrities. Some do their best to preserve their privacy.  Others choose to embrace the inevitable and use public interest in their illness as an opportunity, as a teachable moment. In just a moment, Elizabeth Edwards joins us. We also want to hear your stories. How have you dealt with the decision to let other people know about your illness? Does it help at all to learn that a famous actor or politician has the same illness that you do? Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr. org. You can also share your story on our blog. That's at npr. org/blogofthenation. Elizabeth Edwards joins us on the line from Chapel Hill in North Carolina, and it's nice to have you back on the program.  Ms. ELIZABETH EDWARDS: It's great to be with you. CONAN: And if you would, take us back to, well, it was a day in 2004, the day that your husband, John Edwards, and Senator John Kerry conceded the presidential race. Ms. EDWARDS: I had suspicions at that time already that a lump that I'd found in my breast during the campaign was going to turn out to be cancer, but we, immediately after Senator Kerry did his concession speech, we went to Mass General Hospital and had a biopsy done and found out that, in fact, it was. We then, of course, had to return to our home in Washington, D. C. , that night and on the way made the decision that we would, in fact, go public with this. I was going to lose my hair. I wasn't much of a public figure, but I was enough of one that my losing my hair was going to mean that it was going to be a harder secret to keep. CONAN: Yeah. Ms. EDWARDS: So I went ahead and said just go ahead and do this. I actually didn't think of my place in a long string of people, known and unknown, who had this disease. I since think of myself very much that way, and that we sort of hold each other's hands in this long chain. And my being public sort of allowed people to reach out to somebody, and I did get those hands reaching out to me, largely people who suffer from cancer. I sort of feel like this is a tribute to the people who came before me, and who reached their hands to me, both by participating in research and being strong themselves. And then I have an obligation now to do that for my brothers and sisters, as well. CONAN: But was there a moment when you said, look, can't I keep this private? Ms. EDWARDS: Honestly, there wasn't. I mean, I guess I grew up in a household that was a very open household, and John and I have always had a very open home, where we have very few secrets from anyone. We always say there's a bunch of 28-year-old boys running around, who've seen me in every nightgown I own. So I wasn't particularly private to begin with, and politics kind of cures you a little bit of that anyway. People want to peer in your closets, and you sort of make a bargain that you're going to let them.  And this - you know, there was in it also the possibility of a teachable moment, and just tell people not to make the mistakes I made, to go ahead and have their mammograms in a timely way and do their monthly self-exams. And in fact, one of the first emails I got was from a woman who had gone and gotten herself checked immediately after hearing of me and found, in fact, that she did have a cancerous tumor, and she was already getting treatment. So whatever else, whatever the bad sides were, I have this woman's life as a reason to have made the public statement.  CONAN: I guess, simple coincidence that it was in Massachusetts General, the same hospital where Senator Kennedy is. Ms. EDWARDS: It is. But I got very good treatment there, and I'm certain that he will get the same. CONAN: I wonder, though, was there - what did you think when you saw those stories on the news last Tuesday, as, well, we're seeing cross-sections of Senator Kennedy's head? Ms. EDWARDS: It broke my heart because he - as it does with anybody, but in particular, when you see somebody who is so vital, who embraces life in the huge way that he does, it just seemed - and in particular all he's been through, this seemed so grossly unfair. On the other hand, this is an equal-opportunity disease. It doesn't really care, you know, how much you have to live for or how much fight you have in you.  It can strike anybody, and this time, it struck somebody who, I would think, in the ten days before that, I testified on the new cancer bill that he is introducing in the Senate with Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican from Texas. So it was almost a cruel irony in addition. It was hard not to look back at that hearing. I spoke; with my panel was Lance Armstrong, who had testicular cancer that spread to his brain, and me, with breast cancer that's spread to my bones, and Steve Case, whose brother died, in fact, of a brain tumor. CONAN: Let's see if we can get some listeners involved in the conversation. Our guest, of course, is Elizabeth Edwards. We're talking about illness, about a public illness, and if you'd like to join us, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr. org, and let's see if we can begin with Kathy, Kathy is with us from Royal Oak in Michigan. KATHY (Caller): Hello. CONAN: Hi. KATHY: Hi. I had diagnosed in April, three years ago, grade-four glioblastoma, was given no time to live. But my work is as a healer, and a whole lot of people knew about it and started praying for me. And I'll tell you, that's so significant. So I'm thinking, the more people that know about it the better. It's over three years. I do have some challenges with my balance and stuff, but I don't have any more glioma. So that people can recover.  That brings up all those things, oh, God, what if I'm wrong, you know? But anybody who has a history of cancer, it makes your stomach go wiggly. But you know, I have a healthy background. I don't know if - well, one of my girls is a colonel in the Army, and she said, well, mom, I guess it wasn't your day to die. So I guess, you know, if it's Ted Kennedy's day to die, it'll be his day to die. But I'm telling you, the more prayers that we can send to people with cancer, it absolutely makes a difference. That's why I'm well, I swear. CONAN: Elizabeth Edwards, that kind of support, I know, has flowed to you as well. Ms. EDWARDS: It has, and I'd like to say I think attitude is everything, as Kathy said. But I actually think that people with great fighting attitudes die of these diseases all the time, and I don't want to say, oh, they died because they didn't have enough fight in them. I think they did. It's just the disease is sometimes stronger than any person could possibly be. I'm glad that was not the case with Kathy. I hope it is not the case with Senator Kennedy. But I did feel that the fight was made easier because I felt I had a huge safety net of people who were ready to catch me in the bad moments. And I think that did allow me an additional level of strength because the treatments for these things are debilitating and difficult.  About the same time I was getting my treatment, Melissa Etheridge was also getting treated for breast cancer, and she stopped her chemotherapy midway because it was so debilitating. So having the strength to continue, even when your body is telling you, we've had enough. I mean, those medicines they put in you, if you were just normally handling them, you would put on gloves they're so toxic. And yet, they put them straight into your veins. So this is a difficult process, and I certainly hope that treatment is available to him, even if it's difficult because all of our thoughts and prayers will get him just so far. And then we have to hope that the medicine is stronger than the disease.  CONAN: Becky's on the line, Becky calling us from York in Pennsylvania.  BECKY (Caller): Hi there. How are you?  CONAN: I'm well, thank you.  BECKY: Good. And it's York, Maine, actually.  CONAN: Oh, I'm sorry.  BECKY: That's OK, no problem. I just quickly wanted to say, Elizabeth, it's an honor to talk to you. When you were re-diagnosed that week, when you came public and said I'm going to stay with my husband's campaign - I apologize in advance, but I was furious. I thought, well, how dare she do that,  how dare she put her husband's job above her health. And I was like, uck, you know? And literally, a week later, I was diagnosed with stage-four cancer that had spread to my liver.  Ms. EDWARDS: Oh, my goodness.  BECKY: And in a lightning bolt, I got it. You know, I totally understood what you were doing. And I just was like, thank God. You're such a role model.  Ms. EDWARDS: That's the thing that - when you're outside the process, outside the disease, it's really hard to put yourself in the position of somebody who does have it. And when we say that we are brothers and sisters of one another, we actually mean it because you understand something. And that's why going public allows you, in a sense gives you this benefit, this enormous family of support because they understand what is just too difficult for other people to understand. And that is how you could, in a moment like that, choose to live.  BECKY: Yeah, and I don't get angry at people who don't understand because I would never wish this on anybody.  Ms. EDWARDS: Absolutely. BECKY: I just want to say, you've just did the light bulb for me and under terrible circumstances, don't get me wrong. You've been a real guiding light to me in the last 14 months.  CONAN: How are you doing, Becky? BECKY: Oh, hanging in there. Actually, speaking of Ted Kennedy real quick, three weeks ago, my insurance company rejected me for special, very special procedure that I had done to my liver - that I wanted to have done to my liver. And my insurance company rejected me, and Ted Kennedy went - or his assistant and aides went to bat for me, and I got approved, and I had the treatment done at Mass General last week.  Ms. EDWARDS: That's great. Actually, one of the parts of his cancer bill is that it would cover the trials and other things that sometimes still you have insurance problems if you're doing anything out of the normal protocol. And you're from Pennsylvania? I think Senator Specter is also not, surprisingly. . . CONAN: I was wrong. She's actually from Maine. But Becky. . . Ms. EDWARDS: From Maine? I missed that.  BECKY: Yeah, that's OK. A note from Senator Collins' office was also incredibly instrumental, just to mention that, too, and they got me through within - I got the denial overturned in less than 24 hours.  Ms. EDWARDS: That's incredible.  CONAN: That's great, Becky.  BECKY: And now, we're hoping for the best. CONAN: Good luck to you.  BECKY: Thank you so much. Thanks for taking my call. Bye-bye.  CONAN: And Elizabeth Edwards, we just have a few seconds left with you. But how are you doing?  Ms. EDWARDS: I'm actually doing quite well. It's one of the things I want to sort of caution people about is they hear - and Kathy was an example of that - you only have a certain amount of time to live. I know people who are paying attention when it was announced that my cancer had spread to my bones. Heard a lot of people saying I only had five years to live because I was in this condition.  Now, it's one year later, slightly more than one year later, and I'm in exactly the same condition. It's not gotten any worse. So if every year, I can say I have five more years, then that'll be great. You know, that medicine is moving very quickly, which is great. And so the statistics that we have from previous years are not really particularly useful. So I'm hopeful that it's also true for Senator Kennedy.  CONAN: Thank you so much for being with us. We appreciate your time.  Ms. EDWARDS: Great to be with you, Neal. CONAN: We're talking about public illness on Talk of the Nation from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music) CONAN: This is Talk of the Nation. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. Dealing with illness is something that many people prefer to keep private, but privacy is often impossible for those in the public eye, like Senator Ted Kennedy, who was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor earlier this week. Have you dealt with a decision to let other people know about your illness? Does it help at all to learn a famous actor or politician has the same illness you do? Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr. org, and you can read what other listeners have to say on our blog at npr. org/blogofthenation.  When celebrities and public figures get sick, sometimes the news takes an unexpected toll, even though we don't know them personally, Dr. Barron Lerner writes this. He's a professor of medicine and public health at Columbia University Medical Center and author of \"When Illness Goes Public: Celebrity Patients, and How We Look at Medicine. \" He joins us now from our bureau in New York, and nice to have you on the program today.  Dr. BARRON LERNER (Medicine and Public Health, Columbia University Medical Center; \"When Illness Goes Public: Celebrity Patients, and How We Look at Medicine\"): Thank you, Neal.  CONAN: And why does something like Senator Kennedy's diagnosis affect us so much? Dr. LERNER: Well, we're a society that's very interested in celebrities and many aspects of celebrities' lives and really revere people in the public eye. And I think when someone of Senator Kennedy's stature gets such a devastating diagnosis, it really hits us, almost as if he's a member of our family or someone we know. And I think that's the main reason why people are talking about this so much.  CONAN: And I guess we're transfixed by the lives of these people. I guess they're famous for a reason. And I guess you're right, we do think of them as relations almost, people we've known our whole lives.  Dr. LERNER: Yeah, it's an interesting phenomenon. I'm not going to be able to tell you why that happens. But I can assure you that what has happened in the world of illness is, just as we are interested in what celebrities wear and who they hang out with and what parties they go to, we now are interested in the names of their diseases, where they're being treated, and how they're being treated.  CONAN: I wonder, do doctors see an upturn in people making appointments to have their colons checked or their prostates when they hear that a famous person has colon cancer or prostate cancer?  Dr. LERNER: Well, it's funny you asked. There actually are a few studies of this. After Betty Ford was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1974, we had what was called the famous Betty Ford blip, where numbers of women who'd never had mammograms went for the first time, and the rates of breast cancer actually went up as a result. Another celebrity who fostered cancer awareness is Katie Couric whose husband died of colon cancer. And she became a strong advocate for colonoscopy. And rates of colonoscopy went up dramatically also after she went public with that whole story.  CONAN: And we admire people like that and certainly, like Elizabeth Edwards. At the same time, you feel for some of these people who may want to keep this private. These are awful moments.  Dr. LERNER: It's very interesting. When I was listening to Elizabeth Edwards talk, she used the word obligation. And one can have nothing but admiration for what she's done with respect to cancer, and I think she's done a tremendous service. But you feel almost a little regret that someone in the public eye feels obliged to do that, because it wasn't so long ago that even famous people were able to keep these diagnoses pretty private and deal with them themselves, without sort of the constant public scrutiny. But over the last 20, 30, 40 years, the tables have really turned and now, if you're famous and you get diagnosed, it's almost impossible to keep things secret.  CONAN: And to see, as we saw with Senator Kennedy, I mean, it must have been terrible for his family to see his diagnosis being debated on television.  Dr. LERNER: Well, that's right. I mean, you can imagine being someone given this tremendously difficult diagnosis. That's bad enough. And then, right, you turn on the TV, and you turn on Sanjay Gupta, who's obviously doing a very good job, as well, and there's a simulation of Ted Kennedy's brain and the tumor, and you're sitting in the room with him. It definitely can be very, very jarring. And it almost raises the question, have we almost gone too far in the other direction and is there a way to sort of pull back a little bit and try to restore some of the dignity and privacy for these folks? CONAN: Here's an email we have from John in Mount Horeb, Wisconsin. My grandfather died of a glioma when he was 60, and my father died of a nearly identical tumor in 2005 at age 74. Both during my father's treatment and after his death, his doctors were very tight lipped about his prognosis, the nature of his tumor, whether I might be at an increased risk of a similar tumor later in my life. My only guess as to why his doctors were not forthcoming with any of this information was they didn't want to open themselves up to possible lawsuits if they proved to be wrong. By following the coverage of Senator Kennedy's unfortunate illness, I've learned more about the condition in two days than I did in years of pressing my father's doctors for information.  Dr. LERNER: Well, that's a great point. I mean, this is the real upside of these public diagnoses, and that couldn't have been stated any more clearly. When you hear about diseases, they sort of carry this mystery. There's question that people have about them, and boom, here's someone with this disease. You get sort of a tutorial on newspapers, on television, on the Internet, and you really have this enormous opportunity as someone interested in the disease to learn about it.  I would add, also, in this particular case, medicine was very, very different in the earlier years. And often times, cancer diagnoses were not discussed, even within families, a lot. So it probably wasn't just a concern about lawsuits but also the era itself. Doctors were much more tight lipped than they are now.  CONAN: It also occurs to me that, I guess, if you heard that Humphrey Bogart had lung cancer, and you had lung cancer, well, you may not have known anybody else who had lung cancer in 1954 or whatever it was. These days, with the Internet, there are support groups out there for every disease, and people who are diagnosed with something can get in touch with hundreds, thousands of other people with the same condition.  Dr. LERNER: That's very true. And you know, as with everything, it's a double-edged sword. You know, I think it's an enormous help for people. Indeed, my own patients, I often suggest that they go on the Internet and look at support groups, in part because sometimes people in the support groups know more than I do about a particular disease because they're up on all the research. The downside, of course, of this public information is that sometimes misleading facts can be put into play. And sometimes people get the wrong impression about specific diseases and treatments because the information really isn't filtered in any manner.  CONAN: Let's get a caller on the line. And this is Jim, Jim with us from Minneapolis.  JIM (Caller): Thanks for having me on the air. I've kind of taken a very public road with my cancer. I happen to have a - I've been living for 10 years with a brain tumor. It's similar to Senator Kennedy's and had five reoccurrences. And when I was diagnosed, I thought I was going to die immediately. And I've been thankful, have been in several clinical trials, taken several emerging drugs off label, and am doing great today. I've set up websites, jimsjourney. com, to help people in the similar diagnosis. And then in 2004, I biked from Los Angeles to Washington, D. C. , with Lance Armstrong as a member of the Tour of Hope National Team to promote clinical trials. Enough people don't know that they're a viable option, and they've saved my life several times and to let people know there is tremendous hope.  CONAN: And going public, I think what you're telling us Jim is, in a way, it saved your life. JIM: It has saved my life, and it continues to. I mean, in this recurrence right now, I'm on a new drug called Avastin. And years before, I've taken new emerging treatments that I would not have, you know, maybe learned about had I not been aggressive in learning about my disease and really finding the best options and treatment options. And that's what people really have to do when they're diagnosed. So I've tried to share the learning that I've had. So many people came out of the woodwork and said hey, I've got a brain tumor, my cousin, my somebody and said here's what we've learned and have hope, and call on us for anything. I've just tried to pay back and be a resource for others starting this journey.  CONAN: Well, have hope. Well, Dr. Lerner, that's an important lesson.  Dr. LERNER: It is a very important lesson. And there are a couple of points I think that Jim's story underscores. One is that, even if you get the diagnosis of brain cancer, even a glioma, different gliomas act very, very differently. And a treatment that works for a given person may not work for another person. That was sort of the point that Elizabeth Edwards was making before. So, getting the information out there through a website, as was suggested, is really, really important.  Whether that particular journey is going to work for you is very much another story. The other point that's worth mentioning, as Elizabeth Edwards also said, is the people we're not hearing from today, unfortunately, are some who haven't done as well as some of the people here. So it's very, very important to get this information out there but also to be realistic that, in some cases, things are going to be very helpful, but for other people, unfortunately, they're not going to work as well.  CONAN: Jim. . . JIM: Well, I think there's a lot of people that don't get second opinions. Even when - they still have this paternalistic view of medicine, that their family doctor or the first person they see who's purported to be the best doctor at this. And they don't ask those questions and go see several people and may miss out on what may be the best treatment option.  CONAN: Jim. . . Dr. LERNER: I would just totally underscore what Jim said. I couldn't agree more. And, if you have the resources and time and ability to get second opinions and ask questions, you are being as good a patient as you can be.  CONAN: Jim, continued good luck.  JIM: Thank you.  CONAN: Bye-bye. Let's see if we can go now to Crash, Crash, who is calling us from Chicago.  CRASH (Caller): Yeah, hi. One thing that isn't being talked about today, and I don't - I hope this doesn't happen to anyone, but, I mean, these diseases do kill people. My mother died two years ago this past April from mastetic breast cancer that had spread to her lungs, and she insisted on keeping it private. She insisted on not telling even members of our own family. She kept how bad her status was from us up until the very end. And it made it really difficult to deal with it for me and my brother, and it made it really difficult for us to even keep the family informed when she died. And we got a terrible story about some distant relatives who actually called me to ask me how she was doing after she had died.  CONAN: Did she ever tell you, Crash, why she wanted to keep it private?  CRASH: You know, I pressed her about it as much as I could, and she just said that it's something that she didn't feel comfortable talking about.  CONAN: And Dr. Lerner, Crash's mom, she's not alone. A lot of people don't want to talk about it.  Dr. LERNER: That's true. I think things, again, have changed in the last several decades, to the point where, in part because so many cancer patients, whether famous or not, are out there going on walkathons and climbing mountains and all that stuff, people are much, much more comfortable talking about cancer today. But there's still a segment of people for whom this is a devastating piece of news, and the way they deal with it is working it out themselves within a closed circle of people and keeping things private. And I think we really, really have to respect that, even though, as Crash suggested, it can sometimes be very difficult for the family.  CRASH: I think it's also important to realize that, when people are faced with these sort of diseases, depression can become a real issue, and people can isolate themselves. And my mom was of a generation of people who didn't accept the fact, like, oh, I don't get depressed. And right up there towards the end, I mean, she was really isolating herself from everyone, and it's something that you need to look for in people that are very ill.  CONAN: Did she say she didn't want to cause people trouble?  CRASH: Yes. Yes, she did.  CONAN: Yeah. Well, Crash, I'm terribly sorry for your loss.  CRASH: I appreciate that, thank you, and thank you for the show.  CONAN: Thanks very much for the phone call. We're talking with Dr. Barron Lerner, professor of medicine and public health at Columbia University Medical Center and author of the book \"When Illness Goes Public: Celebrity Patients and How We Look At Medicine. \"  If you'd like to join the conversation, 800-989-8255. Email us talk@npr. org, and you're listening to Talk of the Nation coming to you from NPR News.  And here's an email we got from Lauren Berlin (ph). I'm trying to call in. I'm 30. I published a personal essay in the New York Times about three months ago about my experience being diagnosed with an incurable illness. Strangers contacted me from all over the world, and many were incredibly supportive and encouraging. However, a few people also tracked down my home phone number and called to tell me that I would be cured if I would try their alternative therapies, such as coconut oil, which they conveniently would sell to me. I felt very exposed and frustrated that people would use my story as an opportunity to sell me something and also so touched by the strangers who sent me notes of encouragement. And I guess you get both those reactions.  Dr. LERNER: You very much do. Certainly, the famous people that I wrote about in the book, who had cancer and went public, got very much the same thing. They got letters of incredible support. They got people discussing their illnesses, trying to emulate them, but they also got a whole slew of pieces of information that probably were less helpful, that someone claimed a particular cure was what made them better, that had no scientific basis.  CONAN: Yeah, you think of Steve McQueen and laetrile.  Dr. LERNER: Exactly. That's who I was going to mention, who was one of the people that I talk about, and Steve McQueen, for people who had forgotten, when he was diagnosed with end stage mesothelioma, went down to Mexico and underwent a very, very unorthodox treatment for his disease, which included even coffee enemas. And at the end, people - even though Steve McQueen died, the sense was that he had somehow almost beaten his disease. And as a result, thousands and thousands of people have gone to Mexico in search of some type of miracle cure, even though there's probably no efficacy to those treatments.  CONAN: Let's talk with Christie, Christie with us from Maynard in Massachusetts.  CHRISTIE (Caller): Yeah, hi. I can't hear you very well. I really appreciate this conversation. I have been diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome, and it's often considered an invisible disease and considered not real by a lot of people, including the medical profession. And it's so helpful when famous people come out. Susan Harris, who wrote \"Soap\" and wrote for \"All in the Family,\" came out many years ago with chronic fatigue, and Michelle Akers, who is a soccer. . . CONAN: Star, she was one of the great players on the famous U. S. women's soccer team.  CHRISTIE: Yeah. In fact, she was voted greatest female athlete of the century. And she - her career ended because of chronic fatigue, and it gives you a sense of you're not alone, especially with a disease that a lot of people don't believe. And when you see somebody as great as Michelle Akers lose a career, you realize this isn't just she's tired. This is actually a very serious disease. And so I really appreciate these people coming out because it validates your own feelings and, you know, sort of helps you explain to other people what's going on.  CONAN: I guess that sense of sisterhood and brotherhood that Elizabeth Edwards was talking about with us earlier.  CHRISTIE: Right. And with cancer, at least there's, you know, people hear the word cancer and go, wow, that's serious. And for other diseases, there still has to be a lot more discussion, I think, out there.  CONAN: Christie, good luck.  CHRISTIE: Thank you very much.  CONAN: Appreciate it. One final question, Dr. Lerner, and that is, sometimes, somebody with the same disease as a famous person might see the treatment that that, you know, actor or politician is getting and, say, you know, be a little resentful. Yeah, I'm learning about this wonderful treatment that I can't afford.  Dr. LERNER: It's a concern. A good example we might talk about there is Lance Armstrong, who very eloquently in his book talks about how he went from one medical center to another and eventually chose a treatment that he felt was best for him. But Lance Armstrong also notes that not everybody has the means to do that. And with our current healthcare system, that's a reality. But what all of these celebrities can do, and what Internet websites can do at least is get you the information, at least give you the knowledge that - of what is out there, and what is potentially available. And like the earlier caller, if you've got the gumption to call up your senator's office and push hard enough and get someone like Ted Kennedy advocating for you, then things might actually work out, even if you don't think you have the means.  CONAN: Dr. Lerner, thanks very much for being with us today.  Dr. LERNER: Thank you, Neal.  CONAN: Dr. Barron Lerner, professor of medicine and public health at Columbia University Medical Center, his book, \"When Illness Goes Public: Celebrity patients and how we look at medicine,\" and he was with us today from our bureau in New York.  Coming up, double-amputee runner Oscar Pistorius got the go-ahead last week to compete in the Olympic Games if he can qualify. He'll join us next. If you would like to talk with him, give us a call 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr. org. Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan. It's the Talk of the Nation from NPR News.   NEAL CONAN, host:   This is Talk of the Nation. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. This week, many of us learned a new word, glioma. It's a type of malignant brain tumor, and on Tuesday, news broke that Senator Ted Kennedy has one. Since then, we've received a crash course in brain tumors. We've seen cross-sections of what Kennedy's brain might look like, and we've heard about his treatment options. Whether he and his family like it or not, Senator Kennedy's illness is a very public story, which often happens with celebrities. Some do their best to preserve their privacy.   Others choose to embrace the inevitable and use public interest in their illness as an opportunity, as a teachable moment. In just a moment, Elizabeth Edwards joins us. We also want to hear your stories. How have you dealt with the decision to let other people know about your illness? Does it help at all to learn that a famous actor or politician has the same illness that you do? Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr. org. You can also share your story on our blog. That's at npr. org/blogofthenation. Elizabeth Edwards joins us on the line from Chapel Hill in North Carolina, and it's nice to have you back on the program.   Ms. ELIZABETH EDWARDS: It's great to be with you.  CONAN: And if you would, take us back to, well, it was a day in 2004, the day that your husband, John Edwards, and Senator John Kerry conceded the presidential race.  Ms. EDWARDS: I had suspicions at that time already that a lump that I'd found in my breast during the campaign was going to turn out to be cancer, but we, immediately after Senator Kerry did his concession speech, we went to Mass General Hospital and had a biopsy done and found out that, in fact, it was. We then, of course, had to return to our home in Washington, D. C. , that night and on the way made the decision that we would, in fact, go public with this. I was going to lose my hair. I wasn't much of a public figure, but I was enough of one that my losing my hair was going to mean that it was going to be a harder secret to keep.  CONAN: Yeah.  Ms. EDWARDS: So I went ahead and said just go ahead and do this. I actually didn't think of my place in a long string of people, known and unknown, who had this disease. I since think of myself very much that way, and that we sort of hold each other's hands in this long chain. And my being public sort of allowed people to reach out to somebody, and I did get those hands reaching out to me, largely people who suffer from cancer. I sort of feel like this is a tribute to the people who came before me, and who reached their hands to me, both by participating in research and being strong themselves. And then I have an obligation now to do that for my brothers and sisters, as well.  CONAN: But was there a moment when you said, look, can't I keep this private?  Ms. EDWARDS: Honestly, there wasn't. I mean, I guess I grew up in a household that was a very open household, and John and I have always had a very open home, where we have very few secrets from anyone. We always say there's a bunch of 28-year-old boys running around, who've seen me in every nightgown I own. So I wasn't particularly private to begin with, and politics kind of cures you a little bit of that anyway. People want to peer in your closets, and you sort of make a bargain that you're going to let them.   And this - you know, there was in it also the possibility of a teachable moment, and just tell people not to make the mistakes I made, to go ahead and have their mammograms in a timely way and do their monthly self-exams. And in fact, one of the first emails I got was from a woman who had gone and gotten herself checked immediately after hearing of me and found, in fact, that she did have a cancerous tumor, and she was already getting treatment. So whatever else, whatever the bad sides were, I have this woman's life as a reason to have made the public statement.   CONAN: I guess, simple coincidence that it was in Massachusetts General, the same hospital where Senator Kennedy is.  Ms. EDWARDS: It is. But I got very good treatment there, and I'm certain that he will get the same.  CONAN: I wonder, though, was there - what did you think when you saw those stories on the news last Tuesday, as, well, we're seeing cross-sections of Senator Kennedy's head?  Ms. EDWARDS: It broke my heart because he - as it does with anybody, but in particular, when you see somebody who is so vital, who embraces life in the huge way that he does, it just seemed - and in particular all he's been through, this seemed so grossly unfair. On the other hand, this is an equal-opportunity disease. It doesn't really care, you know, how much you have to live for or how much fight you have in you.   It can strike anybody, and this time, it struck somebody who, I would think, in the ten days before that, I testified on the new cancer bill that he is introducing in the Senate with Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican from Texas. So it was almost a cruel irony in addition. It was hard not to look back at that hearing. I spoke; with my panel was Lance Armstrong, who had testicular cancer that spread to his brain, and me, with breast cancer that's spread to my bones, and Steve Case, whose brother died, in fact, of a brain tumor.  CONAN: Let's see if we can get some listeners involved in the conversation. Our guest, of course, is Elizabeth Edwards. We're talking about illness, about a public illness, and if you'd like to join us, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr. org, and let's see if we can begin with Kathy, Kathy is with us from Royal Oak in Michigan.  KATHY (Caller): Hello.  CONAN: Hi.  KATHY: Hi. I had diagnosed in April, three years ago, grade-four glioblastoma, was given no time to live. But my work is as a healer, and a whole lot of people knew about it and started praying for me. And I'll tell you, that's so significant. So I'm thinking, the more people that know about it the better. It's over three years. I do have some challenges with my balance and stuff, but I don't have any more glioma. So that people can recover.   That brings up all those things, oh, God, what if I'm wrong, you know? But anybody who has a history of cancer, it makes your stomach go wiggly. But you know, I have a healthy background. I don't know if - well, one of my girls is a colonel in the Army, and she said, well, mom, I guess it wasn't your day to die. So I guess, you know, if it's Ted Kennedy's day to die, it'll be his day to die. But I'm telling you, the more prayers that we can send to people with cancer, it absolutely makes a difference. That's why I'm well, I swear.  CONAN: Elizabeth Edwards, that kind of support, I know, has flowed to you as well.  Ms. EDWARDS: It has, and I'd like to say I think attitude is everything, as Kathy said. But I actually think that people with great fighting attitudes die of these diseases all the time, and I don't want to say, oh, they died because they didn't have enough fight in them. I think they did. It's just the disease is sometimes stronger than any person could possibly be. I'm glad that was not the case with Kathy. I hope it is not the case with Senator Kennedy. But I did feel that the fight was made easier because I felt I had a huge safety net of people who were ready to catch me in the bad moments. And I think that did allow me an additional level of strength because the treatments for these things are debilitating and difficult.   About the same time I was getting my treatment, Melissa Etheridge was also getting treated for breast cancer, and she stopped her chemotherapy midway because it was so debilitating. So having the strength to continue, even when your body is telling you, we've had enough. I mean, those medicines they put in you, if you were just normally handling them, you would put on gloves they're so toxic. And yet, they put them straight into your veins. So this is a difficult process, and I certainly hope that treatment is available to him, even if it's difficult because all of our thoughts and prayers will get him just so far. And then we have to hope that the medicine is stronger than the disease.   CONAN: Becky's on the line, Becky calling us from York in Pennsylvania.   BECKY (Caller): Hi there. How are you?   CONAN: I'm well, thank you.   BECKY: Good. And it's York, Maine, actually.   CONAN: Oh, I'm sorry.   BECKY: That's OK, no problem. I just quickly wanted to say, Elizabeth, it's an honor to talk to you. When you were re-diagnosed that week, when you came public and said I'm going to stay with my husband's campaign - I apologize in advance, but I was furious. I thought, well, how dare she do that,  how dare she put her husband's job above her health. And I was like, uck, you know? And literally, a week later, I was diagnosed with stage-four cancer that had spread to my liver.   Ms. EDWARDS: Oh, my goodness.   BECKY: And in a lightning bolt, I got it. You know, I totally understood what you were doing. And I just was like, thank God. You're such a role model.   Ms. EDWARDS: That's the thing that - when you're outside the process, outside the disease, it's really hard to put yourself in the position of somebody who does have it. And when we say that we are brothers and sisters of one another, we actually mean it because you understand something. And that's why going public allows you, in a sense gives you this benefit, this enormous family of support because they understand what is just too difficult for other people to understand. And that is how you could, in a moment like that, choose to live.   BECKY: Yeah, and I don't get angry at people who don't understand because I would never wish this on anybody.   Ms. EDWARDS: Absolutely.  BECKY: I just want to say, you've just did the light bulb for me and under terrible circumstances, don't get me wrong. You've been a real guiding light to me in the last 14 months.   CONAN: How are you doing, Becky?  BECKY: Oh, hanging in there. Actually, speaking of Ted Kennedy real quick, three weeks ago, my insurance company rejected me for special, very special procedure that I had done to my liver - that I wanted to have done to my liver. And my insurance company rejected me, and Ted Kennedy went - or his assistant and aides went to bat for me, and I got approved, and I had the treatment done at Mass General last week.   Ms. EDWARDS: That's great. Actually, one of the parts of his cancer bill is that it would cover the trials and other things that sometimes still you have insurance problems if you're doing anything out of the normal protocol. And you're from Pennsylvania? I think Senator Specter is also not, surprisingly. . .  CONAN: I was wrong. She's actually from Maine. But Becky. . .  Ms. EDWARDS: From Maine? I missed that.   BECKY: Yeah, that's OK. A note from Senator Collins' office was also incredibly instrumental, just to mention that, too, and they got me through within - I got the denial overturned in less than 24 hours.   Ms. EDWARDS: That's incredible.   CONAN: That's great, Becky.   BECKY: And now, we're hoping for the best.  CONAN: Good luck to you.   BECKY: Thank you so much. Thanks for taking my call. Bye-bye.   CONAN: And Elizabeth Edwards, we just have a few seconds left with you. But how are you doing?   Ms. EDWARDS: I'm actually doing quite well. It's one of the things I want to sort of caution people about is they hear - and Kathy was an example of that - you only have a certain amount of time to live. I know people who are paying attention when it was announced that my cancer had spread to my bones. Heard a lot of people saying I only had five years to live because I was in this condition.   Now, it's one year later, slightly more than one year later, and I'm in exactly the same condition. It's not gotten any worse. So if every year, I can say I have five more years, then that'll be great. You know, that medicine is moving very quickly, which is great. And so the statistics that we have from previous years are not really particularly useful. So I'm hopeful that it's also true for Senator Kennedy.   CONAN: Thank you so much for being with us. We appreciate your time.   Ms. EDWARDS: Great to be with you, Neal.  CONAN: We're talking about public illness on Talk of the Nation from NPR News.   (Soundbite of music)  CONAN: This is Talk of the Nation. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. Dealing with illness is something that many people prefer to keep private, but privacy is often impossible for those in the public eye, like Senator Ted Kennedy, who was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor earlier this week. Have you dealt with a decision to let other people know about your illness? Does it help at all to learn a famous actor or politician has the same illness you do? Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr. org, and you can read what other listeners have to say on our blog at npr. org/blogofthenation.   When celebrities and public figures get sick, sometimes the news takes an unexpected toll, even though we don't know them personally, Dr. Barron Lerner writes this. He's a professor of medicine and public health at Columbia University Medical Center and author of \"When Illness Goes Public: Celebrity Patients, and How We Look at Medicine. \" He joins us now from our bureau in New York, and nice to have you on the program today.   Dr. BARRON LERNER (Medicine and Public Health, Columbia University Medical Center; \"When Illness Goes Public: Celebrity Patients, and How We Look at Medicine\"): Thank you, Neal.   CONAN: And why does something like Senator Kennedy's diagnosis affect us so much?  Dr. LERNER: Well, we're a society that's very interested in celebrities and many aspects of celebrities' lives and really revere people in the public eye. And I think when someone of Senator Kennedy's stature gets such a devastating diagnosis, it really hits us, almost as if he's a member of our family or someone we know. And I think that's the main reason why people are talking about this so much.   CONAN: And I guess we're transfixed by the lives of these people. I guess they're famous for a reason. And I guess you're right, we do think of them as relations almost, people we've known our whole lives.   Dr. LERNER: Yeah, it's an interesting phenomenon. I'm not going to be able to tell you why that happens. But I can assure you that what has happened in the world of illness is, just as we are interested in what celebrities wear and who they hang out with and what parties they go to, we now are interested in the names of their diseases, where they're being treated, and how they're being treated.   CONAN: I wonder, do doctors see an upturn in people making appointments to have their colons checked or their prostates when they hear that a famous person has colon cancer or prostate cancer?   Dr. LERNER: Well, it's funny you asked. There actually are a few studies of this. After Betty Ford was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1974, we had what was called the famous Betty Ford blip, where numbers of women who'd never had mammograms went for the first time, and the rates of breast cancer actually went up as a result. Another celebrity who fostered cancer awareness is Katie Couric whose husband died of colon cancer. And she became a strong advocate for colonoscopy. And rates of colonoscopy went up dramatically also after she went public with that whole story.   CONAN: And we admire people like that and certainly, like Elizabeth Edwards. At the same time, you feel for some of these people who may want to keep this private. These are awful moments.   Dr. LERNER: It's very interesting. When I was listening to Elizabeth Edwards talk, she used the word obligation. And one can have nothing but admiration for what she's done with respect to cancer, and I think she's done a tremendous service. But you feel almost a little regret that someone in the public eye feels obliged to do that, because it wasn't so long ago that even famous people were able to keep these diagnoses pretty private and deal with them themselves, without sort of the constant public scrutiny. But over the last 20, 30, 40 years, the tables have really turned and now, if you're famous and you get diagnosed, it's almost impossible to keep things secret.   CONAN: And to see, as we saw with Senator Kennedy, I mean, it must have been terrible for his family to see his diagnosis being debated on television.   Dr. LERNER: Well, that's right. I mean, you can imagine being someone given this tremendously difficult diagnosis. That's bad enough. And then, right, you turn on the TV, and you turn on Sanjay Gupta, who's obviously doing a very good job, as well, and there's a simulation of Ted Kennedy's brain and the tumor, and you're sitting in the room with him. It definitely can be very, very jarring. And it almost raises the question, have we almost gone too far in the other direction and is there a way to sort of pull back a little bit and try to restore some of the dignity and privacy for these folks?  CONAN: Here's an email we have from John in Mount Horeb, Wisconsin. My grandfather died of a glioma when he was 60, and my father died of a nearly identical tumor in 2005 at age 74. Both during my father's treatment and after his death, his doctors were very tight lipped about his prognosis, the nature of his tumor, whether I might be at an increased risk of a similar tumor later in my life. My only guess as to why his doctors were not forthcoming with any of this information was they didn't want to open themselves up to possible lawsuits if they proved to be wrong. By following the coverage of Senator Kennedy's unfortunate illness, I've learned more about the condition in two days than I did in years of pressing my father's doctors for information.   Dr. LERNER: Well, that's a great point. I mean, this is the real upside of these public diagnoses, and that couldn't have been stated any more clearly. When you hear about diseases, they sort of carry this mystery. There's question that people have about them, and boom, here's someone with this disease. You get sort of a tutorial on newspapers, on television, on the Internet, and you really have this enormous opportunity as someone interested in the disease to learn about it.   I would add, also, in this particular case, medicine was very, very different in the earlier years. And often times, cancer diagnoses were not discussed, even within families, a lot. So it probably wasn't just a concern about lawsuits but also the era itself. Doctors were much more tight lipped than they are now.   CONAN: It also occurs to me that, I guess, if you heard that Humphrey Bogart had lung cancer, and you had lung cancer, well, you may not have known anybody else who had lung cancer in 1954 or whatever it was. These days, with the Internet, there are support groups out there for every disease, and people who are diagnosed with something can get in touch with hundreds, thousands of other people with the same condition.   Dr. LERNER: That's very true. And you know, as with everything, it's a double-edged sword. You know, I think it's an enormous help for people. Indeed, my own patients, I often suggest that they go on the Internet and look at support groups, in part because sometimes people in the support groups know more than I do about a particular disease because they're up on all the research. The downside, of course, of this public information is that sometimes misleading facts can be put into play. And sometimes people get the wrong impression about specific diseases and treatments because the information really isn't filtered in any manner.   CONAN: Let's get a caller on the line. And this is Jim, Jim with us from Minneapolis.   JIM (Caller): Thanks for having me on the air. I've kind of taken a very public road with my cancer. I happen to have a - I've been living for 10 years with a brain tumor. It's similar to Senator Kennedy's and had five reoccurrences. And when I was diagnosed, I thought I was going to die immediately. And I've been thankful, have been in several clinical trials, taken several emerging drugs off label, and am doing great today. I've set up websites, jimsjourney. com, to help people in the similar diagnosis. And then in 2004, I biked from Los Angeles to Washington, D. C. , with Lance Armstrong as a member of the Tour of Hope National Team to promote clinical trials. Enough people don't know that they're a viable option, and they've saved my life several times and to let people know there is tremendous hope.   CONAN: And going public, I think what you're telling us Jim is, in a way, it saved your life.  JIM: It has saved my life, and it continues to. I mean, in this recurrence right now, I'm on a new drug called Avastin. And years before, I've taken new emerging treatments that I would not have, you know, maybe learned about had I not been aggressive in learning about my disease and really finding the best options and treatment options. And that's what people really have to do when they're diagnosed. So I've tried to share the learning that I've had. So many people came out of the woodwork and said hey, I've got a brain tumor, my cousin, my somebody and said here's what we've learned and have hope, and call on us for anything. I've just tried to pay back and be a resource for others starting this journey.   CONAN: Well, have hope. Well, Dr. Lerner, that's an important lesson.   Dr. LERNER: It is a very important lesson. And there are a couple of points I think that Jim's story underscores. One is that, even if you get the diagnosis of brain cancer, even a glioma, different gliomas act very, very differently. And a treatment that works for a given person may not work for another person. That was sort of the point that Elizabeth Edwards was making before. So, getting the information out there through a website, as was suggested, is really, really important.   Whether that particular journey is going to work for you is very much another story. The other point that's worth mentioning, as Elizabeth Edwards also said, is the people we're not hearing from today, unfortunately, are some who haven't done as well as some of the people here. So it's very, very important to get this information out there but also to be realistic that, in some cases, things are going to be very helpful, but for other people, unfortunately, they're not going to work as well.   CONAN: Jim. . .  JIM: Well, I think there's a lot of people that don't get second opinions. Even when - they still have this paternalistic view of medicine, that their family doctor or the first person they see who's purported to be the best doctor at this. And they don't ask those questions and go see several people and may miss out on what may be the best treatment option.   CONAN: Jim. . .  Dr. LERNER: I would just totally underscore what Jim said. I couldn't agree more. And, if you have the resources and time and ability to get second opinions and ask questions, you are being as good a patient as you can be.   CONAN: Jim, continued good luck.   JIM: Thank you.   CONAN: Bye-bye. Let's see if we can go now to Crash, Crash, who is calling us from Chicago.   CRASH (Caller): Yeah, hi. One thing that isn't being talked about today, and I don't - I hope this doesn't happen to anyone, but, I mean, these diseases do kill people. My mother died two years ago this past April from mastetic breast cancer that had spread to her lungs, and she insisted on keeping it private. She insisted on not telling even members of our own family. She kept how bad her status was from us up until the very end. And it made it really difficult to deal with it for me and my brother, and it made it really difficult for us to even keep the family informed when she died. And we got a terrible story about some distant relatives who actually called me to ask me how she was doing after she had died.   CONAN: Did she ever tell you, Crash, why she wanted to keep it private?   CRASH: You know, I pressed her about it as much as I could, and she just said that it's something that she didn't feel comfortable talking about.   CONAN: And Dr. Lerner, Crash's mom, she's not alone. A lot of people don't want to talk about it.   Dr. LERNER: That's true. I think things, again, have changed in the last several decades, to the point where, in part because so many cancer patients, whether famous or not, are out there going on walkathons and climbing mountains and all that stuff, people are much, much more comfortable talking about cancer today. But there's still a segment of people for whom this is a devastating piece of news, and the way they deal with it is working it out themselves within a closed circle of people and keeping things private. And I think we really, really have to respect that, even though, as Crash suggested, it can sometimes be very difficult for the family.   CRASH: I think it's also important to realize that, when people are faced with these sort of diseases, depression can become a real issue, and people can isolate themselves. And my mom was of a generation of people who didn't accept the fact, like, oh, I don't get depressed. And right up there towards the end, I mean, she was really isolating herself from everyone, and it's something that you need to look for in people that are very ill.   CONAN: Did she say she didn't want to cause people trouble?   CRASH: Yes. Yes, she did.   CONAN: Yeah. Well, Crash, I'm terribly sorry for your loss.   CRASH: I appreciate that, thank you, and thank you for the show.   CONAN: Thanks very much for the phone call. We're talking with Dr. Barron Lerner, professor of medicine and public health at Columbia University Medical Center and author of the book \"When Illness Goes Public: Celebrity Patients and How We Look At Medicine. \"  If you'd like to join the conversation, 800-989-8255. Email us talk@npr. org, and you're listening to Talk of the Nation coming to you from NPR News.   And here's an email we got from Lauren Berlin (ph). I'm trying to call in. I'm 30. I published a personal essay in the New York Times about three months ago about my experience being diagnosed with an incurable illness. Strangers contacted me from all over the world, and many were incredibly supportive and encouraging. However, a few people also tracked down my home phone number and called to tell me that I would be cured if I would try their alternative therapies, such as coconut oil, which they conveniently would sell to me. I felt very exposed and frustrated that people would use my story as an opportunity to sell me something and also so touched by the strangers who sent me notes of encouragement. And I guess you get both those reactions.   Dr. LERNER: You very much do. Certainly, the famous people that I wrote about in the book, who had cancer and went public, got very much the same thing. They got letters of incredible support. They got people discussing their illnesses, trying to emulate them, but they also got a whole slew of pieces of information that probably were less helpful, that someone claimed a particular cure was what made them better, that had no scientific basis.   CONAN: Yeah, you think of Steve McQueen and laetrile.   Dr. LERNER: Exactly. That's who I was going to mention, who was one of the people that I talk about, and Steve McQueen, for people who had forgotten, when he was diagnosed with end stage mesothelioma, went down to Mexico and underwent a very, very unorthodox treatment for his disease, which included even coffee enemas. And at the end, people - even though Steve McQueen died, the sense was that he had somehow almost beaten his disease. And as a result, thousands and thousands of people have gone to Mexico in search of some type of miracle cure, even though there's probably no efficacy to those treatments.   CONAN: Let's talk with Christie, Christie with us from Maynard in Massachusetts.   CHRISTIE (Caller): Yeah, hi. I can't hear you very well. I really appreciate this conversation. I have been diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome, and it's often considered an invisible disease and considered not real by a lot of people, including the medical profession. And it's so helpful when famous people come out. Susan Harris, who wrote \"Soap\" and wrote for \"All in the Family,\" came out many years ago with chronic fatigue, and Michelle Akers, who is a soccer. . .  CONAN: Star, she was one of the great players on the famous U. S. women's soccer team.   CHRISTIE: Yeah. In fact, she was voted greatest female athlete of the century. And she - her career ended because of chronic fatigue, and it gives you a sense of you're not alone, especially with a disease that a lot of people don't believe. And when you see somebody as great as Michelle Akers lose a career, you realize this isn't just she's tired. This is actually a very serious disease. And so I really appreciate these people coming out because it validates your own feelings and, you know, sort of helps you explain to other people what's going on.   CONAN: I guess that sense of sisterhood and brotherhood that Elizabeth Edwards was talking about with us earlier.   CHRISTIE: Right. And with cancer, at least there's, you know, people hear the word cancer and go, wow, that's serious. And for other diseases, there still has to be a lot more discussion, I think, out there.   CONAN: Christie, good luck.   CHRISTIE: Thank you very much.   CONAN: Appreciate it. One final question, Dr. Lerner, and that is, sometimes, somebody with the same disease as a famous person might see the treatment that that, you know, actor or politician is getting and, say, you know, be a little resentful. Yeah, I'm learning about this wonderful treatment that I can't afford.   Dr. LERNER: It's a concern. A good example we might talk about there is Lance Armstrong, who very eloquently in his book talks about how he went from one medical center to another and eventually chose a treatment that he felt was best for him. But Lance Armstrong also notes that not everybody has the means to do that. And with our current healthcare system, that's a reality.  But what all of these celebrities can do, and what Internet websites can do at least is get you the information, at least give you the knowledge that - of what is out there, and what is potentially available. And like the earlier caller, if you've got the gumption to call up your senator's office and push hard enough and get someone like Ted Kennedy advocating for you, then things might actually work out, even if you don't think you have the means.   CONAN: Dr. Lerner, thanks very much for being with us today.   Dr. LERNER: Thank you, Neal.   CONAN: Dr. Barron Lerner, professor of medicine and public health at Columbia University Medical Center, his book, \"When Illness Goes Public: Celebrity patients and how we look at medicine,\" and he was with us today from our bureau in New York.   Coming up, double-amputee runner Oscar Pistorius got the go-ahead last week to compete in the Olympic Games if he can qualify. He'll join us next. If you would like to talk with him, give us a call 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr. org. Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan. It's the Talk of the Nation from NPR News.

I'm Ira Flatow. A team of biologists and mathematicians recently figured out how to make simple computers from living bacteria. These computing E. coli work away at the classic mathematical puzzle called the burnt pancake problem. That's something like maybe what goes on in your house in your house every morning, that experiment. But this is a little bit different. The E. coli really don't flip pancakes. They just jumble fragments of DNA instead. And the research is out this week in the Journal of Biological Engineering. So, how on Earth do you get bacteria to become computers? And could they be someday be flipping one and zeros on your iPod or on your PC or Mac? Joining me now to talk about these bacterial computers is Karmella Haynes. She's a biologist and postdoctoral researcher at Davidson College in Davidson, North Carolina. She joins us from station WBUR in Boston. Welcome to the program, Dr. Haynes Dr. KARMELLA HAYNES (Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Davidson College): Hi. Thank you, Ira. FLATOW: Let's talk a bit about this. Is this the first time that microbes have been able to compute something? Dr. HAYNES: Well, it is the first time that computational operations have been demonstrated inside living cells. Other researchers have used DNA outside of cells to attempt to address mathematical problems. And this is the first time that the operations that are used to actually carry out the computation have been executed inside living cells. So, it's pretty exciting. FLATOW: Yeah, let's talk about the problem itself, the burnt pancake problem. Give us a little thumbnail on that, if you would Dr. HAYNES: OK, so the burnt pancake problem, basically, what that is, is that it's a problem that's solved by sorting objects in an array of objects by flipping objects either singly or multiple objects at a time. Just imagine you have a stack of burnt pancakes. Each pancake is burnt on one side, golden on the other. And they're all different sizes and what you want to do is that you want to make a nice pretty stack where the biggest one is on the bottom, the smallest one is on the top, and every pancake is facing golden side up. But one of the rules to that game is that you have a spatula where, in order to sort the pancakes, you actually have to insert the spatula in to the stack and then flip the pancakes on top of the spatula. You can't pull out a pancake and stick it in to the bottom, so you can't shuffle them. The only way that you can order that stack is by flipping them. That's pretty much what the burnt pancake problem is. So, one of the goals of that problem is to try to figure out the minimal number of flips it takes to convert a scrambled ugly stack into a nice neat one where the biggest one is on the bottom, smallest ones on the top, and all of the pancakes are golden side up. FLATOW: Now, how do you tell the bacteria to do that? That I'm not actually going to flip a pancake Dr. HAYNES: Exactly. So - and I don't think a lot of people would want bacteria on their pancakes. That wouldn't be very appealing. FLATOW: Certainly not E. coli Dr. HAYNES: Yeah, exactly. So, what we have to do is first figure out how to represent a pancake inside of E. coli. So, what's nice about DNA, it looks a lot like a burnt pancake in that one piece of DNA has a specific directionality, so it can be either be pointing forwards or pointing backwards, OK. DNA pieces, in order for them to make any sense to the cell, they have to be arranged in a certain order. So, if we take something like a gene that has a promoter, which actually turns the gene on in a coding region. It has to follow that promoter. If those two pieces are swapped into the wrong order, then the gene will not be able to be turned on. So, you can think of those fragments as burnt pancakes and that each piece of the gene needs to be in a certain order and in a certain orientation like golden side up in the pancake stack, in order for that gene to be switched on. So, in bacteria, we know that the pancakes' stack had been solved when the gene switches on, and then that gives us some visible phenotype that we can easily monitor. FLATOW: So, you have basically then the bacteria working, working, working, just flipping things around until they get it right? Dr. HAYNES: Exactly, exactly. FLATOW: Do they know how to stop once they get it right Dr. HAYNES: Aha, so that is a very good question. So what we have to do is that we have to keep careful watch on the bacteria as they are randomly trying to solve the problem. So, as the bacteria are solving the problem, they're swimming around in the cell culture, we sample at time intervals and check to see if any of those bacteria had reached the desired phenotype. And that would help us answer the question of what's the minimal time or number of flips it takes to actually reach a solution. A bacteria could reach the solution and then flip away from it. But what we are interested in is just catching the bacteria when they first solve the problem at random. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255, talking with Karmella Haynes. But isn't this sort of like, you know, the old thing about monkeys on a typewriter and then they'll do Shakespeare after a while? If you give them enough time to flip, they'll come up with some guess will be right about getting the pancakes all lined up Dr. HAYNES: Exactly. It's pretty much like that. One of the advantages of doing this sort of computation in bacteria is that you've got millions of little microcomputers all chugging away at this problem at the same time. So, that increases the likelihood that one of them will pick the exact right path in the minimal number of flips to solve the problem. Dr. HAYNES: So, what use can you make of this? Now we have - bacteria can flip the DNA around, but so what Dr. HAYNES: Right, so this has applications in - well, basically any problem that requires massive amounts of parallel processing capacity - problems that can be addressed by sorting objects by reversals. So this would be very useful in that regard, for instance, in studying evolutionary genomics where we compare species by comparing how their genes are all arranged compared to each other. Evolutionary biologists are interested in figuring out the minimal number of steps it takes to convert one species genome into the other by rearrangement. So, that's one practical use of being able to solve very complex versions of this problem. And larger amounts of computational power are required as the pancakes stack gets bigger. It would probably take a computer months and months just to solve a pancake stack that was on the order of 11 pancakes big. At that point, the problem gets massively complex and that's where having tons of parallel processing power becomes handy FLATOW: So, in other words, you turn each of the E. coli into a little computer? Dr. HAYNES: Yes. FLATOW: And you all work on it together, or parallel. Yeah. Dr. HAYNES: In parallel. FLATOW: In parallel. That's interesting. Wouldn't it be great if you could have it stop itself and signal hey, I've finished, you know? Dr. HAYNES: Yeah, you know, that wouldn't be too difficult, at least in concept, to accomplish. So for instance, we could have that unscrambled gene be a gene product that would then turn around and attach itself to the enzyme that's doing the flipping to stop the flipping. You see, so sort of a negative feedback loop FLATOW: Maybe you could have. . Dr. HAYNES: Yeah, but that can be engineered FLATOW: Yeah? Could you do that, yeah Dr. HAYNES: Yeah, I think so FLATOW: Could you get it to turn a little light on or something? You know, would they have these fluorescent bacteria that maybe, you know, hey it turns green, it's done Dr. HAYNES: Right, so the gene that we are using in our work right now is tetracycline-resistant, so it's a gene that renders the bacteria resistance to an antibiotic. So, the phenotype that we look for is growth. So, any bacteria that lives solve the problem and everybody else in the culture is dead when we check. It's unfortunate for the bacteria. So alternately, yes, you could easily use a fluorescence protein to get a visual of when the bacteria actually solve the problem. Further engineering could allow the bacteria to stop flipping the DNA around once they got to the solution. And that's where we would have to engineer in something like a negative feedback loop. FLATOW: Right Dr. HAYNES: That would be pretty nifty. FLATOW: Let's go to Becky in Gunnison. Hi, Becky, Gunnison, Colorado BECKY (Caller): Hi. My question is I just wonder - how do you get the bacteria to do this or want to do this? Or is this something they just automatically do when given the opportunity FLATOW: Good question. How do you - do they have to talk them into that BECKY: Yes. Dr. HAYNES: Well, we have to engineer them to be able to do so. So, what we've done is that we've taken - there's an enzyme that regulates the scrambling of the DNA in the bacteria. That enzyme, we cloned that of a bacteria called salmonella, this is the same bug that will grow in eggs that are sitting too long, raw eggs that are sitting too long on a counter overnight. So, same bug. We get the enzyme from salmonella and that's the enzyme that can cut the DNA, flip it 180 degrees and stick the ends back together. That enzyme also needs to be told where to cut by specific DNA sequences. So those are also engineered into the E. coli. So, we basically bring in components from Salmonella bacteria in order to engineer E. coli to carry out these manipulations BECKY: Great. Thank you FLATOW: Thank you, Becky. What would be the next problem for it? A little chess came? Checkers Dr. HAYNES: All right. That's a very a good question. So, right now we're focused on the burnt pancake problem because the system is so specific to sorting by inversions, what we would essentially have to do is take other math problems and convert them into sorting by reversals problems. And we haven't quite done that just yet, but the collaborative team at Davidson College and Missouri Western State University, the mathematicians are thinking away at ways to be able to do that. And once that. . FLATOW: Like at one point Dr. HAYNES: OK, what's that? FLATOW: Sudoku Dr. HAYNES: Oh, that would be awesome FLATOW: Wouldn't that be great? Yeah, bacteria solving Sudoku problems. Dr. HAYNES: Yes! Brilliant! You want to come and join our team? FLATOW: I don't know why it just seemed perfect. It just struck me as you were saying that, you know Dr. HAYNES: Yeah. Yeah FLATOW: Because its own numbers and you just have a random - put all those numbers in there and see how long it takes to do the Sudoku problem. Give them a hard one. Dr. HAYNES: Yeah FLATOW: Not the entry level Dr. HAYNES: That makes it - that would be yes. OK FLATOW: All right? Dr. HAYNES: That's something to think about FLATOW: Well, that's your assignment (Soundbite of laughter Dr. HANES: It's definitely something to think about FLATOW: Well, let's see. Sometimes they do come up with something intelligent on this program. OK, let's go to the phones. Let's go to Ty in Reno, Nevada. Hi, Ty TY (Caller): Hey, how are you doing FLATOW: Hi, there. Do you like bacteria to do Sudoku problem for you? TY: I'm not really into Sudoku. FLATOW: OK TY: I thought it was kind of funny and ironic that this was basically a genetic algorithm but you're using bacteria's genetic material to solve it. Anyway, I was wondering, in that respect, is there any sort of like pressure toward the fitness, like a genetic algorithm would actually run to sort of pressure the bacteria toward the actual solution? Or is it just completely random like the monkeys in the typewriters Dr. HAYNES: Right. What we were going for was complete randomness so we don't introduce the selection pressure. Its selection pressure would be antibiotic resistance, OK. The bacteria are rewarded. . FLATOW: Explain what that means, this selection pressure Dr. HAYNES: The selection pressure. OK. So it's whatever environmental condition rewards a certain arrangement of fragments and in the E. coli right, so. . FLATOW: See, you punish it - you'd punish it for going in the wrong direction or something like that Dr. HAYNES: Yes, yes. But we don't do that, so the caller is asking whether during that flipping process, is there any reward or punishment for having a certain arrangement of fragments? And the answer to that is no. What we do is in the - after we allow them to flip at random, we then take out a sample of bacteria, and then subject those to the antibiotic to screen for antibiotic resistance, just to check to see if anybody had solved the problem. FLATOW: Yeah, we're talking with Karmella Haynes this hour of Talk of the Nation: Science Friday from NPR News about the bacteria that solve problems, and our listeners have their thinking caps on. Homer in Raleigh. Hi, welcome to Science Friday. HOMER (Caller): Hey, how is it going? FLATOW: Hi, go ahead HOMER: I'm wondering if we can get some bacteria that's living in our bodies, maybe in our digestive system or something to do this, to maybe trigger some sort of internal response and I'll take my answer off the air FLATOW: OK Dr. HAYNES: OK. Well, the system that we've engineered, this using an enzyme from Salmonella and the DNA recognition sites that can manipulate DNA, that can be probably applied to manipulating genes and a system. So more like less in terms of solving a mathematical problem and more in terms of just perhaps driving a toggle switch to regulate the expression of some useful genes, something that would be useful to the bacteria's function. FLATOW: Now - yeah. . Dr. HAYNES: That would allow us control over the expression of genes FLATOW: I imagine there are people who are worried now that you're playing around with E. coli, flipping their genes around, it's going to escape out of the laboratory. We're going to have some brainy E. coli taking over our food or whatever. Any possibility that might happen Dr. HAYNES: You know, at this point I, to be honest, I seriously doubt that these bacteria would pose any public threat. The - so, all of this flipping is taking place on circular pieces of DNA called plasmids. If those plasmids are not selected for, so in order to maintain these little micro - DNA microprocessors in the bacteria, we constantly have to grow them up into in conditions that encourage the bacteria to maintain them FLATOW: OK, let me interrupt it because we have someone on the phone from - Rebecca from Chicago who has sort of the same question, right, Rebecca REBECCA (Caller): Yeah, hi FLATOW: Go ahead. REBECCA: Yeah, I'm actually just curious as to what this process actually looks like when you're in the lab FLATOW: What does it look like? Yeah! What are you looking at and how does it work? Good question Dr. HAYNES: Well, you know, it's surprisingly not very exciting. It's a big glass flask full of brownish-looking liquid swirling around at 37 degrees. So, we're basically just growing up bacteria in culture. Each one - those bacteria carry the plasmids that - where the flipping is taking place. So, it's all - it's pretty much just normal standard molecular genetics techniques that we use. . FLATOW: So, do you take samples out of this big flask every once in awhile to see if it has done something Dr. HAYNES: Yes, yes, at time intervals and grow them up on an agar plate that has antibiotic on it and then see if we have any growth FLATOW: So, this is a long process, this is not something that happens overnight Dr. HAYNES: No, it's not. Yes, so, it does require some human intervention. However, it's a very efficient process and that the actual computations generating all the permutations of the problem happens inside the bacteria, and all we have to do is sample every once in awhile to see if we have any growth. Now, we have engineered the system to occur very slowly so that we could study the kinetics of flipping the DNA. There are ways to actually speed up the flipping. The natural process of flipping a piece of DNA and salmonella takes somewhere in the order of under a minute. So it happens very rapidly as well FLATOW: Right Dr. HAYNES: So there are ways to speed it up if we wanted to FLATOW: Well, Dr. Haynes, I want to thank you for taking time to be with us. Dr. HAYNE: All right FLATOW: And we'll be watching for that paper you publish about the Sudoku problem solving. (Soundbite of laughter Dr. HAYNES: All right FLATOW: And have you back. Dr. HAYNES: All right, we'll be working on that FLATOW: OK, Karmella Haynes. She's a biologist and post-doctoral researcher at the Davidson College in Davidson, North Carolina, and she was talking to us about using E. coli as computers. We're going to switch gears, take a break and come back and talk lots more about the new \"Indiana Jones\" movie and those crystal skulls that are the subject of the movie. Is there real sciences? Is there real geology? Real archeology? Real mythology? What is real about those skulls? So, stay with us. We'll be right back after the short break (Soundbite of music FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow.

FLATOW: So, do you take samples out of this big flask every once in awhile to see if it has done something  Dr. HAYNES: Yes, yes, at time intervals and grow them up on an agar plate that has antibiotic on it and then see if we have any growth  FLATOW: So, this is a long process, this is not something that happens overnight  Dr. HAYNES: No, it's not. Yes, so, it does require some human intervention. However, it's a very efficient process and that the actual computations generating all the permutations of the problem happens inside the bacteria, and all we have to do is sample every once in awhile to see if we have any growth.  Now, we have engineered the system to occur very slowly so that we could study the kinetics of flipping the DNA. There are ways to actually speed up the flipping. The natural process of flipping a piece of DNA and salmonella takes somewhere in the order of under a minute. So it happens very rapidly as well  FLATOW: Right  Dr. HAYNES: So there are ways to speed it up if we wanted to  FLATOW: Well, Dr. Haynes, I want to thank you for taking time to be with us.  Dr. HAYNE: All right  FLATOW: And we'll be watching for that paper you publish about the Sudoku problem solving.  (Soundbite of laughter  Dr. HAYNES: All right  FLATOW: And have you back.  Dr. HAYNES: All right, we'll be working on that  FLATOW: OK, Karmella Haynes. She's a biologist and post-doctoral researcher at the Davidson College in Davidson, North Carolina, and she was talking to us about using E. coli as computers. We're going to switch gears, take a break and come back and talk lots more about the new \"Indiana Jones\" movie and those crystal skulls that are the subject of the movie. Is there real sciences? Is there real geology? Real archeology? Real mythology? What is real about those skulls? So, stay with us. We'll be right back after the short break  (Soundbite of music  FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow.

I'm Ari Shapiro. Later today, a space probe from Earth will hurdle through the Martian atmosphere. And if all goes well, it'll come to a gentle landing near the red planet's north pole. The mission is called Phoenix. It's not designed to look for life on Mars, but it will say whether conditions for life once existed there. NPR's Joe Palca has this preview of today's events. JOE PALCA: The Phoenix spacecraft lifted off from Cape Canaveral in Florida last August and set a course for Mars. Mr. BARRY GOLDSTEIN (Project Manager, Mars Phoenix Mission): We have had a very peaceful cruise. PALCA: Barry Goldstein of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena is project manager for the Mars Phoenix mission. Peaceful is good; peaceful is what project managers like. But the peaceful part of the mission is about to end. Terrifying is how people describe the phase of the mission known as EDL - entry, descent and landing. Goldstein describes what's supposed to happen. Mr. GOLDSTEIN: Approximately 14 minutes before we land, we go through what we call cruise-stage separation. PALCA: The cruise stage supplied the power and communications for Phoenix during its trip from Earth. But it's no use on the surface of Mars, so it's cast away before EDL starts. About seven minutes before landing, the spacecraft hits the top of the Martian atmosphere, traveling more than 12,000 miles an hour. Even though the atmosphere is thin, it's substantial enough to slow the spacecraft down to 750 miles an hour. Three minutes before landing comes the parachute. Mr. GOLDSTEIN: The parachute will open up, and that will decelerate us yet again quite a bit from there - will take is down to about 125 miles an hour. PALCA: Then, Phoenix cuts loose from the parachute and starts firing its landing engines. Mr. GOLDSTEIN: And the next 34 seconds, which is what we call terminal descent, go from approximately 125 miles and hour down to five miles an hour. PALCA: The last 100 feet or so will be at that gentle 5 miles an hour. Mr. GOLDSTEIN: And then we detect surface and we cut off our engines and let the dust settle, and we're on the ground. Everything will work fine. PALCA: If it sounds like there's a nervous catch in Goldstein's voice, it's understandable. Going from 12,000 miles an hour to a full stop in seven minutes means a lot of equipment has to work perfectly. Mr. GOLDSTEIN: A lot of people ask me what is going to give me the most terror, what am I most worried about the night of landing. PALCA: What Goldstein is most anxious about is something that happens just before the landing sequence starts. It's a command to turn on Phoenix's radio transmitter. Mr. GOLDSTEIN: And the reason is not because it's the most difficult. It's frankly one of the more simpler aspects of EDL. But once we have communication going, at least that part of my brain will know that at the very least, we are going to learn something from this mission. PALCA: The radio will transmit information about how the landing is going. And if something does go wrong, the signal should provide clues about what happened. A failure would be bad, but a failure with no data at all is totally frustrating. Assuming EDL is a success, Phoenix will be the first lander to explore the polar regions on Mars. Previous missions have all been closer to the equator. Mr. MICHAEL HECHT (Member, Phoenix Science Team, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory): The Mars of the equatorial regions of low latitude is a very ancient Mars. You see features there that were essentially unchanged for billions of years. PALCA: Michael Hecht is a member of the Phoenix Science Team. He's with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Hecht says there is water in the form of ice at the higher latitude near the poles, and there is clear evidence that the ice is changing the landscape. Mr. HECHT: So, what we're looking at at these latitudes are relatively recent processes. Now, that might mean they're millions of years old, but what makes them fundamentally different is that they're ongoing. PALCA: Hecht says Phoenix has instruments on board that can reveal some of the processes by measuring the minerals and elements that are in the soil and ice where the lander touches down. JPL's Deborah Bass is another member of the Phoenix Science Team. She says one thing the mission was not designed to do is look for life on Mars. Ms. DEBORAH BASS (Member, Phoenix Science Team, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory): Phoenix is looking for habitability - so, the likelihood of a location that's capable of supporting life rather than looking for life itself. Phoenix will not be looking for DNA, unfortunately. PALCA: That will have to wait for a future mission to Mars. Joe Palca, NPR News.  ARI SHAPIRO, host:   This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News.

I am Alex Chadwick. MADELEINE BRAND, host:  And I'm Madeleine Brand. Does this sound familiar? You forgot where you put your keys - the keys you just had in your hands. You can't remember the name of the movie you saw last night and that guy - oh, I've met him several times, what's his name again? Well Sue Halpern is here to talk about these types of memory lapses and the more serious ones, the ones that indicate Alzheimer's disease. She's the author of a new book. It's called \"Can't Remember What I Forgot, the Good News From the Frontlines of Memory Research. \" Sue Halpern, welcome to Day To Day. Dr. SUE HALPERN (Author, \"Can't Remember What I Forgot\"): Thank you. BRAND: Now you spent many years researching this book. You spoke to top researchers in the field of neuroscience. What started you on this journey?  Dr. HALPERN: Well, there were kind of two motivations. One was that it seemed to me like everyone I knew suddenly was worried about their memory, and I just kept on hearing people say, I'm having a senior moment or gosh, I can't remember that person's name; I must have early Alzheimer's. And it just became kind of dominant in the conversation almost like a cultural tic, and. . .  BRAND: Yeah. Dr. HALPERN: And then my dad got sick and he really did have serious memory problems, and that made me wonder why I wasn't worried and did I need to be worried.  BRAND: And so then did you get worried?  Dr. HALPERN: A little bit. I decided in order to really understand this, and also to understand the anxiety, I should put myself through the neuropsychological tests, which are six-hour batteries of paper and pencil tests, and then I wanted to get scanned in all the different ways you get scanned just to see what my brain looked like. Even though at the time when I was doing it, I wasn't sure I really did want to know what my brain looked like.  BRAND: What kind of things did they ask you on these tests?  Dr. HALPERN: All sorts of things. So they might tell you a story that was about a paragraph long, and then they would ask you to tell them all of the pertinent details, all the things that happened in the story, and then maybe 15 minutes later, they'd read you another story and they'd say, repeat the story back to us verbatim. Or they might give a long list of words and you have to tell them what they were and then alphabetize them 15 minutes later, or give you pictures to remember to draw from memory right away and then maybe a half an hour later you'd have to come back up with this image, which was very complicated. BRAND: That sounds really stressful. Dr. HALPERN: It was really stressful. (Soundbite of laughter) BRAND: So were you thinking the whole time, if I don't do well on this then I am going to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's or something grave? Dr. HALPERN: The funny thing about taking the tests is that after about the third hour, you get a sort of battle fatigue and you kind of give up and you think all right, whatever. I'm just going to get through this and at least for me, I stopped worrying about it about in hour three. I just thought whatever it is, it is. BRAND: Right. Dr. HALPERN: And I'll deal with it. (Soundbite of laughter) BRAND: You gave into it. Can the researchers tell after going through the results of these tests, can they tell pretty conclusively that you have a healthier brain or if you have some kind of illness after taking these tests? Dr. HALPERN: They actually can. These tests are pretty much as comprehensive as a brain scan. So they give you a really good picture of a person's brain because they're testing so many different parts of it, and they test it in such a way that you get compared to not like the general public, but you get compared to people like you. So for me, it was women between the ages of say, 45 and 50 who have, in my case, you know, graduate education. You know, they sort of make it so that the norm is the norm for people who are very much like yourself.  BRAND: What about someone who's not going to take these tests? Is there anything that they can see in their daily lives that they should pay attention to that may indicate some kind of beginnings of an illness?  Dr. HALPERN: There's a standard line that groups like the Alzheimer's Association say and the line is something like, if you misplace your keys, that's one thing, but if you forget what your keys are for, that's a disease. If you are looking at something and saying, like my Dad when he was sick, looked at a can opener and said something like, I know I know what this is for, but I don't know what it's for. That is very problematic. If you find yourself getting lost a lot, you know, really disoriented, that's a problem. BRAND: You interviewed lots and lots of people, experts on this and maybe you could just tell us what they know about why we lose our memory and when we begin to lose it and really, if there is anything to be done about it.  Dr. HALPERN: Everybody starts to lose memory pretty early on. I mean really, starting in your 20s, and that just continues. And there are physiological reasons for that. Parts of your brain are not functioning as efficiently as they had. Your brain becomes somewhat hypometabolic. It slows down. Some of the neurotransmitters are not there with as much volume as they had been. And there's this other thing that happens that's really interesting, which is that your brain starts to produce neurons in a kind of slower way. So you've always been producing new neurons throughout your whole life, but that production starts to slow down. And there's a theory that the slowing down of that production is the thing that is causing, among other things, the things that are causing normal memory loss.  And so to answer the other part of your question, it looks like physical exercise, like aerobic exercise, actually increases the production of new neurons in the brain - and particularly in the very part of your brain where your short-term memory resides. One of the studies I liked the best is one that shows that people who do social dancing - you know, ballroom dancing or contra dancing - tend to be those who, you know, when push comes to shove get dementia less. And I think the reason is because it has a social component, it has a physical active component, and it has an intellectual and it has a spatial component. So it has all these things going on at once. So it exercises sort of every part of our being while it's happening.  BRAND: And what are scientists telling you? I mean, your subtitle of your book is \"The Good News From the Frontlines of Memory Research. \" Are they saying they expect to find a cure for Alzheimer's anytime soon? Dr. HALPERN: Yeah, they do, actually. That sounds kind of unlikely, but the fact is that even in the course of the time that I was working on the book, things changed radically. Diagnostics got so much better. To the point where there are tests now that can show Alzheimer's disease nine years before there are ever symptomatic. The other thing that happened when I was working on the book is they were able to distinguish in the brain precisely where Alzheimer's begins versus normal memory loss. And that's important because - so in order to get a really good drug, you have to find the target and then you aim at it, and you have a much better chance of hitting it. That's all brand new. So, you know, a lot is happening, and it's happening from so many different angles that I think the optimism is completely justified.  BRAND: Sue Halperin, thanks a lot. Dr. HALPERN: Thank you.

MIKE PESCA, host: I've heard. MARTIN: A lot.  PESCA: Hm. MARTIN: But they don't usually kill you. But doctors in several western states who treat these bites say, in recent year, deaths from rattlesnake bites actually appear to be going up. Now, there isn't enough data to say why or even to confirm a larger trend. That hasn't stopped us from talking about this. Frankly, the news stories totally creeped us out, and we wanted to learn more. We've got Russ Johnson on the line. He's president of the Phoenix Herpetological Society. He is also a self-described lover of snakes, even though he's been bitten badly. We'll talk about that in a moment. Russ, hey, thanks for joining us. Mr. RUSS JOHNSON (President, Phoenix Herpetological Society): Good morning, Rachel. How are you? MARTIN: We're doing just fine. So, there has been some speculation that venom in the snakes is actually getting stronger, and this is in part responsible for what some are saying could be an increase in deaths. You're skeptical of this, huh? Mr. JOHNSON: Way more than skeptical. (Soundbite of laughter) PESCA: Dismissive? Mr. JOHNSON: Pardon me? PESCA: Dismissive, even? Mr. JOHNSON: Yes. You know, this thing started on Yahoo! venom list by a moderator who is a self-proscribed - he considers himself quite knowledgeable about this, and I've talked to four experts on this, and all of them have basically not given any credibility to this issue at all. MARTIN: What - why do you think - if this isn't credible, what are people pointing to? I mean, is there any - can there be any logical explanation? Mr. JOHNSON: Yes, there is. And you know, first of all, some of the data that I got from the poison control center yesterday in Tucson from Jude McNally is that a number of the people that have been bitten here in the western states are people that have moved here and are retirees. And one of the vulnerable categories of persons in - on a bite are either the very, very young, like small children, older people, or somebody who is in ill health.  And we get a lot of senior citizens out here, that have moved out here, and they get to either hiking, or they love gardening. And they're trimming their bushes without looking underneath, and they're being bit. And they are at a higher risk of mortality than a younger person in good health. MARTIN: So it's attributed to demographic changes, really. Mr. JOHNSON: Yes, very much so. And then, plus, we're also - here in Arizona, we are building out extensively. So where we're building homes further and further out in the desert, there's getting to be more and more incursions with snakes. The reason being is the last three years, we've had pretty decent water, which means the rodent crop and grass crop has been up, which means there's been a lot more snakes and a higher rate of survival in the baby rattlesnakes, which are maturing. So where - odds are, you're just going to run into one because of the successful survival rate the last three years. MARTIN: Now, some of this, some people are pointing to this idea that maybe venom is getting stronger. How do you even go about proving or disproving that? How do you measure the potency of venom? Mr. JOHNSON: Well, that's actually pretty simple. It is an extensive test, but it's called the LD50, which is lethal dose for 50 kilograms. And what they do is they take various venoms, and they extract it and inject it into, unfortunately, some type of rodent or something else like that, and it says how long it takes them to kill it.  If it kills it quicker than it has in the past, then yes, you have a higher toxicity. But you know, there are several other factors that are basically responsible for this at this time now other than that. But there is not even on the horizon, with any of the doctors that do this, this is not even a topic of discussion, because they don't believe that this by any means is happening. MARTIN: OK. Let's talk about what happens when you're bitten. You have endured this twice, I understand, once pretty severely. What happened? Mr. JOHNSON: Yeah, in 2001, I - both times just - I categorize as I made a mistake. And you know, when you're working with venomous, you cannot make a mistake. You cannot get in a hurry. I was drawing blood on an animal. It's in a restraining tube. And what happened was, as I withdrew the blood, I realized that the snake's head was able to move around too much in the tube. And I should have put it down and got another tube. Instead, I reached over and bent forward to do that. And when I did so, it gave just enough flex for it to turn around, get its head out, and latch onto my finger. MARTIN: And it's painful? Mr. JOHNSON: Oh, God, it is - the bad bite I received in 2001 was like being electrocuted and burned at the same time.  MARTIN: Ooh! Mr. JOHNSON: And it was incessant. I was three days in the ICU. And to be honest with you, the pain on the first day, I slept a total of five minutes, and they were giving me massive doses of Fentanyl, which is actually more powerful than morphine, and it did not even take the edge off the pain. PESCA: Did you feel it literally coursing through your body, as it's said? Mr. JOHNSON: Absolutely, Mike. I've got to be honest with you. I've received severe bites. As the venom flowed through the body, I could actually tell you where, at any given point in time, where it was in my body.  PESCA: Oh, my. Mr. JOHNSON: It felt like the tide coming in. And then just, unfortunately, what it boils down to is it feels like the tide comes in more rapidly near the end. And as it reaches further and further in your body, and then, basically, what it - it just doesn't quit until it is dispersed far enough through your body where you body starts taking over and dilutes it. The anti-venom stops the tissue degradation, but the drugs are supposed to help you with the pain. And, on a bad bite, I don't care who you are, you are going to be extremely uncomfortable. PESCA: That's it. Getting bit by a rattlesnake is now off my list of life experiences. Mr. JOHNSON: You know, it's one I'd pass on again. I've broken eight bones in my body, and I would rather break all eight again at the same time than go through that again, to be honest with you. MARTIN: Oh, yes or no answer. Like it does - like we see in the movies, Russ, should we suck the venom out if we're bitten? Mr. JOHNSON: Absolutely not. MARTIN: OK, there you have it. Russ Johnson, president of the Phoenix Herpetological Society. Thank you, Russ, for your insight and your safety tips. We appreciate it. Mr. JOHNSON: OK, thank you. MARTIN: One safety tip Russ did not mention because, well, it's kind of common sense. If you want to avoid bites, do not, I repeat, do not compete in contest where the goal is to get 10 live rattlesnakes into a sack as fast as possible. Regular listeners to the BPP may remember our conversations with a man who repeatedly ignores this advice. His name is Jackie Bibby, and he's the best in the world at the sport of rattlesnake-sacking. Jackie told us about the hazards of competition. Mr. JACKIE BIBBY (Rattlesnake-Sacker Champion): I've been doing this for 40 years, and I've been bit eight times seriously enough to require hospitalization. One of the worst bites I ever received, I received on Saturday, and I wouldn't go to the hospital 'til after I completed the contest on Sunday, because I was winning. (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: Sorry. I know it - he's just so hardcore. Rattlesnake-sacking champion, Jackie Bibby, on the BPP in April. And again, a dangerous sport. We are not recommending trying rattlesnake-sacking. PESCA: I would say it even stretches the definition of sport.  PESCA: I would say it even stretches the definition of sport.  MARTIN: He would argue with you. It is - it's a sport. PESCA: He'd argue with me, and then a fair-minded observer would say, one guy has gotten bit a lot by rattlesnakes and one guy tries to avoid getting bit by rattlesnakes. Who should we listen to? MARTIN: We're a balanced show, so we bring both voices to the table at the BPP. PESCA: Right. This is the crossfire between the rattlesnake-bited and the un-bited.  (Soundbite of laughter) PESCA: Because we should all have opinions that we listen to, exactly. MARTIN: Stay with us. Coming up next on the show, a hockey house divided, Carly Cosaleno (ph)? - Colenso? I'm sorry, Carly - is a Red Wings fan, Joe Ott, her husband, is a Penguins guy. PESCA: Ott, it's pronounced Ott. MARTIN: We'll check in with them - thanks - to see how their marriage is holding up as their teams duke it out for the Stanley Cup. PESCA: This is the Bryant Park Project from NPR News.  RACHEL MARTIN, host:  I don't know if you know this, Mike, but rattlesnake bites hurt.  MIKE PESCA, host:  I've heard.  MARTIN: A lot.   PESCA: Hm.  MARTIN: But they don't usually kill you. But doctors in several western states who treat these bites say, in recent year, deaths from rattlesnake bites actually appear to be going up. Now, there isn't enough data to say why or even to confirm a larger trend. That hasn't stopped us from talking about this. Frankly, the news stories totally creeped us out, and we wanted to learn more. We've got Russ Johnson on the line. He's president of the Phoenix Herpetological Society. He is also a self-described lover of snakes, even though he's been bitten badly. We'll talk about that in a moment. Russ, hey, thanks for joining us.  Mr. RUSS JOHNSON (President, Phoenix Herpetological Society): Good morning, Rachel. How are you?  MARTIN: We're doing just fine. So, there has been some speculation that venom in the snakes is actually getting stronger, and this is in part responsible for what some are saying could be an increase in deaths. You're skeptical of this, huh?  Mr. JOHNSON: Way more than skeptical.  (Soundbite of laughter)  PESCA: Dismissive?  Mr. JOHNSON: Pardon me?  PESCA: Dismissive, even?  Mr. JOHNSON: Yes. You know, this thing started on Yahoo! venom list by a moderator who is a self-proscribed - he considers himself quite knowledgeable about this, and I've talked to four experts on this, and all of them have basically not given any credibility to this issue at all.  MARTIN: What - why do you think - if this isn't credible, what are people pointing to? I mean, is there any - can there be any logical explanation?  Mr. JOHNSON: Yes, there is. And you know, first of all, some of the data that I got from the poison control center yesterday in Tucson from Jude McNally is that a number of the people that have been bitten here in the western states are people that have moved here and are retirees. And one of the vulnerable categories of persons in - on a bite are either the very, very young, like small children, older people, or somebody who is in ill health.   And we get a lot of senior citizens out here, that have moved out here, and they get to either hiking, or they love gardening. And they're trimming their bushes without looking underneath, and they're being bit. And they are at a higher risk of mortality than a younger person in good health.  MARTIN: So it's attributed to demographic changes, really.  Mr. JOHNSON: Yes, very much so. And then, plus, we're also - here in Arizona, we are building out extensively. So where we're building homes further and further out in the desert, there's getting to be more and more incursions with snakes. The reason being is the last three years, we've had pretty decent water, which means the rodent crop and grass crop has been up, which means there's been a lot more snakes and a higher rate of survival in the baby rattlesnakes, which are maturing. So where - odds are, you're just going to run into one because of the successful survival rate the last three years.

ALEX CHADWICK, Host: Back now with Day to Day. \"Project Nim\" at Colombia University back in the 1970s sought to discover if a chimpanzee could learn to communicate in American Sign Language. The chimp actually lived with an American family on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Well, now there's a new book about Nim and some of the family members who raised him are talking about the ethics of what they did. NPR's Margot Adler has the story. MARGOT ADLER: Jenny Lee, Nim's surrogate sister remembers the day Nim came to live with her family. She was 10. JENNY LEE: He was coming off the plane with my mom, wrapped up in baby blankets and he was this tiny newborn being who happened to be a chimp. And it was probably love at first sight. ADLER: Nim Chimpsky is a pun on Noam Chomsky, the MIT linguist who has theorized that language as we know it is unique to humans. \"Project Nim\" hoped to disprove Chomsky, to show that a chimpanzee could develop language. The project was run by Colombia University psychologist, Herbert Terrace. HERBERT TERRACE: Everybody agrees that words are learned one at a time. But that syntax seems to emerge spontaneously. So the question is what would them do? ADLER: He chose Stephanie LeFarge to be Nim's surrogate mother. For LeFarge who was studying psychology it was thrilling. She says a chimp is five times as strong as a human being, yet its touch is unbelievably gentle. STEPHANIE LEFARGE: I wasn't even aware of what the role of chimpanzee - mother, surrogate mother would be. It was to have this body attached to you for almost two years, period. ADLER: And that's what she did. She raised this chimp like a child, including it in her sprawling, chaotic blended family, along with seven kids. Jenny Lee says it was kind of nutty. LEE: Well, you're making you know, sloppy joes for seven kids or two kids, and who is doing the dishes. And, were you sharing the room that night or were you not. ADLER: Raising a chimp in a human family might raise questions now. But 35 years ago a lot less was known about chimpanzees. Bob Ingersoll was a graduate student working at the Institute in Oklahoma, where Nim was born. BOB INGERSOLL: From the 1975 perspective it didn't seem misguided at all, you know. I mean, handing out chimp babies to just about anyone that wanted one. And that gives you a kind of understanding of how little we knew. ADLER: Soon Nim was breaking things all over the house. Stephanie LeFarge's husband was never comfortable with Nim. Finally, Herbert Terrace put Nim in a different home. Nim learned about 125 signs, but was he really learning language? One day watching a video of Nim signing with a teacher, Terrace says he had an epiphany. TERRACE: Nim was tracking most of the teacher signs, imitating most of the teacher signs. He almost never made a sign spontaneously. ADLER: Terrace came to believe that Nim would never use language the way humans do; to form sentences and express ideas. That was the end of the project. Nim was returned to the research institute in Norman, Oklahoma, to live a very different life, in a cage with other chimps. But Bob Ingersoll says his life wasn't a bad one. INGERSOLL: In the sense that he was with his own brothers, he got to have a chimp group that wasn't necessarily always controlled by humans. ADLER: But in 1981, all funding ended for the institute. There was no exit plan for the chimps. Within a year Nim was sold to a medical lab for tuberculosis studies. Nim's supporters managed to rescue him. He was taken to Cleveland Amory's Black Beauty Ranch in Texas. An animal sanctuary where Nim died in the year 2000. Jenny Lee, Nim's surrogate sister was in college when Nim was taken to the medical lab. How do you reconcile, she says, a tiny chimp in blue baby blankets, drinking from a bottle and wearing Pampers? LEE: Those are the baby pictures and then when he's 10, him in the lab, in a cage, with nothing soft, nothing warm, no people, you know. This is my brother, this is somebody that I raised and that the system could let this happen was shocking. ADLER: Stephanie LeFarge, Nim's surrogate mother, says today she believes that taking Nim into her home was totally unethical. LEFARGE: Essentially tricking him into thinking he's a human being with no plan whatsoever of protecting him. TERRACE: I don't think what we've done to Nim was unethical. ADLER: Says Herbert Terrace. Given that people eat meat, have pets, train horses to race. Elizabeth Hess interviewed all these people and many more for her book \"Nim Chimpsky: The Chimp Who Would Be Human. \" She says Nim was an amazing survivor. She says \"Project Nim,\" would never happen today, and the debate over the project continues. ELIZABETH HESS: Whether chimps have language or don't have language and what is their own language? The surprising thing is how little we know about how animals communicate. ADLER: Researchers today she says, are looking at how prairie dogs warn each other, how birds know where to fly, they're asking a better question. How do animals communicate?

It's become a popular psychology tool. Talk therapists of all varieties are encouraging patients to try meditation to help them manage flash floods of emotions during a therapeutic process. The National Institutes of Health is financing about 50 studies to learn whether meditation techniques do, in fact, help things like stress, addiction, depression, hot flashes, and the propensity to buy Bowflex systems off the TV at night. I made that last one up.  So we learned all this stuff this week from a New York Times story we ripped from the headlines. It's a little easier than doing the work ourselves. We - I guess we outsourced it to New York Times reporter Ben Carey, who joins us now to talk about his story, \"Lotus Therapy. \" Hey, Ben. Mr. BEN CAREY (Reporter, New York Times): Hello. PESCA: So, you know, was I practicing therapy there without a license there when I was describing how mindfulness meditation works? Just clearing your head and only noticing your breath? Is that about it? Mr. CAREY: It's pretty bare-bones stuff, and I think that, of course, has been around a lot longer than therapy and pretty accessible to anyone. So I think it could be allowed to describe it in that way. It's pretty close. PESCA: And how does it work as a therapeutic tool? Mr. CAREY: Well, I mean, it's used in a whole different bunch of ways, like, for example, one of the most promising ways is to prevent relapse in depression for serious depression. And so what they try to do there is get the person to essentially practice, you know, the pretty basic meditative technique, and once they feel they've sort of mastered the basics then they encourage them to, in effect, sort of let themselves feel, you know, sort of troubling emotions or sort of look at a sort of a soured relationship. And the idea is when you're in this meditative state you kind of just observe this effect on you kind of without fighting it, without trying to, you know, rationalize it or change it or whatever, and you kind of let the feeling pass. PESCA: Well, that's the idea. So what's the evidence that it works? Mr. CAREY: Well, there's not a lot of evidence yet. There are a couple studies that have come out of a group that's centered in Toronto that show that, you know, if you incorporate this into some therapy for relapse prevention with people with depression, if they've had three or more, it does seem to cut the risk that they'll relapse again. However, for people who have only had one or two relapses, it's not clear that it's helping them. It might even be making them a little worse than what's happening there. But anyway - so that's still - but it's still early. You know, they're looking at this, and like you say, you know, the NIH is interested in this for a whole bunch of different things. PESCA: Why would it be harmful? Why would it make it worse? Just that it's not - the underlying problem's not being treated in another way? Mr. CAREY: Well, no. I mean, that's possible, because you're sitting there, you know, meditating and you're not getting any other kind of therapy, but you know, I mean, it's not always a good idea for people who, you know, have mental issues to have them sort of sit with their mental issues. RACHEL MARTIN, host: Sit with their thoughts. PESCA: Yeah. Simmer. Mr. CAREY: Yeah. So you simmer, or they call it rumination, you know, whatever. I mean, so, this might work for some people. You and I might be able to sit there sort of guru-like and watch, you know, our troubles pass before our eyes, but someone else, essentially, if they're in the middle of an acute problem, might just make it worse and they get nothing out of it. PESCA: To try to understand what mindful meditation was I went to Wikipedia. First, I tried Googling it and other ways, but I guess my non Zen-like brain couldn't understand tons of these descriptions on these Zen sites and these meditation sites. It kind of seemed like gobbledygook to me. So I went to Wikipedia, not Buddhapedia (ph), and there's a description there, but tell me how well this nails it. Mr. CAREY: OK. PESCA: Quote, \"One is free to release a thought, let it go. When one realizes that the thought may not be concrete reality or absolute truth, thus one is free to observe life without getting caught in the commentary. \" Is that about right? Mr. CAREY: You know, you could. . . PESCA: And that's the non-gobbledygook version. Mr. CAREY: You know, you're just being so western about this, basically. PESCA: Yeah, I know. Mr. CAREY: It's pretty close. I mean, so. . . MARTIN: Non-attachment. It's about non-attachment. Mr. CAREY: I'm looking at this from the - it's pretty close. I mean, you really - that's it. They want you to sort of be in the moment. Now, just excuse that phrase and, you know, that's a phrase like \"inner child,\" where people just sort of snort when they hear it. PESCA: I snorted. I just snorted. I don't know if you could hear that. Sorry.  Mr. CAREY: Well, you did, anyways. So the idea is to, you know, relax, you know, sort of really concentrate on your sensations, your breathing, be in the moment, just sort of - and if you try this and you practice this, you do kind of get into a different kind of state, which I did, by the way, when I was doing this story. PESCA: That's good reporting. And was that the first time you tried it? Mr. CAREY: Oh, yeah. No. This is not - I have no cultural connection with this kind of stuff, but it was the first time I tried it. So you get into this, and then you're supposed to sort of just watch without judgment sort of what happens as you're sitting there, and so that's just it, really. There's not a lot more to say about it. MARTIN: But the danger's that when you start thinking about nothing, and especially if you're a reporter, and then you're analyzing your non-thinking-ness. PESCA: And the danger is you're paying a therapist how much money to do that? Mr. CAREY: Well, you know, keep in mind a couple things. Number one, yes, thinking about not thinking, as a reporter, you're definitely wasting deadline time on something like this, but you know, usually it's incorporated into other therapy. Well, like, you know, therapies like cognitive therapies, for example, which is a very common sort of answer for depression, where they try to reshape people's assumptions and thoughts. . . MARTIN: It can augment therapies. It's not a therapy in and of itself. Mr. CAREY: No. It's usually part of - that's part of a therapy. Yeah. And so they would teach it to you as a technique, and in some cases, in some people who work with very troubled people, you know, I mean, they're just kicked around by, you know, their anxieties and their memories so much that - I mean, they can't sit still practically. And so, you need to figure out a way of getting them just to tolerate, you know, sort of what their internal psychology is turning. PESCA: Yes. Mr. CAREY: And so that just makes it a supplement to usually a broader approach to, you know, solving a problem. PESCA: Got it. Ben Carey of the New York Times, thank you and thanks for that article. Mr. CAREY: Sure. MARTIN: Stay with us. Coming up, San Francisco dump, the artist in residence. Curious? Stay with us. We'll talk about it. This is the BPP from NPR News.  (Soundbite of people meditating)  MIKE PESCA, host:  Mindfulness meditation, closing your eyes, clearing your head of all thoughts, and only noticing how you feel as you breathe in and out. It's become a popular psychology tool. Talk therapists of all varieties are encouraging patients to try meditation to help them manage flash floods of emotions during a therapeutic process. The National Institutes of Health is financing about 50 studies to learn whether meditation techniques do, in fact, help things like stress, addiction, depression, hot flashes, and the propensity to buy Bowflex systems off the TV at night. I made that last one up.   So we learned all this stuff this week from a New York Times story we ripped from the headlines. It's a little easier than doing the work ourselves. We - I guess we outsourced it to New York Times reporter Ben Carey, who joins us now to talk about his story, \"Lotus Therapy. \" Hey, Ben.  Mr. BEN CAREY (Reporter, New York Times): Hello.  PESCA: So, you know, was I practicing therapy there without a license there when I was describing how mindfulness meditation works? Just clearing your head and only noticing your breath? Is that about it?  Mr. CAREY: It's pretty bare-bones stuff, and I think that, of course, has been around a lot longer than therapy and pretty accessible to anyone. So I think it could be allowed to describe it in that way. It's pretty close.  PESCA: And how does it work as a therapeutic tool?  Mr. CAREY: Well, I mean, it's used in a whole different bunch of ways, like, for example, one of the most promising ways is to prevent relapse in depression for serious depression. And so what they try to do there is get the person to essentially practice, you know, the pretty basic meditative technique, and once they feel they've sort of mastered the basics then they encourage them to, in effect, sort of let themselves feel, you know, sort of troubling emotions or sort of look at a sort of a soured relationship. And the idea is when you're in this meditative state you kind of just observe this effect on you kind of without fighting it, without trying to, you know, rationalize it or change it or whatever, and you kind of let the feeling pass.  PESCA: Well, that's the idea. So what's the evidence that it works?  Mr. CAREY: Well, there's not a lot of evidence yet. There are a couple studies that have come out of a group that's centered in Toronto that show that, you know, if you incorporate this into some therapy for relapse prevention with people with depression, if they've had three or more, it does seem to cut the risk that they'll relapse again. However, for people who have only had one or two relapses, it's not clear that it's helping them. It might even be making them a little worse than what's happening there. But anyway - so that's still - but it's still early. You know, they're looking at this, and like you say, you know, the NIH is interested in this for a whole bunch of different things.  PESCA: Why would it be harmful? Why would it make it worse? Just that it's not - the underlying problem's not being treated in another way?  Mr. CAREY: Well, no. I mean, that's possible, because you're sitting there, you know, meditating and you're not getting any other kind of therapy, but you know, I mean, it's not always a good idea for people who, you know, have mental issues to have them sort of sit with their mental issues.  RACHEL MARTIN, host:  Sit with their thoughts.  PESCA: Yeah. Simmer.  Mr. CAREY: Yeah. So you simmer, or they call it rumination, you know, whatever. I mean, so, this might work for some people. You and I might be able to sit there sort of guru-like and watch, you know, our troubles pass before our eyes, but someone else, essentially, if they're in the middle of an acute problem, might just make it worse and they get nothing out of it.  PESCA: To try to understand what mindful meditation was I went to Wikipedia. First, I tried Googling it and other ways, but I guess my non Zen-like brain couldn't understand tons of these descriptions on these Zen sites and these meditation sites. It kind of seemed like gobbledygook to me. So I went to Wikipedia, not Buddhapedia (ph), and there's a description there, but tell me how well this nails it.  Mr. CAREY: OK.  PESCA: Quote, \"One is free to release a thought, let it go. When one realizes that the thought may not be concrete reality or absolute truth, thus one is free to observe life without getting caught in the commentary. \" Is that about right?  Mr. CAREY: You know, you could. . .  PESCA: And that's the non-gobbledygook version.  Mr. CAREY: You know, you're just being so western about this, basically.  PESCA: Yeah, I know.  Mr. CAREY: It's pretty close. I mean, so. . .  MARTIN: Non-attachment. It's about non-attachment.  Mr. CAREY: I'm looking at this from the - it's pretty close. I mean, you really - that's it.

MIKE PESCA, host: It was my worst subject, actually. MARTIN: Was it? That surprises me. I kind of think of you as a science guy. PESCA: I liked math. MARTIN: You liked math. PESCA: Which is the actual application of the abstract into the real world.  MARTIN: Well, I was one of those people in college, I - you know, I was OK in science, but I didn't love it, and so when I saw on the curriculum that I could sign up for something called Science in Context - that was actually a requirement in my college, the specific course was Physics for Poets - I said yes, that is the class for me, and it was a great class. To this day, putting science in context really makes a difference. We read this book, \"The Making of the Atomic Bomb,\" and - so you have this narrative of making the bomb, but it comes - you learn history, and art, and music, and it really makes the thing stick in your brain. PESCA: I read that book, it was - it won the Pulitzer for best work of history for Richard Rhodes.  MARTIN: It's a great book, Richard Rhodes.  PESCA: I didn't know that counted as science. So, yeah, I'm good at science.  MARTIN: Totally, you're totally good at science. PESCA: Oh, man, I'm good at reading books. MARTIN: The whole world I - in my - Rachel Martin's world is divided into people who take real science classes, and people who take physics for poets. Now, if you fall into that second camp like me, and you happen to be in New York over the next few days, we have got your weekend plans. We've got them all laid out. Why? Because the first ever World Science Festival is happening here in New York, and this is an entire five-day event devoted to doing just that, putting science in context using art, music, dance, literature, dialogue and debate.  And here's a sampling of some of the offerings, a \"mathemagician\" - didn't even know there was such a thing - entertains with feats of mathematical gymnastics, while explaining how he does it. Nobel Laureates will be on hand fielding questions from high-school students on the nuts and bolts on the universe. If that doesn't grab you, how about sonic juggling or an exploration of the wonderful weirdness of the quantum world? My curiosity is sufficiently piqued. PESCA: Piqued.  MARTIN: Now is the time when we bring in - we are so lucky to have him - NPR's own Robert Krulwich, esteemed science correspondence. He is also the co-host of WNYC's Radio Lab. He himself is a participant in this week's World Science Festival. He joins me on the line now. Hi, Robert. ROBERT KRULWICH: Hi there, Rachel, Mike. PESCA: Hey. MARTIN: Thanks for doing this. So, in a moment I want to talk specifically about what you are going to be presenting at the festival, but first, let's talk about the festival itself. These goals, as we said in the intro, are to try to make science more accessible. How are they trying to do that? KRULWICH: Well, they went way back in history, so it was - maybe you read about in one of those books in your science class, they went back to 1820-something, when, in London, the great scientists of the day would leave their labs and walk down to probably the big stage downtown, just south of Hyde Park, and they would do theatrical presentations of their work in front of anybody who wanted to come, and everybody wanted to come, the great poets of the day, the lords, the ladies, the shopkeepers.  Everybody seemed to show up at these things, and there was a fellow named Sir Humphrey Davies who would do dramatic science experiments using electricity. Things would go off, there would be explosions, stink bombs, and the whole town was completely fascinated, because electricity had been discovered in the previous century by Ben Franklin, but no one quite knew what to do with it, and no one quite understood how it worked, and so that and chemistry were the big hits. People would pour things into other things, and the whole town would go, whoa, you know, and so it was a big deal and it reached everyone.  And then about 150 years later, the city of Genoa in Italy decided to do a modern-day version of this. They invite scientists from all over the world to come to Genoa for two weeks. If you are - it's a big industrial city in northern Italy, and if you live there, and you are walking to work, or you're walking home, or you're taking Sunday in the park in that town, you bump into scientists who are sitting doing things, talking, showing films. There are dance recitals and so forth, and it's all over town.  And you could have gotten three C-minuses in a row in your grade school, high school and college chemistry and you never want to think about it. But in Genoa for those two weeks, you keep bumping into scientists, and science enthusiasts, and science homage-ists (ph), artists dancing, and stuff. And it is all around you, and that was the idea that Brian Green and Tracy Day wanted to bring to New York City. MARTIN: Those are the founders and it really is about - that you referenced the bumping into. I mean a lot of times people think about science, and scientists, and researchers in labs coats in sterile environments, in ivy towers, and don't realize that science is everywhere. It's everywhere in your life on a daily basis. KRULWICH: Right. And the New York festival is - this is the first year that there's trying to see if it can be in a whole lot of places, so that when you go to the park, or when you, particularly if you happen to be in Greenwich Village, which is in the middle of Lower Manhattan, you will see an awful lot of things going on, and that's the notion. MARTIN: I want to get right to what you are going to be presenting. You and Oliver Sacks, who is a renowned neurologist and author, you two are hosting a presentation on the intersection of vision and perception. It's - the title of the presentation is called \"The Mind's Eye. \" Can you give us a little sneak peak, Robert, about what you're going to share with the audience? KRULWICH: Yeah, sure. That's a very fancy-dancy way of saying it, but it's - Oliver's going to talk about his - the cancer that he has in his right eye. A few years ago he was at the movies, he's - actually it was \"Brokeback Mountain,\" (unintelligible). He just slipped in, sat in the back row and got ready for the movie, and before the movie began, during one of the previews, there was some sudden explosion of light in his right eye, the corner of his right eye. And he couldn't figure out what it was. It was very, very distracting and it was just a like - it was a little bit like fireworks in the upper right corner, and it got worse, and worse, and he thought to himself, what is going on? MARTIN: Yeah. KRULWICH: And then, he was - I think two hours after the movie ended, he was at the doctor's, and he was diagnosed with a retinal cancer. And he, because he is a doctor and very much a clinician, he began drawing what he was seeing through his eye in about now 27 notebooks. So, I went through the notebooks, and I found some of the more mysterious drawings. What we are going to do, is we're going to listen to Oliver Sacks talk about the progress of his disease.  He has always been one of those people who, when he meets people who are sick, or who are strangely sick, or who are chronically ill, and who are stuck in a very different place than the rest of us, he has always been the guy who describes them so beautifully and so emphatically, that you begin to think about them as just people, instead of other kind of, oh, oh, I don't want to get too near that guy. MARTIN: Uh-huh. PESCA: Or his patients. . . KRULWICH: Or his patients. PESCA: Or some victims, or something like that. KRULWICH: So, now it's happened to him, he can't correct the problem. It's not going to kill him apparently, because a small attempt was made to try to make the cancer die, but it's still there, but it is very stable, and retinal cancers don't tend to break up and go into your blood system or your lymph nodes and metastasize. So, he has beat it, but he's lost, at this point, the sight in his right eye, so. . . MARTIN: What does it mean, Robert, in the write-up for your presentation, it says that people who are blind can be hyper-visual. Can you explain that? KRULWICH: When people who have seen go blind, their brain, the part of the brain that was devoted to processing visual information, has nothing to do. You've got all these neurons up there that used to be receiving information, and turning it into pictures in your head. Now they are pretty much unemployed and the brain cells are very active, and when those cells in your head have nothing to do, they just make stuff up. PESCA: Uh-huh. KRULWICH: So, blind people often hallucinate, oftentimes with patterns, sometimes with people, you know very vivid, techno - sorry, very, very clear movie-style people in their heads. And they think, of course, they are going completely bats. But they are not. All that's happening is their brain is making it up, and creating sort of brain fantasies in their head. Oliver has that in a modest sort of way. MARTIN: Mm. KRULWICH: He's been trying to learn how to play the piano, and he has now been looking with his good eye at notes, musical notes, and his hallucinatory part for some reason takes hundreds of notes off of musical sheets, always flat, for some reason, so you can see the staff, they're flat - it's flat notes and they rain. He has raining flat musical notations in his head.  MARTIN: Weird. PESCA: Is this hyper-visual phenomenon - do they know if it's anything like the phantom-limb phenomenon? KRULWICH: It's exactly like the phantom-limb phenomenon. Yes, you - when your brain loses something, loses an input, so if someone chops off your arm, then the part of your brain that receives arm information has nothing to do, and might create a pretend arm. And when you lose hearing, your part of your brain that deals with hearing makes up sounds that you aren't hearing, but it pretends that you are, and the same with sight. Brains don't like to be put out of work. PESCA: Does Oliver like his hyper-visualism? Because sometimes people with phantom limbs experience phantom limb pain. KRULWICH: Yeah, that, of course - you know that's what I'm going to ask, he. . . MARTIN: Have to go to the presentation, Mike. (Soundbite of laughter) PESCA: Are you saying, I thought of the same question, Robert? KRULWICH: I don't know, that's the question I want to ask. MARTIN: You can use that. PESCA: Yeah. MARTIN: And finally, Robert, I want to ask you, so much of the work that you do is devoted to this very topic, making science interesting, making science accessible, and you use the word \"wonder\" a lot, getting people to realize the wonder involved in science. How do you do that? What's the key to helping people rediscover the wonder? KRULWICH: Well, I just think if you have it in yourself, you know, if you - both my sister and I, I don't quite know how this happened in our family, but we both can walk down the street and what happens between us is like, look at that (unintelligible), oh, my God. There's a lot of that all the time, and so you just turn it into a job. (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: And why - I guess, lastly, why do people get freaked out about science, do you think? KRULWICH: Oh, because it scares them and they don't think they will ever understand it, and it seems kind as like, you know, language, either fancy words or mathematics that they don't get. So, everybody, everybody, when they are little, loves to think about animals, and alternate worlds, and where you come from, and where we are we going.  But when the vocabulary gets too tough, they think, well, I guess that's not for me. But I think it's the job of people who can understand this best to talk to people in terms that they can understand and then everybody's back in. In theory, very, very easy to get excited about this, if you can understand what people are talking about. MARTIN: Yes, and you are a very good translator between those two worlds. NPR's science correspondent, Robert Krulwich. The World Science Festival is happening in New York. Robert's going to be panelist. Hey, Mr. Krulwich, thanks very much for joining us. We appreciate it. KRULWICH: You're very welcome. PESCA: Thanks, Robert. KRULWICH: Thanks, Mike. (Soundbite of music) PESCA: And Modern Drunkard, Cat Fancy, Guns and Ammo, all magazines and this guy read them all. Peter Carlson is retiring as the author of the magazine Reader Column in the Washington Post. He will tell us all about his glossy career. And the good thing is, when we do the interview, those little insert cards won't fall into your lap. This is the Bryant Park Project from NPR News.

It's not going to kill him apparently, because a small attempt was made to try to make the cancer die, but it's still there, but it is very stable, and retinal cancers don't tend to break up and go into your blood system or your lymph nodes and metastasize. So, he has beat it, but he's lost, at this point, the sight in his right eye, so. . .  MARTIN: What does it mean, Robert, in the write-up for your presentation, it says that people who are blind can be hyper-visual. Can you explain that?  KRULWICH: When people who have seen go blind, their brain, the part of the brain that was devoted to processing visual information, has nothing to do. You've got all these neurons up there that used to be receiving information, and turning it into pictures in your head. Now they are pretty much unemployed and the brain cells are very active, and when those cells in your head have nothing to do, they just make stuff up.  PESCA: Uh-huh.  KRULWICH: So, blind people often hallucinate, oftentimes with patterns, sometimes with people, you know very vivid, techno - sorry, very, very clear movie-style people in their heads. And they think, of course, they are going completely bats. But they are not. All that's happening is their brain is making it up, and creating sort of brain fantasies in their head. Oliver has that in a modest sort of way.  MARTIN: Mm.  KRULWICH: He's been trying to learn how to play the piano, and he has now been looking with his good eye at notes, musical notes, and his hallucinatory part for some reason takes hundreds of notes off of musical sheets, always flat, for some reason, so you can see the staff, they're flat - it's flat notes and they rain. He has raining flat musical notations in his head.   MARTIN: Weird.  PESCA: Is this hyper-visual phenomenon - do they know if it's anything like the phantom-limb phenomenon?  KRULWICH: It's exactly like the phantom-limb phenomenon. Yes, you - when your brain loses something, loses an input, so if someone chops off your arm, then the part of your brain that receives arm information has nothing to do, and might create a pretend arm. And when you lose hearing, your part of your brain that deals with hearing makes up sounds that you aren't hearing, but it pretends that you are, and the same with sight. Brains don't like to be put out of work.  PESCA: Does Oliver like his hyper-visualism? Because sometimes people with phantom limbs experience phantom limb pain.  KRULWICH: Yeah, that, of course - you know that's what I'm going to ask, he. . .  MARTIN: Have to go to the presentation, Mike.  (Soundbite of laughter)  PESCA: Are you saying, I thought of the same question, Robert?  KRULWICH: I don't know, that's the question I want to ask.  MARTIN: You can use that.  PESCA: Yeah.  MARTIN: And finally, Robert, I want to ask you, so much of the work that you do is devoted to this very topic, making science interesting, making science accessible, and you use the word \"wonder\" a lot, getting people to realize the wonder involved in science. How do you do that? What's the key to helping people rediscover the wonder?  KRULWICH: Well, I just think if you have it in yourself, you know, if you - both my sister and I, I don't quite know how this happened in our family, but we both can walk down the street and what happens between us is like, look at that (unintelligible), oh, my God. There's a lot of that all the time, and so you just turn it into a job.  (Soundbite of laughter)  MARTIN: And why - I guess, lastly, why do people get freaked out about science, do you think?  KRULWICH: Oh, because it scares them and they don't think they will ever understand it, and it seems kind as like, you know, language, either fancy words or mathematics that they don't get. So, everybody, everybody, when they are little, loves to think about animals, and alternate worlds, and where you come from, and where we are we going.   But when the vocabulary gets too tough, they think, well, I guess that's not for me. But I think it's the job of people who can understand this best to talk to people in terms that they can understand and then everybody's back in. In theory, very, very easy to get excited about this, if you can understand what people are talking about.  MARTIN: Yes, and you are a very good translator between those two worlds. NPR's science correspondent, Robert Krulwich. The World Science Festival is happening in New York. Robert's going to be panelist. Hey, Mr. Krulwich, thanks very much for joining us. We appreciate it.  KRULWICH: You're very welcome.  PESCA: Thanks, Robert.  KRULWICH: Thanks, Mike.  (Soundbite of music)  PESCA: And Modern Drunkard, Cat Fancy, Guns and Ammo, all magazines and this guy read them all. Peter Carlson is retiring as the author of the magazine Reader Column in the Washington Post. He will tell us all about his glossy career.

What do actor Alan Alda, Columbia University string theorist Brian Greene, and Muppet scientist, Dr. Bunsen Honeydew, have in common?   Well, they're all part of the World Science Festival underway this week in New York City.  It's a new event, and the idea is to bring science to the public through dozens of events across the city.  Interested in sustainable cities, endangered species, how our genes determine our identities, the weird world of quantum physics?   Well, the festival's got it covered.  For the rest of the hour we'll get a virtual tour of the festival with one of its co-founders, and we'll talk with two winners of a brand new award in science, the Kavli Prize.  Those were handed out this week at the festival's World Science Summit for achievements in astrophysics, nanoscience and neuroscience.   If you'd like to join in give us a call.  Our number is 1-800-989-8255.  That's 1-800-989-TALK.  If you want more information about what we'll be talking about this hour, go to our website at www. sciencefriday. com, where you'll find links to our topic.   Now, let me introduce my guest.  Brian Greene is co-founder of the World Science Festival.  He's author of \"The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory,\" and \"The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality. \" And he is a professor of mathematics and physics at Columbia University here in New York.  He joins me today in the Science Friday studio.  Welcome back, Dr. Greene.  Dr. BRIAN GREENE (Co-founder, World Science Festival):  Thank you.  Pleased to be here.  HARRIS:  So, festival sounds festive to me.  It's just not a word that a lot of people will associate with science, I'd say.  But - so tell me why are you doing this?  Dr. GREENE:  The idea is to really try to shift the public's perception of science, so that they don't see it as cold, and intimidating, and aloof, something that makes your head hurt, but rather something like great literature, music or art that enriches your life, that gives you a connection to your surroundings, that's hard to achieve in any other way.  So, the point is to make science exciting and accessible, not watering it down, but really allow people to engage with the underlying ideas.  HARRIS:  Huh. And how did this idea come about?  Dr. GREENE:  Well, I was asked to speak at the Genoa Science Festival.  Europe has some of these science festivals.  We don't.  And I went there in 2005, together with Tracy Day, who's a broadcast journalist.  And we stood in this square in this little town of Genoa, and science was kind of spilling out into the streets.   People were so excited about it.  There was electric sense of science in the atmosphere.  And we stood there and said, wouldn't it be spectacular to do something like this in New York, where perhaps for a few days, science would become the headline, or science would be the main act. And people would be thinking about science, going to science, and really helping to shift science to the center of the public conversation.  And they - we decided then to try to do it.  HARRIS:  How did you do it?  Van der Graaf Generators throwing out sparks or things like that?  I mean, those are the flashy version of science, but there must be a. . .  Dr. GREENE:  Not really.  Our view is- or I should say, mine personally is, it is useful for kids in particular to blow things up, and to have sparks, and all that is good.  But that is not really what the heart of science is.   And it kind of limits your capacity to bring people in to science, if you limit it to bangs, and booms and things like that.  So, we're really taking serious science - cosmology, quantum physics, neuroscience, sustainability, and creating programming that is really quite compelling, accessible and entertaining, but the science is really there in a significant way.   So, there are kids' programs.  I don't want to downplay that at all, but there's a broad-spectrum of adult programs where things don't blow up at all, but yet the programs are really quite wonderful.  HARRIS:  Give a couple of for instances.  Dr. GREENE:  Well, last night I went to a program of ours, called Illuminating Genius.  And the idea of the program is to bring together artists and neuroscientists, to try to have a conversation that teases out where creativity sits in the brain.  Is it something that can be cultivated?   Is it something that is obviously in the architecture of the brain?  So, Bill T. Jones was there, Matthew Ritchie, neuroscientist Ramachandran was there, David Eagleman, another neuroscientist Nancy Andreasen, and yeah, Michael York did a performance piece to start it all off.   And it was a real vibrant conversation at this interface between the creative arts, and neuroscientists were beginning to look in the brain with medical imaging devices, and beginning to get a sense of where that creative spark is.  HARRIS:  And who is coming?  Who is your audience?  Dr. GREENE:  It's a little hard for me to put my finger on it, because there are so many people there.  We've been so gratified that basically every event has sold out.  So, you know, last night in this theater, there were 900 people there, and just looking at them roughly, there was quite an age range.   There were students there.  There were older members of the audience as well.  Certainly, there were people who I recognized as coming from the science community, but others who I certainly didn't.  I'm sure they're just from the general populace.  So, it's really trying to reach a broad spectrum of the general public.  HARRIS:  It would be interesting to know if you're drawing in people who are naturally drawn in to these events.  I mean, that presumably is your goal.  Dr. GREENE:  Yes, and we will know that.  We're doing extensive surveying of the individuals.  The data hasn't yet been compiled, but we're having people fill out forms that give us a sense of where they're coming from, and how the event may have affected the way they think about science.   For instance, whether they'd be a little more apt to read the Science Times, because of the event or pick up a science book, or follow up on a subject that they heard about in an event.   So, we'll get a census of that shortly, but I have already spoken to a few of our data folks, and they have indicated that we are finding that kind of traction where people are saying, yeah, I didn't really think about science in those terms before, and it's really something that I would want to continue to pursue.  HARRIS:  How many of the events are free and how many do - how many people have to pay to get into?  Dr. GREENE:  Well, some of the events are free in the kids and family program.  There is a all-day street fair that take place at Washington Square Park on Saturday, May 31st, rain or shine, all day from 10 to 6.  It looks like it's going to rain, so we'll have to see what that looks like.   But there's some wonderful things there.  Disney is coming with a 12-foot tall animatronic dinosaur that'll be walking around, and that will give people a sense of how it works, the science behind it.  You've got a Magic School Bus for the younger kids.  Ms. Frizzle will be walking around.  Snook, are you familiar with Snook?   HARRIS:  No, I don't know Snook.  Dr. GREENE:  Yes, Snook is this eight-foot tall sloth, the PBS character who has science in his programming.  So, that's free.  And then the remainder of the programs are largely paid, but we've really extended a great effort to keep the cost down so it's widely accessible.   For instance, Disney is doing a paid programming, where they're going to show the science behind robotics, virtual reality, animation, things of that sort.  And it's a 12-dollar program for anybody who wants to attend.  HARRIS:  Well, let's go to the phones.  If you want to join the conversation, you can call us at 1-800-989-TALK and let's say hello to Andrew from Chicago.  Hello, Andrew.  ANDREW (Caller):  This is Andrew.  HARRIS:  Hi.  You're on the air.  ANDREW:  Oh, wonderful.  How are you gentlemen doing?  HARRIS:  Great.  How are you?  ANDREW:  Fantastic as always.  Just have a quick question for - it's just on my mind here.  I'm looking at a wonderful sky and it's raining and I'm just thinking, listening to your conversation, how can I be of service, just as a regular human being who wants to take action to create this movement?  HARRIS:  Movement in terms of more appreciation for science, is that what you're (unintelligible)?  ANDREW:  Absolutely.  Even beyond that, making it a part of your life by finding a balance between technology and nature.  HARRIS:  Brian Greene, do you have an idea?  Dr. GREENE:  Well, sir, it's a great question.  And it all depends on what kind of impact one wants to have.  I think at the level of the individual, if you're taking in science and making it into a part of your life, I think that's a start.  If everybody were to do that, we would be in a completely different place in this country. So, I think that's the most important thing.  But if one wants to have a broader impact, one of the great things that started happening lately in a variety of cities, are these cafe sciences.   I don't know how much you are familiar with those, where scientists from universities or from research laboratories go to a local restaurant, of a bar, or pub, and sit there and just talk to people without PowerPoint, without visuals, about science. So, if you can organize that kind of a gathering in your community, it's the kind of thing where people would really just come out and experience science in a very informal way.  I think that they're very effective.  HARRIS:  Great.  Well, thanks.  Those cafes, do they attract an audience?  Have you gone to them?  Dr. GREENE:  I have gone to them.  I did one myself, a version of one down in Texas not too long ago, and they do attract a pretty broad audience, because it's not often that you have that kind of informal exchange with scientists.  And I think it's something which people find very valuable.  HARRIS:  Was hard for you to sell this idea, to get the funding to do it, and to get it off the ground?  Dr. GREENE:  Well, it's always a lot of work to get funding, as anybody in the non-profit sector knows all too well.  But when we road tested this idea with university presidents,  we went to Lee Bollinger at Columbia, John Sexton at NYU, Paul Nurse at Rockefeller, Matthew Goldstein at CUNY, George Campbell at Cooper Union, the universal reaction was this is such a really good idea.   We can't believe it doesn't already exist in this country.  We're in the century of science.  How can we not have a gathering that celebrates science?  I mean when you look at the film industry, there are like over a hundred film festivals throughout the United States every year, and not a single science festival. It kind of doesn't add up.  It doesn't really make sense.   So just about everybody we brought this idea to from the universities, to the cultural institutions, to the government.  We went to New York City government's Dan Doctoroff.  We told him about this idea, immediately said yes.  This is something that has to happen, you know the state as well. So everybody really came behind it in a very strong way, and we're very happy about that.  HARRIS:  Huh. And what made you say you're willing to put aside your work in cosmology for a little while, to devote yourself to this.  What makes it so important for you?  Dr. GREENE:  Well, it is very important to me.  I had no idea what I was getting myself into, which is probably a good thing when it comes to some projects, because it took a lot - much more time and more effort than I ever anticipated that it would.  But I think, it's so critical to have a general public that is engaged with science.   When we look at the challenges and opportunities just around the corner with us already,, climate change, stem cells, genomic sequencing, nanotechnology, space travel, alternate energies.  I mean there's so many issues, that we have to ultimately make some decisions about and they're fundamentally scientific.   So if you have a general public that isn't engaged with the science, then it can't really engage with the ideas, and make and form decisions.  So it's so important that people are not intimated by these ideas.  And the other side, of course, is kids.  You know, to get kids excited about science, what could be more important than that.  HARRIS:  Huh. Let's take another call here.  Let's talk to Bob in Lombard, Illinois. Bob, I hope I've pushed the right button.  Can you hear me?  BOB (Caller):  Yes, hello.  HARRIS:  Hi!  Welcome to the program.  Mr. BOB:  Hi!  Thanks for taking my call.  HARRIS:  Yeah.  BOB:  I understand there's an alternative to the string theory, and I'm wondering what that is and where I can find out about it.  My - I'm very interested in theory, but my access is a little limited.  HARRIS:  First of all, did string theory come up at the festival?  Dr. GREENE:  There is a program that's called beyond Einstein, that I believe happens on Saturday, and it is an exploration of how far we've gotten along the path towards Einstein's dream of a unified theory of all of physics, a single theory that might describe the big, the small, everything in between, with maybe a single equation or single master principle.   String theory is one approach to finding that unified theory, and there have been other approaches to put in together the big and the small gravity and quantum mechanics in the form of something called loop quantum gravity.   Lismullen is one of the proponents and he has some popularized - popularizations of that, that people can read and there are others as well, dynamical triangulations.  I don't know if there are any popular level books on that subject, but there are a number of approaches that are out there, which is great.   The health of a field is the number of different avenues of approach that people are following to try to find the answers.  HARRIS:  I'm Richard Harris, and this is Talk of the Nation from NPR News.  So, you're going to - I guess let's talk a little bit about the festival where you kicked it on - off earlier this week, Wednesday.  Dr. GREENE:  Wednesday, that's right.  HARRIS:  And it started with the World Science Summit, right?  Dr. GREENE:  Yes.    HARRIS:  I was talking to Brian Greene here, by the way.  And, tell us about the World Science Summit.   Dr. GREENE: So, the World Science Summit is a somewhat different character from the rest of the world-science-festival programming, in that it's not open to the general public.   This was a closed door, invitation only gathering among some of the top scientists in the world, there are about 10 Nobel Laureates there, other leading scientists as well, together with leaders in business and government.   In order to have a conversation in which science is really brought in at every level, to the ideas of how to make a decision about various policy issues.   So, the focus was on sustainability, foreign policy, and also, on more science at the level of the individual.  It was called Building a Better Brain, the issues surrounding how, for instance, brain-machine interface can really change the way in which we go about doing our everyday business.   So it was a really exciting gathering and at there also the - we had an announcement of the Kavli Prize winners.  The first annual cup - first, I guess, every other year prize that has been set up in Norway, sort of Norway's answer to Sweden, which has the Noble Prizes.  HARRIS:  Well, tell me about the Kavli Prizes. So, the Kavli Prize, it comes from the vision of Fred Kavli, who has been enormously supportive to science in the last few years, setting wonderful institutes and a variety of universities, and the prizes are awarded in the fields of astrophysics, cosmology, and neuroscience, and in nanoscience, and each of the prizes is a million dollars, so it's a significant prize and the inaugural version of these prizes was announced at this World Science Summit on Wednesday.    HARRIS:  Huh. And in fact we have one of those prize winners with us joining us on the phone, Bruce is a winner of the 2008 Kavli Prize in nanoscience.  At work, he's the Samuel Litham Mitchell professor of chemistry and professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University in New York, where you are also as well.  And congratulations, and welcome to the program, Dr. Bruce.    Dr. LOUIS BRUS (Chemical Engineering, Columbia University):  Well, thank you so much.    HARRIS:  So, I gather, you were awarded this price for something called Quantum Dots.  Do you want to help connect the dots for us?  What are Quantum Dots?  Dr. BRUS:  Well, they're very small pieces of semiconductor that are basically halfway on their way to being molecules.  This work that - it began more than 20 years ago now, was an effort to understand what would happen to transistors, or to the design of the transistor when dimensions became very small.  I think everyone knows that computers are more and more powerful, because the transistor is getting smaller every year, but at some point, that would change when the pieces of the transistor, the silicon itself, would begin to look and act more like a molecule rather than a semiconductor, just because the number of atoms is getting to be smaller and smaller.  HARRIS:  So the property of the material actually changes as it approaches some sort of atomic limits, is that what you're saying?  Dr. BRUS:  Yes, that's right.  So, it's basically -when it would behave more like a molecule, like a subject in chemistry, rather than a subject in physics.  So, we tried to work out that transformation from chemistry to physics on the intellectual level, but also on a practical level, synthetic level actually, making these particles and using them as components for new materials, things of that sort.  HARRIS:  Yeah, so what can you do with them?  Dr. BRUS:  Well, it's - the basis research is really unpredictable.  And we were thinking all the time about transistor design, and you know, how to modify transistors, but the first application actually comes in biology. And these small particles emit light very well, just like semiconductor's an excellent emitter of light. We use light emitting diodes all the time.   We have solid states, street lighting, that's just coming, you know, to be practical and so, these particles have now been used to image, to provide luminescent images for processes occurring inside the cell.  I never thought of that, but people read the articles that we published, you know, and they made the connection.   They had a problem to be solved and they understood that you know, this thing that we had discovered might be the solution and so that's now become an industry of - you know, to use widely in biological imaging.  HARRIS:  Ah. That sounds interesting.  We will end - what other than biological imaging can you do with it.  Dr. BRUS:  Well, there's a big effort right now to physical scientists of my sort to address the energy problem which is. . . HARRIS:  I'm sorry, I need to interrupt you.  We'll be right back after this short break.   (Soundbite of music)  HARRIS:  This is Talk of the Nation from NPR News.  HARRIS:  What do reproductive rights have to do with the environment?  More than you might think.  I'm Richard Harris, join me on Science Friday for a talk with Robert Engelman, author of \"More: Population, Nature, and What Women Want. \" Plus, monkeys control of prosthetic arm, just by thinking about it.  That's on Talk of the Nation from NPR News.    HARRIS: From NPR News, this is Talk of the Nation Science Friday and I'm Richard Harris.  We're talking this hour about the World Science Festival.  My guests are Brian Greene, co-founder of the World Science Festival and author of the \"Elegant Universe,\" and \"The Fabric of the Cosmos. \"  He's a professor of mathematics and physics at Columbia University in New York.  Also with us is Louis Brus, winner of the 2008 Kavli Prize in nanoscience, and a professor of chemistry and chemical engineering at Columbia University in New York.   And Dr. Brus, we were talking a little bit about quantum dots, and you were starting to tell us about some of the other things it can be used for.   Dr. BRUS: Yes. One thing that's happening right now, is that people are trying to use quantum dots to design new types of solar cells.   Electricity in this country is principally generated by the burning of coal, and that's quite cheap, but actually quite polluting to the atmosphere in terms of release of carbon dioxide.  And a wonderful permanent solution that many people envisage on time scale of 50 years, is to replace this with solar electricity with solar cells.   And we had solar cells now(ph) and they're made out of silicon, but they're actually quite expensive and that limits their use.  And so there's a tremendous effort underway to find a way to make cheaper solar cells, that can be used everywhere.   And the quantum dots may well turn out to be an integral part of this.  And that research is going on right now in many laboratories, in many countries around the world.  HARRIS:  Huh. Well, that would certainly be a major accomplishment if you could make solar inexpensive and readily accessible.  Dr. BRUS:  Yeah.  So something like that is a product of many different people, with many different ideas at different times and places, you know.  And a group effort.   HARRIS:  Let's go to the phones here.  There's a call here from John in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  John, please, welcome to the program.  JOHN (Caller):  Hi.  Thank you.  Thanks for having me on.  I wondered if I could,- just to come back to the issue of the World Science Festival, and to the issue of science festivals in general in the United States.  I wanted to just tell you that actually the situation isn't as quite as bad on the ground, as maybe it sounded a few minutes ago.   There are already science festivals beginning here, and we in Cambridge have had one for the last two years actually.  We just finished our second one.  Last year, Science Friday actually came and broadcast from our festival.  We're wishing and hoping all the best for our friends in New York with the World Science Festival.   But there are about three other cities we know of which are also waiting in the wing just about to start there.  So I think we're on the verge of something really big here.    HARRIS:  That's great.  And I should - considering your accent, I guess I should mention you're calling from Cambridge, Massachusetts.  JOHN:  I am.  I'm sorry.  I - yeah, I'm a Brit, but I live here, I work at MIT, and with the Cambridge Massachusetts Science Festival I'm talking about.  HARRIS:  Ah-hah.  So do you have advice for Brian Greene in the near. . .  JOHN:  Oh, I'm not sure I would try to give Brian advice on this.  It sounds to me like he's been preparing in depth and very carefully.  I wish him all the very best.  I mean, what we have found is that you can begin to build interest year on year.   And I hope very much that he's intending to make his an annual effort, and I'd be interested to know what his plan - if he dared look beyond what he's currently preoccupied with, what his plans for 2009 and beyond may be.  Prof. GREENE:  Yeah, we're definitely planning this as an annual event, and what you're pointing at is so exciting, because we envisage that there really can be a movement sparked, where people think about science in a vastly different way.   And having science festivals, I'd love it to happen in every city throughout the United States.  I'd love it to happen in every city throughout the world.  JOHN:  Exactly.  Prof. GREENE:  Because there should be a nationwide - there should be a worldwide celebration every year of science, because it's a thing that - it's the most profound element in shaping and molding the future.    JOHN:  Well, I absolutely agree with that, Brian.  And I can say for sure, we know that San Diego is now well-advanced in planning to start a festival on the West Coast in 2009.  And I know that there's real interest in San Francisco, Philadelphia and St. Louis, to name just three other cities.   So, I see no reason why between us all, we can't really begin to get something big happening here.  HARRIS:  Sounds like a movement.  Well, thanks very much for your call.    JOHN:  Thank you.  HARRIS:  All right.  Now, joining us as well on the phone is Thomas Jessell.  He's another winner of the 2008 Kavli Prize.  This one is in neuroscience.  He's the Claire Tow Professor in Neuroscience and Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics at The Center for Neurobiology and Behavior at Columbia University Medical Center in New York.  Congratulations to you, Dr. Jessell, and welcome to Science Friday. Dr. THOMAS JESSELL (Professor, Neuroscience and Neurobiology, Columbia University):  Thank you.  It's a pleasure to be here. HARRIS:  And tell us why your work was recognized. Dr. JESSELL:  Well, I think it was a recognition of an entire field of developmental neuroscience, and its relation to the way in which nerve cells form circuits that control behaviors in invertebrate organisms, and so, as you know the human brain contains many, many billions of nerve cells with thousands of different cell types, and in order to control any aspect of bodily function, these nerve cells have to wire themselves into networks or circuits that exhibit remarkable precision, and the precision of those circuits eventually ends up controlling the behavior.   So we, as with many other people in the field, have been interested in how nerve cells become different, and how those differences, defined at a molecular level, enable those nerve cells or neurons to form selective circuits, and to understand the way in which the logic of circuit assembly and organization controls particular behavior. HARRIS: And what's the ultimate purpose of this? Dr. JESSELL:  The ultimate purpose, I think, is to understand enough about the wiring of the nervous system not only to be able to explain normal aspects of behavior, but to understand pathologies of the nervous system, why some nerve cells degenerate in neurological disorders, why subtle differences in the wiring produce psychiatric diseases.  And the only way forward in trying to approach those major issues is to understand the normal process with which one can then begin to tackle what has gone wrong in these disease states. HARRIS:  Right.  The other thing that people are always hopeful for is something that would approach the problem of spinal damage.  Is that something you're thinking about as well?   Dr. JESSELL:  Yes, that's uppermost in our mind, in the sense that most of the studies we've done are focused on the spinal cord.  And so the issue is, how after a motorcycle accident, when you severe the connections between the brain and the spinal cord, you can restore motor function.  And over the last five to ten years, there have been really dramatic advances in understanding, not the process of regeneration, but the blocks to regeneration. So now scientists can begin in a systematic way to overcome those blocks and to gradually improve their prospects of recovery. HARRIS:  That sounds like, obviously a much-desired goal, but it also sounds like it might be a ways off. Dr. JESSELL:  It's a challenge.  And so, even though over the last 10 to 20 years, there have really been profound advances in our understanding of the way the nervous system assembles and functions,  we are still some way off from having a practical cure to the degenerative diseases or to spinal cord injury.  But nevertheless, I think there's a sense of optimism in the field now that these are not impossible goals, and that with these systematic, rational approaches, within years, at most perhaps a decade or two, there will be rational solutions to some of these issues. HARRIS:  I'd like to ask you what it was like to win a major new prize that no one had ever won before.  How did you find out?  How did you feel about it? Dr. JESSELL:  The over-riding element I think was initially of surprise.  We've found out, there was a phone call from the Norwegian Academy of Sciences at some anti-socially early hour on Wednesday morning.  And things have been a bit of a blur since then.  So, there's both surprise, delight, but also a sense that it's really an entire field or discipline of science that is being recognized, and because this is a new prize, I think perhaps it sets in some way, a precedent for the types of awards in neuroscience and nanoscience that Fred Kavli has been so visionary in trying to pursue. HARRIS:  Yes.  And Professor Brus, how about you?  Do you have - what was your story about hearing about the prize? Dr. BRUS:  Well, it was 6:50 AM in the morning, and I was just getting out of bed when the phone call came, and it was quite a shock.  You know, I had forgotten completely about the fact that this prize had existed, and all of Wednesday was a blur.  And I learned for the first time what it is to stand in front of a live television camera, and to speak without a script or speak in any sort of a way.  And you know, I would echo this point that I just represent the field.  There are you know, many, many strong people that made independent contributions to this area of quantum dots and nanocrystals, and I sort of symbolize this field.  But, I'm just one worker in the field. HARRIS:  Mm.  So, I guess - the prize is a million dollars.  But it will be shared among people in each category I gathered.  You. . . Professor BRUS:  Yes, I'm sharing it with Professor Iijima.  Sumio Iijima in Japan, who made quite a significant discovery in the structure of carbon nanotubes in the early 1990s.  And that's very well deserved. HARRIS:  So, a party could be in your future if. . . Professor BRUS:  Yes. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. BRUS:  Without a doubt. HARRIS:  That's fantastic.  And Dr. Jessell, a windfall like that must be something you think about a little bit before you decide what to do about it.  But have you given it any thought at all? Dr. JESSELL:  Given the events of the last couple of days,  I can't really say that this has been upper most.  And then again, I would just echo that I'm sharing this prize, and the added pleasure in this is that the two people I'm sharing it with, Sten Grillner from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, and Pasko Rakic from Yale, are colleagues who I've admired from many, many years.  And although we haven't worked directly together, I think collectively, the types of problems we've been approaching have been similar in scope.  So, it's a particular - it's a lot of fun to share this, or share the prospect of this with those two. HARRIS:  Well, let's go back to the phones for a call.  Let's talk to John (ph) in San Pablo, California.  John, welcome to Science Friday. JOHN (Caller):  Good afternoon.  I thank you for answering my call.  I've had an experience about opening up my creativity or aka inspiration.  I was an engineer for 18 years at Geotechnical.  I've worked around the world.  And then I became a nurse aide, and I was in nursing school, and my first patient as a nursing student was catatonic, frozen arms, frozen legs, eyes open, but no cognition.  I was supposed - I gave him a bath. I put him on a gurney, and I started with his little finger. I said, you're not showing recognition that you hear or understand me, but let's start with your little finger. HARRIS:  John, I'm not quite sure where this question is going. JOHN:  This question is going to the creativity of scientists, artists in everybody.  How to open up that area such that you are available to make discoveries in nanotechnology, et cetera, et cetera, including the science, and all areas in the world. HARRIS:  Yes, that's an interesting question.  Brian Greene, do you think that - does the science just sort of happened from a cook book?  I mean, that's how kids seem to learn it in school.  But I mean, what, where is the element of creativity? Mr. GREENE:  Well, it's at the heart of science.  And one of the things that I always feel really disappointed about, is when I do encounter kids who think that science is simply the stuff that they learn in their class.  The stuff that is in their textbook.  Because we present the end product in the textbook.  We don't show the journey of science.  Science is the spectacular journey of discovery.  This mysterious universe that we're trying to figure out, and it takes inspiration, it takes creativity, it takes familiarity with the underlying technical details, so that you can funnel that creativity through the right language for describing the universe.  But relativity? Quantum mechanics?  These were astonishing leaps of creative insight by some of the greatest geniuses that our planet has ever known. HARRIS:  I'm Richard Harris, and this is Talk of The Nation from NPR News.  So, that may explain then why you have artists as well as scientists at the World Science Festival. Mr. GREENE:  Yes.  Well, the other way of thinking about it is we realize that you need to create new avenues of entry into science for people.  I mean, there are some people who just would never go near science, regardless of how you describe it.  But they might go to dance or they might go to film.  So, why not have dance, film or theater or art that has an organic connection to science?  So, for instance at the Guggenheim Museum Friday and Saturday, a wonderful choreographer, Carol Armitage, is interpreting quantum gravity, strength theory through choreography.  So, you know, gravity is integral to dance, it's integral to strength theory.  Put them together, and see what comes out.  So these are the ways in which people would come in as Tracy Day, the executive director likes to say,  they come in for the art, and they leave with the science. HARRIS:  Ha.  Well, that sounds like fun.  Let's take another call.  Let's talk to Christie (ph) in Maynard, Massachusetts.  Christie, welcome to Science Friday. CHRISTIE (Caller):  Yes, hi.  Thank you.  I'm loving this discussion.  I worked at the Museum of Science in Boston for 13 years.  And then went into teaching science in a classroom.  So, I've been in the trenches, and I've seen where the stumbling blocks are.  And I'm so excited about these festivals.  And I'm wondering, I think a major stumbling block to people is the difference between science and technology.  And I even hear it in your discussions, you go back and forth between the questions of science and the questions of technology, this, how does neuroscience apply? And I think it's a critical difference of people to understand, and I just wonder if you addressed that at these festivals. Mr. GREENE:  Yes, absolutely.  It's a great point, and what we really try to do in a number of the programs is allow people to recognize how the technology that they are familiar with is actually based on fundamental science.  So, there's a link there that can really get people excited about science because everybody has a cell phone or a personal computer.  But how many people recognize that those devices work because of quantum physics?  Quantum physics is what allows the integrated circuit to exist, and the integrated circuit is what allows the cell phone and the personal computer and all sorts of medical technology to exist.  And when you say to someone, you have a quantum-mechanical device in your pocket, and when you push its buttons, you are manipulating the quantum-mechanical devices within it.  They're like, wow.  OK.  I'm interested in quantum physics.  Then, tell me about it.  As opposed to it feeling completely esoteric. HARRIS:  Ha, that's great. CHRISTIE:  Right.  I also noticed that because the line is so blurred, that when certain technology is, say, you know, genetic engineering of food or something like that.  People condemn science for it, which is just a quest for understanding the natural world, and asking those questions.  And so, it's almost like there's a backlash against science because of a technology. HARRIS:  Yes.  Well, thank you.  Thanks very much for your call.  I want to - before we get out of here, I want to ask Professors Brus and Jessell, are you planning to go to any of the events at The World Science Festival here in New York City? Dr. JESSELL:  Yes, this is Tom Jessell here.  I've already enjoyed many of the events earlier in the week, and it's really inspiring, as Brian mentioned, to see the variety of participants, topics under discussion.  I went, and the first person I ran into was a high school teacher at my daughter's high school.  So, I think, if the intent of the festival is to reach out not just to technicians and professionals in the field, but in fact people who have the important job of encouraging enthusiasm in science in the young, then it's really doing a marvelous job at achieving that. HARRIS:  Thank you.  Dr. Brus? Dr. BRUS:  Yes.  I think the festival has been a great success.  On Wednesday, I heard a marvelous discussion of our energy policy, and the constraints, and the possibilities for future research, and participated in this discussion.  So, it's been one outstanding event after another. HARRIS:  All right.  Well, thank you all very much for joining us.  I'd like to thank Brian Greene, co-founder of The World Science Festival, and author of the books, \"The Elegant Universe\" and \"The Fabric of The Cosmos. \"  He's a professor of Mathematics and Physics at Columbia University in New York.  Louis Brus is winner of the 2008 Kavli prize in nanoscience, and a chemistry professor at Columbia University, and Professor Thomas Jessell is a winner of the 2008 Kavli prize in neuroscience, and a neurobiologist in Columbia.  I'm Richard Harris, Science Friday.  RICHARD HARRIS, host:    From NPR News, this is Talk of the Nation Science Friday, and I'm Richard Harris in for Ira Flatow.  What do actor Alan Alda, Columbia University string theorist Brian Greene, and Muppet scientist, Dr. Bunsen Honeydew, have in common?    Well, they're all part of the World Science Festival underway this week in New York City.  It's a new event, and the idea is to bring science to the public through dozens of events across the city.  Interested in sustainable cities, endangered species, how our genes determine our identities, the weird world of quantum physics?    Well, the festival's got it covered.  For the rest of the hour we'll get a virtual tour of the festival with one of its co-founders, and we'll talk with two winners of a brand new award in science, the Kavli Prize.  Those were handed out this week at the festival's World Science Summit for achievements in astrophysics, nanoscience and neuroscience.    If you'd like to join in give us a call.  Our number is 1-800-989-8255.  That's 1-800-989-TALK.  If you want more information about what we'll be talking about this hour, go to our website at www. sciencefriday. com, where you'll find links to our topic.    Now, let me introduce my guest.  Brian Greene is co-founder of the World Science Festival.  He's author of \"The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory,\" and \"The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality. \"  And he is a professor of mathematics and physics at Columbia University here in New York.  He joins me today in the Science Friday studio.  Welcome back, Dr. Greene.   Dr. BRIAN GREENE (Co-founder, World Science Festival):  Thank you.  Pleased to be here.   HARRIS:  So, festival sounds festive to me.  It's just not a word that a lot of people will associate with science, I'd say.  But - so tell me why are you doing this?   Dr. GREENE:  The idea is to really try to shift the public's perception of science, so that they don't see it as cold, and intimidating, and aloof, something that makes your head hurt, but rather something like great literature, music or art that enriches your life, that gives you a connection to your surroundings, that's hard to achieve in any other way.   So, the point is to make science exciting and accessible, not watering it down, but really allow people to engage with the underlying ideas.   HARRIS:  Huh. And how did this idea come about?   Dr. GREENE:  Well, I was asked to speak at the Genoa Science Festival.  Europe has some of these science festivals.  We don't.  And I went there in 2005, together with Tracy Day, who's a broadcast journalist.  And we stood in this square in this little town of Genoa, and science was kind of spilling out into the streets.    People were so excited about it.  There was electric sense of science in the atmosphere.  And we stood there and said, wouldn't it be spectacular to do something like this in New York, where perhaps for a few days, science would become the headline, or science would be the main act. And people would be thinking about science, going to science, and really helping to shift science to the center of the public conversation.  And they - we decided then to try to do it.   HARRIS:  How did you do it?  Van der Graaf Generators throwing out sparks or things like that?  I mean, those are the flashy version of science, but there must be a. . .   Dr. GREENE:  Not really.  Our view is- or I should say, mine personally is, it is useful for kids in particular to blow things up, and to have sparks, and all that is good.  But that is not really what the heart of science is.    And it kind of limits your capacity to bring people in to science, if you limit it to bangs, and booms and things like that.  So, we're really taking serious science - cosmology, quantum physics, neuroscience, sustainability, and creating programming that is really quite compelling, accessible and entertaining, but the science is really there in a significant way.    So, there are kids' programs.  I don't want to downplay that at all, but there's a broad-spectrum of adult programs where things don't blow up at all, but yet the programs are really quite wonderful.   HARRIS:  Give a couple of for instances.   Dr. GREENE:  Well, last night I went to a program of ours, called Illuminating Genius.  And the idea of the program is to bring together artists and neuroscientists, to try to have a conversation that teases out where creativity sits in the brain.  Is it something that can be cultivated?    Is it something that is obviously in the architecture of the brain?  So, Bill T. Jones was there, Matthew Ritchie, neuroscientist Ramachandran was there, David Eagleman, another neuroscientist Nancy Andreasen, and yeah, Michael York did a performance piece to start it all off.    And it was a real vibrant conversation at this interface between the creative arts, and neuroscientists were beginning to look in the brain with medical imaging devices, and beginning to get a sense of where that creative spark is.   HARRIS:  And who is coming?  Who is your audience?   Dr. GREENE:  It's a little hard for me to put my finger on it, because there are so many people there.  We've been so gratified that basically every event has sold out.  So, you know, last night in this theater, there were 900 people there, and just looking at them roughly, there was quite an age range.    There were students there.  There were older members of the audience as well.  Certainly, there were people who I recognized as coming from the science community, but others who I certainly didn't.  I'm sure they're just from the general populace.  So, it's really trying to reach a broad spectrum of the general public.   HARRIS:  It would be interesting to know if you're drawing in people who are naturally drawn in to these events.  I mean, that presumably is your goal.   Dr. GREENE:  Yes, and we will know that.  We're doing extensive surveying of the individuals.  The data hasn't yet been compiled, but we're having people fill out forms that give us a sense of where they're coming from, and how the event may have affected the way they think about science.    For instance, whether they'd be a little more apt to read the Science Times, because of the event or pick up a science book, or follow up on a subject that they heard about in an event.    So, we'll get a census of that shortly, but I have already spoken to a few of our data folks, and they have indicated that we are finding that kind of traction where people are saying, yeah, I didn't really think about science in those terms before, and it's really something that I would want to continue to pursue.   HARRIS:  How many of the events are free and how many do - how many people have to pay to get into?   Dr. GREENE:  Well, some of the events are free in the kids and family program.  There is a all-day street fair that take place at Washington Square Park on Saturday, May 31st, rain or shine, all day from 10 to 6.  It looks like it's going to rain, so we'll have to see what that looks like.    But there's some wonderful things there.  Disney is coming with a 12-foot tall animatronic dinosaur that'll be walking around, and that will give people a sense of how it works, the science behind it.  You've got a Magic School Bus for the younger kids.  Ms. Frizzle will be walking around.  Snook, are you familiar with Snook?    HARRIS:  No, I don't know Snook.   Dr. GREENE:  Yes, Snook is this eight-foot tall sloth, the PBS character who has science in his programming.  So, that's free.  And then the remainder of the programs are largely paid, but we've really extended a great effort to keep the cost down so it's widely accessible.    For instance, Disney is doing a paid programming, where they're going to show the science behind robotics, virtual reality, animation, things of that sort.  And it's a 12-dollar program for anybody who wants to attend.   HARRIS:  Well, let's go to the phones.  If you want to join the conversation, you can call us at 1-800-989-TALK and let's say hello to Andrew from Chicago.  Hello, Andrew.   ANDREW (Caller):  This is Andrew.   HARRIS:  Hi.  You're on the air.   ANDREW:  Oh, wonderful.  How are you gentlemen doing?   HARRIS:  Great.  How are you?   ANDREW:  Fantastic as always.  Just have a quick question for - it's just on my mind here.  I'm looking at a wonderful sky and it's raining and I'm just thinking, listening to your conversation, how can I be of service, just as a regular human being who wants to take action to create this movement?   HARRIS:  Movement in terms of more appreciation for science, is that what you're (unintelligible)?   ANDREW:  Absolutely.  Even beyond that, making it a part of your life by finding a balance between technology and nature.   HARRIS:  Brian Greene, do you have an idea?   Dr. GREENE:  Well, sir, it's a great question.  And it all depends on what kind of impact one wants to have.  I think at the level of the individual, if you're taking in science and making it into a part of your life, I think that's a start.  If everybody were to do that, we would be in a completely different place in this country. So, I think that's the most important thing.  But if one wants to have a broader impact, one of the great things that started happening lately in a variety of cities, are these cafe sciences.    I don't know how much you are familiar with those, where scientists from universities or from research laboratories go to a local restaurant, of a bar, or pub, and sit there and just talk to people without PowerPoint, without visuals, about science. So, if you can organize that kind of a gathering in your community, it's the kind of thing where people would really just come out and experience science in a very informal way.  I think that they're very effective.   HARRIS:  Great.  Well, thanks.  Those cafes, do they attract an audience?  Have you gone to them?   Dr. GREENE:  I have gone to them.  I did one myself, a version of one down in Texas not too long ago, and they do attract a pretty broad audience, because it's not often that you have that kind of informal exchange with scientists.  And I think it's something which people find very valuable.   HARRIS:  Was hard for you to sell this idea, to get the funding to do it, and to get it off the ground?   Dr. GREENE:  Well, it's always a lot of work to get funding, as anybody in the non-profit sector knows all too well.  But when we road tested this idea with university presidents,  we went to Lee Bollinger at Columbia, John Sexton at NYU, Paul Nurse at Rockefeller, Matthew Goldstein at CUNY, George Campbell at Cooper Union, the universal reaction was this is such a really good idea.    We can't believe it doesn't already exist in this country.  We're in the century of science.  How can we not have a gathering that celebrates science?  I mean when you look at the film industry, there are like over a hundred film festivals throughout the United States every year, and not a single science festival. It kind of doesn't add up.  It doesn't really make sense.    So just about everybody we brought this idea to from the universities, to the cultural institutions, to the government.  We went to New York City government's Dan Doctoroff.  We told him about this idea, immediately said yes.  This is something that has to happen, you know the state as well. So everybody really came behind it in a very strong way, and we're very happy about that.   HARRIS:  Huh. And what made you say you're willing to put aside your work in cosmology for a little while, to devote yourself to this.  What makes it so important for you?   Dr. GREENE:  Well, it is very important to me.  I had no idea what I was getting myself into, which is probably a good thing when it comes to some projects, because it took a lot - much more time and more effort than I ever anticipated that it would.  But I think, it's so critical to have a general public that is engaged with science.    When we look at the challenges and opportunities just around the corner with us already,, climate change, stem cells, genomic sequencing, nanotechnology, space travel, alternate energies.  I mean there's so many issues, that we have to ultimately make some decisions about and they're fundamentally scientific.    So if you have a general public that isn't engaged with the science, then it can't really engage with the ideas, and make and form decisions.  So it's so important that people are not intimated by these ideas.  And the other side, of course, is kids.  You know, to get kids excited about science, what could be more important than that.   HARRIS:  Huh. Let's take another call here.  Let's talk to Bob in Lombard, Illinois. Bob, I hope I've pushed the right button.  Can you hear me?   BOB (Caller):  Yes, hello.   HARRIS:  Hi!  Welcome to the program.   Mr. BOB:  Hi!  Thanks for taking my call.   HARRIS:  Yeah.   BOB:  I understand there's an alternative to the string theory, and I'm wondering what that is and where I can find out about it.  My - I'm very interested in theory, but my access is a little limited.   HARRIS:  First of all, did string theory come up at the festival?   Dr. GREENE:  There is a program that's called beyond Einstein, that I believe happens on Saturday, and it is an exploration of how far we've gotten along the path towards Einstein's dream of a unified theory of all of physics, a single theory that might describe the big, the small, everything in between, with maybe a single equation or single master principle.    String theory is one approach to finding that unified theory, and there have been other approaches to put in together the big and the small gravity and quantum mechanics in the form of something called loop quantum gravity.    Lismullen is one of the proponents and he has some popularized - popularizations of that, that people can read and there are others as well, dynamical triangulations.  I don't know if there are any popular level books on that subject, but there are a number of approaches that are out there, which is great.    The health of a field is the number of different avenues of approach that people are following to try to find the answers.   HARRIS:  I'm Richard Harris, and this is Talk of the Nation from NPR News.  So, you're going to - I guess let's talk a little bit about the festival where you kicked it on - off earlier this week, Wednesday.   Dr. GREENE:  Wednesday, that's right.   HARRIS:  And it started with the World Science Summit, right?   Dr. GREENE:  Yes.     HARRIS:  I was talking to Brian Greene here, by the way.  And, tell us about the World Science Summit.    Dr. GREENE: So, the World Science Summit is a somewhat different character from the rest of the world-science-festival programming, in that it's not open to the general public.    This was a closed door, invitation only gathering among some of the top scientists in the world, there are about 10 Nobel Laureates there, other leading scientists as well, together with leaders in business and government.    In order to have a conversation in which science is really brought in at every level, to the ideas of how to make a decision about various policy issues.    So, the focus was on sustainability, foreign policy, and also, on more science at the level of the individual.  It was called Building a Better Brain, the issues surrounding how, for instance, brain-machine interface can really change the way in which we go about doing our everyday business.    So it was a really exciting gathering and at there also the - we had an announcement of the Kavli Prize winners.  The first annual cup - first, I guess, every other year prize that has been set up in Norway, sort of Norway's answer to Sweden, which has the Noble Prizes.   HARRIS:  Well, tell me about the Kavli Prizes. So, the Kavli Prize, it comes from the vision of Fred Kavli, who has been enormously supportive to science in the last few years, setting wonderful institutes and a variety of universities, and the prizes are awarded in the fields of astrophysics, cosmology, and neuroscience, and in nanoscience, and each of the prizes is a million dollars, so it's a significant prize and the inaugural version of these prizes was announced at this World Science Summit on Wednesday.     HARRIS:  Huh. And in fact we have one of those prize winners with us joining us on the phone, Bruce is a winner of the 2008 Kavli Prize in nanoscience.  At work, he's the Samuel Litham Mitchell professor of chemistry and professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University in New York, where you are also as well.  And congratulations, and welcome to the program, Dr. Bruce.     Dr. LOUIS BRUS (Chemical Engineering, Columbia University):  Well, thank you so much.     HARRIS:  So, I gather, you were awarded this price for something called Quantum Dots.  Do you want to help connect the dots for us?  What are Quantum Dots?   Dr. BRUS:  Well, they're very small pieces of semiconductor that are basically halfway on their way to being molecules.  This work that - it began more than 20 years ago now, was an effort to understand what would happen to transistors, or to the design of the transistor when dimensions became very small.   I think everyone knows that computers are more and more powerful, because the transistor is getting smaller every year, but at some point, that would change when the pieces of the transistor, the silicon itself, would begin to look and act more like a molecule rather than a semiconductor, just because the number of atoms is getting to be smaller and smaller.   HARRIS:  So the property of the material actually changes as it approaches some sort of atomic limits, is that what you're saying?   Dr. BRUS:  Yes, that's right.  So, it's basically -when it would behave more like a molecule, like a subject in chemistry, rather than a subject in physics.  So, we tried to work out that transformation from chemistry to physics on the intellectual level, but also on a practical level, synthetic level actually, making these particles and using them as components for new materials, things of that sort.   HARRIS:  Yeah, so what can you do with them?   Dr. BRUS:  Well, it's - the basis research is really unpredictable.  And we were thinking all the time about transistor design, and you know, how to modify transistors, but the first application actually comes in biology. And these small particles emit light very well, just like semiconductor's an excellent emitter of light. We use light emitting diodes all the time.    We have solid states, street lighting, that's just coming, you know, to be practical and so, these particles have now been used to image, to provide luminescent images for processes occurring inside the cell.  I never thought of that, but people read the articles that we published, you know, and they made the connection.    They had a problem to be solved and they understood that you know, this thing that we had discovered might be the solution and so that's now become an industry of - you know, to use widely in biological imaging.   HARRIS:  Ah. That sounds interesting.  We will end - what other than biological imaging can you do with it.   Dr. BRUS:  Well, there's a big effort right now to physical scientists of my sort to address the energy problem which is. . .  HARRIS:  I'm sorry, I need to interrupt you.  We'll be right back after this short break.    (Soundbite of music)   HARRIS:  This is Talk of the Nation from NPR News.   HARRIS:  What do reproductive rights have to do with the environment?  More than you might think.  I'm Richard Harris, join me on Science Friday for a talk with Robert Engelman, author of \"More: Population, Nature, and What Women Want. \" Plus, monkeys control of prosthetic arm, just by thinking about it.  That's on Talk of the Nation from NPR News.     HARRIS: From NPR News, this is Talk of the Nation Science Friday and I'm Richard Harris.  We're talking this hour about the World Science Festival.  My guests are Brian Greene, co-founder of the World Science Festival and author of the \"Elegant Universe,\" and \"The Fabric of the Cosmos. \"  He's a professor of mathematics and physics at Columbia University in New York.  Also with us is Louis Brus, winner of the 2008 Kavli Prize in nanoscience, and a professor of chemistry and chemical engineering at Columbia University in New York.    And Dr. Brus, we were talking a little bit about quantum dots, and you were starting to tell us about some of the other things it can be used for.    Dr. BRUS: Yes. One thing that's happening right now, is that people are trying to use quantum dots to design new types of solar cells.    Electricity in this country is principally generated by the burning of coal, and that's quite cheap, but actually quite polluting to the atmosphere in terms of release of carbon dioxide.  And a wonderful permanent solution that many people envisage on time scale of 50 years, is to replace this with solar electricity with solar cells.    And we had solar cells now(ph) and they're made out of silicon, but they're actually quite expensive and that limits their use.  And so there's a tremendous effort underway to find a way to make cheaper solar cells, that can be used everywhere.    And the quantum dots may well turn out to be an integral part of this.  And that research is going on right now in many laboratories, in many countries around the world.   HARRIS:  Huh. Well, that would certainly be a major accomplishment if you could make solar inexpensive and readily accessible.   Dr. BRUS:  Yeah.  So something like that is a product of many different people, with many different ideas at different times and places, you know.  And a group effort.    HARRIS:  Let's go to the phones here.  There's a call here from John in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  John, please, welcome to the program.   JOHN (Caller):  Hi.  Thank you.  Thanks for having me on.  I wondered if I could,- just to come back to the issue of the World Science Festival, and to the issue of science festivals in general in the United States.  I wanted to just tell you that actually the situation isn't as quite as bad on the ground, as maybe it sounded a few minutes ago.    There are already science festivals beginning here, and we in Cambridge have had one for the last two years actually.  We just finished our second one.  Last year, Science Friday actually came and broadcast from our festival.  We're wishing and hoping all the best for our friends in New York with the World Science Festival.    But there are about three other cities we know of which are also waiting in the wing just about to start there.  So I think we're on the verge of something really big here.     HARRIS:  That's great.  And I should - considering your accent, I guess I should mention you're calling from Cambridge, Massachusetts.   JOHN:  I am.  I'm sorry.  I - yeah, I'm a Brit, but I live here, I work at MIT, and with the Cambridge Massachusetts Science Festival I'm talking about.   HARRIS:  Ah-hah.  So do you have advice for Brian Greene in the near. . .   JOHN:  Oh, I'm not sure I would try to give Brian advice on this.  It sounds to me like he's been preparing in depth and very carefully.  I wish him all the very best.  I mean, what we have found is that you can begin to build interest year on year.    And I hope very much that he's intending to make his an annual effort, and I'd be interested to know what his plan - if he dared look beyond what he's currently preoccupied with, what his plans for 2009 and beyond may be.   Prof. GREENE:  Yeah, we're definitely planning this as an annual event, and what you're pointing at is so exciting, because we envisage that there really can be a movement sparked, where people think about science in a vastly different way.    And having science festivals, I'd love it to happen in every city throughout the United States.  I'd love it to happen in every city throughout the world.   JOHN:  Exactly.   Prof. GREENE:  Because there should be a nationwide - there should be a worldwide celebration every year of science, because it's a thing that - it's the most profound element in shaping and molding the future.     JOHN:  Well, I absolutely agree with that, Brian.  And I can say for sure, we know that San Diego is now well-advanced in planning to start a festival on the West Coast in 2009.  And I know that there's real interest in San Francisco, Philadelphia and St. Louis, to name just three other cities.    So, I see no reason why between us all, we can't really begin to get something big happening here.   HARRIS:  Sounds like a movement.  Well, thanks very much for your call.     JOHN:  Thank you.   HARRIS:  All right.  Now, joining us as well on the phone is Thomas Jessell.  He's another winner of the 2008 Kavli Prize.  This one is in neuroscience.  He's the Claire Tow Professor in Neuroscience and Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics at The Center for Neurobiology and Behavior at Columbia University Medical Center in New York.  Congratulations to you, Dr. Jessell, and welcome to Science Friday.  Dr. THOMAS JESSELL (Professor, Neuroscience and Neurobiology, Columbia University):  Thank you.  It's a pleasure to be here.  HARRIS:  And tell us why your work was recognized.  Dr. JESSELL:  Well, I think it was a recognition of an entire field of developmental neuroscience, and its relation to the way in which nerve cells form circuits that control behaviors in invertebrate organisms, and so, as you know the human brain contains many, many billions of nerve cells with thousands of different cell types, and in order to control any aspect of bodily function, these nerve cells have to wire themselves into networks or circuits that exhibit remarkable precision, and the precision of those circuits eventually ends up controlling the behavior.    So we, as with many other people in the field, have been interested in how nerve cells become different, and how those differences, defined at a molecular level, enable those nerve cells or neurons to form selective circuits, and to understand the way in which the logic of circuit assembly and organization controls particular behavior.  HARRIS: And what's the ultimate purpose of this?  Dr. JESSELL:  The ultimate purpose, I think, is to understand enough about the wiring of the nervous system not only to be able to explain normal aspects of behavior, but to understand pathologies of the nervous system, why some nerve cells degenerate in neurological disorders, why subtle differences in the wiring produce psychiatric diseases.  And the only way forward in trying to approach those major issues is to understand the normal process with which one can then begin to tackle what has gone wrong in these disease states.  HARRIS:  Right.  The other thing that people are always hopeful for is something that would approach the problem of spinal damage.  Is that something you're thinking about as well?    Dr. JESSELL:  Yes, that's uppermost in our mind, in the sense that most of the studies we've done are focused on the spinal cord.  And so the issue is, how after a motorcycle accident, when you severe the connections between the brain and the spinal cord, you can restore motor function.  And over the last five to ten years, there have been really dramatic advances in understanding, not the process of regeneration, but the blocks to regeneration. So now scientists can begin in a systematic way to overcome those blocks and to gradually improve their prospects of recovery.  HARRIS:  That sounds like, obviously a much-desired goal, but it also sounds like it might be a ways off.  Dr. JESSELL:  It's a challenge.  And so, even though over the last 10 to 20 years, there have really been profound advances in our understanding of the way the nervous system assembles and functions,  we are still some way off from having a practical cure to the degenerative diseases or to spinal cord injury.  But nevertheless, I think there's a sense of optimism in the field now that these are not impossible goals, and that with these systematic, rational approaches, within years, at most perhaps a decade or two, there will be rational solutions to some of these issues.  HARRIS:  I'd like to ask you what it was like to win a major new prize that no one had ever won before.  How did you find out?  How did you feel about it?  Dr. JESSELL:  The over-riding element I think was initially of surprise.  We've found out, there was a phone call from the Norwegian Academy of Sciences at some anti-socially early hour on Wednesday morning.  And things have been a bit of a blur since then.  So, there's both surprise, delight, but also a sense that it's really an entire field or discipline of science that is being recognized, and because this is a new prize, I think perhaps it sets in some way, a precedent for the types of awards in neuroscience and nanoscience that Fred Kavli has been so visionary in trying to pursue.  HARRIS:  Yes.  And Professor Brus, how about you?  Do you have - what was your story about hearing about the prize?  Dr. BRUS:  Well, it was 6:50 AM in the morning, and I was just getting out of bed when the phone call came, and it was quite a shock.  You know, I had forgotten completely about the fact that this prize had existed, and all of Wednesday was a blur.  And I learned for the first time what it is to stand in front of a live television camera, and to speak without a script or speak in any sort of a way.  And you know, I would echo this point that I just represent the field.  There are you know, many, many strong people that made independent contributions to this area of quantum dots and nanocrystals, and I sort of symbolize this field.  But, I'm just one worker in the field.  HARRIS:  Mm.  So, I guess - the prize is a million dollars.  But it will be shared among people in each category I gathered.  You. . .  Professor BRUS:  Yes, I'm sharing it with Professor Iijima.  Sumio Iijima in Japan, who made quite a significant discovery in the structure of carbon nanotubes in the early 1990s.  And that's very well deserved.  HARRIS:  So, a party could be in your future if. . .  Professor BRUS:  Yes.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. BRUS:  Without a doubt.  HARRIS:  That's fantastic.  And Dr. Jessell, a windfall like that must be something you think about a little bit before you decide what to do about it.  But have you given it any thought at all?  Dr. JESSELL:  Given the events of the last couple of days,  I can't really say that this has been upper most.  And then again, I would just echo that I'm sharing this prize, and the added pleasure in this is that the two people I'm sharing it with, Sten Grillner from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, and Pasko Rakic from Yale, are colleagues who I've admired from many, many years.  And although we haven't worked directly together, I think collectively, the types of problems we've been approaching have been similar in scope.  So, it's a particular - it's a lot of fun to share this, or share the prospect of this with those two.  HARRIS:  Well, let's go back to the phones for a call.  Let's talk to John (ph) in San Pablo, California.  John, welcome to Science Friday.  JOHN (Caller):  Good afternoon.  I thank you for answering my call.  I've had an experience about opening up my creativity or aka inspiration.  I was an engineer for 18 years at Geotechnical.  I've worked around the world.  And then I became a nurse aide, and I was in nursing school, and my first patient as a nursing student was catatonic, frozen arms, frozen legs, eyes open, but no cognition.  I was supposed - I gave him a bath. I put him on a gurney, and I started with his little finger. I said, you're not showing recognition that you hear or understand me, but let's start with your little finger.  HARRIS:  John, I'm not quite sure where this question is going.  JOHN:  This question is going to the creativity of scientists, artists in everybody.  How to open up that area such that you are available to make discoveries in nanotechnology, et cetera, et cetera, including the science, and all areas in the world.  HARRIS:  Yes, that's an interesting question.  Brian Greene, do you think that - does the science just sort of happened from a cook book?  I mean, that's how kids seem to learn it in school.  But I mean, what, where is the element of creativity?  Mr. GREENE:  Well, it's at the heart of science.  And one of the things that I always feel really disappointed about, is when I do encounter kids who think that science is simply the stuff that they learn in their class.  The stuff that is in their textbook.  Because we present the end product in the textbook.  We don't show the journey of science.  Science is the spectacular journey of discovery.  This mysterious universe that we're trying to figure out, and it takes inspiration, it takes creativity, it takes familiarity with the underlying technical details, so that you can funnel that creativity through the right language for describing the universe.  But relativity? Quantum mechanics?  These were astonishing leaps of creative insight by some of the greatest geniuses that our planet has ever known.  HARRIS:  I'm Richard Harris, and this is Talk of The Nation from NPR News.  So, that may explain then why you have artists as well as scientists at the World Science Festival.  Mr. GREENE:  Yes.  Well, the other way of thinking about it is we realize that you need to create new avenues of entry into science for people.  I mean, there are some people who just would never go near science, regardless of how you describe it.  But they might go to dance or they might go to film.  So, why not have dance, film or theater or art that has an organic connection to science?  So, for instance at the Guggenheim Museum Friday and Saturday, a wonderful choreographer, Carol Armitage, is interpreting quantum gravity, strength theory through choreography.  So, you know, gravity is integral to dance, it's integral to strength theory.  Put them together, and see what comes out.  So these are the ways in which people would come in as Tracy Day, the executive director likes to say,  they come in for the art, and they leave with the science.  HARRIS:  Ha.  Well, that sounds like fun.  Let's take another call.  Let's talk to Christie (ph) in Maynard, Massachusetts.  Christie, welcome to Science Friday.  CHRISTIE (Caller):  Yes, hi.  Thank you.  I'm loving this discussion.  I worked at the Museum of Science in Boston for 13 years.  And then went into teaching science in a classroom.  So, I've been in the trenches, and I've seen where the stumbling blocks are.  And I'm so excited about these festivals.  And I'm wondering, I think a major stumbling block to people is the difference between science and technology.  And I even hear it in your discussions, you go back and forth between the questions of science and the questions of technology, this, how does neuroscience apply? And I think it's a critical difference of people to understand, and I just wonder if you addressed that at these festivals.  Mr. GREENE:  Yes, absolutely.  It's a great point, and what we really try to do in a number of the programs is allow people to recognize how the technology that they are familiar with is actually based on fundamental science.  So, there's a link there that can really get people excited about science because everybody has a cell phone or a personal computer.  But how many people recognize that those devices work because of quantum physics?  Quantum physics is what allows the integrated circuit to exist, and the integrated circuit is what allows the cell phone and the personal computer and all sorts of medical technology to exist.  And when you say to someone, you have a quantum-mechanical device in your pocket, and when you push its buttons, you are manipulating the quantum-mechanical devices within it.  They're like, wow.  OK.  I'm interested in quantum physics.  Then, tell me about it.  As opposed to it feeling completely esoteric.  HARRIS:  Ha, that's great.  CHRISTIE:  Right.  I also noticed that because the line is so blurred, that when certain technology is, say, you know, genetic engineering of food or something like that.  People condemn science for it, which is just a quest for understanding the natural world, and asking those questions.  And so, it's almost like there's a backlash against science because of a technology.  HARRIS:  Yes.  Well, thank you.  Thanks very much for your call.  I want to - before we get out of here, I want to ask Professors Brus and Jessell, are you planning to go to any of the events at The World Science Festival here in New York City?  Dr. JESSELL:  Yes, this is Tom Jessell here.  I've already enjoyed many of the events earlier in the week, and it's really inspiring, as Brian mentioned, to see the variety of participants, topics under discussion.  I went, and the first person I ran into was a high school teacher at my daughter's high school.  So, I think, if the intent of the festival is to reach out not just to technicians and professionals in the field, but in fact people who have the important job of encouraging enthusiasm in science in the young, then it's really doing a marvelous job at achieving that.  HARRIS:  Thank you.  Dr. Brus?  Dr. BRUS:  Yes.  I think the festival has been a great success.  On Wednesday, I heard a marvelous discussion of our energy policy, and the constraints, and the possibilities for future research, and participated in this discussion.  So, it's been one outstanding event after another.  HARRIS:  All right.  Well, thank you all very much for joining us.  I'd like to thank Brian Greene, co-founder of The World Science Festival, and author of the books, \"The Elegant Universe\" and \"The Fabric of The Cosmos. \"  He's a professor of Mathematics and Physics at Columbia University in New York.  Louis Brus is winner of the 2008 Kavli prize in nanoscience, and a chemistry professor at Columbia University, and Professor Thomas Jessell is a winner of the 2008 Kavli prize in neuroscience, and a neurobiologist in Columbia.

For about $80 and a few cheek cells, the ad said the canine heritage breed test could determine at least some of the breeds that make up my mutt.

CORCORAN: Of the identified breeds, Sharpei didn't make much sense to us but Chow did because of Fi's thick coat and the fact she has a black spot on her tongue. But as we vigorously discussed the results, Fi sat quietly at our feet notably uninterested. It seems dogs don't care about DNA tests and scientific advances. Fifi, come on.

I'm Madeleine Brand.  ALEX CHADWICK, host:  And I'm Alex Chadwick. Lucy is now two years old. An occasion absolutely no one is celebrating. Lucy is a mud volcano on the island of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia. It's on the eastern tip of the island. It's already swallowed the homes of more than 30,000 people. Scientists and displaced Indonesians blame a gas company for causing the eruption of sludge two years ago. Richard Davies is a geologist with Durham University in England. He's been tracking this volcano since it first appeared. Richard Davies, what usually causes a mud volcano? And how is this one different? Professor RICHARD DAVIES (Geologist, Durham University):  They are normally caused by natural processes. Under the ground you have something called geological pressure and this pressure, sometimes, can be abnormally high. And so where it reaches abnormally high levels, it can force fluids to the surface. Normally through natural fractures and breaks in the rocks. There are thousands of mud volcanoes on the earth. What makes this mud volcano very different is that this one was almost certainly triggered by drilling a gas exploration well.  CHADWICK: This gas well was being drilled by a company that belongs to the richest man in Indonesia. He's connected to the government. There's a lot of back and forth on this. A local court has said that it thinks it was a natural disaster.  Prof. DAVIES: Well, yeah, there was an earthquake on the 27th of May, two days before the start of the mud volcano on the 29th of May, 2006. Almost exactly two years ago. This earthquake has been looked at, in detail, by an American scientist, Michael Magner and he decided that the earthquake is too small and too far away to have had any influence on the triggering this mud volcano. My part in the research has been to look at the drilling data and in fact we have very clear indications that while they were drilling the well, they basically had a series of operational events, which led to the subsurface blowout. Which means that the fluid within the well leaked out towards the surface and that kicked off the process in which Lucy was born.  CHADWICK: Well, this is the world's largest mud volcano. Now, how much bigger might it get? And is there anything that can be done to plug the thing up? Prof. DAVIES: It's not actually the largest. The largest are out in Azerbaijan, but those mud volcanoes are formed over tens of thousands - possibly millions of years. It is the fastest growing. So it's an incredible fast growing mud volcano that is in its infancy. It's expanded to about seven square kilometers and it's actually being penned in by series of dams, which have been built, in order to stop the impact on the local population.  CHADWICK: You've been to the sight. You've looked at this mud volcano? Prof. DAVIES: Yes.  CHADWICK: From the press accounts I read, it's - well it doesn't smell very good? Prof. DAVIES: Well, initially, one of the problems was the gas that erupted with the volcano had hydrogen sulfide gas in it, which is - has a smell of rotten eggs. It's a sight to behold, I mean, reading through the various literature and looking at pictures does not prepare you for seeing this thing. It has a crater in the middle of it, a vent, which is 50 meters wide with mud and gas and steam coming out of it.  CHADWICK: Is the land in danger of collapsing if this water runs out? I mean what is going to happen there? Geologically? Prof. DAVIES: It is collapsing and so we've recently published a paper - we're working with Indonesians. They have taken accurate GPS measurements, which can measure a fraction of a centimeter of downward movement. And they have also used satellite images to see whether the land has gone up  or gone down. It is of course going down. The weight of the mud, and because you are taking mud and fluid from underneath the ground, is causing the area to subside. The maximum rate, if you like, are four centimeters a day. That equates to something like 14 meters a year and if you multiply it by ten years, you can quickly extrapolate the worst-case scenario.  And so my point is you really have to look at this new data because it shows that the area will eventually be impacted by the mud volcano, it's not just the area covered by mud.  CHADWICK: Richard Davies, professor of Geology at Durham University in the United Kingdom on the great mud volcano, Lucy, on the island of Java in Indonesia.  Richard Davies, thank you.  Mr. DAVIES: Thank you very much.   MADELEINE BRAND, host:   This is Day to Day. I'm Madeleine Brand.   ALEX CHADWICK, host:   And I'm Alex Chadwick. Lucy is now two years old.

Prof. DAVIES: Well, yeah, there was an earthquake on the 27th of May, two days before the start of the mud volcano on the 29th of May, 2006. Almost exactly two years ago. This earthquake has been looked at, in detail, by an American scientist, Michael Magner and he decided that the earthquake is too small and too far away to have had any influence on the triggering this mud volcano. My part in the research has been to look at the drilling data and in fact we have very clear indications that while they were drilling the well, they basically had a series of operational events, which led to the subsurface blowout. Which means that the fluid within the well leaked out towards the surface and that kicked off the process in which Lucy was born.   CHADWICK: Well, this is the world's largest mud volcano. Now, how much bigger might it get? And is there anything that can be done to plug the thing up?  Prof. DAVIES: It's not actually the largest. The largest are out in Azerbaijan, but those mud volcanoes are formed over tens of thousands - possibly millions of years. It is the fastest growing. So it's an incredible fast growing mud volcano that is in its infancy. It's expanded to about seven square kilometers and it's actually being penned in by series of dams, which have been built, in order to stop the impact on the local population.   CHADWICK: You've been to the sight. You've looked at this mud volcano?  Prof. DAVIES: Yes.   CHADWICK: From the press accounts I read, it's - well it doesn't smell very good?  Prof. DAVIES: Well, initially, one of the problems was the gas that erupted with the volcano had hydrogen sulfide gas in it, which is - has a smell of rotten eggs. It's a sight to behold, I mean, reading through the various literature and looking at pictures does not prepare you for seeing this thing. It has a crater in the middle of it, a vent, which is 50 meters wide with mud and gas and steam coming out of it.   CHADWICK: Is the land in danger of collapsing if this water runs out? I mean what is going to happen there? Geologically?  Prof. DAVIES: It is collapsing and so we've recently published a paper - we're working with Indonesians. They have taken accurate GPS measurements, which can measure a fraction of a centimeter of downward movement. And they have also used satellite images to see whether the land has gone up  or gone down. It is of course going down. The weight of the mud, and because you are taking mud and fluid from underneath the ground, is causing the area to subside. The maximum rate, if you like, are four centimeters a day. That equates to something like 14 meters a year and if you multiply it by ten years, you can quickly extrapolate the worst-case scenario.  And so my point is you really have to look at this new data because it shows that the area will eventually be impacted by the mud volcano, it's not just the area covered by mud.   CHADWICK: Richard Davies, professor of Geology at Durham University in the United Kingdom on the great mud volcano, Lucy, on the island of Java in Indonesia.  Richard Davies, thank you.   Mr. DAVIES: Thank you very much.  ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.  All rights reserved.

As many as one in 150 American children has been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. And as autism and its related disorders have affected so many families in the United States, they have, not surprisingly, come up with a variety of responses, including the so-called Autism Rights Movement.  Its proponents, many of them on the spectrum themselves, want us to look at autism in a new way, and not as a disease that needs a cure. Last week, Andrew Solomon wrote a long story in New York Magazine about the movement, and so we thought time for another edition of the BPP's Ripped Off. . . (Soundbite of Law & Order theme) MARTIN: From the Headlines. I spoke to 20-year-old Ari Ne'eman who has Asperger's syndrome, and is the president of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network. He talked about a series of ads put out by the NYU Child Studies Center last year that, for him, encapsulated the wrong way of thinking about autism. (Soundbite of reverse playback) Mr. ARI NE'EMAN (President, Autistic Self Advocacy Network): The ads consisted of a series of phony ransom notes, each one claiming to be from a particular disability that had supposedly kidnapped a child. To give you an example, for instance, the one about ADHD said, we have your child. We'll make him fidget and squirm until he is a detriment to himself and everyone around him. Signed, ADHD.  And there was one about autism, and one about Asperger's which spoke, we will make him completely socially isolated and never able to care for himself, or something to that effect. And we found these ads extremely offensive. . . MARTIN: Right. Mr. NE'EMAN: Because they reinforce perceptions of people with disabilities as not being full people, being somehow kidnapped, not fully present in our own bodies. And as a result, we've launched a very comprehensive response campaign. I'm glad to say we managed to get these ads withdrawn. MARTIN: And what is the mission, the larger mission, of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network? Mr. NE'EMAN: Well, our - as an organization, I think, in many respects, we're unique, in that we're one of the few organizations that represent autistic people ourselves, rather than parents or professionals. One of the mottos that we share with the larger disability rights movement is, \"nothing about us, without us. \" People are talking about us, or making policy about us, or conducting research about us. We think we have a right to be involved. MARTIN: And I've noticed that you do use the term \"disability. \" You characterize autism as a disability? Mr. NE'EMAN: Well, yes, Rachel. We're disabled by society. I think that's something that a lot of people don't understand. We don't consider ourselves as having a disease, but what disables us is, for instance, an educational system that's only designed to meet the needs of one kind of student, or societal prejudices which say that autistic people will never be able to live in the community, or succeed in any number of other things. I think the ransom-note ads, which portrayed an incredibly bleak, negative, deficit-oriented picture, are good examples of some of the societal prejudices that I'm speaking about. MARTIN: As the article states, autism exists on a spectrum, right? There are people - and maybe this is where a lot of the stereotypes come from, and these concerns that people with autism or Asperger's can't function in societies, because there are - for some people, on one end of that spectrum, that's true, right? Mr. NE'EMAN: You know, yes, it's true, that the autism spectrum is incredibly diverse. We have a saying, when you know one person on the spectrum, you know one person on the spectrum. And some people are more in line with what the stereotypical depiction is than others, but to characterize somebody as, quote, unquote, \"low functioning,\" can become a very self-fulfilling prophecy.  MARTIN: Mm. Mr. NE'EMAN: Because somebody is unable to communicate right now, it's assumed that they will never be able to communicate, and they don't receive the education and the support that enable them to move forward and to progress on a personal level. So I think one of the things that we want to see is we want to see a removal of the stigma from the label of the autism spectrum, but we very much see it as part of our identity, I think, similar to how you would characterize as part of your identity being a woman, or someone African-American may characterize that as being part of their identity. MARTIN: So, you're essentially proud of being autistic? Mr. NE'EMAN: Yes. I think that's a reasonable characterization. We are proud of who we are. We are proud of the community that we are building, and we want to see a broader systems change to ensure that everybody in our community has the opportunity for communication and for quality of life. MARTIN: What do you say to people who suggest that perhaps you should try harder to be, \"cured,\" quote, unquote, that if given a choice, clearly, you would prefer to not be autistic? Mr. NE'EMAN: Well, I think that that's an unfortunate perspective. There are no - and I don't believe there really ever could be a magic pill that would make us normal, and if there was, I know that I and many others like me would not take it. It concerns. . . MARTIN: That's interesting. Why? Why not? MR. NE'EMAN: Well, because it's part of who we are, and I think there's something deeply unethical, and as practical matter, very troubling with rewiring the fundamental aspects of how somebody thinks and perceives the world. MARTIN: We talk about some of the difficulty in dealing with that stigma. A lot of that comes out of the public education system. If autism is - exists on a spectrum, and there are people within that spectrum who suffer from varying degrees of the disability, how does the public education system deal with that?  Mr. NE'EMAN: Well. . . MARTIN: Or maybe they're not dealing with it? (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. NE'EMAN: When I was in school, I was sent for a number of years into a segregated special-education school, where the assumption was that people like me would not be able to, you know, hold a high-level job, or to go to college, or to succeed at the same level as somebody who is considered normal. If we have a segregated educational system, I think that's going to lead to a segregated society. And if people growing up don't see people of a wide diversity of neurologies and have them in their classroom and understand that, then it's going to be very hard for - as we grow to be adults, for us to have the kind of mutual understanding and acceptance that we require. MARTIN: And you mention that term, \"neurodiversity. \" Is that something that your organization coined? Or has that been around? Mr. NE'EMAN: Well, it's something that originated in the autistic community, and it basically is an idea we're very supportive of, that states that we should apply the same concept of legitimacy that we've applied to race, religion, gender, sexual orientation and so on to neurology, to apply that kind of civil-rights model to our community as well, and instead of working to try and \"cure\" autistic people, to instead work to meet our needs, educationally through the right services and supports, and through broader societal acceptance. MARTIN: One of the stereotypes of people who suffer from autism is a kind of emotional numbness. Can you speak to that? Mr. NE'EMAN: I think that that's an unfortunate stereotype and an inaccurate one, and what it comes down to is, because our communication styles are often not recognized, and whether that's having difficulty understanding when you're using subtle, nonverbal communication, or whether that's needing a keyboard to communicate rather than communicating through voice, there's an assumption that, you know, we're not fully there. One of the most damaging stereotypes that's been associated is that autism somehow steals a normal child and places an emotionally numb, autistic child or adult in their place. MARTIN: And parents end up grieving that. They grieve the loss of that idea of what their child was supposed to be. Mr. NE'EMAN: Exactly, and I think that that's a very concerning thing when that kind of grieving doesn't stop and parents don't see the very real child, and I should stress, also adults, because autistic people are also adults, not just children. . . MARTIN: Sure. Mr. NE'EMAN: But the very real child that is with them and not the child that their original preconceptions thought would be present. MARTIN: How and when were you diagnosed, may I ask? Mr. NE'EMAN: When I was 12. It was something that, at first, I didn't know what it was, but as I grew older, I started to connect with other people in the spectrum, and I began to found - find out that there is a very vibrant community of other adults and youth like myself, and that we have ideas and perspectives and really even a culture that many people are quite simply unaware of. MARTIN: You're in college now? Mr. NE'EMAN: Yes, I am. MARTIN: What's a situation in college that you've had where you have been reminded of your disability, when you have thought to yourself, oh, I am different than these people? Mr. NE'EMAN: I remember one time when, I think ,for club that I'm involved with, we went all to have our pictures taken, and the room that we were getting our pictures taken in had a light bulb that wasn't working properly, and so it was flickering on and off really fast, and that was actually very aggravating for me, sensorially speaking, and I, you know, I actually had to leave the room where we were waiting for pictures to be taken because of that, and that was, you know, definitely something that certainly reminded me of the more disabling aspects of it. MARTIN: If someone were to say to you, Ari, how do you know what you're missing? You were born this way. You say you don't want to be cured, but that's - how can you know that, because you don't know life any other way? Mr. NE'EMAN: Well, I think that that's a somewhat - well, you know, I would imagine that a member of any other minority group, you know, African-American person doesn't know what it's like to be white, a gay person doesn't know what it's like to be straight, or any number of other similar things, and I think to characterize it that way, is in many (unintelligible) deeply disrespectful of our perceptions of ourself. I think other people assuming they know more about our lives than we do is something that's very offensive, and it's the source of a lot of problems for us. MARTIN: Ari Ne'eman is the president of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network. He joined me from our studios in Washington, D. C. Ari, thank you so much for your time. We appreciate it.

An enormous study of 50,000 patients shows that certain anti-inflammatory drugs are probably helpful in delaying or preventing Alzheimer's. That does not mean, though, we should all start popping ibuprofen every day. Dr. Sydney Spiesel is a professor at the Yale Medical School and our medical expert here on Day to Day. Hi, Syd.  Dr. SYDNEY SPIESEL (Professor, Yale Medical School): Hi, Madeleine.  BRAND: Well, tell us more about this study. Who did it and how did they come to their findings? Fifty thousand patients, that's a lot.  Dr. SPIESEL: It was research that was done in the V. A. - the Veterans Administration system. They began by taking patients over a six-year period. They only accepted patients who did not start at the beginning of the six-year period with Alzheimer's disease.  They started tracking sort of everybody identified as developing Alzheimer's disease during this period and at the end of the six years, they had 50,000 patients with Alzheimer's disease, or virtually 50,000. Now, that seems like a huge number but you know, there are about 5 million cases of Alzheimer's in the United States right now and probably about 24 million cases in the world. So, it's a quite common and quite terrible disease.  Each of these 50,000 patients was then matched with four other V. A. patients of the same age, from the same facility, who didn't have Alzheimer's. And they just looked at their pattern of what prescriptions had been written for the people with Alzheimer's and the controll patients. What they were looking particularly were these anti-inflammatory drugs that doctors call NSAIDs, drugs like Advil or Motrin that is ibuprofen, or naproxen, which people know is Aleve. They're often used for arthritis. BRAND: And they found that the drugs worked? Dr. SPIESEL: Well, you know, I really hate in this case the word worked. The most I'm prepared to say is that there really was a tremendous difference in usage between these two groups. The patients without Alzheimer's had a much, much greater probability of using ibuprofen, for example, and that was the most effective of all the drugs looked at. And the longer they took it, the lower the risk until finally, the patients who had been taking ibuprofen for the full five years had only half the risk of developing Alzheimer's compared with the patients who had not been taking it. BRAND: So that would indicate to me that I should go out right now, buy myself a bottle of ibuprofen, and start taking it. Dr. SPIESEL: Well, no, I wouldn't say so, for a number of reasons. The problem is that drugs in this category are not benign. They can lead to an intense irritation of the lining of the stomach, which can lead to potentially fatal bleeding. Gastrointestinal bleeding is one of the most common outcomes of taking excessive amounts of these drugs over a long period of time. They also neutralize the effect - many patients are taking drugs like baby aspirin for cardiovascular protection. Ibuprofen for example, neutralizes the benefit of this baby aspirin, so that's another issue. For some patients, these drugs can cause risk of severe kidney damage, even kidney failure. So never do this without consulting with your doctor first. BRAND: Syd, you mentioned that association should not be confused with causation, so I imagine further study will be warranted by this. Dr. SPIESEL: Absolutely. What we need to do is a study where some patients are given these drugs in a long-term way. Other patients are not given those drugs. Nobody knows - or that is to say, the researchers and the patients don't know who was given the drugs and who wasn't given the drugs, and track these two populations for the development of Alzheimer's disease. That is to say, this is the gold standard in medical testing, the double-blind, random, control trial. BRAND: Thank you, Syd. Dr. SPIESEL: Thank you. BRAND: Dr. Sydney Spiesel is a Yale Medical School professor and a pediatrician, and he's a regular on our program. He comes to us from the online magazine Slate.  MADELEINE BRAND, host:   There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but there may be a way to prevent it with common ibuprofen. An enormous study of 50,000 patients shows that certain anti-inflammatory drugs are probably helpful in delaying or preventing Alzheimer's. That does not mean, though, we should all start popping ibuprofen every day. Dr. Sydney Spiesel is a professor at the Yale Medical School and our medical expert here on Day to Day. Hi, Syd.   Dr. SYDNEY SPIESEL (Professor, Yale Medical School): Hi, Madeleine.   BRAND: Well, tell us more about this study. Who did it and how did they come to their findings? Fifty thousand patients, that's a lot.   Dr. SPIESEL: It was research that was done in the V. A. - the Veterans Administration system. They began by taking patients over a six-year period. They only accepted patients who did not start at the beginning of the six-year period with Alzheimer's disease.   They started tracking sort of everybody identified as developing Alzheimer's disease during this period and at the end of the six years, they had 50,000 patients with Alzheimer's disease, or virtually 50,000. Now, that seems like a huge number but you know, there are about 5 million cases of Alzheimer's in the United States right now and probably about 24 million cases in the world. So, it's a quite common and quite terrible disease.   Each of these 50,000 patients was then matched with four other V. A. patients of the same age, from the same facility, who didn't have Alzheimer's. And they just looked at their pattern of what prescriptions had been written for the people with Alzheimer's and the controll patients. What they were looking particularly were these anti-inflammatory drugs that doctors call NSAIDs, drugs like Advil or Motrin that is ibuprofen, or naproxen, which people know is Aleve. They're often used for arthritis.  BRAND: And they found that the drugs worked?  Dr. SPIESEL: Well, you know, I really hate in this case the word worked. The most I'm prepared to say is that there really was a tremendous difference in usage between these two groups. The patients without Alzheimer's had a much, much greater probability of using ibuprofen, for example, and that was the most effective of all the drugs looked at. And the longer they took it, the lower the risk until finally, the patients who had been taking ibuprofen for the full five years had only half the risk of developing Alzheimer's compared with the patients who had not been taking it.  BRAND: So that would indicate to me that I should go out right now, buy myself a bottle of ibuprofen, and start taking it.  Dr. SPIESEL: Well, no, I wouldn't say so, for a number of reasons. The problem is that drugs in this category are not benign. They can lead to an intense irritation of the lining of the stomach, which can lead to potentially fatal bleeding. Gastrointestinal bleeding is one of the most common outcomes of taking excessive amounts of these drugs over a long period of time. They also neutralize the effect - many patients are taking drugs like baby aspirin for cardiovascular protection. Ibuprofen for example, neutralizes the benefit of this baby aspirin, so that's another issue. For some patients, these drugs can cause risk of severe kidney damage, even kidney failure. So never do this without consulting with your doctor first.  BRAND: Syd, you mentioned that association should not be confused with causation, so I imagine further study will be warranted by this.  Dr. SPIESEL: Absolutely. What we need to do is a study where some patients are given these drugs in a long-term way. Other patients are not given those drugs. Nobody knows - or that is to say, the researchers and the patients don't know who was given the drugs and who wasn't given the drugs, and track these two populations for the development of Alzheimer's disease. That is to say, this is the gold standard in medical testing, the double-blind, random, control trial.  BRAND: Thank you, Syd.  Dr. SPIESEL: Thank you.

A band of researchers from around the world gathered recently at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge for a celebration - a celebration, mind you. The occasion was the 20th anniversary of the discovery of a tiny marine bacterium, which turns out to have a big effect on our lives. NPR's Joe Palca was at the event. JOE PALCA: The celebration was for the discovery of a teeny-tiny marine bacterium called Prochlorococcus. It may be small, but it's so abundant it plays a significant role in keeping oceans healthy and the earth habitable. How significant is something scientists are still trying to work out. Now, I could take you through the science of the celebration. (Soundbite of overlapping voices) PALCA: But I think you'll get a better sense of the joy and delight in the world of Prochlorococcus research if you listen to a part of the evening program. Unidentified Women: (Singing) Prochlorococcus, Prochlorococcus, I count you by your chlorophyll. It makes you grow right. . . PALCA: Now, at this point you may be saying, okay, tiny little microbe, no doubt very cute, but why should I care about Prochlorococcus? Fair enough. You like to breathe? You do? Because by some estimates, the oxygen in one of every five breaths you take comes from Prochlorococcus. Here's why. Prochlorococcus is a bacterium, but it's a bacterium that like a plant cell can perform the amazing feat of photosynthesis. That means it can use energy from the sun to release oxygen from water molecules. And even though each Prochlorococcus produces a tiny blip of oxygen, there are something like a trillion trillion Prochlorococci on Earth, and that adds up to a lot of oxygen. Zachary Johnson organized the Prochlorococcus fest. He's a marine microbiologist at the University of Hawaii. He says there's another reason to pay attention to Prochlorococcus. Mr. ZACHARY JOHNSON (University of Hawaii): It consumes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. So it's very important in terms of reducing carbon dioxide levels from the atmosphere. PALCA: And that's not all. Mr. JOHNSON: It's also the base of the food chain in the ocean. And so it's ultimately consumed by larger organisms - little shrimp on up to fish. And so if we want to understand higher organisms, then we need to understand the base of the food chain. PALCA: So here's this organism that makes the air we breathe, reduces CO2 in the atmosphere, lies at the base of the ocean food chain - and yet 20 years ago, it was completely 100 percent unknown. And it might still be unknown but for the work of Sally Chisholm, better known to her friends and colleagues as Penny. She's a marine microbiologist at MIT. Twenty years ago, she and a colleague named Rob Olsen decided to take a machine called a flow psytometer(ph) on a cruise from Cape Cod to Bermuda. Flow psytometers don't typically go on cruises. They're mainly used by hospitals to count the cells in blood. But Chisholm figured if you pumped seawater through one, you could detect the cells floating in the ocean. Ms. SALLY CHISHOLM (Massachusetts Institute of Technology): We took it on a cruise because we knew we would be able to see Synecococcus(ph), which is the cousin of Prochlorococcus, which had been discovered a decade earlier. PALCA: Synecococcus is a bacterium that also contains chlorophyll, the chemical that enables photosynthesis. The flow psytometer saw Synecococcus, all right, but it also saw something else much smaller. Ms. CHISHOLM: At that time there wasn't supposed to be any particle in the oceans that small that would contain chlorophyll, so at first we thought it was just broken up-cells, maybe chloroplasts from larger cells. But it became pretty clear that it was a very abundant, tiny, tiny cell. PALCA: During a break in the Prochlorococcus fest, Chisholm took me over to her lab on campus and showed me her new flow psytometer. It's basically a big black box the size of a large microwave oven with some metal fittings attaching to small plastic tubing. This machine in her lab is way more powerful than the one she took to sea two decades ago. Ms. CHISHOLM: So using this we can take seawater, squirt it through here, and we can count the number of Prochlorococcus cells in a milliliter of seawater with no problem. And then we can tell the machine: When you see a cell or a particle that looks like this, deflect it to the right. And it'll deflect a little droplet over to the right, and it'll collect all those Prochlorococcus cells. PALCA: Once she's got the cells, she can grow them, prod them, sequence them, basically study the heck out of them. Chisholm plans to examine the entire sweep of Prochlorococcus - from the molecular level of its DNA to how they live and thrive in the open ocean. I asked Chisholm if she ever found it astonishing that something so important could have been missed for so long. Ms. CHISHOLM: I don't think it's that astonishing because I actually think nature is ready to humble us every single day. I mean, we don't really understand how the oceans work. PALCA: But at least now people do know Prochlorococcus is part of the answer. Unidentified Women: (Singing) Prochlorococcus, Prochlorococcus, you always. . . PALCA: Joe Palca, NPR News. Unidentified Women: . . . I have to grow you, to get to know you, each and every little day, cha, cha, cha.

I'm Madeleine Brand.  ALEX COHEN, host:  I'm Alex Cohen. In Massachusetts law makers are worried that their bold attempt to cover the uninsured may fall victim to its own success. So far the state's enrolled at least 340,000 residents in free or subsidized insurance plans. That's more than double the original expectations. But the cost of providing that coverage is straining the state's budget. From member station WBUR Martha Bebinger has more.  MARTHA BEBINGER: In Massachusetts today there are hundreds if not thousands of stories like this one from Laverne Barns (ph). Barns enrolled in one of state's new subsidized insurance plans and went to the doctor. Her first visit in six years. A routine test revealed a mass in her colon that was quickly removed.  Ms. LAVERNE BARNS (Free Health Insurance Recipient, Massachusetts): Everything was found in time and it wasn't cancer. I'm very thankful that the door was open for me to get signed up with health insurance. It's a blessing.  BEBINGER: So how much does- is the co-payment? Unidentified Man: Three dollars.  Ms. BEBINGER: Three dollars. Wow. COHEN: Madeleine Renish (ph) says she no longer has to choose between food and medicine.  Ms. MADELEINE RENISH (Free Health Insurance Recipient, Massachusetts): I matter again. It matters that I get health care. It matters that I'm healthy. That society is supporting that a little bit.  BEBINGER: Two thirds of Massachusetts residents, who have signed up for health insurance since it became mandatory last July are getting free or subsidized coverage. The cost of that coverage is expected to more than double in one year. The cost and enrollment numbers are so fluid that state law makers aren't sure if the budget they are finalizing for July first will hold next year. And there is another looming uncertainty. A federal agreement that triggers more than a billion dollars to help cover the uninsured expires in July. And there is no guarantee that the Bush administration will maintain funding for the law. Governor DEVAL PATRICK (Democrat, Massachusetts): The challenges we face to fully achieve and sustain its promise are almost as significant as those you faced in creating it in the first place. BEBINGER:  Governor Deval Patrick told the annual meeting of health care leaders last week that the state needs short and long term funding solutions.  Governor PATRICK: And I am asking you to join with us with the same spirit and the same commitment and the same creativity that you brought to inventing his wonderful reform to assure that it lasts. BEBINGER: In the short term, aides to Governor Patrick are proposing additional charges on hospitals, insurance companies, and employers. The coverage law was passed with an understanding that government, individuals, and employers would all do their fair share to make it work. Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce President Paul Guzzi says that employers have done their share covering some 85,000 workers who have previous declined health insurance.  Mr. PAUL GUZZI (Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce): We feel very proud, not only of what health insurance reform has achieved, but also the role that employers have paid in looking for additional revenues from employers during this time clearly is not our first option.  BEBINGER: Guzzi says the state must make sure cost pressures don't unravel support for the law. Public support is holding even though 86,000 tax filers paid a modest penalty because they didn't have insurance last year. Ron Norton is one of them. Norton hopes to organize the uninsured when they realize that the penalty for this year is more than four times higher.  Mr. RON NORTON (Uninsured, Massachusetts): You  know most people could afford to lose the 220 dollars, but I think next year, as it approaches a thousand dollars, people are going to be considerable angrier. And hopefully I can get them to mobilize.  BEBINGER: Even though the law faces uncertainties, Kaiser Family Foundation President Drew Altman says the fact that it hasn't failed yet, is a success story by itself. Mr. DREW ALTMAN (President, Kaiser Family Foundation): Because there are a lot of people who said it won't even get off the ground, they'll be a revolt, the mandate won't work and it's still there.  The implementation is moving ahead, though challenges along the way. BEBINGER: State leaders say the key challenge will be figuring out how to hold down the rising costs of caring for the uninsured, which they call health care reform part two.

KESTENBAUM: Titus and two other researchers surveyed scientists who got money from the NIH, over 2,000 respondents.

HOWARD GARRISON: We have to understand that the survey is collecting data on suspected misconduct, possible misconduct, and at various stages in the process individuals and organizations look closely at that data and may make determinations that what was initially thought to be misconduct turns out not to be misconduct at all. KESTENBAUM: Garrison says yes, misconduct happens, more should be done to stop it, but he thinks it's actually pretty rare. GARRISON: I cannot believe any scientist who's practicing in the United States today and understands their craft would really do this. KESTENBAUM: Cheaters get found out, he says, because someone will try to replicate the results and find they can't. The authors of the article in Nature proposed a zero tolerance policy, where all suspected misconduct must be reported.

HOWARD GARRISON: We have to understand that the survey is collecting data on suspected misconduct, possible misconduct, and at various stages in the process individuals and organizations look closely at that data and may make determinations that what was initially thought to be misconduct turns out not to be misconduct at all. KESTENBAUM: Garrison says yes, misconduct happens, more should be done to stop it, but he thinks it's actually pretty rare. GARRISON: I cannot believe any scientist who's practicing in the United States today and understands their craft would really do this. KESTENBAUM: Cheaters get found out, he says, because someone will try to replicate the results and find they can't. The authors of the article in Nature proposed a zero tolerance policy, where all suspected misconduct must be reported. Garrison worries that could create a climate of fear and suspicion that in his words would not be helpful.

I'm Ira Flatow. A little bit later in the hour, we'll talk about several steps you can take to save energy. But first, some hopeful news for those of us who stumble into the kitchen groping for that first cup of coffee, bleary-eyed, stressed-out from a bad night's sleep. New research suggests that just a whiff of roasted coffee can alleviate some of the stress caused by missing sleep, at least, for rats.  A team of researchers found that in laboratory studies, just the scent of roasted coffee beans altered the activity of over a dozen genes in the brains of rodents who were deprived of sleep. At first, when the researchers deprived the rats of sleep, the activity of several important stress-relieving genes decreased, but the activity of those genes rose again to above-average levels when the sleepless rats smelled the roasted coffee. So, should we start smelling our morning coffee instead of drinking it? Do we know enough about people to say so?  Joining me now to talk about the stress-relieving aroma of coffee, research out in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, he's my guest, Yoshinori Masuo. He is a neuroscientist and head of the mental stress team at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Tsukuba, Japan. That's northeast of Tokyo. He's joining us on the phone, in the middle of the morning, late at night from Japan. Welcome to the program, Dr. Masuo.  Dr. YOSHINORI MASUO (Neuroscientist, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan): Hello, good afternoon.  FLATOW: Thank you. Did the rats in your experiment smell the coffee before the experiment started? Dr. MASUO: I'm sorry, I can't hear you. FLATOW: Let me ask it again.  Dr. MASUO: Yes? FLATOW: Do the rats like the coffee smell? Dr. MASUO: Yes, the first author in our paper, Dr. Seo told me that the rats prefer a certain kind of coffee, Colombian. We don't. . . FLATOW: Oh, they. . . Dr. MASUO: Yes? FLATOW: They like Colombian coffee. Dr. MASUO: Yes, but we don't know the difference among Colombian and others scientifically. But I met some specialists of coffee and they said, at a level of aroma, we prefer Colombian. FLATOW: Why did you do this experiment with aroma rather than tasting the coffee? Dr. MASUO: There are many previous papers showing the effects of coffee drinking. So, the effects of caffeine, but the effects of caffeine is not so clear yet, and we know that the aroma can attenuate at stress levels. So, we decided to measure molecular levels and molecular changes in the brain.  FLATOW: And so, you found that there was - that the aroma of the coffee reduced stress? Dr. MASUO: Yes. FLATOW: Do we - do - would - do we - would we think that in people, this might work the same way? Is it possible to test this out in people? Dr. MASUO: Yes, it's possible, of course.  FLATOW: Mm-hm. Would you be doing that? Or do you leave that to someone else? Dr. MASUO: Actually, I don't care because the. . . (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. MASUO: Because the - our goal is to establish the stress-measurement system in human blood. So, we just tested the effects of coffee aroma on the stress. FLATOW: Would you then think that when we drink a cup of coffee, perhaps some of the satisfaction we get from drinking the coffee comes from smelling the coffee, too, perhaps?  Dr. MASUO. Yes, sure. Because that - when you drink a coffee, you cannot avoid the smell - smelling a coffee. And we just examined the effects of coffee aroma and we observed the automations(ph) in gene expression, in protein expression.  FLATOW: Mm-hm. What kinds of effects - you say gene expression and protein expression, what effects do they have on the brain? Dr. MASUO: For example, we observed observations in several factors, but I'd like to talk about two typical examples. One is nerve-growth factor. This factor pro - promotes resistance to stress and enhances cell survival. So, it protects and rescues the brain from injury. Another one is glucocorticoid. This is involved in anxiety and endocrine controls, stress degrees, gene expressione of receptors for these two factors and coffee aroma made them recover. These changes may be associated with anti-stress effects of coffee aroma. FLATOW: So, if you're staying - trying to stay up all night to study, should you drink the cup of coffee or smell it? Dr. MASUO: Oh, that's an excellent question. Drinking coffee includes aroma, taste, caffeine and many factors. Among these, we just studied the aroma. And we don't mean that the smelling is better than drinking. In some online journals, they misinterpreted our work, saying stop drinking and smell coffee. But of course, you can enjoy drinking because you can smell the coffee at the same time, and the smell will rescue your brain. FLATOW: You know, here in America, we don't think about the Japanese as coffee drinkers. We think of you as tea drinkers.  Dr. MASUO: Oh. That's actually - we drink a lot of coffee. In view of the amount of coffee, the first imported country is the United States, of course, and the second is Germany, and Japan is the third. We also need coffee to be awake.  (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Well, what about tea? Do you suspect there might be some aroma of tea that might have a similar effect?  Dr. MASUO: I think tea has similar effects, although we don't study it yet. Aroma can help the stressed brain. From the tea? I think so. There are some publications on aroma, for example, the aroma of lemon, the rose, and lavender. Physiological studies suggest that such good smells make animals feel relaxed. So, it may be possible to show evidence of molecular changes in the brain. Now, we have many things to do.  FLATOW: So, you can - you might be able to find aromas of other things that make us relax, like aroma therapy.  Dr. MASUO: Yes, sure.  FLATOW: So, smelling coffee is like aroma therapy then. Dr. MASUO: Yes, I think so. FLATOW: Yeah, that's terrific. Well, thank you very much for - I know it's in the middle of the morning, late at night for you. Dr. Masuo, thank you very, very much for staying up to talk with us.  Dr. MASUO: OK, you are welcome.  FLATOW: You're very welcome yourself.

And now, a tale of sex and secrecy in the animal kingdom.  Female primates in the wild tend to advertise their sexual encounters.   (Soundbite of animal noise) That's a long-tailed macaque having sex.  These copulation calls seem to help females attract as many sex partners as possible.  A good survival strategy.  But as a team of researchers discovered, female chimpanzees are inclined to be more discreet.  NPR's Jon Hamilton explains. JON HAMILTON:  The Budongo Forest in western Uganda offers a place for researchers to study chimps in a natural setting.  That's what Simon Townsend was doing when he noticed something odd.  Sometimes female chimps produced a copulation call. (Soundbite of chimps calling) HAMILTON:  Other times they didn't. Dr. SIMON TOWNSEND (Evolutionary Psychologist, St. Andrews University, Scotland):  They seem to be different from other primates where the females always call, and so then I started to question, well, why are they calling and why are they sometimes not calling? HAMILTON:  To answer that question, Townsend, who's from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, spent months studying female chimps.  He documented 287 sexual encounters involving seven females.  But the chimps publicized only a third of those encounters.  Townsend realized that the chimps were suppressing copulation calls when a high-ranking female was nearby. Dr. TOWNSEND:  They work out who's in the audience.  You know, they can compute rank differences between themselves and these other females, and then from that they can decide whether to produce a call or not. HAMILTON:  He says high-ranking female chimps tend to get violent when they catch a competitor in the act, hence the secrecy.  So why make copulation calls at all?  Townsend says it's because the females also need to alert desirable males that they're available for breeding.  A female chimp should have as many partners as possible for her children's sake. Dr. TOWNSEND:  If lots of high-ranking males mate with her, then ultimately a lot of them will be confused as to whether they're the father or not. HAMILTON:  An adult male won't kill a baby if he thinks it might be his.  Scientists say female chimps may be more circumspect about their liaisons than other primates because chimps have a different social structure.  Dorothy Cheney, from the University of Pennsylvania, studies baboons. She says a female baboon usually spends her entire life in a relatively harmonious group that includes her mother and other female relatives. Dr. DOROTHY CHENEY (Biology, University of Pennsylvania):  With chimpanzees, females usually come from other groups that are unrelated to many of the other females in the group. And as a result, there may be much more competition for access to males and also for protection from males. HAMILTON:  That competition could make it more dangerous to advertise a sexual encounter.  The new study appears in the journal Public Library of Science I.  Jon Hamilton, NPR News.

But that method has been turned upside down in New York's Hudson River Valley. There, domestic cows and goats are trotting to the rescue of a cute brown turtle on the federal endangered species list. NPR's John Nielsen saw it with his own eyes in a swamp about 100 miles north of New York City. JOHN NIELSEN: The swamps that hold the last of New York's wild bogs are sunny, mushy places, full of low green plants and waist-deep mud pits. Watch your step, says Jason Tesauro. But it's too late. Mr. JASON TESAURO (Zoologist, Environmental Defense Fund): Down there. NIELSEN: You know, I'm glad I brought that extra pair of pants. Tesauro works for the Environmental Defense Fund. He says the mud pit I am now crawling out of is connected to a mass of hidden streams that bog turtles use like freeways. Then, he pulls exhibit A out of a mud puddle. Mr. TESAURO: This is the female we always find at this site. NIELSEN: An adult bog turtle rests in the palm of Tesauro's hand, mild-mannered, he observes, as the head re-emerges from the 3-inch shell. Mr. TESAURO: So that's as big as they get. You can see she has an orange neck patch. NIELSEN: Yes. Mr. TESAURO: It's sort of diagnostic. And she's old, you can tell her age by how worn the top of her shell is. NIELSEN: Oh, okay. Yeah, looks like somebody's been sanding that thing down. Mr. TESAURO: That's right, that's the abrasives in the soil. So we'll release her and take a little walk. NIELSEN: Tesauro says it's likely that bog turtles can live for more than 80 years in sunny swamps like this one. The problem is that many of these swamps have been invaded by a giant foreign weed that dries the soil out and steals the sunlight. It's known as phragmites, and it forms dense thickets like the one we've just walked into. Bog turtles will not live in these things, he says. Also, they grow very quickly. Mr. TESAURO: And since I've been working here almost five years, it used to be moving, I don't know, a good 10 feet a year. NIELSEN: Mow these thickets down and they pop right back up again. On the other hand, Tesauro rarely sees them in well-grazed pastures, which helps explain why there is a tractor-trailer full of goats parked on the far side of the thicket we've just passed through. As we watch, the trailer's doors are opened and the goats fly past us, straight into the foreign phrag patch. Mr. JOHN ADDRIZZO (Owner, New York State Meat Goat Associates): And the bogs -they'll live. NIELSEN: John Addrizzo, the owner of a company called New York State Meat Goat Associates, drove his trailer up from New York City. He says those goats will eat all of the plants they can find out there in the swamp - he calls it browse - and then go looking for more. Mr. ADDRIZZO: They love browse. Goats prefer browse than anything else. So what happens is they'll eat most of the browse and then when starts to die down, they'll start to girdle the tree, they bite around the edge. NIELSEN: And just kill them? Mr. ADDRIZZO: And it girdles it, yeah. NIELSEN: Addrizzo says the thought of using goats to save endangered turtles used to seem ridiculous to him. Then the U. S. Department of Agriculture started paying him to do just that. Now, it seems like a crazy plan that just might work. Mr. ADDRIZZO: It's a unique project. Plus, they fertilize the area, so there's a little give and take. NIELSEN: The reason it might work, according to Tesauro, is that the native plants devoured by these goats tend to bounce back in a hurry, but the big phragmites thickets just can't survive the constant grazing. Mr. TESAURO: So they will knock down all that litter, all the dead stuff, and all the standing biomass within a season. If we came back two months from now, two and a half months, we could stand here and see the back line of that fence where we just walked\u2026 NIELSEN: And we can't see any of it. Mr. TESAURO: \u2026rather than that impenetrable thicket, yeah. NIELSEN: Actually, we didn't have to wait two months to see those changes. They were on display inside the fenced-in swamp just a few miles up the road. A year ago, the place inside this gate was one big, dried-out weed patch, says Tesauro. Now, thanks to a herd of hungry livestock, it is once again a sunny swamp. Tesauro says the rare bog turtles are returning to the swamp and laying eggs on dried-out dirt mounds, like the one right in front of us. Mr. TESAURO: The turtles actually said, hey, this is pretty nice nesting habitat. NIELSEN: Oh yeah. Look at that. Mr. TESAURO: So, you know\u2026 NIELSEN: A teeny-weeny little mess. Mr. TESAURO: That's right. It had about four eggs, and these are all hatched. NIELSEN: So, it's working. Mr. TESAURO: Yeah. Yeah, we're doing good here for sure. NIELSEN: Tesauro says this swamp was cleared by local dairy cattle and not goats shipped up from New York City. When the federal funds used to pay for the goats run out in a few years, he hopes to use the cattle instead. Whether that will happen will depend on whether the small farmers that own these cattle stick around, he says. These days, more and more of them are selling their farms to rich folks moving up from New York City. John Nielsen, NPR News.

Mr. TESAURO: So they will knock down all that litter, all the dead stuff, and all the standing biomass within a season. If we came back two months from now, two and a half months, we could stand here and see the back line of that fence where we just walked\u2026  NIELSEN: And we can't see any of it.  Mr. TESAURO: \u2026rather than that impenetrable thicket, yeah.  NIELSEN: Actually, we didn't have to wait two months to see those changes. They were on display inside the fenced-in swamp just a few miles up the road. A year ago, the place inside this gate was one big, dried-out weed patch, says Tesauro. Now, thanks to a herd of hungry livestock, it is once again a sunny swamp. Tesauro says the rare bog turtles are returning to the swamp and laying eggs on dried-out dirt mounds, like the one right in front of us.  Mr. TESAURO: The turtles actually said, hey, this is pretty nice nesting habitat.  NIELSEN: Oh yeah. Look at that.  Mr. TESAURO: So, you know\u2026  NIELSEN: A teeny-weeny little mess.  Mr. TESAURO: That's right. It had about four eggs, and these are all hatched.  NIELSEN: So, it's working.  Mr. TESAURO: Yeah. Yeah, we're doing good here for sure.  NIELSEN: Tesauro says this swamp was cleared by local dairy cattle and not goats shipped up from New York City. When the federal funds used to pay for the goats run out in a few years, he hopes to use the cattle instead. Whether that will happen will depend on whether the small farmers that own these cattle stick around, he says. These days, more and more of them are selling their farms to rich folks moving up from New York City.  John Nielsen, NPR News. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.

In a moment I have a thought or two about Michelle Obama. But first it's time for Wisdom Watch. From time to time we like to visit with those who we think can give us important perspective on today's most pressing issues, people who aren't just smart, but wise. Today, he grew up in inner-city Detroit, the son of a woman with a third-grade education. He was such a poor student in school, his nickname was dummy. And yet he became one of the most acclaimed surgeons in the world, known for performing some of the most complicated, exacting surgeries known to humankind. He is an author, a teacher, and he has just collected a new honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor. He is Dr. Benjamin Carson, the chief of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore. And he is with us now. Dr. Carson, welcome and congratulations. Dr. BENJAMIN CARSON (Chief of Pediatric Neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins, Medal of Freedom Laureate): Yeah, it was wonderful occasion, thank you very much. MARTIN: What were you doing when you found out that you'd been awarded the Medal of Freedom? Dr. CARSON: I was actually in Indianapolis. We were getting ready for the Colts' celebrity ball. We have a little thing with the Indianapolis Colts each year, and they raise money for the Carson Scholars Fund, and you know that is used to create scholarships in the Indianapolis school system. MARTIN: I know, but what were you doing when you - did you get a phone call, were you sitting down? Dr. CARSON: Oh, yeah. I had just checked into the hotel and got a phone call from the White House. I said wow, is this a mistake? Is it me you really want? (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: Well you've gotten a few rewards in your day. What does this one mean to you? Dr. CARSON: I don't think it really has even fully sunk in now. But when I go back and I look at the list of previous awardees, you know obviously I'm not sure I belong in that company, but it's very humbling. And it's particularly, you know, gratifying to know that someone is actually recognizing some of the extreme efforts that we put, not only into trying to provide the best patient care possible, but also the efforts trying to improve the minds of our young people and potentially the future of our nation. MARTIN: Given that you are now such an admired professional, I think a lot of people who don't know your story might be surprised by your background, which I just alluded to just briefly. You know, you and your brother raised by a single mom with a third-grade education whom you later learned was illiterate, you didn't know that growing up. What do you think she taught you that helped you become the man you are today? Dr. CARSON: Well, I think the major thing my mother taught us was not to be a victim. You know, she, you know was one of 24 children, got married at age 13 and discovered her husband was a bigamist, had only a third-grade education. But she decided that with all that going against her, she could still carve out a future for her and for us. You know, she refused to go on welfare, because she said she never saw anybody go on welfare who came off of it. And she always gave us examples of maintaining control. I remember when my brother was in junior high and they said he's going to go on a vocational track. And she went down there and tore that place apart, and said no, he's college prep, I'm sorry. And she was not going to accept that, you know? And that's the kind of person she was. MARTIN: In your latest book, \"Take the Risk,\" you talk about, among many things, what it's like to be in situations where people's lives are in your hands. And you have to make a judgment about whether - or they have to make a judgment, and you have to make a judgment about whether you should go forward. It's obviously, you wrote a whole book about it. . . Dr. CARSON: Yes. MARTIN: It's a very rich and complicated subject. But can you talk a little bit about what it takes to navigate those situations, particularly things that those of us who don't perform life-saving surgeries can think about as we address those issues? Dr. CARSON: Well, one thing that probably most people don't know is that neurosurgeons, in general, die about ten years earlier than the rest of the population. And a lot of that is stress related. Because you're dealing, you know, with life and death situations all the time, people's functions. And you have to make split-second decisions sometimes. And, you know, if you're wrong the patient might die or have a neurologic injury or just horrible things can happen to you. And that takes a toll on people, there's no question about it. But one of the things that I've learned to do, first of all is, you know, do your homework.  Make sure you understand what's going on, talk to people and let them participate in the decision-making process, that's very important. Ask God to give me wisdom. And ask some basic questions like, you know, what's the best thing that happens if I do this, what's the worst thing that happens if I do it, what's the best thing that happens if I don't do it, what's the worst thing that happens if I don't do it, and, you know, making sure you understand the answers to those questions, making sure that the patient understands it so that everybody goes into the situation with their eyes open. MARTIN:  Why did you want to write your latest book about risk?  What gave you the idea? Dr. CARSON:  Well, I've been thinking about risk for a long time, but the thing that really gave me the idea was the case of the Bijani twins a few years ago, you know, 29-year-old women, very intelligent.  You know, their dream was to be separated and they were both lawyers, you know, so they had a very good sense of the risks that were involved. And they knew that there was no better than a 50-50 chance of living, but they said something to me that really impressed me.   They said, doctor, we would rather die than spend another day together, and I began thinking about their situation because I was sort of aghast when they said that, but then I thought about, you know, those people who were confined to a prison camp for life, and sometimes the incredible risk they take to their lives, to escape.  Well, you know, these were young women who were basically confined to a prison camp because they could not live their lives and they were very intelligent. And I started analyzing in terms of the way they looked at risk and how it's all relative and how it becomes so important for us to understand first of all what our value system is because if we don't know what our value system is then we don't know what risks to take.  Your answer to lots of questions changes if, you know, your value is, you know, fame and glory and money versus uplifting mankind. MARTIN:  But the twins did die. Dr. CARSON:  Yeah. MARTIN:  Did their deaths, which you write about very movingly in the book, I must say, did that change your thinking at all about the subject when you lost both of them? Dr. CARSON:  Obviously, you know, when they were lost that was a tremendous disappointment for all of us.  It wasn't totally unexpected, but, you know, the key thing about everything is learning, you know, with every tragic situation and with every triumphant situation, one must take something away from that, and if you always learn then you're always making progress.  You know, you won't be one of those people who's always late because they never learned that if you leave 15 minutes earlier, you can get there on time.  I think people can train themselves to learn from bad situations and those are the people who go on to do great things. MARTIN:  If you're just joining us, you're listening to Tell Me More from NPR News and our guest for our Wisdom Watch Conversation is Dr. Benjamin Carson.  His latest honor is the Medal of Freedom.  You mentioned that one of the things that you do in assessing risk is you also ask God for guidance, and this is intriguing because I think some people consider it a conflict to be a person of faith and a person of science both.  You talk very openly about your faith, particularly in this book, and you talk about the challenge of integrating your faith with your profession which some consider antithetical.  So could you tell us a little bit about how your beliefs play out in your professional life?  How do you go about integrating those two? Dr. CARSON:  Well, you know, I consider myself a very logical person.  I like to look at everything and I like to find what's consistent with each, what's inconsistent. And as I look at for instance the creation of our universe and I hear some of the hard theoretical physicists saying, you know, if I have enough explosions over a long enough period of time, everything will come into perfect order like it is.  Well, you know, that strains my credulity quite frankly, and I just say so what you're telling me is if I blow a hurricane through a junkyard enough times, a perfectly formed 747 will come out eventually, ready to fly.  I just have to do it long enough and enough times, and yeah, they say well, yeah, theoretically that's true.  Well, it takes more faith than I have to believe that.  It just does.   And that's the case with many other things and yet, you know, I look at the willingness of people to jump into a river to try to save somebody they don't even know and all kinds of things that people do for each other that would make no sense if there were not some internal switch that said something about who we are and morality and the kinds of things that could only derive, you know, from a superior being or creator.  You know, those things would not derive from a bunch of promiscuous biochemicals getting together in a slime pool and making themselves into a creature. MARTIN:  You make that sound so appealing.  You've talked a lot about healthcare as a moral issue.  A lot of people see it as a policy issue.  What do you see as the moral imperative with healthcare? Dr. CARSON:  Well, first of all, recognize that the most important thing that anybody has is their health.  And all you have to do is, you know, walk into the wards of, you know a famous hospital like Hopkins or Duke or Mass. General, and you'll see all these very rich people, very powerful people, dying of horrible diseases, and every single one of them will give every penny and every title for a clean bill of health.   You begin to realize what you have and, you know, to be in a situation where we have the resources to insure that people have good health, and yet, not to provide it, I think it does become a bit of a moral issue.  Recognizing that we have the will to do it, we spend more per capital on health care than any other nation in the world, and yet we rank number 37.  So what we don't have\u2026 MARTIN:  You mean number 37 in terms of the overall quality of our nation's health and the population's health. Dr. CARSON:  Yeah.  Correct.  So what we don't have the will to do is to recognize that we're doing it incorrectly and to overhaul the system.  You know, if it's broke, fix it.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it, but it is broke, and you know, it doesn't do any good to say, well, we're going to have universal health care and we're going to put everybody into this broken system.  It would make much more sense to say let's really analyze the system and let's fix it, and by doing so the cost is going to drop dramatically. And with a little bit of logic we can cover everybody and they can have fantastic care and everybody can be happy.  It can be done. MARTIN:  is there a candidate making sense to you on this issue? Dr. CARSON:  No. MARTIN:  No?  None. Dr. CARSON:  None.  None of them. MARTIN:  Not one? Dr. CARSON:  Not a single one and I'm very sad to have to say that.  I hope that, you know, as the campaign goes on, one or both of them will begin to look more seriously, you know, stop looking for, you know, little political sound bites, and, you know, you don't have to reinvent the wheel.  You know, there are things that we can look at that work, and what we have to do is ask ourselves how do we, you know, apply that on massive scale, you know, why can't we go to, you know, electronic billing and collection?  That would be such an easy thing to do, 300 billion dollars a year right there just by doing that one simple thing.  We can do it and it doesn't do any good to just say this is not politics as usual, but then to continue politics as usual.  We really need some real thinking on this. MARTIN:  One issue that has gotten a lot of attention and conversation in this presidential election year for obvious reasons is the subject of race.  You don't talk a lot about race.  You don't shy away from it, but you don't necessarily talk about it either, and I just wondered is there anything - do you have any interesting thoughts as a result of the dynamic that's resulted from Barack Obama's candidacy that you want to share? Dr. CARSON:  Well, I can tell you the reason that I don't talk a lot about race may have to do with the fact that I'm a neurosurgeon.  You know, when I open that scalp and take off that bone and I'm working on that brain, I realize that that is the thing that makes the person who they are, not the covering . The covering is relatively irrelevant.  It is that brain that is what gives us our personality, what gives us our intellect, and what makes us the human being that we are, and the sooner we get away from concentrating on the wrapping and deal with the present inside, the better off we're going to be as a society. MARTIN:  Well, I understand you have to go into surgery soon.  What's on your dance card today? Dr. CARSON:  Today I have a little kid from Arizona with a very complex spinal cord tethering.  I have a retired military person with trigeminal neuralgia, and I have a baby who has compression of the brain stem. MARTIN:  OK.  Not busy at all I see.  So well, thank you for spending a couple of minutes with us.  Go save somebody if you would. Dr. CARSON:  All right.  My pleasure.  Thank you very much. MARTIN:  Dr. Benjamin Carson joined us from his office at the Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore.  Congratulations once again. Dr. CARSON:  Thank you.

Here to explain is NPR's health policy correspondent, Julie Rovner. Hi, Julie.  JULIE ROVNER: Hi, Alex. COHEN: So tell us a bit about this Medicare bill.  ROVNER: Congress is really coming down to the wire here. Unfortunately they have a habit of acting like a bunch of college students.  They always leave things to the last minute. In this case they've really had six months to figure out how to avert this 10 and a half percent cut to doctor pay that will otherwise take effect next Tuesday, July 1st.  It's a cut that nobody really intended to happen. It is kind of a glitch in the funding formula. The House passed the bill on Tuesday by an overwhelming 355 to 59 vote, but now the bill is kind of stalled in the Senate.  Senate Republicans there aren't sure they want to go along with the way the House has done the bill. They would pay for it by taking money away from private insurance plans that serves Medicare beneficiaries. That's something that the Bush administration and a lot of Republicans really support very strongly. They'd like to find a different way to pay for it, but again, time is running out. COHEN: This bill also involves durable medical equipment, things like wheelchairs, oxygen tanks, explain what's going on with that part of it. ROVNER: Well, this was something that was really just added on at the last minute, you never really have a Medicare bill that only involves one or two things. It has - they have a way of sort of growing and becoming really, what I call the lobbying Lollapalooza. This is always - Medicare bills have a way of attracting health-care lobbyists. In the case of durable medical equipment, studies have found that Medicare has been overpaying for this equipment for years. So, several years ago Congress decided that perhaps they should have competitive bidding for companies that want to sell their equipment to Medicare patients.  The problem is there are winners and losers. There are companies who've been overpaid, now say they're going to be underpaid or they're going to be cut out of the process altogether.  The companies who have been winners, who have won in this bidding process, want it to go ahead. So you've got very - groups of very strange political bedfellows. So you've got among the group that want competitive bidding to be delayed, you've got Senator Schumer and Senator Clinton from New York and Senator Hatch from Utah. Liberals and conservatives would like to have it delayed among those who'd like it to go forward. You've got some strange bedfellows like Senator Coburn from Oklahoma, one of the most conservative members of the Senate, and Senator Kerry, the Democratic nominee from 2004. So this is really not political as much as it is parochial. It's been a fascinating fight to watch. COHEN:  So what's the status of the bill right now? ROVNER: Well, the competitive bidding demonstration would be delayed in the bill that passed the House on Tuesday, and it's in the bill before the Senate right now. And the bill came up in the Senate this morning, but Republicans objected and we could in fact - the Senate could be in this weekend, perhaps even getting to this bill. COHEN: Julie, what happens if this bill doesn't pass? ROVNER: The doctor pay-cut could take effect. There has been a pay-cut that has taken effect once before in 2002, it was a five percent cut, and doctors mostly just stuck with the program and did take care of patients, but really since then doctors' pay has been largely frozen or they've got perhaps one percent increases. And there's a real worry this time that doctors will certainly probably stop taking new Medicare patients and some doctors might even drop existing patients. So this is a big cut and a real concern, and really no-one wants this cut to happen. It's just a matter of finding a way to get this to go away and figure out how to pay for it in a way that Democrats and Republicans and President Bush all agree to. And time really is running out.

I'm Joe Palca. For the rest of this hours, the science of smell. From a whiff of morning coffee and some minty toothpaste onto car exhaust and your coworker's bad breath, your day is filled with smells, fruity, earthy, floral, skunk-y, all of them sending a signal or maybe a warning and telling your brain something about the world around you. Of the five senses, none is as evocative and as elusive as smell. No one has come up with a reliable estimate of the number of scents in the world or a good way to classify them, but that hasn't stopped scientists from studying the aromas that drive, scare or signal us, or simply take us back to a long-forgotten memory. My next guest makes his living studying smell and how it affects us and he's written a book on the subject. Avery Gilbert is the author of \"What the Nose Knows\" - Get it? Nose knows? - \"The Science of Scent in Everyday Life,\" just out by Crown Publishers. He's a psychologist and smell scientist, and he joins me here in the NPR bureau. Welcome to Science Friday, Dr. Gilbert. Dr. AVERY GILBERT (Author, \"What the Nose Knows: The Science of Scent in Everyday Life\"): Thanks, Joe. PALCA: And we'd like to hear - we're going to be interested in hearing your thoughts on smell. So, by all means, give us a call, 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. And yeah, there's also some interesting links on our website, sciencefriday. com, and you know, I was just talking about, is smell sort of the Rodney Dangerfield of the senses, it doesn't get no respect? Dr. GILBERT: It was the last to be explored, and only now do we actually have a sense of what the external wiring is. Back in 2004, the Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology went to Linda Buck and Richard Axel for finding the nature of the receptors that - actually high up on our nasal tissue, contact the odor molecules when they come in, and turns out to be a huge gene family, an enormous number of different receptors. Now, we have a sense of what the wiring is, and we're kind of following it up into the brain and the psychology of the matter. PALCA: Well, tell us a little bit about - I mean, how does - how is smell generated? Take us through from odor to sensation. Dr. GILBERT: Well, an odor is a volatile molecule. It has to be light enough to float in the air and be inhaled up your nose, where it goes very high up in the nasal passages to a set of - a little patch of tissue about the size of a dime that has sensory cells with little tendrils, spaghetti-like tendrils, on which are receptors. You could think of them like a baseball mitt, and the smell molecules is the baseball. When the baseball hits, it stimulates the cell to send a signal up into the brain. So, that's the key first step, where you take chemical message and translate it into electrical message to the brain. PALCA: OK. And if there's these large number of receptors, and this mix that goes up to the brain, why has it proven so hard to categorize these things? I mean, for example, taste. We have five tastes, or color, we have primary colors, vision. Why has smell proven so elusive? Dr. GILBERT: At a practical level, it's very difficult to measure. Scientists have had a hard time developing ways to present a standardized smell, for example. There's no kilogram of patchouli, in that sense. There's no - so it's a nuisance in a laboratory. But more specifically, it's trying to come up with a categorization. We don't have a standardized rainbow, in the same way that we have the Newtonian rainbow. You know, colors, wavelengths of physical light in the real world are continuous, variable, and it's our brain that creates the rainbow - the colors of the rainbow. In the same way, our brain is creating odor categories, but it's - we haven't yet specified them in a way that's useful in a laboratory. PALCA: Now, you talk about a device that's critical for odor chemists, this thing called a gas chromatograph, which actually takes the volatile elements in a particular thing and separates it into different chemical characteristics. Can you look at the output from a gas chromatograph and say, oh, that's an orange or oh, that's a peach? Or is it - there's something else going on in terms of how we perceive these things? Dr. GILBERT: A gas chromatograph, coupled with what's called mass spectrophotometry, enables you to do that. What you get is a chart that has little peaks on it, and those peaks and valleys are the odor fingerprint, if you will. And a trained chemist, somebody who's skilled in analyzing different sorts of samples, can look at a set of peaks and say that's probably a citrus fruit, and it's probably an orange. But you or I couldn't. PALCA: But the cool thing is, and this is - you described this in the book. OK. So we have actually - so we can do some real-life thing. We've got a lime here, a lime with an earthworm. . . (Soundbite of laughter) PALCA: That's not an earthworm, an inchworm. So, OK. So, this is a slice of lime and. . . (Soundbite of sniffing) PALCA: Now, that definitely smells like lime. So it's a lime. But if you wanted to create an artificial lime, you wouldn't have to have all the chemicals in line to make me think I'm smelling a lime, right? Dr. GILBERT: That's an interesting payoff of all the research has been done since about the late '70s on chemical constituents of natural materials. So people have examined all kinds of food, raw fish, cooked fish, vegetables, fruits, and found the same molecules keep turning up again and again. And in fact, Terry Acree, a professor of food science at Cornell, has found that probably less than 1,000 different molecules enable you to recreate any natural cell in the world. PALCA: Huh. And that was one other thing I wanted to point out. I mean, and we were talking about this earlier. So when I held this lime up to my nose. . . (Soundbite of sniffing) PALCA: I was sniffing at it, and that's how you get the air - the volatile molecules up into the back of a nose where those receptors are sitting, waiting for whatever the smell is. But you described there's different kinds of sniffers. Am I a typical sniffer or atypical sniffer? Dr. GILBERT: You're a moderate sort of sniffer. PALCA: Moderate sniffer. Dr. GILBERT: Yeah. There's some people who are very delicate. If you hand them a new smell in a bottle, they'll just take tentative little sniffs, and other people, like all kind of honkers, who are just. . . (Soundbite of sniffing) Dr. GILBERT: You know, really just inhaling again and again and again. I think they're going to hurt themselves. And every person has a kind of typical way of sampling smell. And again, you know, you can tell behind the - when I test subjects behind the screen, I can hear on the other side of the screen how they're sniffing, and I know if somebody takes 20 minutes of big honking sniffs, it's going to be a long day in the test lab. (Soundbite of laughter) PALCA: I'm just wondering now that, you know, so with loud sounds, you can damage your ear cells and the inner ear. With bright light, you can damage the retinal cells. Are there smells that are so powerful that it can knock out your sensors? Dr. GILBERT: Not really as smells. I mean, if you, you know, if you get a face full of pure chlorine in an industrial accident or something, you can burn your tissues, but that's at the extreme. PALCA: OK, all right, interesting. Well, I'm sure our listeners have a lot of questions that they'd like to ask. And so, let me remind everyone the number is 800-989-8255. That's 800-98-TALK. And let's take a call now from Ryan in Greenville - is it Michigan? RYAN (Caller): Yes, it is. PALCA: Welcome to the program, Ryan. RYAN: Thanks for taking my question. I've heard in the news recently about the possibility of electronic transmission of smells, and I was just curious how that was possible, how the chemicals could be reproduced. PALCA: All right. Thanks for that call, Ryan. Electronic transmission of smells. Dr. GILBERT: Well, actually, I was involved in a startup company some years back that was attempting to do just that. Basically, the idea is that you get a code, and you can make codes for different smells in the same way graphic artists have codes for different sorts of colors, and the code would correspond to firing off a little set of chemicals in a pallet, in a, say, computer peripheral, and so, you could click on a perfume ad, say, on a screen, and somewhere else, the code will fire a little device next to you and you get a puff of that fragrance. So it's all in the software. PALCA: There was actually - you mentioned on the book, which - and we were trying with doing something like this, the idea that you could transmit smells over the radio, and of course, right now, you can't, or at least not without specialized equipment on the receiving end. But you talk about somebody who played a joke on the audience once where he said, I'm going to play a tone now and you should smell something and call us and tell us what you think you smelled. And people called in and said, oh, I smell bacon or I smell something. And they were actually lulled into thinking they could smell something. Dr. GILBERT: Yeah. It was Michael O'Mahney's (ph) famous experiment in BBC in England. There a lot of expectation that goes into what we smell, so it can bias us to expect certain things, good or bad. And in fact, you know, you were smelling a lime. In consumer products that are lemon-flavored, the expectation is that it - consumers more than just a simple lemon. If you actually get a simple lemon smell, it's naturally accurate, they're going to be disappointment. So most lemon products tastes - smell like grapefruit. (Soundbite of laughter) PALCA: OK. I'm sorry. I want to take another call, but I have to say, the other that really amazed me is that your smell is also affected by your expectation in terms of look, and you describe people who - you pour the same wine into two different kinds of glasses, and they smell it in a different glasses, and they think it's two different wines, even though all they're changing is the glass, and they're. . . Dr. GILBERT: That's right, and if you have two different solutions with a smell in it and you put a little food coloring in one and other is clear, people sniffing the food-colored one will think it smells stronger. PALCA: Interesting. All right, let's take another call now and let's go to Ken in Houston, Texas. Ken, welcome to Science Friday. KEN (Caller): Hi. Thank you. I noticed when I about 13 years old that I didn't really have a sense of smell, and at the time, no one actually believed me. But was hoping your guest could talk about that, what causes that and how common that is. PALCA: All right. Dr. GILBERT: Well. . . PALCA: No smell at all or no sense of smell at all. Dr. GILBERT: Well, I guess. . . KEN: Well, a really impaired sense. I mean, some very strong odors like ammonia I can detect. But often, (unintelligible). I really don't know what they're talking about. PALCA: Got it. All right. Dr. GILBERT: It's rare, but it's happened. I've met other people like yourself. When you're smelling ammonia, actually that's not the olfactory nerve. That's the chemosensory nerves in your nose, the same way you might be able to smell vinegar or feel the chili pepper burn on your tongue and on your lips. So it's rare. It happens. Other people have lost sense of smell by a slight blow to the head, for example, or a bad flu. So I guess you've never really known what you've lost in a way. So you might be prognostically better off than people who've known it and then lost it suddenly, I'm guessing. PALCA: Ken, thanks very much for the call. KEN: Well, thank you. PALCA: OK. Let's take another call now and go to - let me see here. Is it Judy in Portland, Oregon? Judy, welcome to Science Friday. JUDY (Caller): Hi, there! PALCA: Hi! JUDY: This is really interesting. I was telling the guy that, you know, was taking the calls from people that my big smell that I love is vanilla. And inevitably, when I'm at a perfume counter and they're trying to sell me a new kind of perfume, I'll go, oh, that's got vanilla in it, doesn't it? And sure, you know, sure enough, it does have vanilla in it. There's something about vanilla, even if it's masked slightly by musk or a floral smell, I inevitably smell the vanilla. And I was curious as to, you know, what causes that? I mean, just a personal preference or if there really is something in your chemical makeup in the nose that lends you to smell a particular smell? Dr. GILBERT: Well, in the industry, vanilla's kind of notorious for being very - it penetrates through other combinations. That's why in the vanilla-scented or vanilla-themed perfumes, for example, are mainly vanilla. It's hard to work with it. And in itself in a laboratory, it'll leak out of any bottle. It'll go through plastic. It's just quite an aggressive smell. PALCA: You know, the other thing, speaking of vanilla, as I was doing some interviews with winemakers in Bordeaux, and they were saying that if they want to make a wine popular, they'll put a little vanilla flavor in it because it makes people like the wine better. Dr. GILBERT: That's right. There was a period where vanilla notes were very popular in colognes or perfumes, well, mainly perfumes for women, because they had a kind of edible quality. You smell that, you think cookies, you think sweetness, and it's very innocent and so especially for a lot younger wearing fragrances, it's a popular ingredient. PALCA: But you know, just that last sentence you just said is really interesting, because you used \"notes\" which is usually a term associated with music and hearing and \"edible\" as in taste. So as if the smell can't stand on its own, it sort of has to rope in other senses which I think is just an interesting thing about smell. Dr. GILBERT: We're always groping for metaphors with smell, but perfumers tend to talk about notes for individual ingredients, and they talk about chords or a chord which are combinations of two or three such things. And since we got a very musical sense to it, there's a guy back in the 19th century who had the idea that smell worked in a musical system, and there was kind of an octave system he had all worked out. I don't know he pulled it out of his head. He really had no basis, in fact, but it was an interesting idea. PALCA: We're talking with Avery Gilbert. He's the author of \"What the Nose Knows: The Science of Scent in Everyday Life. \" I'm Joe Palca and this is Talk of the Nation from NPR News. And let's take another call now and go to Christie in Novato, California. Christie, welcome to Science Friday. CHRISTIE (Caller): Hi! Thank you. PALCA: You bet. CHRISTIE: I am a mom of two young boys and I am fascinated with the smell of baby heads, and I'm not the only one, because even when you pass off your baby to someone else, they go oh, the baby smell. And then somewhere between, I don't know, two or three years they seem to lose that smell. It turns into a different one. So I've always kind of wondered about that. I assume it's something, pheromones, bonding, but I would like to know if you know anything about that. PALCA: Cool! Interesting question. Thanks, Christie. Dr. GILBERT: It's a great question. I hear it a lot, and I've experienced it with my own kids. There's that kind of clean baby skin smell that you get from young kids, and then I don't know if it's like they grow out of it. I think it has to do also with diet and things like that. I mean, to get indelicate with baby poop from nursing infants is fairly inoffensive. You start feeding them the solids foods and then the diaper changing becomes something you want your spouse to do. I think it's a lifelong process as well. Some recent work shows that there are reliable changes in character of body odors. People age from middle age and on. So that's just one of the many things as being kind of worked out now. PALCA: You know, one of the other things you talk about in the book is how mothers can recognize their baby smell and find it pleasanter than other babies, even when it comes to baby poop. Dr. GILBERT: That's right. It's not just yes, using baby poop samples from the various kids in the nursery. It's not just mom thinking her kid smells better or less worse than the rest. You can actually - you can back it up. PALCA: That's cool. We have time for one more quick call now, Kathleen from Rochester Hills, Michigan. Welcome to the program. KATHLEEN (Caller): Thank you. Yes. My husband has an absolutely awesome sense of smell, and it can also be kind of a detriment, he says. And I always tease him and say, well, maybe we can find out if there are other ways you can make money with that. Are there opportunities out there for such things where research labs utilize people with extra sensory that way? PALCA: Kathleen, thanks. Interesting question. What about that? Dr. GILBERT: Sure. Yes. He's got a future in quality control. I mean, you have to smell materials in the food industry, fragrance industry to make sure they're in spec, make sure something is not off. I mean, you could be a cheese inspector. PALCA: Are there, you know, - I've heard about super tasters. Are there super smellers? Or do we know? Dr. GILBERT: There are tons of super smellers in fiction all over the place. Salman Rushdie has written about them. That strange German novel \"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer\" is about it. But in real life, they don't exist and the strange thing is that in terms of testing sense of smell, all the tests, the best you can achieve on them is being average and normal. There's no test that shows that you're a smell genius. In fact, it's very hard to define. PALCA: Yes. Can you get better? Dr. GILBERT: Yes, absolutely. It's a matter of training, the same way that wine tasting, if you have enough samples, you know, presented to you repeatedly and described to you. You build your own kind of internal memory system for it, and you can learn it. It's very rarely a case of perfumers are good just because of their physical nose. It's their brain. PALCA: And there's one other issue and we only have a few seconds before the break. But humans versus dogs. Are dogs much better than we are? Are we as terrible as we think or. . . Dr. GILBERT: We're not as terrible as we think. And in fact, in many instances we're on a par with dogs, surprisingly enough. Although there are differences in how we function, but for pure detection, we're close. PALCA: Really? Is there one species that is like the smelling king of the animal world? Dr. GILBERT: I'm not sure. . . PALCA: I stumped him. That's great. Dr. GILBERT: Well, no. I'm a real proponent that we're up there. PALCA: OK. All right. Well, you know, that's good. We've got to be good for something as human beings. I think it's fine if we are good at being smellers. OK. We're going to keep thinking about smell for the rest of this hour and we're going to talk to a curator of an interesting exhibit that's currently under way in Philadelphia. So stay with us. We'll be right back after a short break. (Soundbite of music) PALCA: This hour, we're talking about smell. My guest is Avery Gilbert. He's a psychologist and smell scientist, and author of \"What the Nose Knows: The Science of Scent in Everyday Life. \" And smell might not be the first thing you think of when it comes to work of art. But for my next guest, the olfactory experience is the art form. Jim Drobnick is co-curator of the Odor Limits exhibition. You have one more day to take it in so hurry. It's now showing or smelling at the Esther M. Klein Art Gallery at the Science Center in Philadelphia. Unfortunately, it closes tomorrow. But maybe Mr. Drobnick can tell us about it and see if it'll be somewhere else. Welcome to the program, sir. Mr. JIM DROBNICK (Co-Curator, Odor Limits Exhibition, Philadelphia Science Center): Oh, good. Well, thank you very much. It's a pleasure. PALCA: And if you'd like to ask questions about smell and this exhibit, please call us. The number is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-Talk. Why an art exhibit about smell? What were you trying to get at? Mr. DROBNICK: Well, it's an alternative way for artists to engage viewers and visitors. Smell is one of those sensory modalities that tends to be overlooked within our very audiovisual culture. And especially, within the realm of art which is so visually identified, we thought it interesting to look at artists who try to well, either critique this kind of overemphasis on visuality and also to provide alternatives to that visuality. PALCA: And so, how do you present art that incorporates odor? Mr. DROBNICK: Well, there's two ways. One is to include very fragrant materials and another way is to create synthetic materials that, you know, recent advances in chemistry and synthesis has greatly increased our ability to fabricate smells, ones that exist in nature and ones that don't even exist in nature. So artists have been very keen to adapt this new technology to their own interests, and I guess there's a third way that artists address now, and that is through symbolic means as well. There is a series of videos in the show as well as a smell map that people can participate in. And so with these kinds of representations of smell, one can also consider how language and pictographic markings can also deal with smell. PALCA: Tell me a little bit more about the smell map. That sounds interesting. Mr. DROBNICK: Well, it's a piece by Jenny Marketou, and it's the third or fourth one that she's produced. She's done them in Spain, in Europe, and elsewhere. And she kind of looks up to tradition of smell maps which go back to the 18th century, and smell maps were created during that time in order to identify noxious smells. And this is part of the great sanitization campaign that developed into, you know, cities with grand boulevards, septic systems, and sewers and so on, but her map has a kind of different emphasis.  Instead of identifying bad odors or foul fragrances, she tries to encourage and invite the audience to identify smells of all different types such as flowering trees, bakeries, or pizzerias, construction sites and the kind of dustiness that occurs in those kinds of places. So it's really an attempt to increase people's attentiveness to the sense of smell in the city. PALCA: Right. Well, and just finally, you know, it's too bad we caught you on this last day. Is there any chance that this exhibit will travel? Mr. DROBNICK: Well, you know, smell works tend to be quite performative and ephemeral and also site-specific. So a piece like Jenny Marketou's smell map took an incredible amount of energy and time by the artist to situate it within the specific environs of Philadelphia. So well, there's a hope. There's a chance. There is nothing in the works right now but we're working on it. PALCA: All right. Well, we'll stay tuned. Thanks so much for joining us today. Mr. DROBNICK: Thank you. PALCA: Jim Drobnick is co-curator of the Odor Limits exhibition running through tomorrow at the Esther M. Klein Gallery at the Science Center in Philadelphia. We're also talking this hour with Avery Gilbert. He's the author of \"What the Nose Knows: The Science of Scent in Everyday Life. \" And we've got a lot of calls, so let's go to the phones and take a call from Daniel in Baltimore, Maryland. Welcome to Science Friday. DANIEL (Caller): Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. I've got a question I've always wanted to ask someone who might know. My 90-year-old dad, when he went back to the school in his 30s, he shared with me something he tried when cramming for an exam which was to slice open a lemon and sniff that while he was studying and then bring the slice of lemon to the exam, and try to trigger that mnemonic. PALCA: Interesting. Yeah, mnemonic. That's cool. Let me ask Avery Gilbert about that. Dr. GILBERT: Yeah, it's a very reasonable idea, in fact. He sort of hacked in his own way to the psychological insight, it's called a sight specific learning, you can see it in rats, you can see it in kids and adults where things you learn in a specific room for example, you can remember better in that room than in a different room later on. So, put the smell up and then recreate the smell, and you're more likely to, it's reasonable to think that you're more likely to recall the key information. PALCA: Cool. Now, we have a question for Second Life from someone named Chuck, Chuck Beatty (ph). Are there perfumes that use multiple human pheromones? And maybe, before you answer that question, I should get you to tell me if there is a difference between a pheromone and an odor of something that you, you know, are they the same thing? Dr. GILBERT: Pheromones and odors, that's a vexed question that's just now kind of being untangled. The idea of the pheromone is that it's a chemical substance that will cause behavioral effect in animals and insects. We think of it as mating pheromones for example, and the effects are very specific and rigid and automated. Whether pheromone effects even exist in primates, much less in humans it's kind of kicked back and forth. Martha McClintock of the University of Chicago thinks that pheromones are kind of a classy behavior that influences sort of at the edges of awareness and at the margins, but it's not going to be a dramatic effect. PALCA: All right. Interesting. Let's talk a call now from Connor in Somerville, Massachusetts. Connor, welcome to Science Friday. CONNOR (Caller): Hi. Thanks for having me on the show. PALCA: You bet. CONNOR: I haven't heard the whole thing so I hope I'm not repeating question. But, I have two questions. One, there's a phenomenon I've experienced and others have, you know, where a very particular smell will trigger extremely vivid memories, and you'll be able to know exactly what the memory was if it's the exact smell you've smelled sometime before. And I never experienced quite the same effect with either any of the other senses, vision, taste, tactile, nothing else. And I was wondering if you guest could speak for that phenomenon.  And then, my second question is with the way that humans have a sensitivity to a certain spectrum of light that we call the visible range and other animals could see more to infrared and honeybees and some birds can see more to ultraviolet. Is there a similar spectrum when it comes to smell? And are there, you know, smells that we just as humans can never smell but other species can? PALCA: Cool. Those are two really good questions, Connor. The first one, smell and memory. Dr. GILBERT: That's a very common experience, and that it's this kind of instant and highly vivid evocation of the past. It's something that is unique and it's appealing to smell because you know, in other modalities when we remember the past, we were learning something typically. So, in grade school we were learning something typically. So, in grade school, we learned the names of the state capitals and in adulthood, it's not remarkable to know the capital of North Dakota might be. Joe is shaking his head, I can't remember it either at the moment, but we made an effort to learn it once and so it's so not remarkable when it comes back to us.  Now, with smell, smell is kind of always covering its tracks, in a way. We don't make a conscious effort to remember every smell as we pass through it, and yet it can kind of leave a trail, procedural memories is what psychologists call it. It's kind of imprints itself on a series of events and then we come across it years later, just reawakens that whole sequence in a very vivid way, often misattributed to Marcel Proust the novelist, but as I pointed out in the book, he probably got it wrong and there's a lot of very good authors that captured the spirit of it much better. PALCA: And what about - oh Bismarck, North Dakota? (Soundbite of laughter) PALCA: What about the other point of certain smells that are just beyond our ability but maybe some other species can capture? Dr. GILBERT: That's probably true. In many ways, the natural smells in the world the volatile smells aren't there for us. Therefore, insects talking to insects, plants talking to insects and vice versa and we're just eavesdropping on these interspecies conversations that go on. One of the interesting outcomes of the new work on the genetics of odor reception is that we can see how similar our receptors are to those of mice, say, or apes or rabbits and so forth.  As it turns out, with chimpanzees, that kind of families of odor receptors that we have are very closely mapped on to chimpanzee ones. But even with mice, what the kind of groupings and here's a little speculation because we haven't nailed down a particular smell to a particular receptor, but it's very likely that what we're smelling in the world, in written large is what a mouse is smelling in the world and vice versa. PALCA: Now, it's been suggested that certain smells are somewhat iconic for certain things, and we have some lavender there that came from someone's garden? Dr. GILBERT: It's great. It's very fresh. PALCA: It's a nice smell, but somehow, it seems to be associated to spinsterhood? Dr. GILBERT: In this country, it is. Lavender's one of the favorite ingredients for aroma therapists around the world and it's a popular smell. It has a connotation of calmness and calming when aroma therapists talk about it, and it's used in a lot of products in Europe with that kind of a positioning. In this country, we tend to think of it as old ladies and grandma's closet sort of, it's not an exciting smell. PALCA: It seems to me - I was at a field in France once where there was just rows and rows of. . . Dr. GILBERT: It's still grown there, absolutely. PALCA: Yeah. Interesting. All right, let's take another call now and go to Vincent in Long Island, New York. Welcome to the show, Vincent. VINCENT (Caller): Thank you. How are you guys today? PALCA: Good. VINCENT: Good. I have a question in regards to why is it that when humans smell certain obnoxious odors that it makes us nauseous or it's making us want to be very sick? Whereas dogs who also have a strong sense of smell doesn't seem to be affected by odor in a way like that? PALCA: Good question, Vincent. Thanks. Dr. GILBERT: Yeah, excellent. I think it's because we attribute meanings to smells and that dogs have sort to have taking them at face value in a way. The smell of the dog is just a fact out in the world but doesn't have a value to it, and we start thinking about, oh, that's a smell of a horrible you know, blood and guts in a car accident or a slaughter house or something. We start thinking about the implications of that. I think that helps bring up the nausea in a way. PALCA: Interesting. We're talking with Avery Gilbert. He's the author of \"What the Nose Knows: The Science of Scent of in Everyday Life. \" I'm Joe Palca and this is Talk of the Nation from NPR News. I guess we have to bring up one other question, two parts of the same question. I know I'm asking for trouble here, but men and women, different ability to smell? Dr. GILBERT: Yeah, that's one of the issues where conventional wisdom is actually correct. Women claim to be able to smell better and be more sensitive, and we have to give them that. On an average, a woman can smell, detect an odor at a lower concentration in the air, and women are generally able to identify them more readily, more quickly which goes with the female advantage and verbal ability over us guys. PALCA: But now, let's flip it around and so, women in terms of how they smell. That's a section in the book that I can't let go. This is the difference between male and female farts. You say, it's been scientifically shown that volume, ounce for ounce, women have smellier farts than men. Dr. GILBERT: That's true. There's a research group using gas chromatography as you mentioned. Very cool technique and it's only been put to these age-old questions, has been argued for centuries, guys had been insisting that women are stinkier ounce for ounce, and they're correct. The offsetting fact, though, is that guys produce more gas, and so, I think it's a draw in the end, so to speak. PALCA: See, I told you, Annette, we were going to get to that. Annette didn't put that down as one of the questions, but she's the producer, I get to ask the questions. And let's go to another caller now and take, is it Carthic (ph) from Apex, North Carolina. CARTHIC (Caller): It is Carthic from Apex, North Carolina. PALCA: Welcome. Welcome to the show. CARTHIC: Thank you. Thank you for taking my call. PALCA: You bet. CARTHIC: I just had a quick question about the comment that there's an array of say a thousand of chemicals that trigger smell responses. Are there individual receptors for each one of these or is there a signature of interactions that each chemical trigger that then is read as a particular (unintelligible) by our brain? PALCA: Interesting. Very interesting. What about that? Do we have a receptor for one (unintelligible) all or something or they get mixed up somehow? Dr. GILBERT: That's a great question. Actually, there's a PhD to be pursued there if you want to. It's a really hot topic right now. It seems as if a given chemical will probably stimulate two to three or four more receptors to a greater or lesser degree. And just figuring out how they overlap with each other in the receptor fields, again, talking metaphorically, is of great interest in the neuroscience community now because that will help us figure the psychological code for how smells are transferred again from a chemical structure into a psychological coding and an experience. PALCA: So, what's the worst thing you've ever smelled? Dr. GILBERT: I'm not a fan of vomit in any form. I can do the diaper-cleaning routine, but the vomit gets me. PALCA: There's one that I remember. Maybe, somebody, I worked in a lab, a biochemical lab for a while and there was this chemical that was used for staining DNA or something called Beta-Mercaptoethanol, BME, and I mean, they open a vial of that anywhere in the building and it was like run for your life. It's got sulfur in it. Sulfur seems to be at the root of a lot of not-so-nice smells. Dr. GILBERT: Right. I mean, that's your basic fart ingredient. There's a lot of sulfur containing Mercaptant smells. I mean, that Mercaptants are, the mixture of them uses a warning signal in natural gas for example. Yeah, they're often the culprits. PALCA: All right. Well, I'm afraid that's where we're going to have to leave it, very interesting discussion. I hope everybody has learned that smell is something that smell is we both pay attention to, admire, use when we need to, and appreciate for all the complexities that it has. Thanks for joining us, Avery. Dr. GILBERT: My pleasure.  JOE PALCA, host:  From NPR News, this is Talk of the Nation: Science Friday. I'm Joe Palca. For the rest of this hours, the science of smell. From a whiff of morning coffee and some minty toothpaste onto car exhaust and your coworker's bad breath, your day is filled with smells, fruity, earthy, floral, skunk-y, all of them sending a signal or maybe a warning and telling your brain something about the world around you.  Of the five senses, none is as evocative and as elusive as smell. No one has come up with a reliable estimate of the number of scents in the world or a good way to classify them, but that hasn't stopped scientists from studying the aromas that drive, scare or signal us, or simply take us back to a long-forgotten memory. My next guest makes his living studying smell and how it affects us and he's written a book on the subject. Avery Gilbert is the author of \"What the Nose Knows\" - Get it? Nose knows? - \"The Science of Scent in Everyday Life,\" just out by Crown Publishers. He's a psychologist and smell scientist, and he joins me here in the NPR bureau. Welcome to Science Friday, Dr. Gilbert.  Dr. AVERY GILBERT (Author, \"What the Nose Knows: The Science of Scent in Everyday Life\"): Thanks, Joe.  PALCA: And we'd like to hear - we're going to be interested in hearing your thoughts on smell. So, by all means, give us a call, 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. And yeah, there's also some interesting links on our website, sciencefriday. com, and you know, I was just talking about, is smell sort of the Rodney Dangerfield of the senses, it doesn't get no respect?  Dr. GILBERT: It was the last to be explored, and only now do we actually have a sense of what the external wiring is. Back in 2004, the Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology went to Linda Buck and Richard Axel for finding the nature of the receptors that - actually high up on our nasal tissue, contact the odor molecules when they come in, and turns out to be a huge gene family, an enormous number of different receptors. Now, we have a sense of what the wiring is, and we're kind of following it up into the brain and the psychology of the matter.  PALCA: Well, tell us a little bit about - I mean, how does - how is smell generated? Take us through from odor to sensation.  Dr. GILBERT: Well, an odor is a volatile molecule. It has to be light enough to float in the air and be inhaled up your nose, where it goes very high up in the nasal passages to a set of - a little patch of tissue about the size of a dime that has sensory cells with little tendrils, spaghetti-like tendrils, on which are receptors. You could think of them like a baseball mitt, and the smell molecules is the baseball. When the baseball hits, it stimulates the cell to send a signal up into the brain. So, that's the key first step, where you take chemical message and translate it into electrical message to the brain.  PALCA: OK. And if there's these large number of receptors, and this mix that goes up to the brain, why has it proven so hard to categorize these things? I mean, for example, taste. We have five tastes, or color, we have primary colors, vision. Why has smell proven so elusive?  Dr. GILBERT: At a practical level, it's very difficult to measure. Scientists have had a hard time developing ways to present a standardized smell, for example. There's no kilogram of patchouli, in that sense. There's no - so it's a nuisance in a laboratory. But more specifically, it's trying to come up with a categorization. We don't have a standardized rainbow, in the same way that we have the Newtonian rainbow. You know, colors, wavelengths of physical light in the real world are continuous, variable, and it's our brain that creates the rainbow - the colors of the rainbow. In the same way, our brain is creating odor categories, but it's - we haven't yet specified them in a way that's useful in a laboratory.  PALCA: Now, you talk about a device that's critical for odor chemists, this thing called a gas chromatograph, which actually takes the volatile elements in a particular thing and separates it into different chemical characteristics. Can you look at the output from a gas chromatograph and say, oh, that's an orange or oh, that's a peach? Or is it - there's something else going on in terms of how we perceive these things?  Dr. GILBERT: A gas chromatograph, coupled with what's called mass spectrophotometry, enables you to do that. What you get is a chart that has little peaks on it, and those peaks and valleys are the odor fingerprint, if you will. And a trained chemist, somebody who's skilled in analyzing different sorts of samples, can look at a set of peaks and say that's probably a citrus fruit, and it's probably an orange. But you or I couldn't.  PALCA: But the cool thing is, and this is - you described this in the book. OK. So we have actually - so we can do some real-life thing. We've got a lime here, a lime with an earthworm. . .  (Soundbite of laughter)  PALCA: That's not an earthworm, an inchworm. So, OK. So, this is a slice of lime and. . .  (Soundbite of sniffing)  PALCA: Now, that definitely smells like lime. So it's a lime. But if you wanted to create an artificial lime, you wouldn't have to have all the chemicals in line to make me think I'm smelling a lime, right?  Dr. GILBERT: That's an interesting payoff of all the research has been done since about the late '70s on chemical constituents of natural materials. So people have examined all kinds of food, raw fish, cooked fish, vegetables, fruits, and found the same molecules keep turning up again and again. And in fact, Terry Acree, a professor of food science at Cornell, has found that probably less than 1,000 different molecules enable you to recreate any natural cell in the world.  PALCA: Huh. And that was one other thing I wanted to point out. I mean, and we were talking about this earlier. So when I held this lime up to my nose. . .  (Soundbite of sniffing)  PALCA: I was sniffing at it, and that's how you get the air - the volatile molecules up into the back of a nose where those receptors are sitting, waiting for whatever the smell is. But you described there's different kinds of sniffers. Am I a typical sniffer or atypical sniffer?  Dr. GILBERT: You're a moderate sort of sniffer.  PALCA: Moderate sniffer.  Dr. GILBERT: Yeah. There's some people who are very delicate. If you hand them a new smell in a bottle, they'll just take tentative little sniffs, and other people, like all kind of honkers, who are just. . .  (Soundbite of sniffing)  Dr. GILBERT: You know, really just inhaling again and again and again. I think they're going to hurt themselves. And every person has a kind of typical way of sampling smell. And again, you know, you can tell behind the - when I test subjects behind the screen, I can hear on the other side of the screen how they're sniffing, and I know if somebody takes 20 minutes of big honking sniffs, it's going to be a long day in the test lab.  (Soundbite of laughter)  PALCA: I'm just wondering now that, you know, so with loud sounds, you can damage your ear cells and the inner ear. With bright light, you can damage the retinal cells. Are there smells that are so powerful that it can knock out your sensors?  Dr. GILBERT: Not really as smells. I mean, if you, you know, if you get a face full of pure chlorine in an industrial accident or something, you can burn your tissues, but that's at the extreme.  PALCA: OK, all right, interesting. Well, I'm sure our listeners have a lot of questions that they'd like to ask. And so, let me remind everyone the number is 800-989-8255. That's 800-98-TALK. And let's take a call now from Ryan in Greenville - is it Michigan?  RYAN (Caller): Yes, it is.  PALCA: Welcome to the program, Ryan.  RYAN: Thanks for taking my question. I've heard in the news recently about the possibility of electronic transmission of smells, and I was just curious how that was possible, how the chemicals could be reproduced.  PALCA: All right. Thanks for that call, Ryan. Electronic transmission of smells.  Dr. GILBERT: Well, actually, I was involved in a startup company some years back that was attempting to do just that. Basically, the idea is that you get a code, and you can make codes for different smells in the same way graphic artists have codes for different sorts of colors, and the code would correspond to firing off a little set of chemicals in a pallet, in a, say, computer peripheral, and so, you could click on a perfume ad, say, on a screen, and somewhere else, the code will fire a little device next to you and you get a puff of that fragrance. So it's all in the software.  PALCA: There was actually - you mentioned on the book, which - and we were trying with doing something like this, the idea that you could transmit smells over the radio, and of course, right now, you can't, or at least not without specialized equipment on the receiving end. But you talk about somebody who played a joke on the audience once where he said, I'm going to play a tone now and you should smell something and call us and tell us what you think you smelled. And people called in and said, oh, I smell bacon or I smell something. And they were actually lulled into thinking they could smell something.  Dr. GILBERT: Yeah. It was Michael O'Mahney's (ph) famous experiment in BBC in England. There a lot of expectation that goes into what we smell, so it can bias us to expect certain things, good or bad. And in fact, you know, you were smelling a lime. In consumer products that are lemon-flavored, the expectation is that it - consumers more than just a simple lemon. If you actually get a simple lemon smell, it's naturally accurate, they're going to be disappointment. So most lemon products tastes - smell like grapefruit.  (Soundbite of laughter)  PALCA: OK. I'm sorry. I want to take another call, but I have to say, the other that really amazed me is that your smell is also affected by your expectation in terms of look, and you describe people who - you pour the same wine into two different kinds of glasses, and they smell it in a different glasses, and they think it's two different wines, even though all they're changing is the glass, and they're. . .  Dr. GILBERT: That's right, and if you have two different solutions with a smell in it and you put a little food coloring in one and other is clear, people sniffing the food-colored one will think it smells stronger.  PALCA: Interesting. All right, let's take another call now and let's go to Ken in Houston, Texas. Ken, welcome to Science Friday.  KEN (Caller): Hi. Thank you. I noticed when I about 13 years old that I didn't really have a sense of smell, and at the time, no one actually believed me. But was hoping your guest could talk about that, what causes that and how common that is.  PALCA: All right.  Dr. GILBERT: Well. . .  PALCA: No smell at all or no sense of smell at all.  Dr. GILBERT: Well, I guess. . .  KEN: Well, a really impaired sense. I mean, some very strong odors like ammonia I can detect. But often, (unintelligible). I really don't know what they're talking about.  PALCA: Got it. All right.  Dr. GILBERT: It's rare, but it's happened. I've met other people like yourself. When you're smelling ammonia, actually that's not the olfactory nerve. That's the chemosensory nerves in your nose, the same way you might be able to smell vinegar or feel the chili pepper burn on your tongue and on your lips. So it's rare. It happens. Other people have lost sense of smell by a slight blow to the head, for example, or a bad flu. So I guess you've never really known what you've lost in a way. So you might be prognostically better off than people who've known it and then lost it suddenly, I'm guessing.  PALCA: Ken, thanks very much for the call.  KEN: Well, thank you.  PALCA: OK. Let's take another call now and go to - let me see here. Is it Judy in Portland, Oregon? Judy, welcome to Science Friday.  JUDY (Caller): Hi, there!  PALCA: Hi!  JUDY: This is really interesting. I was telling the guy that, you know, was taking the calls from people that my big smell that I love is vanilla. And inevitably, when I'm at a perfume counter and they're trying to sell me a new kind of perfume, I'll go, oh, that's got vanilla in it, doesn't it? And sure, you know, sure enough, it does have vanilla in it. There's something about vanilla, even if it's masked slightly by musk or a floral smell, I inevitably smell the vanilla. And I was curious as to, you know, what causes that? I mean, just a personal preference or if there really is something in your chemical makeup in the nose that lends you to smell a particular smell?  Dr. GILBERT: Well, in the industry, vanilla's kind of notorious for being very - it penetrates through other combinations. That's why in the vanilla-scented or vanilla-themed perfumes, for example, are mainly vanilla. It's hard to work with it. And in itself in a laboratory, it'll leak out of any bottle. It'll go through plastic. It's just quite an aggressive smell.  PALCA: You know, the other thing, speaking of vanilla, as I was doing some interviews with winemakers in Bordeaux, and they were saying that if they want to make a wine popular, they'll put a little vanilla flavor in it because it makes people like the wine better.  Dr. GILBERT: That's right. There was a period where vanilla notes were very popular in colognes or perfumes, well, mainly perfumes for women, because they had a kind of edible quality. You smell that, you think cookies, you think sweetness, and it's very innocent and so especially for a lot younger wearing fragrances, it's a popular ingredient.  PALCA: But you know, just that last sentence you just said is really interesting, because you used \"notes\" which is usually a term associated with music and hearing and \"edible\" as in taste. So as if the smell can't stand on its own, it sort of has to rope in other senses which I think is just an interesting thing about smell.  Dr. GILBERT: We're always groping for metaphors with smell, but perfumers tend to talk about notes for individual ingredients, and they talk about chords or a chord which are combinations of two or three such things. And since we got a very musical sense to it, there's a guy back in the 19th century who had the idea that smell worked in a musical system, and there was kind of an octave system he had all worked out. I don't know he pulled it out of his head. He really had no basis, in fact, but it was an interesting idea.  PALCA: We're talking with Avery Gilbert. He's the author of \"What the Nose Knows: The Science of Scent in Everyday Life. \" I'm Joe Palca and this is Talk of the Nation from NPR News. And let's take another call now and go to Christie in Novato, California. Christie, welcome to Science Friday.  CHRISTIE (Caller): Hi! Thank you.  PALCA: You bet.  CHRISTIE: I am a mom of two young boys and I am fascinated with the smell of baby heads, and I'm not the only one, because even when you pass off your baby to someone else, they go oh, the baby smell. And then somewhere between, I don't know, two or three years they seem to lose that smell. It turns into a different one. So I've always kind of wondered about that. I assume it's something, pheromones, bonding, but I would like to know if you know anything about that.  PALCA: Cool! Interesting question. Thanks, Christie.  Dr. GILBERT: It's a great question. I hear it a lot, and I've experienced it with my own kids. There's that kind of clean baby skin smell that you get from young kids, and then I don't know if it's like they grow out of it. I think it has to do also with diet and things like that. I mean, to get indelicate with baby poop from nursing infants is fairly inoffensive. You start feeding them the solids foods and then the diaper changing becomes something you want your spouse to do. I think it's a lifelong process as well. Some recent work shows that there are reliable changes in character of body odors. People age from middle age and on. So that's just one of the many things as being kind of worked out now.  PALCA: You know, one of the other things you talk about in the book is how mothers can recognize their baby smell and find it pleasanter than other babies, even when it comes to baby poop.  Dr. GILBERT: That's right. It's not just yes, using baby poop samples from the various kids in the nursery. It's not just mom thinking her kid smells better or less worse than the rest. You can actually - you can back it up.  PALCA: That's cool. We have time for one more quick call now, Kathleen from Rochester Hills, Michigan. Welcome to the program.  KATHLEEN (Caller): Thank you. Yes. My husband has an absolutely awesome sense of smell, and it can also be kind of a detriment, he says. And I always tease him and say, well, maybe we can find out if there are other ways you can make money with that. Are there opportunities out there for such things where research labs utilize people with extra sensory that way?  PALCA: Kathleen, thanks. Interesting question. What about that?  Dr. GILBERT: Sure. Yes. He's got a future in quality control. I mean, you have to smell materials in the food industry, fragrance industry to make sure they're in spec, make sure something is not off. I mean, you could be a cheese inspector.  PALCA: Are there, you know, - I've heard about super tasters. Are there super smellers? Or do we know?  Dr. GILBERT: There are tons of super smellers in fiction all over the place. Salman Rushdie has written about them. That strange German novel \"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer\" is about it. But in real life, they don't exist and the strange thing is that in terms of testing sense of smell, all the tests, the best you can achieve on them is being average and normal. There's no test that shows that you're a smell genius. In fact, it's very hard to define.  PALCA: Yes. Can you get better?  Dr. GILBERT: Yes, absolutely. It's a matter of training, the same way that wine tasting, if you have enough samples, you know, presented to you repeatedly and described to you. You build your own kind of internal memory system for it, and you can learn it. It's very rarely a case of perfumers are good just because of their physical nose. It's their brain.  PALCA: And there's one other issue and we only have a few seconds before the break. But humans versus dogs. Are dogs much better than we are? Are we as terrible as we think or. . .  Dr. GILBERT: We're not as terrible as we think. And in fact, in many instances we're on a par with dogs, surprisingly enough. Although there are differences in how we function, but for pure detection, we're close.  PALCA: Really? Is there one species that is like the smelling king of the animal world?  Dr. GILBERT: I'm not sure. . .  PALCA: I stumped him. That's great.  Dr. GILBERT: Well, no. I'm a real proponent that we're up there.  PALCA: OK. All right. Well, you know, that's good. We've got to be good for something as human beings. I think it's fine if we are good at being smellers. OK. We're going to keep thinking about smell for the rest of this hour and we're going to talk to a curator of an interesting exhibit that's currently under way in Philadelphia. So stay with us. We'll be right back after a short break.  (Soundbite of music)  PALCA: This hour, we're talking about smell. My guest is Avery Gilbert. He's a psychologist and smell scientist, and author of \"What the Nose Knows: The Science of Scent in Everyday Life. \" And smell might not be the first thing you think of when it comes to work of art. But for my next guest, the olfactory experience is the art form. Jim Drobnick is co-curator of the Odor Limits exhibition. You have one more day to take it in so hurry. It's now showing or smelling at the Esther M. Klein Art Gallery at the Science Center in Philadelphia. Unfortunately, it closes tomorrow. But maybe Mr. Drobnick can tell us about it and see if it'll be somewhere else. Welcome to the program, sir.  Mr. JIM DROBNICK (Co-Curator, Odor Limits Exhibition, Philadelphia Science Center): Oh, good. Well, thank you very much. It's a pleasure.  PALCA: And if you'd like to ask questions about smell and this exhibit, please call us. The number is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-Talk. Why an art exhibit about smell? What were you trying to get at?  Mr. DROBNICK: Well, it's an alternative way for artists to engage viewers and visitors. Smell is one of those sensory modalities that tends to be overlooked within our very audiovisual culture. And especially, within the realm of art which is so visually identified, we thought it interesting to look at artists who try to well, either critique this kind of overemphasis on visuality and also to provide alternatives to that visuality.  PALCA: And so, how do you present art that incorporates odor?  Mr. DROBNICK: Well, there's two ways. One is to include very fragrant materials and another way is to create synthetic materials that, you know, recent advances in chemistry and synthesis has greatly increased our ability to fabricate smells, ones that exist in nature and ones that don't even exist in nature. So artists have been very keen to adapt this new technology to their own interests, and I guess there's a third way that artists address now, and that is through symbolic means as well. There is a series of videos in the show as well as a smell map that people can participate in. And so with these kinds of representations of smell, one can also consider how language and pictographic markings can also deal with smell.  PALCA: Tell me a little bit more about the smell map. That sounds interesting.  Mr. DROBNICK: Well, it's a piece by Jenny Marketou, and it's the third or fourth one that she's produced. She's done them in Spain, in Europe, and elsewhere. And she kind of looks up to tradition of smell maps which go back to the 18th century, and smell maps were created during that time in order to identify noxious smells. And this is part of the great sanitization campaign that developed into, you know, cities with grand boulevards, septic systems, and sewers and so on, but her map has a kind of different emphasis.   Instead of identifying bad odors or foul fragrances, she tries to encourage and invite the audience to identify smells of all different types such as flowering trees, bakeries, or pizzerias, construction sites and the kind of dustiness that occurs in those kinds of places. So it's really an attempt to increase people's attentiveness to the sense of smell in the city.  PALCA: Right. Well, and just finally, you know, it's too bad we caught you on this last day. Is there any chance that this exhibit will travel?  Mr. DROBNICK: Well, you know, smell works tend to be quite performative and ephemeral and also site-specific. So a piece like Jenny Marketou's smell map took an incredible amount of energy and time by the artist to situate it within the specific environs of Philadelphia. So well, there's a hope. There's a chance. There is nothing in the works right now but we're working on it.  PALCA: All right. Well, we'll stay tuned. Thanks so much for joining us today.  Mr. DROBNICK: Thank you.  PALCA: Jim Drobnick is co-curator of the Odor Limits exhibition running through tomorrow at the Esther M. Klein Gallery at the Science Center in Philadelphia. We're also talking this hour with Avery Gilbert. He's the author of \"What the Nose Knows: The Science of Scent in Everyday Life. \" And we've got a lot of calls, so let's go to the phones and take a call from Daniel in Baltimore, Maryland. Welcome to Science Friday.  DANIEL (Caller): Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. I've got a question I've always wanted to ask someone who might know. My 90-year-old dad, when he went back to the school in his 30s, he shared with me something he tried when cramming for an exam which was to slice open a lemon and sniff that while he was studying and then bring the slice of lemon to the exam, and try to trigger that mnemonic.  PALCA: Interesting. Yeah, mnemonic. That's cool. Let me ask Avery Gilbert about that.  Dr. GILBERT: Yeah, it's a very reasonable idea, in fact. He sort of hacked in his own way to the psychological insight, it's called a sight specific learning, you can see it in rats, you can see it in kids and adults where things you learn in a specific room for example, you can remember better in that room than in a different room later on. So, put the smell up and then recreate the smell, and you're more likely to, it's reasonable to think that you're more likely to recall the key information.  PALCA: Cool. Now, we have a question for Second Life from someone named Chuck, Chuck Beatty (ph). Are there perfumes that use multiple human pheromones? And maybe, before you answer that question, I should get you to tell me if there is a difference between a pheromone and an odor of something that you, you know, are they the same thing?  Dr. GILBERT: Pheromones and odors, that's a vexed question that's just now kind of being untangled. The idea of the pheromone is that it's a chemical substance that will cause behavioral effect in animals and insects. We think of it as mating pheromones for example, and the effects are very specific and rigid and automated. Whether pheromone effects even exist in primates, much less in humans it's kind of kicked back and forth. Martha McClintock of the University of Chicago thinks that pheromones are kind of a classy behavior that influences sort of at the edges of awareness and at the margins, but it's not going to be a dramatic effect.  PALCA: All right. Interesting. Let's talk a call now from Connor in Somerville, Massachusetts. Connor, welcome to Science Friday.  CONNOR (Caller): Hi. Thanks for having me on the show.  PALCA: You bet.  CONNOR: I haven't heard the whole thing so I hope I'm not repeating question. But, I have two questions. One, there's a phenomenon I've experienced and others have, you know, where a very particular smell will trigger extremely vivid memories, and you'll be able to know exactly what the memory was if it's the exact smell you've smelled sometime before. And I never experienced quite the same effect with either any of the other senses, vision, taste, tactile, nothing else. And I was wondering if you guest could speak for that phenomenon.   And then, my second question is with the way that humans have a sensitivity to a certain spectrum of light that we call the visible range and other animals could see more to infrared and honeybees and some birds can see more to ultraviolet. Is there a similar spectrum when it comes to smell? And are there, you know, smells that we just as humans can never smell but other species can?  PALCA: Cool. Those are two really good questions, Connor. The first one, smell and memory.  Dr. GILBERT: That's a very common experience, and that it's this kind of instant and highly vivid evocation of the past. It's something that is unique and it's appealing to smell because you know, in other modalities when we remember the past, we were learning something typically. So, in grade school we were learning something typically. So, in grade school, we learned the names of the state capitals and in adulthood, it's not remarkable to know the capital of North Dakota might be. Joe is shaking his head, I can't remember it either at the moment, but we made an effort to learn it once and so it's so not remarkable when it comes back to us.   Now, with smell, smell is kind of always covering its tracks, in a way. We don't make a conscious effort to remember every smell as we pass through it, and yet it can kind of leave a trail, procedural memories is what psychologists call it. It's kind of imprints itself on a series of events and then we come across it years later, just reawakens that whole sequence in a very vivid way, often misattributed to Marcel Proust the novelist, but as I pointed out in the book, he probably got it wrong and there's a lot of very good authors that captured the spirit of it much better.  PALCA: And what about - oh Bismarck, North Dakota?  (Soundbite of laughter)  PALCA: What about the other point of certain smells that are just beyond our ability but maybe some other species can capture?  Dr. GILBERT: That's probably true. In many ways, the natural smells in the world the volatile smells aren't there for us. Therefore, insects talking to insects, plants talking to insects and vice versa and we're just eavesdropping on these interspecies conversations that go on. One of the interesting outcomes of the new work on the genetics of odor reception is that we can see how similar our receptors are to those of mice, say, or apes or rabbits and so forth.   As it turns out, with chimpanzees, that kind of families of odor receptors that we have are very closely mapped on to chimpanzee ones. But even with mice, what the kind of groupings and here's a little speculation because we haven't nailed down a particular smell to a particular receptor, but it's very likely that what we're smelling in the world, in written large is what a mouse is smelling in the world and vice versa.  PALCA: Now, it's been suggested that certain smells are somewhat iconic for certain things, and we have some lavender there that came from someone's garden?  Dr. GILBERT: It's great. It's very fresh.  PALCA: It's a nice smell, but somehow, it seems to be associated to spinsterhood?  Dr. GILBERT: In this country, it is. Lavender's one of the favorite ingredients for aroma therapists around the world and it's a popular smell. It has a connotation of calmness and calming when aroma therapists talk about it, and it's used in a lot of products in Europe with that kind of a positioning. In this country, we tend to think of it as old ladies and grandma's closet sort of, it's not an exciting smell.  PALCA: It seems to me - I was at a field in France once where there was just rows and rows of. . .  Dr. GILBERT: It's still grown there, absolutely.  PALCA: Yeah. Interesting. All right, let's take another call now and go to Vincent in Long Island, New York. Welcome to the show, Vincent.  VINCENT (Caller): Thank you. How are you guys today?  PALCA: Good.  VINCENT: Good. I have a question in regards to why is it that when humans smell certain obnoxious odors that it makes us nauseous or it's making us want to be very sick? Whereas dogs who also have a strong sense of smell doesn't seem to be affected by odor in a way like that?  PALCA: Good question, Vincent. Thanks.  Dr. GILBERT: Yeah, excellent. I think it's because we attribute meanings to smells and that dogs have sort to have taking them at face value in a way. The smell of the dog is just a fact out in the world but doesn't have a value to it, and we start thinking about, oh, that's a smell of a horrible you know, blood and guts in a car accident or a slaughter house or something. We start thinking about the implications of that. I think that helps bring up the nausea in a way.  PALCA: Interesting. We're talking with Avery Gilbert. He's the author of \"What the Nose Knows: The Science of Scent of in Everyday Life. \" I'm Joe Palca and this is Talk of the Nation from NPR News. I guess we have to bring up one other question, two parts of the same question. I know I'm asking for trouble here, but men and women, different ability to smell?  Dr. GILBERT: Yeah, that's one of the issues where conventional wisdom is actually correct. Women claim to be able to smell better and be more sensitive, and we have to give them that. On an average, a woman can smell, detect an odor at a lower concentration in the air, and women are generally able to identify them more readily, more quickly which goes with the female advantage and verbal ability over us guys.  PALCA: But now, let's flip it around and so, women in terms of how they smell. That's a section in the book that I can't let go. This is the difference between male and female farts. You say, it's been scientifically shown that volume, ounce for ounce, women have smellier farts than men.  Dr. GILBERT: That's true. There's a research group using gas chromatography as you mentioned. Very cool technique and it's only been put to these age-old questions, has been argued for centuries, guys had been insisting that women are stinkier ounce for ounce, and they're correct. The offsetting fact, though, is that guys produce more gas, and so, I think it's a draw in the end, so to speak.  PALCA: See, I told you, Annette, we were going to get to that. Annette didn't put that down as one of the questions, but she's the producer, I get to ask the questions. And let's go to another caller now and take, is it Carthic (ph) from Apex, North Carolina.  CARTHIC (Caller): It is Carthic from Apex, North Carolina.  PALCA: Welcome. Welcome to the show.  CARTHIC: Thank you. Thank you for taking my call.  PALCA: You bet.  CARTHIC: I just had a quick question about the comment that there's an array of say a thousand of chemicals that trigger smell responses. Are there individual receptors for each one of these or is there a signature of interactions that each chemical trigger that then is read as a particular (unintelligible) by our brain?  PALCA: Interesting. Very interesting. What about that? Do we have a receptor for one (unintelligible) all or something or they get mixed up somehow?  Dr. GILBERT: That's a great question. Actually, there's a PhD to be pursued there if you want to. It's a really hot topic right now. It seems as if a given chemical will probably stimulate two to three or four more receptors to a greater or lesser degree. And just figuring out how they overlap with each other in the receptor fields, again, talking metaphorically, is of great interest in the neuroscience community now because that will help us figure the psychological code for how smells are transferred again from a chemical structure into a psychological coding and an experience.  PALCA: So, what's the worst thing you've ever smelled?  Dr. GILBERT: I'm not a fan of vomit in any form. I can do the diaper-cleaning routine, but the vomit gets me.  PALCA: There's one that I remember. Maybe, somebody, I worked in a lab, a biochemical lab for a while and there was this chemical that was used for staining DNA or something called Beta-Mercaptoethanol, BME, and I mean, they open a vial of that anywhere in the building and it was like run for your life. It's got sulfur in it. Sulfur seems to be at the root of a lot of not-so-nice smells.  Dr. GILBERT: Right. I mean, that's your basic fart ingredient. There's a lot of sulfur containing Mercaptant smells. I mean, that Mercaptants are, the mixture of them uses a warning signal in natural gas for example. Yeah, they're often the culprits.  PALCA: All right. Well, I'm afraid that's where we're going to have to leave it, very interesting discussion. I hope everybody has learned that smell is something that smell is we both pay attention to, admire, use when we need to, and appreciate for all the complexities that it has. Thanks for joining us, Avery.  Dr. GILBERT: My pleasure. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I'm Joe Palca, sitting in for Ira Flatow. Later in this hour, we'll talk about the science of smell, and how aroma has wafted into poetry, art and music. But first, they say there are a lot of fish in the sea. Oh, they sure do, but just how many crabs, fish and clams, are there? And where do they live? Those are some of the questions researchers from the Census of Marine Life are trying to answer. So far, the census researchers have listed more than 100,000 species and that puts them at about halfway, since they expect to find more than 200,000 different species by the time the census completes in two years. The census takers recently inaugurated the World Register of Marine Species, an encyclopedic database of photos and information about ocean dwellers from all over the world, and you can take a look at that if you go online at marinespecies. org. Joining me now to talk about the census is Sylvia Earle. She's an oceanographer and explorer-in-residence at the National Geographic Society in Washington. She joins us on the phone from Texas, where she's on a trip today. Thanks for joining us, and welcome back to the program, Dr. Earle. Dr. SYLVIA EARLE (Oceanographer; Explorer-in-Residence, National Geographic Society): Well, nice to be onboard. (Soundbite of laughter) PALCA: Good. It's that marine reference again. If you want to ask Dr. Earle a question and if you want to learn more about our topic - well, first of all, if you want to ask Dr. Earle a question, our number is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK, and we also have links to our topic at sciencefriday. com. So, Sylvia Earle, I mean, what was the genesis of this census? What was - why were we interested in doing this? Dr. EARLE: It seems like the logical thing to do, to know who your neighbors are, after all. If we were to land a spacecraft, and we are landing spacecrafts, on other parts of the solar system, one of the great questions is, is there anything alive there? And so far, we've come up empty-handed. No evidence for sure that anything lives elsewhere other than this planet, but we have not really begun to explore our own backyard, if you will. Most of the efforts so far have been concentrated on the land, and if you take all the exploration from the time that humans started noticing that we have other creatures around us and began naming them up to the present time, about 1. 5 million species, a large number of insects, quite a few plants, mammals, birds and the like, but the ocean has largely been neglected. And the Census of Marine Life is helping to fill that gap. We're just beginning. You mentioned that in the next two years, it is thought that we'll come up with something in excess of 200,000 inventoried. I think presently on the order of 250,000 have been given names somewhere on the planet by researchers over the years, but that's - really doesn't do justice to what we suspect is out there, the order - to may be an order of magnitude or even more than that. We're talking about the possibility of 10 to 50 or more million in the ocean alone that have yet to be discovered. Maybe it shouldn't be surprising, understanding that we've seen less than five percent of the ocean, let alone explored it. PALCA: Wow. Now, wait a minute. You said that there could be millions, and I thought - I was talking in the introduction about hundreds of thousands. Are we talking the difference between microscopic versus, you know, macroscopic organisms? Dr. EARLE: Not entirely, although until very recently, the microscopic creatures have been, really, largely ignored. It was imagined that they were bacteria, for example, going back to the 1950s, were thought to be in short supply in the ocean. Now, based on research that is forthcoming using new means of - using genetic testing, the DNA that is inherent in all living things, turns out that there are really probably millions of as yet unidentified. But even in samples taken recently by Dr. Craig Venter and that has been repeated by others - Venter is well-known for his human genome research, but others who have been working in other parts of the world using similar techniques. In little spoonfuls of water that are being sampled, as many as 1,000 unique kinds of bacteria are turning up, most of them in very small numbers, but a few in large numbers, and samples that are relatively close to each other are turning up not much similarity, not much overlap. PALCA: Yeah, wow. You know, one of the things that I was reading that seemed kind of interesting is this problem of naming, because if you've got people all over the world doing this, what happens when somebody calls it - somebody calls a little marine creature one thing and somebody else calls it something, and they each think they've discovered something new and they were talking about the same thing? Dr. EARLE: It is a problem, but through the new computer technologies that are available, we've gotten a big assist in terms of helping to bring resolution to this. And not so long ago, and I've worked with plant systematics myself, especially marine algae, you had to dig through piles of books and get in touch with all the experts and try to figure out if anyone had discovered previously or named previously a little critter that you thought might be new. Now, owing to - a part of what is involved with the Census of Marine Life, the Ocean Biogeographic Information System, otherwise known as OBIS, is keeping track of historic observations and new discoveries, and people can tune in to OBIS and get a lot of information in a very short period of time. And it doesn't mean that you can neglect the scholarly work of - in trying to make sure that nobody has discovered something like what you've got in hand previously, but it certainly is a big help. PALCA: We have people who gather at Science Island in Second Life to listen to this program, and there's someone named Laura there who has an interesting question. The question is, are we going to store the DNA of what we find? Dr. EARLE: Well, that's a tall order, but right now, personally, I know of no such efforts with marine creatures in a comprehensive way. But it does offer some interesting possibilities for what might be done especially for creatures that seem to be on the way out, and unfortunately, despite what seems like a huge diversity of life, and there is huge diversity of life, some species are in a very precarious state, and just as on the land, we've lost a fair number of marine species in the last 12,000 years, but especially in the last 100 years. And the pace is picking up, as we see the destruction of habitats in the sea. PALCA: Hm. Well, let's go to the phones now. Our number is 800-989-8255. And let's take a call from Sean in Amherst, Massachusetts. Sean, welcome to Science Friday. SEAN (Caller): Hi. How are you? PALCA: Good. How are you? SEAN: Good. Dr. Earle, it's an honor to speak with you. Dr. EARLE: Nice to hear from you. SEAN: My question is regarding - I'm going to pull over. (Soundbite of laughter) PALCA: Oh, good. Yes, please. SEAN: My question is regarding basically the fact that taxonomists and experts in, you know, physically identifying things are retiring and leaving, and there's no NSF funding, really, to - you know, you try to get an NSF grant funded to. . . PALCA: That's National Science Foundation, yeah. SEAN: . . . taxonomy. That's just terrible. How do you feel about that? And do you think that pendulum's going to swing the other way anytime soon? Dr. EARLE: I certainly hope so, because it's vital that we maintain that knowledge base. Right now, about - well, more than 2,000 scientists from 82 countries are engaged in this Census of Marine Life exercise. And it is a major concern, where are the youngsters coming along. One promising sign is that, just as in the early days of natural history, excitement on the land, many so-called amateurs got involved. Much of what we know about birds has come about because of the interest in bird watching. And now fish watching is becoming interesting as well. So, divers are volunteering their time to go out and count fish and to make assessments of who's doing what. And it all starts with knowing. People began to care once they know a little bit about something, and it's hard to care if you don't know. Right now, the ignorance about the ocean and who lives there and the nature of the creatures who're in the sea, it's pathetic, in a way, that the knowledge base, generally speaking, is so thin. But communicating what's out there and inspiring people to go see for themselves, everybody can be an explorer. Everyone has a potential for discovering new things, new species, by jumping in the ocean. It's true in your backyard, too, but it's especially true in the ocean. PALCA: Cool. Sean, thanks for that call. Let's - we have time for one more quick call, and why don't we go to Vicky in South Dakota? Vicky, welcome to Science Friday. VICKY (Caller): Hi. Thank you for having me on. PALCA: Sure. VICKY: OK. I have a question. I've heard that climate change is possibly going to affect ocean creatures first and maybe more. . . PALCA: Oops. Vicky, did we lose you? Well, I think we got the gist of the question, Sylvia Earle. Are the oceans going to see the effects of climate change? And will the census maybe reveal the changes that the climate is having on the ocean? Dr. EARLE: Absolutely. One of the vital aspects of this Census of Marine Life is to give us some idea of the diversity of life in the sea, where most of diversity on the planet actually resides, and to see the changes over time. That's one of the aspects that is most interesting about the census, looking back, what did occur, looking at what is out there now and also to project forward in the future. And the diversity of life is one of the keys to maintaining stability, and it's something that we should be very concerned with. We would like the planet to stay pretty much the way it is. These conditions after four and a half billion years of fine-tuning have finally come to a point that are - it's just right for human kind. The last thing we want to do is disturb it, disrupt it and cause great changes. But we're seeing that happen through the climate change, which will have a big impact on the sea as well as the land. Greater diversity gives greater hope that we can weather these ups and downs. And so, understanding the nature of what we've got and figuring out how to protect it is really very much in our best interests. PALCA: Well, fair enough. That's where we have to leave it on this discussion, although I'm totally enthralled with the idea of a class of hobbyists known as fish watchers. Dr. EARLE: Yeah. PALCA: But I'm all for it. I think it's a great idea, a fish watcher. Anyway, we have to go. Thanks very much for joining us, Sylvia Earle. Dr. EARLE: I'm glad to be part of the action. PALCA: OK. Sylvia Earle is explorer-in-residence for the National Geographic Society and executive director of the Global Marine Programs for Conservation International. When we come back, smell and the science behind it. Stay with us. (Soundbite of music) PALCA: This is Talk of the Nation from NPR News.

And not so long ago, and I've worked with plant systematics myself, especially marine algae, you had to dig through piles of books and get in touch with all the experts and try to figure out if anyone had discovered previously or named previously a little critter that you thought might be new.  Now, owing to - a part of what is involved with the Census of Marine Life, the Ocean Biogeographic Information System, otherwise known as OBIS, is keeping track of historic observations and new discoveries, and people can tune in to OBIS and get a lot of information in a very short period of time. And it doesn't mean that you can neglect the scholarly work of - in trying to make sure that nobody has discovered something like what you've got in hand previously, but it certainly is a big help.  PALCA: We have people who gather at Science Island in Second Life to listen to this program, and there's someone named Laura there who has an interesting question. The question is, are we going to store the DNA of what we find?  Dr. EARLE: Well, that's a tall order, but right now, personally, I know of no such efforts with marine creatures in a comprehensive way. But it does offer some interesting possibilities for what might be done especially for creatures that seem to be on the way out, and unfortunately, despite what seems like a huge diversity of life, and there is huge diversity of life, some species are in a very precarious state, and just as on the land, we've lost a fair number of marine species in the last 12,000 years, but especially in the last 100 years. And the pace is picking up, as we see the destruction of habitats in the sea.  PALCA: Hm. Well, let's go to the phones now. Our number is 800-989-8255. And let's take a call from Sean in Amherst, Massachusetts. Sean, welcome to Science Friday.  SEAN (Caller): Hi. How are you?  PALCA: Good. How are you?  SEAN: Good. Dr. Earle, it's an honor to speak with you.  Dr. EARLE: Nice to hear from you.  SEAN: My question is regarding - I'm going to pull over.  (Soundbite of laughter)  PALCA: Oh, good. Yes, please.  SEAN: My question is regarding basically the fact that taxonomists and experts in, you know, physically identifying things are retiring and leaving, and there's no NSF funding, really, to - you know, you try to get an NSF grant funded to. . .  PALCA: That's National Science Foundation, yeah.  SEAN: . . . taxonomy. That's just terrible. How do you feel about that? And do you think that pendulum's going to swing the other way anytime soon?  Dr. EARLE: I certainly hope so, because it's vital that we maintain that knowledge base. Right now, about - well, more than 2,000 scientists from 82 countries are engaged in this Census of Marine Life exercise. And it is a major concern, where are the youngsters coming along. One promising sign is that, just as in the early days of natural history, excitement on the land, many so-called amateurs got involved.  Much of what we know about birds has come about because of the interest in bird watching. And now fish watching is becoming interesting as well. So, divers are volunteering their time to go out and count fish and to make assessments of who's doing what. And it all starts with knowing. People began to care once they know a little bit about something, and it's hard to care if you don't know.  Right now, the ignorance about the ocean and who lives there and the nature of the creatures who're in the sea, it's pathetic, in a way, that the knowledge base, generally speaking, is so thin. But communicating what's out there and inspiring people to go see for themselves, everybody can be an explorer. Everyone has a potential for discovering new things, new species, by jumping in the ocean. It's true in your backyard, too, but it's especially true in the ocean.  PALCA: Cool. Sean, thanks for that call. Let's - we have time for one more quick call, and why don't we go to Vicky in South Dakota? Vicky, welcome to Science Friday.  VICKY (Caller): Hi. Thank you for having me on.  PALCA: Sure.  VICKY: OK. I have a question. I've heard that climate change is possibly going to affect ocean creatures first and maybe more. . .  PALCA: Oops. Vicky, did we lose you? Well, I think we got the gist of the question, Sylvia Earle. Are the oceans going to see the effects of climate change? And will the census maybe reveal the changes that the climate is having on the ocean?  Dr. EARLE: Absolutely. One of the vital aspects of this Census of Marine Life is to give us some idea of the diversity of life in the sea, where most of diversity on the planet actually resides, and to see the changes over time. That's one of the aspects that is most interesting about the census, looking back, what did occur, looking at what is out there now and also to project forward in the future. And the diversity of life is one of the keys to maintaining stability, and it's something that we should be very concerned with.  We would like the planet to stay pretty much the way it is. These conditions after four and a half billion years of fine-tuning have finally come to a point that are - it's just right for human kind. The last thing we want to do is disturb it, disrupt it and cause great changes. But we're seeing that happen through the climate change, which will have a big impact on the sea as well as the land. Greater diversity gives greater hope that we can weather these ups and downs. And so, understanding the nature of what we've got and figuring out how to protect it is really very much in our best interests.  PALCA: Well, fair enough. That's where we have to leave it on this discussion, although I'm totally enthralled with the idea of a class of hobbyists known as fish watchers.  Dr. EARLE: Yeah.  PALCA: But I'm all for it. I think it's a great idea, a fish watcher. Anyway, we have to go. Thanks very much for joining us, Sylvia Earle.  Dr. EARLE: I'm glad to be part of the action.  PALCA: OK. Sylvia Earle is explorer-in-residence for the National Geographic Society and executive director of the Global Marine Programs for Conservation International. When we come back, smell and the science behind it. Stay with us.  (Soundbite of music)  PALCA: This is Talk of the Nation from NPR News.

Dr. FRANCIS COLLINS (Human Genome Research Institute): An enterprise which seemed incredibly audacious when first proposed in 1990, but which did succeed in generating an essentially complete copy of the human genome sequenced by April of 2003. SHAPIRO: Dr. Francis Collins has run the Human Genome Research Institute for 15 years, where he oversaw the sequencing of all our DNA. That's essentially the human blueprint. His team figured out the proper order for three billion letters. Collins is retiring in August. (Soundbite of applause) SHAPIRO: Until then, he's still traversing this spacious campus, either on his motorcycle, or like today, on foot. I noticed in your talk that one of the first things you mentioned in addressing this group was the importance of teamwork. Dr. COLLINS: Absolutely. There are still a few projects that can be done by a lonely investigator, toiling away by themselves at the lab bench, but not very many. Most of the problems that are most exciting and most in need in of solving is by teams. SHAPIRO: And so the kinds of scientific problems that are at the cutting edge now are more multi-disciplinary than they may have been decades ago? Dr. COLLINS: They are. They are. I think that's right. The disciplinary boundaries, I think, are getting very blurry. SHAPIRO: Well, this is interesting, given your background, because as I understand it, you initially were not so interested in biology and didn't think it was a field for you. Dr. COLLINS: Much too messy. (Soundbite of laughter) SHAPIRO: And so now you're in biology in a way that combines all of these other fields, as well. Dr. COLLINS: And I love it - scientists working as team members instead of, you know, the almighty ego that has to rise above all other egos. SHAPIRO: Do most other scientists seem to share your view? Dr. COLLINS: I think it's coming around to that perspective. It's still tough. I mean, let's be honest. If you go into science, particularly cutting-edge scientists are going to have a bit of a competitive edge. SHAPIRO: Everybody wants a Nobel Prize. Dr. COLLINS: Everybody wants a Nobel Prize. I haven't met anybody who says no, that's not important or not interesting. At the same time, I do think - and maybe genomics has been one of the reasons for this - that the success of the team effort brought a lot of people around to the idea if they really want to make a contribution, they're more likely to succeed if they're part of a team than if they're toiling away in a lonely fashion, refusing to talk to anybody else about their ideas. SHAPIRO: Francis Collins is on his way to meet Khan Kow(ph) at his office. She's a post-doctoral fellow studying progeria, the most dramatic form of premature aging. Dr. COLLINS: Well, come in, and we can sit here. SHAPIRO: Using information from the human genome, these scientists are exploring fundamental questions about what it means to be human, such as why do we age and is there a way to stop it. Dr. COLLINS: Could that be telling you something about how the genes that are modified, as far as their epigenetic marks, are located in the three-dimensional nucleus? SHAPIRO: This is not exactly water-cooler conversation, but it illustrates part of why Francis Collins has been so popular. He can go head to head with the smartest scientists, and he can connect with non-scientists, like the members of Congress who sign his checks. Just listen to the title he proposes for Khan Kow's upcoming research paper. Dr. COLLINS: So pas de deux, you know, is the French description of a duet, a dance duet, a \"Pas de Deux of Cell Death. \" I have to think about whether that's a little over the top, but\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) SHAPIRO: His gusto for this work is obvious - gusto and reverence. In his book, \"The Language of God,\" Collins wrote: Science can be a form of worship. Dr. COLLINS: If you are somebody like myself, who has both a scientific and a spiritual world view, who sees that the universe only makes sense if you postulate a creator, that when you are doing science and you're discovering how the universe is working, you're also getting a glimpse of God's mind. SHAPIRO: There was another line in your book that really stuck with me, where you said for the foreseeable future, the death rate will be one per person. Dr. COLLINS: That's correct. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. COLLINS: I don't see that changing. SHAPIRO: That being the case, what is the ultimate goal of your work here? Dr. COLLINS: The ultimate goal is to try to understand the causes of human illness, to be able to apply that to prevent and treat disease. That's what motivates me. I'm a physician. I've spent far too many hours in a clinic or in a hospital ward, frustrated by my lack of understanding and lack of tools to try to help somebody who's suffering on the basis of a disease. The chance to change that, to deal with problems that have vexed humanity for all time, is an incredible privilege. SHAPIRO: The complete human genome map has provided insight into diseases, but it has not provided many cures. And with knowledge comes new ethical questions. For example, what's the value of knowing you're predisposed to Alzheimer's if your doctors have no way to cure it? Dr. COLLINS: I can tell you that having spent all of those hours talking to families or individuals about diseases for which we currently don't have much to offer, the idea that we would basically say, well, we're just not going to push this research agenda because there might be ethical consequences is not an acceptable position to take. One of the things I'm proudest of about the way that the genome project was set up and continues to operate is a focus on those ethical, legal and social issues. This was a new experiment. We haven't done it that way before. Generally, science has just kind of moved on. From the beginning of the genome project, we've put a substantial part of the budget into researching these ethical, legal and social issues, thinking hard about what is coming down the road, and what should we do to anticipate that to avoid unfortunate consequences. SHAPIRO: Looking down his own road, Francis Collins says he doesn't yet know where he'll go next. He says he's restless, and that's one reason he's moving on. And to mark occasions like his retirement, Collins has a tradition of rewriting songs. Dr. COLLINS: (Singing) Wasting away again with all this DNA. SHAPIRO: Jimmy Buffett recently had his DNA tested by a private company to make predictions about illnesses. Collins took that idea and sang this as part of his farewell at the annual genome picnic. Dr. COLLINS: (Singing) Some people claim that this is all just a game, but I thought I'd have perfect genes. (Soundbite of laughter) (Soundbite of applause) SHAPIRO: Dr. Francis Collins, it's been a pleasure talking with you, and congratulations on your retirement. Dr. COLLINS: I think it's been a pleasure. Thank you. It's been nice talking to you, too.

NPR's Richard Harris has the story. RICHARD HARRIS: He picked a few species that lived in the desert region of Madagascar, and in January of 2003, he set out with colleagues to observe these critters, including one species called Furcifer labordi. M: And when I got there, one of the species I was going to study appeared normal, by all accounts. You could find adults. You could find juveniles, and everything was sort of what I expected. And then in this species, Furcifer labordi, I got there and I found nothing but adults. I couldn't find any juveniles whatsoever.

M: Again, in the other species, everything looked as I expected. But then in Furcifer labordi, it was all juveniles, no adults. HARRIS: Karsten and his colleagues then knew this chameleon's whole life cycle is a single year. Juveniles emerge in one burst from their eggs in November. Next, this cohort grows incredibly quickly for a month or two. M: Then from that point, it's just fighting and mating, basically, until they die off at the end of the year.

He is a former deputy commissioner at the Food and Drug Administration, and a former administrator of the Food Safety and Inspection Service at the U. S. Department of Agriculture. WERTHEIMER: Now, I know you are not a scientist. But could I just ask you, how would salmonella get into a tomato? Professor MICHAEL TAYLOR (Health Policy, George Washington University): Well, there are any number of points in the process of growing and processing tomatoes where this can occur. It can happen right on the farm. It's very hard to generalize. WERTHEIMER: Is that why it's taking so long to figure out what caused this outbreak? Prof. TAYLOR: It's a very difficult thing to figure out, the cause of an outbreak of illness, particularly for fresh produce. You know, if you could go into the home of someone who was sick and find the bag of tomatoes from which they ate, and sample and test that tomato and link that to the strain of bacteria that made the people sick, it would be easy. But those tomatoes are gone by the time a case is reported, and so we've got inherently uncertain scientific tools that we're relying on. WERTHEIMER: And you'd trace the outbreak by starting with the victims and trying to work backwards? Prof. TAYLOR: Exactly. We can begin to link cases together using some really good, new tools to link cases of illness to potential common causes. But then finding out what that cause is, that's the difficult part of the process. WERTHEIMER: The estimates of how much this has cost the tomato industry range from 250 to 450 million dollars. How much does that weigh on regulators' minds when they launch an investigation, knowing that most of the people who will be hurt were completely innocent of doing anything bad? Prof. TAYLOR: Well, this puts the Food and Drug Administration and CDC in a very difficult position because they believe they know, or have good evidence to suggest, that a particular food is a cause of illness. They need to alert the food industries so they could contain that. It's a classic public health dilemma where there's always uncertainty in the information. You need to alert the public at some appropriate point, and that has impact, economically. To their credit, the agencies tilt towards preventing illness. WERTHEIMER: So whose responsibility is it really? Is it the government, or is it the producer? Prof. TAYLOR: There's a shared responsibility. I think the first responsibility does rest with the producers, the people who are in the food industry. There's a long-standing, and I think fundamentally necessary, role of government, of course, to set standards, to provide that independent check, to inspect and enforce standards that are effective in preventing these illnesses. To see to it that all producers are observing what we know to be the best practices for preventing these kinds of problems.  WERTHEIMER: Yeah, but producers are not necessarily in the United States of America where you can reach them. Fruits like tomatoes are produced everywhere and shipped here. Prof. TAYLOR: The FDA inspects about one percent of what's coming in. It's actually able to test only a fraction of that. And so the importer should be responsible for assuring that product produced overseas is produced in accordance with the U. S. standards. There should be a requirement that a foreign producer has the same preventive control system that we need to begin requiring here in the United States. WERTHEIMER: Let me just ask you how safe do you think the food system is? How often would you get around to take a look at an American food producer's plant, and say they're doing everything they should? Prof. TAYLOR: Currently, the FDA's inspection frequency is very, very low. I mean, you hear on the average of once every 10 years. But inspection alone will never solve the problem. The industry has to have an enforceable legal duty to have in place state-of-the-art preventive systems to minimize the risk of illness.  WERTHEIMER: And that's not true now? Prof. TAYLOR: No, it's not true now.  WERTHEIMER: Michael Taylor is a professor of Health Policy at the George Washington University. Thank you very much for coming in.  Prof. TAYLOR: Thank you. Glad to be here.  LINDA WERTHEIMER, host:  For the last three months, tomatoes were the suspected source of a salmonella outbreak that had sickened hundreds. But yesterday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the culprit could be jalapeno peppers which are often used with tomatoes. Whatever the source, preventing salmonella is a huge challenge. Michael Taylor joined us in the studio before the Journal's report came out.

I'm Melissa Block. MICHELE NORRIS, Host: And I'm Michele Norris. And we begin this hour with the small but dangerous superbugs. We're talking about germs that won't respond to the usual medical treatments, germs that are often the subject of sensational news reports. U: You may know it as the superbug, but its real name is MRSA, and it's a very dangerous bacteria. U: . . . new details in the TB scare. He flew halfway. . . U: . . . a staph infection that is resistant to antibiotics. U: The so-called superbug is killing. . . NORRIS: Public health officials would love to get rid of these bugs, but some scientists are deliberately creating bacteria that can resist drugs. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce has the story. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE: For scientists, the genes that cause antibiotic resistance aren't always scary. In fact, in the lab, antibiotic resistance can actually be useful. GREENFIELDBOYCE: In the laboratory, antibiotic resistance is used as a tool. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Dan Rockey is a biologist at Oregon State University. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Antibiotic resistance in the laboratory is used daily by many, many, many investigators virtually on - in every laboratory that does any molecular biology probably anywhere in world. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Here's why. Suppose you have a dish of bacteria and you want to insert some extra DNA. Only some of the bacteria in your lab dish will take up the new DNA. How do you know which ones? Rockey says it's easy. If the bit of DNA you stick in there carries a gene for antibiotic resistance, you can just douse all the bacteria with that antibiotic. This will kill the unchanged bacteria, and the ones that are left are the ones with the extra DNA. GREENFIELDBOYCE: It's a quick and easy tool for knowing that you've gotten a piece of DNA into an organism you want to work with in the laboratory. GREENFIELDBOYCE: This doesn't pose any risks if the bacteria you're studying can't make people sick. But things get more tricky if you're talking about human pathogens, especially if you're inserting a kind of antibiotic resistance that the germ has never evolved naturally, and it might compromise treatment. Imagine what would happen if that kind of altered bacteria escape from the lab. Doctors might give people an antibiotic without realizing that it was useless. This is a potential risk to the public that has to be weighed against the benefits of the science. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Good morning, everyone. We're going to begin the meeting. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And it turns out, a committee at the National Institutes of Health is supposed to do just that. Dan Rockey recently went to this committee. He studies chlamydia, a sexually transmitted disease. To help his research, he wanted to insert a gene for tetracycline resistance. GREENFIELDBOYCE: We want the opportunities to do these kind of experiments in the chlamydia, with the goal of understanding how the microbe works and possible development of vaccine targets. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Now, chlamydia normally doesn't develop resistance to antibiotics, so Rockey was grilled by the committee about how his lab would contain the bacteria, and what antibiotics other than tetracycline could still be used. Finally, the panel said the plan sounded okay. What's surprising is that this was the first time in 15 years that anyone had come to ask permission to do this kind of experiment, even though antibiotic-resistance genes are a standard laboratory tool. That means either scientists haven't been engineering pathogens in a way that could compromise medical treatment, or they just don't know when they need to get special permission. GREENFIELDBOYCE: This is not, you know, a high-profile, active process. I think by and large, people don't think about it. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Louis Kirchhoff is an infectious disease specialist at the University of Iowa. He's on the NIH committee. He says scientists know to run their studies by their local bio safety officials. But if you asked those officials to describe what requires the special review. . . GREENFIELDBOYCE: I think you'd get a lot of blank stares. GREENFIELDBOYCE: For example, a researcher at the University of Maryland in Baltimore recently took a form of typhus. He made it resistant to an antibiotic that's sometimes used to treat the disease. He didn't realize that he had to ask the NIH committee. It learned of the experiment only by accident. The panel reviewed the work after the fact, and some experts pointed out this disease could only be treated by a couple of antibiotics. They worried about making it resistant to one of those drugs. Didier Raoult is an expert on typhus in Marseilles, France. GREENFIELDBOYCE: I think that you need to think twice. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That argument won, although the committee's vote was very close. So in April, the NIH director said this resistant bacteria should be destroyed. A University of Maryland spokesperson confirmed that the strains were destroyed, but said the scientist was not available to speak with me. Other researchers say there was nothing wrong with his work. GREENFIELDBOYCE: I'm really angry about this decision. GREENFIELDBOYCE: David Walker is a biologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. He wanted to do the same kind of experiment in his efforts to make a typhus vaccine. GREENFIELDBOYCE: All this work is done in a Biosafety Level 3 laboratory. It's done in a laboratory under high containment. The only person who could get infected with the organism is the person working with it. GREENFIELDBOYCE: It can't spread directly from person to person. Walker thinks it's basically impossible that it would escape the lab and threaten the public. GREENFIELDBOYCE: I'm a partisan but I was convinced that this was not malicious, not harmful, beneficial, and that it was not dangerous. GREENFIELDBOYCE: This example shows how experts can sharply disagree about the risks and benefits of making bacteria antibiotic resistant. And the stakes get even higher when scientists want to do this with potential bioweapons. The government keeps a list of these germs. It includes things like plague and anthrax. There are laws about what can be done with them. And a special committee has to review certain kinds of experiments, like putting in antibiotic-resistance genes that could compromise treatment. I called up the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ask if this committee had gotten any request to do that. And it turns out, it has. Over the last three years, more than 200 requests. The majority, well over half, were approved. GREENFIELDBOYCE: I'm actually surprised. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Gerald Epstein is an expert on biological weapons and science policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D. C. He says, remember, the NIH committee only got a couple proposals. Things seem very different for the committee that looks at potential bioweapons. GREENFIELDBOYCE: It appears to be that, not only that there are many more such experiments being requested there, but that - I don't want to say less scrutiny, but they're being approved more of the time. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Maybe more requests have come in just because the laws are stricter for these pathogens, so scientists make sure to ask permission. But if you want to know what diseases got resistance to what antibiotics, or why over 60 experiments were rejected, the CDC spokesperson says for security reasons, they won't give out details.

The International Olympic Committee is cracking down hard on performance-enhancing drugs. Anyone caught using them will be barred from the Games and from the next Olympics, too. We're joined now by Dr. Gary Wadler. He's a sports doctor, and he's a member of the World Anti-Doping Agency. Thanks for joining us, Dr. Wadler. Dr. GARY WADLER (Chairman, Prohibited Lists and Methods Committee, World Anti-Doping Agency): It's my pleasure. COHEN: Are you approaching testing any differently at these Olympic Games? Dr. WADLER: Well, we're much more aggressive. There's going to be 25 percent more tests done at these Games than there were at Athens, where there were 3,600 tests done. And actually, to go back to 2000 in Sydney, it will be 90 percent more tests being done. And our technology has gotten better. Our information sharing has gotten better. Our intelligence has gotten better. Our ability to target test has gotten better. So both administratively and science wise, we continue to move in a very aggressive and positive direction. COHEN: But it sounds like maybe athletes have wised up a bit, too. I've read all sorts of ways to avoid false positives, from diuretics to taking fertility pills to mask other performance-enhancing drugs. So how do you get around these sorts of things? Dr. WADLER: Well, we test for those masking agents, the very ones you talk about. COHEN: Earlier this year, 11 out of 14 weightlifters on the Greek Olympic team tested positive for steroid use. And then their coach blamed a Chinese manufacturer for giving them supposedly tainted supplements. To what extent can drug testers sort through all of these cases and determine who's really guilty and who isn't? Dr. WADLER: Well, we had, a number of years ago, a big problem with dietary supplements which were contaminated, which caused positive drug tests for a steroid called Nandrolone. That problem has been dealt with rather aggressively throughout the world. In addition to that, because of the nature of supplements, certainly in this country, we advise them that there's no guarantee that what is on the label is in fact what is in the bottle. There's no requirement for safety, purity and efficacy with supplements as there are with drugs. I think athletes are best advised to avoid them unless it's strictly under a medical guidance. COHEN: With all this testing, it's seems like there's a lot of effort and a lot of money going into it. Who's paying for all of this, and how much does it cost? Dr. WADLER: Well, the budget, for example, for the World Anti-Doping Agency, I believe, is about $25 million a year. Fifty percent of it comes from the governments of the world, and the other 50 percent basically comes from the International Olympic Committee. So it's a joint effort which started in the year 2000. Now, of that budget, about 25 percent is for research. So we're looking ahead to the future as well as looking at what's going on now. You know, we already have had three international conferences on the potential of gene doping, which is not, we don't believe, an issue, as we speak, for these Games, but certainly four or eight years from now might be, as gene therapy begins to be developed as a therapeutic method in the United States and around the world. We know athletes, some athletes, have already tried to become involved in that initiative. COHEN: And gene doping is basically where you transfer synthetic genes as a way to simulate muscle growth, pump up endurance. Is there any way to test for that? Dr. WADLER: That's one of the challenges. We're looking at that, and our colleagues in the world of genetics are working with us very closely. We've established a real close rapport. We just completed our third meeting, which was held in St. Petersburg, Russia, only about three or four weeks ago. COHEN: Gary Wadler is a sports doctor and chairman of the Prohibited Lists and Methods Committee at the World Anti-Doping Agency. Thank you. Dr. WADLER: My pleasure.

The New York Times says the rate is almost exactly the same as it was in 1965. In spite of the rise of the antidepressant drugs, crisis-hotline centers and better treatment of mental illness, we still haven't gotten much closer to preventing suicide.

(Soundbite of \"Law & Order\" theme) PESCA: Ripped Off From the Headlines. Scott Anderson joins us. Hello, Scott. Mr. SCOTT ANDERSON (Reporter, New York Times): Good morning. PESCA: I think the big misconception about committing suicide rests in the word \"commit. \" It makes it seem like people have a strong commitment to the act, but you document over and over that that's just not true. Mr. ANDERSON: That's right, and probably the first thing that needs to be said is that there's really two broad types of suicide. One is suicide that's rather premeditated, that people have been planning for weeks or even months, and impulsive suicide. And with impulsive suicide, a majority of them think about it for less than eight hours, and something around 70 percent think about it for less than an hour before actually going through with it. PESCA: Disturbingly, you quote mental health professionals who, maybe, don't even see that distinction as clearly as you do, because over and over again, they say after someone commits suicide, well, we know they were mentally unbalanced. That's called, I believe, in logic, a post-hoc rationalization. Mr. ANDERSON: Yeah. I was very struck by that. As a layman coming to it, there seemed to be a sort of element of circular logic to the whole thing. Because while most of us think of suicide as an inherently irrational act, if someone commits suicide, they routinely perform something called psychological autopsies after the fact, and invariably, or over 90 percent of the time, they decide that mental illness is the culprit in suicide. PESCA: Ovens, guns  and bridges, those were three things you talk about, three methods of committing suicide where, in every case, just a wee bit more inconvenience between the person who, for a second, wants to commit suicide and actually committing suicide. Just a little more inconvenience, and the suicides drop drastically. You want to talk about any or all of those? Mr. ANDERSON: Yeah, well, the first really dramatic example of how - it's called means restriction in public health school parlance - how means restriction can actually reduce suicide, and it came about completely inadvertently in Great Britain in the 1970s, when they - gas was switched from coal-derived gas, which was very high in carbon monoxide, to natural gas, which was virtually carbon-monoxide-free. And up until the 1970s, almost all of England was heated with coal gas. And about 50 percent of all suicides in Britain were from people, quote, \"sticking their heads in the oven. \" It was very easy to asphyxiate yourself with coal gas. With the switchover, it made it almost impossible to kill yourself that way. And over the space of about 10 years when the conversion was completed, the overall suicide rate in Britain dropped by about 30 percent, and it stayed at that level almost ever since. So, what it proved, really quite inadvertently, was that if you remove one means of people being able to kill themselves, the overall suicide rate would drop really drastically. PESCA: And this proves itself over and over again, no matter the method. With bridges, you know, the Golden Gate Bridge is a magnet, and there's always that debate, if we put up some barriers against suicide, well, some advocates say it would help, but other people say, not only would it hurt the look of the bridge, oh, what's it matter, they say, if people want to kill themselves, people want to kill themselves. But I think the statistic you quote was, they did a follow-up study, and of people who tried to commit suicide and have been thwarted, only six percent went on to kill themselves by another means. And over and over again, with bridges, it shows that just a little more inconvenience, a little higher barrier, and people will not jump off a bridge. Mr. ANDERSON: That's right. It's a very deeply held notion that suicide is inevitable. But in fact, over and over again, with barriers being put up, it's shown not just that suicides are, you know, eliminated there, but that people don't go somewhere else to commit suicide. And there's really famous case of two bridges, virtually adjacent bridges, in Washington, D. C. , where one was always the notorious suicide bridge in Washington, and finally in the 1980s, they put up a suicide barrier on it. And the opposition to it was, this other bridge is literally only 60 yards away, identical drop into this gorge, that people would just go there and do it. But in fact, people didn't, and that second bridge still doesn't have a suicide barrier up, and the numbers have never changed on that bridge. PESCA: Your article ends with talking to this guy named Kevin Hines, who jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge, almost immediately regretted it. He was also in a documentary called \"The Bridge,\" which was largely about people who have jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge. I have a clip of Kevin from that documentary. (Soundbite of documentary \"The Bridge\") Mr. KEVIN HINES (Sufferer, Bipolar Disorder; Attempted Suicide Survivor): The second when my hands left the bar, I said, I don't want to die. What am I going to do? This is it. I'm dead. So I said, well, maybe if I get feet first, maybe, maybe I'll live. PESCA: He's a really effective spokesman. I've seen him do a lot of media appearances. I don't think, before people hear him, they realize that a lot of people regret it instantly. Mr. ANDERSON: Yes. I actually talked to four people who attempted suicide who should have died. The odds were overwhelmingly against them, two who jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge, and two who shot themselves in the head. And all four of them said that they - the two people who went off the bridge, including Kevin, said the instant their hands came off the railing, they knew they'd made a mistake, and likewise with the two people that shot themselves. The moment they regained consciousness, or the moment they felt the impact of the bullet, they knew they'd made a horrible mistake. PESCA: You never connect the dots, but one of the implications I got from the article was it was sort of an indictment of the mental health community, just as far as the suicide rights haven't budged. You talked to mental health professionals who said, oh, they were suicidal. They didn't even know about that gas-oven study or incident that you were talking about. Were you disappointed at the mental health community and its attitude toward suicide, or its effectiveness? Mr. ANDERSON: A little bit. I think there is this element of myopia within the community of - I mean, I think they come from a standpoint of - like, looking at something from the standpoint that, well, of course, this is a crazy act. Therefore, the person has to be crazy. And I mean, I can understand why they, because of their training, they approach it from that angle.  My bigger problem with the mental health community is that the idea that everything is - almost all suicide is based in mental illness. It kind of raises the question, well, OK, where does that get you? Because even if you know somebody is depressed, somebody is bipolar, it doesn't give you any predictive power to figure out who is actually at risk to commit suicide.

BRAND: But first, a professional group of African-American doctors says it accepts the apology from the American Medical Association. The AMA today issued a formal apology for discriminating against African-American doctors and not allowing them to join the AMA. That exclusion led black doctors to form their own group many years ago, the National Medical Association, and Dr. Nelson Adams is president of the NMA. He's here now. Dr. Adams, welcome to the program. Dr. NELSON ADAMS (President, National Medical Association): Thank you. I'm glad to be a part of it. BRAND: First, before we get to this issue of the apology and your acceptance of it, please tell us what was your own experience? Did you encounter discrimination when you became a doctor? Dr. ADAMS: Certainly not to the extent that took place generations before me and actually just a few years before me. By the time I came along, there was residual, but the doors were essentially open if you were properly credentialed. BRAND: Well, so you accept the apology, but with some conditions, I understand. Dr. ADAMS: There's three things that I think we all have to begin to focus on. Number one, back in 1980 when Margaret Heckler was secretary of HHS, she produced a report and one of the findings there was that it was clear that a commonness between the provider and the patient often impacted in a positive way on the outcome. So number one, we need collaboration to actively recruit more African-Americans into the medical profession. There are fewer African-American physicians per capita today than there were at the very beginning of the 1900s. In 1910, we actually had more African-American physicians per capita than we do today. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: Margaret Heckler become Secretary of HHS in 1983, and issued the report in 1984. ] BRAND: That's a shocking statistic, or a surprising statistic. Can you flesh that out a little bit? Dr. ADAMS: In the early 1900s, there were more than 20 medical schools, actually, that focused on the training of blacks. And shortly thereafter, because of many things including institutionalized racism, these schools went the way of the dinosaur. So there's been remission in the number of opportunities for training, was a big part of that. Those trends continue today and with some of the actions that have been taken in recent years, as related to affirmative action and the like, have also had a negative impact. BRAND: And so what you're saying is that the result of that is that African American patients receive substandard care and are more prone to diseases like heart disease, diabetes, etc. ? Dr. ADAMS: Well, the two are certainly linked. The second point really deals with what you just talked about, and that's this whole issue of health disparities. A commitment to reduce health disparities among African-Americans and other communities of color is a must. I applaud the AMA and the NMA and other groups who came together a few years ago to form a commission to end health disparities. And that's a great first step. But much work needs to be done there, and we need a full commitment from all of us to do something about health disparities.  I'm saddened to say that the health of Americans is poor. We are in the lower quartile of health status of all industrialized countries. So for us to say we want to get to the point where white America is, is really not the point. All of America is in pretty bad shape as it relates to our health. A rising tide raises all of the ships, and indeed we need to raise the tide of the health status of our people. Not just some of us, but all of us. Dr. ADAMS: And the third point, which I think is extremely important, is as it relates to how you deal with patients. This whole notion of what's called cultural competency has to be raised up. And it's basically a need for communication. We suggest that the AMA and NMA work together to provide for a requirement for medical schools and medical licensing to make cultural competency mandatory. BRAND: Dr. Adams, you are the chief, the head of the National Medical Association. Why not merge your group with the AMA and make it stronger that way? Dr. ADAMS: Well, you know, many of us are members of both organizations. I've been a member off and on of AMA for more than 20 years. I've been a member of NMA for 20-plus years. And the reason is simple. It's a matter of perspective. No one will focus on the concerns of our community, the African-American community that is, like African-Americans. It's pretty plain, pretty basic. The disparities that exist are there because the attention has not been given. BRAND: Dr. Adams, thank you very much. Dr. ADAMS: Thank you.

The EPA has lowered the value of a statistical life about 11 percent from five years ago. That value's now calculated to be $6. 9 million per person. The agency uses that value for cost-benefit analyses when it's figuring out new regulations. Seth Borenstein of the Associated Press discovered the change, and he's here to help us understand it. And Seth, first, how do economists calculate the value of a statistical life as we're talking about here? Mr. SETH BORENSTEIN (Science Reporter, Associated Press): Much of it is the way we're paid to do riskier jobs. If you do a job such as in a coal mine and it's a job that's riskier than a secretary in a coal mine office, you'll get paid extra by your employer, hopefully, to do a riskier job. So economists look at how much extra you get paid to do riskier jobs. That's one part of it. And a second and lesser part is they ask people, would you be willing to do this that will be a little less risky, and how much would you be willing to pay to cut your own personal risks? So they take those and then they do all sorts of calculations that are just beyond most people and including mine's. (Unintelligible) then they come up with this value of a statistical life - it's a range - and then they come up with an average. BLOCK: So that average number is supposed to represent all of us. Mr. BORENSTEIN: All of us. BLOCK: And it has nothing to do with future earnings. I mean, the way life value is calculated, say, for civil lawsuits, things like that - nothing to do with that. Mr. BORENSTEIN: In that, we're all equal. It doesn't matter if we're 85 or 22 or two. I mean, it's called the value of a statistical life, but mostly it's about how much an individual person is willing to pay to reduce their risks. BLOCK: And it's assumed that'll be the same whether you're a hamburger flipper or a hedge fund manager. All the same. Mr. BORENSTEIN: Exactly. BLOCK: Okay. How would EPA, for example, use this value of a statistical life in practice? Mr. BORENSTEIN: Well, you know, when we all make difficult decisions, we make - many of us make pro and con lists. The government does that. They call it a cost-benefit analysis. And when they do that, you have the costs, which are in dollars and that's fairly easy to figure out. But benefits are in reduced deaths or reduced illness, and those are something you can't compare to dollars unless you come up with a dollar amount for a life or an illness. So they come up with the value of a statistical life so they can compare apples to apples. BLOCK: Give us(ph), for instance, a rule that the EPA might be considering where they would take into account the value of a statistical life. Mr. BORENSTEIN: Okay. For instance, an air pollution rule. And let's say their science determines that 10,000 lives could be saved by this rule. At $7 million a life, that's $70 billion. If the rule costs $80 billion and there are no other benefits, then EPA can look at it and say, you know, it's just not worth it. Now, if the value of life were $10 million and the rule cost $80 billion, they could - they would say, you know, this is - this pays off. Now, those numbers are just hypotheticals, but that's generally how you use them. BLOCK: Is the message behind this lower value of a statistical life - is the message behind that that we now are more willing to accept risk and don't expect to be compensated for it? Mr. BORENSTEIN: That's sort of what EPA is saying, that that's what the study showed them. But actually, if you talk to the scientists, that's what one study shows, their studies don't, and they're splitting the difference on two studies when scientists are saying they're giving a little too much credence to the study that says what EPA wanted them to say. BLOCK: It's interesting, Seth, because other agencies come up with their own numbers for the value of a human life, and they're all different. Mr. BORENSTEIN: They are all different. And White House is going back years, not just this one, have(ph) wanted some kind of uniformity in the value of a human life, and they just don't get it. Even in EPA, EPA itself is inconsistent because the Water Department ignores the rest of EPA and has a much higher value of human life, they never dropped theirs. But Department of Transportation, Homeland Security, FDA, they all have other values that are lower. EPA traditionally has been the most generous. They're just cutting back. At the same time, the Department of Transportation has increased theirs twice. BLOCK: But EPA's number is still higher than the other agencies'. Mr. BORENSTEIN: EPA is still the most generous, yes. BLOCK: Seth Borenstein, science writer for the Associated Press. Thanks for coming in. Mr. BORENSTEIN: My pleasure.  MELISSA BLOCK, host:  The EPA has made another policy change recently as far as what it believes you are worth. The EPA has lowered the value of a statistical life about 11 percent from five years ago. That value's now calculated to be $6. 9 million per person. The agency uses that value for cost-benefit analyses when it's figuring out new regulations.  Seth Borenstein of the Associated Press discovered the change, and he's here to help us understand it. And Seth, first, how do economists calculate the value of a statistical life as we're talking about here?  Mr. SETH BORENSTEIN (Science Reporter, Associated Press): Much of it is the way we're paid to do riskier jobs. If you do a job such as in a coal mine and it's a job that's riskier than a secretary in a coal mine office, you'll get paid extra by your employer, hopefully, to do a riskier job. So economists look at how much extra you get paid to do riskier jobs. That's one part of it.  And a second and lesser part is they ask people, would you be willing to do this that will be a little less risky, and how much would you be willing to pay to cut your own personal risks?  So they take those and then they do all sorts of calculations that are just beyond most people and including mine's. (Unintelligible) then they come up with this value of a statistical life - it's a range - and then they come up with an average.  BLOCK: So that average number is supposed to represent all of us.  Mr. BORENSTEIN: All of us.  BLOCK: And it has nothing to do with future earnings. I mean, the way life value is calculated, say, for civil lawsuits, things like that - nothing to do with that.  Mr. BORENSTEIN: In that, we're all equal. It doesn't matter if we're 85 or 22 or two. I mean, it's called the value of a statistical life, but mostly it's about how much an individual person is willing to pay to reduce their risks.  BLOCK: And it's assumed that'll be the same whether you're a hamburger flipper or a hedge fund manager. All the same.  Mr. BORENSTEIN: Exactly.  BLOCK: Okay. How would EPA, for example, use this value of a statistical life in practice?  Mr. BORENSTEIN: Well, you know, when we all make difficult decisions, we make - many of us make pro and con lists. The government does that. They call it a cost-benefit analysis. And when they do that, you have the costs, which are in dollars and that's fairly easy to figure out. But benefits are in reduced deaths or reduced illness, and those are something you can't compare to dollars unless you come up with a dollar amount for a life or an illness. So they come up with the value of a statistical life so they can compare apples to apples.  BLOCK: Give us(ph), for instance, a rule that the EPA might be considering where they would take into account the value of a statistical life.  Mr. BORENSTEIN: Okay. For instance, an air pollution rule. And let's say their science determines that 10,000 lives could be saved by this rule. At $7 million a life, that's $70 billion. If the rule costs $80 billion and there are no other benefits, then EPA can look at it and say, you know, it's just not worth it. Now, if the value of life were $10 million and the rule cost $80 billion, they could - they would say, you know, this is - this pays off. Now, those numbers are just hypotheticals, but that's generally how you use them.  BLOCK: Is the message behind this lower value of a statistical life - is the message behind that that we now are more willing to accept risk and don't expect to be compensated for it?  Mr. BORENSTEIN: That's sort of what EPA is saying, that that's what the study showed them. But actually, if you talk to the scientists, that's what one study shows, their studies don't, and they're splitting the difference on two studies when scientists are saying they're giving a little too much credence to the study that says what EPA wanted them to say.  BLOCK: It's interesting, Seth, because other agencies come up with their own numbers for the value of a human life, and they're all different.  Mr. BORENSTEIN: They are all different. And White House is going back years, not just this one, have(ph) wanted some kind of uniformity in the value of a human life, and they just don't get it. Even in EPA, EPA itself is inconsistent because the Water Department ignores the rest of EPA and has a much higher value of human life, they never dropped theirs.  But Department of Transportation, Homeland Security, FDA, they all have other values that are lower. EPA traditionally has been the most generous. They're just cutting back. At the same time, the Department of Transportation has increased theirs twice.  BLOCK: But EPA's number is still higher than the other agencies'.

I'm Liane Hansen.  There are few things more scary to farmers than the threat of foot and mouth disease.  If that devastating animal virus ever spread through the United States, it could force farmers to slaughter millions of pigs, cows, and other livestock.   Foot and mouth is considered so hazardous and so contagious that for decades, the only laboratory in the country to study it was located on an isolated island off the New York coast.  Now, the government is thinking of moving that lab to the mainland.  NPR's Adam Hochberg traveled to Plum Island, New York to find out why. ADAM HOCHBERG:  For more than 50 years, a small sliver of land in Long Island Sound has been America's first layer of defense against a veterinary catastrophe.  It's here in the secluded laboratories of Plum Island that scientists study some of the world's most dangerous animal pathogens, germs so infectious that the government takes extreme measures to make sure what's studied on Plum Island stays on Plum Island. Unidentified Woman #1:  The U. S. department of Homeland Security and Field Support Service and Transportation Department welcome you to Plum Island. HOCHBERG:  The Island's 300 employees, as well as its occasional visitors come and go on heavily guarded ferry boats, and anybody who steps inside the animal labs has to follow a strict hygiene regimen the minute they walk out.  They're required to shower, shampoo their hair, and clean under their fingernails.  Director Larry Barrett says there's even a rule that they clear their throats and spit. Dr. LARRY BARRETT (Director, Plum Island Animal Disease Center):  The concern there is that, if you're with an animal that is breathing foot and mouth disease, that you could carry it in your nasal cavities and your throat.  And so when you come out, it's expected that you also expectorate and clear your throat and blow your nose. HOCHBERG:  Barrett says those rules exist for the same reason the government put this lab on an island in the first place, because foot and mouth and the other viruses studied here are among the most contagious known to man.  Though they don't cause illness in human, they theoretically could hitch a ride off the island in a person's throat or on skin or clothes.  From there, Barrett says they could infect livestock on the mainland and cause a national crisis. Dr. BARRETT:  If you have an animal that's infected with foot and mouth disease, they quarantine and restrict travel and everything in that area while they're going in and trying to eradicate the disease because it is so contagious. And it could be a 20-billion-dollar impact on our society if you have an outbreak in this country. Unidentified Woman #2:  This is what they call a magnetic particle processor. HOCHBERG:  Since 1954, the scientists in these labs have been studying foot and mouth disease and working on vaccines and other measures to prevent it.  While there have been outbreaks in Great Britain and elsewhere during that time, the U. S. has remained disease free.   But federal officials say Plum Island is becoming obsolete.  They say its labs are small and ill-equipped to deal with new, more dangerous pathogens, while the remote location makes it expensive to operate.   The Department of Homeland Security is considering building a replacement, this time not on an island, but on the U. S. mainland.  The agency's Jamie Johnson says, unlike when Plum Island was built, an up-to-date lab doesn't need to be surrounded by water to be safe. Mr. JAMIE JOHNSON (Director, Office of National Laboratories, Department of Homeland Security): Modern bio containment technology, it's proven. It works.  We plan to take advantage of the full suite of bio containment technologies.  All the security protocol, they go with that to make sure this is the safest facility around. HOCHBERG:  Homeland Security is considering five sites for what it's calling the National Bio and Agro Defense Facility. They're in Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Texas.  The new lab would study foot and mouth and the other animal diseases currently at Plum Island, plus additional pathogens that are contagious in both animals and humans.   Political leaders in each of the five states are competing to attract the 450-million-dollar project and the hundreds of jobs it would bring.  Tom Thornton of the Kansas Bioscience Authority says it belongs there because of the state's strong agricultural heritage. Mr. THOMAS THORNTON (President, Kansas Bioscience Authority):  We should, by all rights, be the best place to put this large federal lab.  And on the merits, it ought to be here. HOCHBERG:  While Athens, Georgia Chamber of Commerce President Doc Eldridge says the lab is a natural fit for his college town. Mr. DOC ELDRIDGE (President, Athens Area Chamber of Commerce):  We think that this is who we are.  This is where the site needs to be. HOCHBERG:  One Texas leader refers to the facility as the next great federal laboratory.  Mississippi Senator Thad Cochran says it would put his state on the cutting edge of research.  And the president of the University of North Carolina says he couldn't be more excited his state's a finalist.  But all that enthusiasm isn't shared by some people who live close to the proposed sites. Unidentified Children: (Singing) Won't you keep the labs offshore, Hallelujah.   Don't bring death to our front door, Hallelujah. HOCHBERG:  These children were part of a protest in North Carolina, where opponents worry about the lab's potential danger and don't trust Homeland Security to run it safely.  They know Plum Island has had accidents in the past.  The most significant in 1978, when the foot and mouth virus somehow infected livestock in a holding pen. That release was confined to the island.   But to opponents, it's an example of why the lab should remain offshore.  At a question and answer session in Creedmoor, North Carolina, local resident Susan Smith (ph) had just one question for federal officials. Ms. SUSAN SMITH (North Carolina Resident):  What do we have to do to make you go away? (Soundbite of cheering) HOCHBERG:  Similar opposition has cropped up around some of the other sites, and several farm groups are skeptical of the plan, as well, fearing a repeat of Britain's 2001 foot and mouth outbreak, which led to the slaughter of six million animals.  In Congress, Michigan Democrat John Dingle chairs a House committee studying the biolab project.  And he says he's baffled by plans to move the facility off Plum Island. Representative JOHN DINGLE (Democrat, Michigan):  The chances of foot mouth disease getting loose from an island are significantly less than if you have if it in the middle of a major agricultural state full of cows and sheep and pigs, all subject to the risk of this kind of disease. HOCHBERG:  Federal officials say they haven't ruled out building the new lab here on Plum Island, though they say that likely would be the most expensive option.  And people who work on the island say critics are overstating the facility's risks.  Luis Rodriguez is a researcher for the agriculture department, which works side by side with Homeland Security in Plum Island's labs. Mr. LUIS RODRIGUEZ (Research Leader, Animal Disease Center):  There is a lot of things that have been written about Plum Island, and maybe the U. S. D. A. was not the best in PR.  However, with the biosafety measures that we currently have, I would not hesitate to live next door to a laboratory like this. HOCHBERG:  Homeland Security hopes to announce a location for the lab by the end of the year, and agency officials have been clear they have no intention of forcing the facility on a community that doesn't want it.  They say they remain optimistic they'll be able to persuade neighbors, farmers, and skeptical members of Congress that the world's most dangerous diseases can safely be studied onshore.

A federal appeals court recently upheld that South Dakota law. Slate. com's Will Saletan is here, and he's also written a book about the abortion laws. Hi Will. Mr. WILL SALETAN (Slate, Author \" Bearing Right: How Conservatives Won the Abortion War\"): Hey Madeleine, how are you? BRAND: Fine, thank you. Will, Planned Parenthood had objected to this law, saying that it basically forces doctors to say things they may not think are true, or that these things are more ideological than indeed factual, but the court did not agree with that. Why not? Mr. SALETAN: Well, the court decided that the statement was not ideological since there was some biology behind that. It's a claim not about whether the embryo was a person, but about whether it's a human being, and about whether certain biological statements apply to it, and therefore it was not forcing ideological speech on doctors. BRAND: Still, that term human being, and when life starts, that is intensely debated. Mr. SALETAN: Yes. It's really hard to figure out what the term human being means, if it's not intended to have some sort of moral weight. I mean, think about it, the entire point of this law is to discourage women from having abortions. Frankly, you can't do that with medical information, so you have to either slant the medical information, or present it selectively, or tint it a little bit in a moral way. And, you know, it's really hard to see how you'll accomplish that objective without making an ideological statement. BRAND: Now, what about the First Amendment rights here. Is it possible? Can, legally, a state force a doctor to say something that this doctor may not want to say? Mr. SALETAN: Well, yes. Doctors may object to things that the state says they should say. There's an open question then, as to whether the statement is somehow medically inaccurate, or not. The really interesting question to me is, what happens when a doctor does, with this kind of moral or ideological statement, the same thing that a doctor might do with some medical information that the doctor has a disagreement with? That is to say, the doctor will say, yes, you know, there are studies that have said such and such; yes, you've heard that on television or what not. But my professional opinion is, that's bogus. Can the doctor do that in this case? We really don't know what's going to happen until a doctor gets brought in for doing that. BRAND: South Dakota has a ballot initiative on the November ballot that would essentially outlaw most abortions, except in the cases of rape or incest, or the life of the mother. And they tried this before a couple of years ago; it failed. Why is South Dakota so keen on anti-abortion rules and laws? Mr. SALETAN: I don't know, state to state. There are certain states that are just known. If you are a pro-life political strategist, these are the states where you can bring the most aggressive kinds of legislation. Louisiana is one, South Dakota is another. They simply have a more receptive population or legislature. Polling data is used, legislative scorecards are used, to assess what are the best places to bring these. But you know, South - you can just count on it that South Dakota will be one of the pioneering states, whenever there is a new kind of legislation, and that is why it is a very good place to watch if you care about this issue, and you're looking for what is the next kind of legislation coming down the pike.

First, do no harm. That's one of the tenets of medicine. But what happens when doctors prevent their own colleagues from serving the greater good? According to a new report, that's exactly what happened, when for decades white American doctors shut their black colleagues out of the profession. Last week, the American Medical Association issued a formal apology for its, quote, \"past history of racial inequality towards African-American physicians. \" Harriet Washington is a medical ethicist and co-authored the AMA report. She joins us now. Harriet, welcome back to the show. Ms. HARRIET WASHINGTON (Medical Ethicist; Co-Author of AMA Report): Hello, Farai. Thank you so much for having me. CHIDEYA: So the AMA was founded in the 1840s and this legacy of discrimination that you helped document has its roots back in 1870, when a group of black doctors tried to become members. Tell us that story. Ms. WASHINGTON: Precisely. In 1870, three physicians, black physicians, tried to be seated as delegates at the AMA convention. Being seated as a delegate was the usual prerequisite to membership. But they were rejected. They were not allowed to take their seats, not allowed to participate. The AMA later explained that it wasn't because of their race, but because they belonged to organizations that admitted - gasp - women, and also admitted what the AMA called non-traditional practitioners. Practitioners of natural medicine, Thompsonsim (ph), hydrotherapy and homeopathy.  However, they AMA had also seated other delegates, other physicians, who also belonged to groups that accepted these people, so that could not have been the reason. The AMA claimed that they didn't practice racial discrimination. In fact, after this event, when the National Medical Association and other organizations decried their failure to seat the blacks, they passed a resolution part of their own guidelines, saying that they would not discriminate racially. But they did, and they continued to do so well into, and I would say almost completely through the civil rights era. CHIDEYA: Well, what effect did this have on black doctors? Ms. WASHINGTON: The effect has been devastating. And one can see the legacy of this discrimination even today. Look at the numbers of black physicians. The estimates range from - no one's quite sure how many there are, which is interesting. But the estimates range from two to three percent to six percent. Even if one takes the higher six percent number, we're talking about a number of black physicians that's roughly half what it should be, blacks being 12. 2 percent of the population. So we have fewer black physicians. But the damage doesn't stop there. We have fewer black physicians, we have a ruptured trust between black physicians and black patients, and the American Medical Association. Part of the legacy of this very tragic history is that many physicians and patients simply don't believe the American Medical Association is looking out for its interests and advocates on behalf of them as well as white physicians.  We also have a lack - besides a lack of racial diversity in medicine, we also have this haunting problem of healthcare disparities, this huge gap in the health between whites and blacks. And I also lay this in part to the American Medical Association policies. Because by excluding black physicians, they excluded physicians that had a bank of trust with patients and who had specialized knowledge of the challenges facing black patients. By excluding these people and by telegraphing their lack of concern for black patience by countenancing segregation, the AMA has unfortunately contributed to this problem. So, I'm sorry. CHIDEYA: Let me jump in, because how did this whole apology come about? I mean, you've written a book called \"Medical Apartheid,\" but how did they put together a team to look into this, and why did they decide to apologize? Ms. WASHINGTON: Well, the - I would trace it - I think that there are a lot of places you could point to and say it's a possible beginning. But I personally trace it to 2005, when John C. Nelson, who was then president of the American Medical Association, addressed the black physicians' group, the National Medical Association. Dr. Nelson made a personal apology for the policies and practices of the American Medical Association. Of course, it had to be a personal apology because it had not been promulgated by the group itself, but the fact that he was the AMA president certainly was not lost upon people who heard him. And that's where I date my hope that, you know, there would be an eventual apology. It's not coincidentally, that same year, we were commissioned to do an independent history, the AMA promised not to be involved. And it wasn't involved. The group of experts, including myself, we decided what the parameters would be, how we would address it, what the paper would look like and what avenues we were going to research. And we hoped that after this paper was published and that the history was revealed, we hoped that eventually the American Association would be moved to apologize. But probably no one was more surprised that myself when the AMA opted to apologize immediately. I found that very heartening. CHIDEYA: Practically, in terms of how it could affect people, what does this apology do? Because it's targeted at physicians, not directly at patients. But do you think it will have a ripple effect at all on American medicine? Ms. WASHINGTON: I think the effect will be two fold, the effect of the apology itself I think will effect Americans, specifically black patients, as well as black physicians. Because, black patients - it's true it's directed at physicians but black patients have watched and are well aware of this troubling history between the AMA and the National Medical Association. Black patients - there are black patients who are alive today who are doing the civil rights movement saw, that the American Medical Association opposed Medicare, opposed Medicaid, did not support the efforts of black physicians to be admitted to practice into hospitals - into specialty practice. They saw this and they quite logically came to me at the American Association - Medical Association as not working in their best interest. And I think that the apology will be cathartic, it's not enough, but it's a necessary first step and an important first step. I think the real import of the apology can only been seen in concert with the AMA's behavior.  And when I look at the AMA's behavior over the past years, I'm very heartened, it elected its first black president in the mid-1990's, and has already been working with the National Medical Association, as well as the Hispanic Doctors Association on a project called, The Commission to End Health Care Disparities in which the black and white physicians and Hispanic physicians are all working together trying to close this racialized health gap. So, I think that the apology itself will have some input, but I think it's going to have its best input in conjunction with a new found association of equals, with black physicians. CHIDEYA: Well, Harriet thanks again. Ms. WASHINGTON: Thank you, Farai. CHIDEYA: Harriet Washington, is a medical ethicist, she co-authored a recent report in the journal of the American Medical Association, it's called, \"African and American Physicians and Organized Medicine 1846 to 1968, Origins of a Racial Divide,\" she's also author of the book, \"Medical Apartheid: The Dark History of Medical Experimentation on Black Americans from Colonial Times to the Present. \" She joined us from our studios in New York City.

Flooding in June destroyed thousands of homes and buildings and bridges. And include this in the losses, four billion dollars worth of corn and soybeans. NPR's Noah Adams spent Iowa days with a guy who drives around in a truck helping farmers who still do have crops growing. Here's Noah's piece about a man whose license plate reads \"Crop Doc\". NOAH ADAMS: The flood of '08. They'll be telling stories about it the same way they talk about the '93 flood. Jim Fawcett worked that one too. He has 20 years on the job with Iowa State University. He's an agronomist. A crop specialist with the University's Extension service. He's based in Iowa City, out at the county fairgrounds. How many dogs are here do you think? (Soundbite of dogs barking) Dr. JIM FAWCETT (Agronomist, Iowa State University): I really don't know. This is the first time I've looked myself. I've just been hearing it from my office and haven't come to look, but it looks like quite a few. ADAMS: It's a temporary home for the dogs because of the flooding. Jim Fawcett's been too busy with crop issues to go out back and take a look. Ms. DIANA COLGEN (4H Youth Coordinator, Johnson County): It's nice being across the hall from him because growing up on the farm and now not living on the farm, I still am on the farm by way of Jim. ADAMS: That's Diana Colgen(ph), a 4H youth coordinator for Johnson County. Jim Fawcett has a Ph. D. in weeds. His Masters is in oats. He has soil survey books for each of his eight counties, chemical reference books, and he can always turn to his colleagues at the university. Computerized Voice: Thank you. Your pass-code has been accepted. At the tone you will be the sixth caller in the conference. ADAMS: On most Monday mornings, Jim Fawcett joins a teleconference from the Iowa State campus in Ames, 140 miles away. Mr. MIKE OWEN: Good morning, why don't we go ahead and get started. We are filtering in slowly here in Agronomy Hall.  ADAMS: Mike Owen is running the meeting. His experts are ready, including a meteorologist with the upcoming bad weather. Unidentified Man #1: Some of the warm air may come down off the Rockies into Northwest Iowa as we approach the middle of July. ADAMS: Among the field agronomists, Michael and Jackson work around the state, there is much talk about rainfall, 2008 has been wet and chilly. A dreadful year, even without the floods. Dr. FAWCETT: We had some wind last Wednesday night I believe it was, so some corn went down without it. Some of the corn has started to look a little better, starting to have a better green color to it, but every field there'll be areas that are gone or  are yellowing. ADAMS: The teleconference is useful but quickly as he can, Jim Fawcett is out getting his shoes muddy. He is, after all, a field agronomist. And he has the eight counties to cover. He's worried. The price of corn is at an all-time high, but because of the weather, his farmers are having trouble growing it. Garth Gardemann turns off his tractor and walks Jim Fawcett over the crest of a hill. Mr. GARTH GARDEMANN (Farmer): I think it's the third time I've had you look at corn for me. ADAMS: And this time Gardemann has a swath of sick-looking corn up close to the fence line. He figures his neighbor farmers were spraying a chemical in a high wind. Dr. FAWCETT: These guys are so pushed to cover their acres. . . Mr. GARDEMANN: Yeah, and especially this year, just didn't have very many days to spray and so if its dry enough they're going to be in there and hope they get away with the windy days. ADAMS: Jim Fawcett will write a letter about the wayward spray. He offers to call the farmers himself. Some money might change hands. There are more stops throughout the day. Fawcett sees ragweed and water-hemp sprouting in a soybean field. The hemp hasn't been a problem since the '93 flood and rains. And he digs up a weak looking bean plant for diagnosis. Dr. FAWCETT: Its Rhizoctonia root rot. It causes a kind of a brick-red coloration near where the soil line is. ADAMS: To visit the farms and make the occasional trip to Iowa State in Ames, Jim Fawcett drives a Nissan 4x4. It's his own truck. The University pays the mileage. Does it matter to a farmer what kind of vehicle the agronomist shows up in? Dr. FAWCETT: Well, the first year I was on the job, I didn't have a pickup, I had a Ford Probe. But the Probe wasn't the best car to be driving through fields on. It goes pretty low to the ground and I think maybe it does matter some to the farmer. When you show up in a pickup, it looks like you're, you know, you know more about farming than showing up in a car. But I really need the pickup for some of the things I do. Sometimes I have chemicals, pesticides that I really shouldn't have in a car. I need them in the back of the pickup. ADAMS: Home in time for hamburgers on the porch, Jim and his wife Kathleen live north of Iowa City, a house by a lake. Dr. FAWCETT: Kathleen. Ms. KATHLEEN FAWCETT (Wife of Dr. Fawcett, Nurse): Nice to meet you. How do you like Iowa so far? ADAMS: Great. Ms. FAWCETT: Yeah? Has it been hot? Dr. FAWCETT: Well, we've been in the truck most of the time.  ADAMS: And for me, it's the guest bedroom overnight. The next morning Kathleen is out of the house before Jim starts breakfast. Both have careers helping people. Kathleen is a nurse. Jim is feeling the pain of a bad crop year, but that's just economics. Dr. FAWCETT: I don't know if I could stand the blood that she deals with, so this is a little more something that I can deal with. ADAMS: We decide to drop in on an extension service field day in an adjoining district. For the farmers gathered under an awning, out in a cornfield, it's a bit of socializing. The lunch is free and so is the advice. Here Brian Lang(ph) is talking about no-till planting. He is fast and technical. Mr. BRIAN LANG: Just kind of sort out what our yield's been doing for continuous corn compared to corn file and beans, compared to corn-corn beans, corn-corn-corn beans, down towards the bottom we got soybeans, following three years of. . . ADAMS: Our last stop on my visit, Jim Fawcett's old family farm outside Iowa City. This is where he grew up. This is where he hid in a basement from a tornado. His cousins run the place now, working hundreds of acres. It was his great-grandfather who built the house in 1896. It stands on a slight rise, sheltered by the old trees, a sycamore, a cottonwood. Dr. FAWCETT: I have a hoppocram just a jab too big (ph). My mom liked to come out and see. When she had to she went to the retirement home. We had an ash tree on the other side of the house that my dad planted, that got way too big so we had to take it down. But we're thinking we're going to replant some trees kind of in their memory. They're both gone now. ADAMS: Jim Fawcett's sister, just now retiring from a city job, has been doing some work on the home place. He says she plans to move in and become quite a serious gardener. Dr. FAWCETT: It looks kind of like tobacco. What is that? I don't know my vegetables very well. ADAMS: Why would your sister be growing tobacco?  (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. FAWCETT: I don't think it is, but I'm not sure what that is in the vegetable garden. I recognize the weeds, but I don't recognize the garden plants. (Soundbite of laughter) ADAMS: Back when he was 13, he started having leg pains. He had a congenital spinal defect. There was an operation to fuse the spine, but he figured he'd never be able to develop the strength to become a farmer, to do the lifting. However, he would be able to be a farm scientist.

Both have careers helping people. Kathleen is a nurse. Jim is feeling the pain of a bad crop year, but that's just economics.  Dr. FAWCETT: I don't know if I could stand the blood that she deals with, so this is a little more something that I can deal with.  ADAMS: We decide to drop in on an extension service field day in an adjoining district. For the farmers gathered under an awning, out in a cornfield, it's a bit of socializing. The lunch is free and so is the advice. Here Brian Lang(ph) is talking about no-till planting. He is fast and technical.  Mr. BRIAN LANG: Just kind of sort out what our yield's been doing for continuous corn compared to corn file and beans, compared to corn-corn beans, corn-corn-corn beans, down towards the bottom we got soybeans, following three years of. . .  ADAMS: Our last stop on my visit, Jim Fawcett's old family farm outside Iowa City. This is where he grew up. This is where he hid in a basement from a tornado. His cousins run the place now, working hundreds of acres. It was his great-grandfather who built the house in 1896. It stands on a slight rise, sheltered by the old trees, a sycamore, a cottonwood.  Dr. FAWCETT: I have a hoppocram just a jab too big (ph). My mom liked to come out and see. When she had to she went to the retirement home. We had an ash tree on the other side of the house that my dad planted, that got way too big so we had to take it down. But we're thinking we're going to replant some trees kind of in their memory. They're both gone now.  ADAMS: Jim Fawcett's sister, just now retiring from a city job, has been doing some work on the home place. He says she plans to move in and become quite a serious gardener.  Dr. FAWCETT: It looks kind of like tobacco. What is that? I don't know my vegetables very well.  ADAMS: Why would your sister be growing tobacco?   (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. FAWCETT: I don't think it is, but I'm not sure what that is in the vegetable garden. I recognize the weeds, but I don't recognize the garden plants.  (Soundbite of laughter)  ADAMS: Back when he was 13, he started having leg pains. He had a congenital spinal defect. There was an operation to fuse the spine, but he figured he'd never be able to develop the strength to become a farmer, to do the lifting. However, he would be able to be a farm scientist.

I'm Steve Inskeep. DEBORAH AMOS, host: And I'm Deborah Amos. A popular drug for men may help some women. There's new research suggesting that Viagra may help women deal with one of the more difficult side effects of antidepressants - diminished sexual function. But even some of the researchers caution that more study is needed. NPR's Joanne Silberner reports. JOANNE SILBERNER: How many women being treated for depression lose some or all sexual functioning depends on whom you ask - some experts say 40 percent of women on drugs like Zoloft or Prozac or Effexor. Some say 60 percent. Some say even more.  Julia Heiman, who heads the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University, points out one thing that almost everyone agrees on. It's about what some women on antidepressants do if they have the side effect. Dr. JULIA HEIMAN (Kinsey Institute, Indiana University): They may stop taking their medication and that maybe a serious outcome for them. SILBERNER: Their depression may come back. Heiman is one of the authors of a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. With funding by the manufacturer of Viagra, she and other researchers monitored 98 women with depression relieved by antidepressants but who had sexual dysfunction. Half took Viagra. Dr. HEIMAN: It seemed important to pay attention to sexual side effects and see whether or not this could be one method of helping alleviate them, at least for a subgroup of these women.  SILBERNER: There are reasons to think Viagra would not help. A large study failed to show any benefit in women who weren't depressed but who had sexual dysfunction. In fact, manufacturer Pfizer withdrew an application to the Food and Drug Administration to market the drug to women. To Heiman the new study is more promising. Dr. HEIMAN: What the study found is that the majority of women showed improvement in their sexual functioning. What that means is on a combined measure of how well they were doing sexually, they improved a lot in their overall response and enjoyment of sex. SILBERNER: But other researchers have their doubts. Psychiatrist Richard Balon is with Wayne State University. Dr. RICHARD BALON (Wayne State University): I just think it's an important study and it's important to do studies like this. But the results are not very impressive. SILBERNER: He's got two problems. Dr. BALON: Number one, the number of patients in this study is relatively small. And number two, even though it is statistically significant, the question is whether it is clinically significant. SILBERNER: That is, could the women tell the difference? Study co-author Heiman said the effect was enough for women to notice, but she agrees that more work needs to be done. Dr. HEIMAN: This study certainly doesn't answer all questions. And frankly, it should be replicated. It's not that - this study makes no claims to be in any way the final word. It's just a word and maybe a comment that needs to be made for women for whom both feeling better from their depressive symptoms is important, but so is the way in which sexuality fits into their lives. SILBERNER: In a statement, Viagra manufacturer Pfizer said the drug is licensed only for use in men, and it has no plans to renew its efforts to earn approval to market Viagra for women.

It came in an advisory sent to faculty and staff by the head of the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute. The advisory acknowledges that evidence linking cell phone use to health effects including cancer is controversial. Nonetheless, it lays out ten steps to limit exposure to electromagnetic radiation emitted from cell phones, including keeping children away from cell phones entirely. Dan Wartenberg is among the scientists who signed on to the advisory. He's chief of the division of environmental epidemiology at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. I asked him how he reconciles the advisory's warning with the lack of conclusive evidence. Dr. DAN WARTENBERG (Environmental Epidemiology, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School): To do the studies is very complicated, and we don't have really good conclusive studies at one way or the other. But I think it's better to be safe than sorry, and the easy precautions one can take in using cell phones that would reduce one's exposure to the radiation that is the concern and that's one's risk. BLOCK: Let's tick through some of the precautions that are - that have been issued that you signed on to. And one of them is to keep the cell phone away from your body and to use either speakerphone mode or a wireless headset. Why don't you explain, why do you think that would be a good idea? Dr. WARTENBERG: As the source of this radiation moves away from you, the strength of it decreases. And it's not just even linear. In other words, if you move twice as far away, it's actually one quarter the amount that you would have if it was right up against - you know, if it was much closer. So it reduces it and that's a useful thing to do, because then your exposure is lower and if there's any risk on virtually all instances, the higher your exposure the greater your risk. BLOCK: And is any headset as good as any other? Dr. WARTENBERG: The ones that are connected by a cord are a little bit better than the Bluetooth ones, the ones that actually transmit, but ideally, you use a speaker phone or the ones corded to your phones. Again, one of the concerns is when you put it up against your ear, you're sort of touching your skull and right on the other side of that bone is brain tissue, which is very sensitive. BLOCK: The very first recommendation on this list flat out says do not allow children to use a cell phone. Is that really necessary or is that a really extreme version of what needs to be done here? Dr. WARTERNBERG: It's probably more extreme than I would say. As I would say, again, limit, reduce the degree possible. It's - I don't think we can tell people not to use cell phones and I don't think we can really tell children to. Children are probably more sensitive than adults because if there is anything done, any adverse effect on the tissue, children's cells are - they're growing, so they change much more quickly, so any sort of problem is likely to be multiplied much more quickly in a child than in an adult. BLOCK: Were you concerned when you were signing off on these recommendations that these were things that may be overly alarmist, with so much that's not known at this point? It's not like there's any risk that has been approved definitely, that you could be carving a lot of concern among people who may not have any reason to be concerned? Dr. WARTENBERG: Well, I'm a public health scientist, a public health researcher. As such, I try and look at ways of preventing disease, and this is just another way of trying to do that. I think one tries to keep it in balance, as you're saying, so we don't frighten people unnecessarily. But in this case, they're relatively simple things people can do and still use their cell phones. So I don't think that's alarmist. BLOCK: I wonder, in your field of environmental epidemiology, when you think about potential risks and things we can do to minimize risk, you could probably stay up all night thinking of things that one could do without and be safer. How do you narrow it down to things that actually make sense? Dr. WARTENBERG: That's a tough question. And I think different people make the decision in different ways. I think we try and - at least I try and look at things were I think there is a potential risk. I think I'm more concerned about children as it can affect a larger part of their life. And I look at remedies that we might be able to suggest that are relatively easy to do, so that they're palatable and people actually might take the advice as opposed to saying something like, we should ban cell phones. That's not just going to happen. BLOCK: Dan Wartenberg, thanks so much for talking with us. Dr. WARTENBERG: Thank you.

I'm Ira Flatow. We're going to be switching gear now, talking about AIDS vaccines, because earlier this month, the National Institutes of Health announced that it would not go forward with a planned major trial of a potential AIDS vaccine, that more basic focus research was needed first on how such vaccines interact with the immune system before such a trial could proceed. The news follows the failure last year of another experimental AIDS vaccine produced by Merck.  So, what are we going to do now about the immune system and these vaccines and what more do we need to know? Do we need new thinking? A new direction for AIDS research? Do we need new blood coming in to do the research? More funding? Joining me now is a frequent Science Friday guest, Dr. Anthony Fauci. He is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at NIH, and he's the winner of the 2007 Lasker Award for Public Service. Welcome back to the program, Dr. Fauci. Dr. ANTHONY FAUCI (Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, NIH): It's good to be here, Ira. FLATOW: Tell us a little bit of the history. Why the cancellation? Dr. FAUCI: Well, the cancellation because the trial that was proposed was of a size and magnitude that, given what we know, or more frankly, what we don't know, about what we call the correlate of immunity, namely the kind of immune response that we're trying to induce in people who are vaccinated with an AIDS vaccine. I felt that we needed to do a much leaner, meaner trial that precisely asked and answered one question: does this particular vaccine work in lowering the viral set point to the viral load were someone to get infected anyway?  And we don't need a trial as large as was proposed given the failures that we've seen up to now. So, I would entertain a smaller trial, but I thought given the situation we're in and the fact that we know so little about these correlates of immunity that it would be more prudent to try and do a much more precise trial. That's the reason why I did not accept the proposal for the larger trial. So, I'm waiting to see and hopefully they'll come in with a proposal for a much smaller approach to this particular question. FLATOW: Was there fear on your part that we might have another failure, failure like that Merck trial? Dr. FAUCI: Well, it was less a question of failure than a question of the balance of resources that you put into what we call an empiric approach, namely taking a product and doing a large trial, not only to see if it works good, but also to see if you can get some hint of some correlation with a particular response, and perhaps the favorable response clinically in some of the vaccinees. What you alluded to when you were introducing the program was we're thinking much more now, towards turning the knob a bit more towards asking and answering some of the fundamental, basic, unanswered questions in HIV vaccine.  It's a very unique situation, much different than what we face with any other virus for which we're trying to make a vaccine, because mostly when you get natural infection with anything, polio, small pox, measles, you call it, the body makes an immune response that, for the most part, in most people, even though it causes death and disease in some, that people's immune system can respond, clear the virus, eradicate it completely from the body, and then allow you to be protected, literally, protected completely from subsequent challenge with the same virus.  Unfortunately, with HIV that's not what we have, because the history of HIV tells us that, for reasons that we still don't understand, the body does not respond adequately to the HIV virus. There are virtually no instances of people who once they get established infection can actually eradicate the virus from the body or even well control it, except some few people who have genetic programming to do that. So, we're really swimming in the dark. We've got to answer some fundamental basic questions of why the body does not make a good immune response against HIV. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number, talking with Dr. Anthony Fauci. You could not learn that from the drugs, not the vaccines, but the drugs that are used to treat people with HIV. Dr. FAUCI: No, Ira, it's an entirely different ball game, because, as you know, the drugs block the virus by having a direct effect on the virus. It doesn't impact the body's immune response to the virus. When you're dealing with a vaccine, you're trying to marshal the body's defenses and prepping it, so that when it sees the virus for the first time, it will have a head start in making a good immune response, and hopefully, as we see with most successful vaccines, block the initial infection or if not block the initial infection, at least protect the person from severe disease. So, it's really apples and oranges when you're talking about a drug verses a vaccine.  FLATOW: You write in the paper in Science about the need to explore new avenues and to attract new and young investigators into this area and maintain their involvement. I have two questions about that. Is there a shortage of new ideas that you're looking to come through now? Dr. FAUCI: Well, I would say less a shortage of new ideas than a shortage of good ideas, because what we've tried so far in a empiric way, hoping that by trial and error we would come up with the answer to an HIV vaccine. It's becoming very clear that we need to do some basic fundamental probing and answer the questions. The questions are clear. How we get to the answers is the issue.  Why does not the body make a very good robust response against the virus that's able to control it? We do that with virtually every other virus. Why not with HIV? We have some leads, but we really need to do those fundamental concept-type experiment, as opposed to just empirically testing a group of potential candidates for a vaccine. And what we say we want new ideas and new blood, and young people who really don't have a predetermined notion about what the direction should be, because that's the way science works. When you get these new fresh ideas, they give leads and then others can take up on them and that's how you get the answers. So, that's really what we're calling for, getting back to answering some of the fundamental question. FLATOW: Yeah. You write it very well. You write, you know, \"the design of a vaccine will require some enormous intellectual leaps beyond present day knowledge. \"  Dr. FAUCI: Right. FLATOW: That's - some - so you really want to just brainstorm this even more? Dr. FAUCI: Well, we want to brainstorm and then we when get the - a good idea to try and test it first, you know, perhaps in an animal model, and you note from the paper that we just put out in Science that we stress the need to enhance what we call the nonhuman primate model, so that we can get some idea. There's no animal model that's a perfect model for HIV, but some of them are pretty close. So, that's the thing that we really need to expand upon and perfect. FLATOW: And that's one of the mysteries - I think if I read the paper correctly, you get better results in the nonhuman primates and you can't transfer those results. Dr. FAUCI: Right. Exactly, and some of the models, you cannot transfer the results. Because in one of the models in particular, using, for example, the Merck candidate that actually was the disappointing results from several months ago, one of the animal models looked like they may have been protected from the high level of virus that you get after you get infected and they made a certain immune response. The humans made a similar immune response, but they were not at all protected, and when you looked at the vaccinated verses the unvaccinated, there really was no benefit at all. FLATOW: Then it sounds like there's something unknown going on here. Dr. FAUCI: That's exactly the point, Ira, you put your finger right on it, there's something unknown. It's not like the body is the experiment of nature with a natural virus like we've done with polio and with measles and with other virus vaccines that we've been so successful in developing. The body's natural response serves as, you know, your first solid experiment. The body already tells you that it can make a good immune response. Unfortunately with HIV, that doesn't happen and we have to figure out why. So, we don't have the experiment of nature to help us along, because the experiment of nature has actually failed. The body does not do a good job in protecting against HIV. FLATOW: You know how physicists have their dark energy problem? You've got your dark HIV problem. Dr. FAUCI: That's in fact the case, unfortunately. FLATOW: You know, what is their - could there be something about the immune system that is there that we have not discovered how it works yet? Dr. FAUCI: No, what we suspect it is, Ira, is that the way the virus presents itself to the body that the components of the virus that would induce, and it does sometimes rarely, what we call a good neutralizing antibody response, so something that you would predict would be protected, is presented into the body in a very cryptic way. So, the body surveillance mechanism doesn't see clearly that component of the virus that it needs to make an immune response against it, and if it doesn't see it clearly, it's very difficult to make a good immune response, and you superimpose upon that the fact that this virus is very divergent. It mutates very rapidly and gives it a big head start on eluding the body's immune response. So, there are number of reasons why this is such a difficult scientific problem.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Carol in Santa Cruz. Hi, Carol. CAROL (Caller): Hi. What he just said is exactly what I was going to ask the question about. What I heard a long time ago was that the virus mutates within the body very quickly, and for that reason, developing a vaccine would be futile because the virus would just again mutate and then the vaccine wouldn't work against that next variety of the virus. FLATOW: Is it that hard, Dr. Fauci? Don't other, you know, disease, viruses mutate also?  Dr. FAUCI: Well, first thing, what the caller said is quite correct, and I'll explain a little bit of a difference there. Yes, other viruses mutate, but HIV is the mother of all mutating viruses. I mean, it just mutates extraordinarily rapidly, and becomes very divergent. When you make a vaccine against a virus that mutates, what you try to do is to make a vaccine that gets a response against the constant region of the virus that can't really mutate because if it mutates, it would make the virus functionless.  One of the points on the virus that we want to make the immune response against is the part of the virus that binds to the receptor on the target cell in the body. And that's how the HIV gets its foothold in the body. It binds to particularly vulnerable target cells and it infects them. That binding site is what we call very cryptic. It's very, very difficult to reveal that to the body's immune-surveillance mechanism.  If we can get that binding site that binds to a particular molecule on the cell and put that in a form that when you vaccinate people, they'll make a very robust response against it. That's one big leap towards a successful vaccine. But thus far, we've been unable to get that particular component of the virus into a form that would elicit a good immune response by the body. So, that's one of the directions. . . FLATOW: Interesting. Dr. FAUCI: That we're trying to pursue with this new idea. FLATOW: Let me see if I can - we can tease that out a little bit. So, there's a site on the cell that the virus binds to. Dr. FAUCI: Right. It's called the receptor. FLATOW: The receptor and it fits like a key, like a jigsaw puzzle, any way you'd like to describe it. Dr. FAUCI: Exactly. FLATOW: And the idea is that you could make a medication that floods the body and binds to that site so that the virus can't bind to it itself. Dr. FAUCI: No, it's a little bit different. Almost there, Ira. What it means is that you inject into the body the particular component of a virus in a very safe way that would elicit a response on the body's part so that the body makes an antibody or a cell-mediated response that actually blocks that interaction that you're talking about. FLATOW: I see. Dr. FAUCI: That lock-and-key interaction. But you have to induce the body to make a good immune response to do that. That's what we've been unsuccessful in doing. So, you're really trying to ask the body or coax the body to make a response against the critical part that the virus needs to bind to its receptor before the person gets exposed to HIV, so that if and when the person does get exposed to HIV, that substance, which would be an antibody or a particular specific cell, will already be in the body revved up, ready to protect you against HIV. FLATOW: And we're talking about AIDS research this hour in Talk of the Nation: Science Friday from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow, talking with Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. I almost got the opinion from reading your article in Science that you're having trouble finding enough young scientists themselves who want to go into this field. Like, you know, maybe they don't see this having any future, it's not a career path for them. Am I misreading that?  Dr. FAUCI: Well, we always are looking for new blood in the fields of science, particularly in those particularly problematic fields like the development of an HIV vaccine. Right now, as you know, in the biomedical research community, the funding for NIH and other scientific institutions has been relatively flat over the last several years. So, there's not a big inducement to get people into the field back in the days when the slope of increase in funding for HIV, I know you remember that well. FLATOW: Sure. Dr. FAUCI: We discussed that years ago on this show. It was so great. It was a major attraction to young investigators. Things had really been a little sobering over the last several years. That's just one of the reasons. The other reason is that sometimes, young people feel that they would not necessarily be able to contribute because there are a lot of people in the field who've been at it for a long time and have a lot of experience. What we're trying to say is that all bets are off with experience, because experience hasn't got us the answer to these problems. So, we would welcome the fresh new ideas that generally come from young new investigators. FLATOW: And we also have other fields that we didn't have many years ago, the genetics, and you mentioned, structural biology, all those kinds of things. . . Dr. FAUCI: Exactly. FLATOW: That might help out. Could we, you know, could we find out - give me an example what kind of things genetics might tell us, for example. Dr. FAUCI: Well, for example, we know that there are some individuals who are genetically programmed to actually be long-term non-progressors in the sense that they seemed to handle the virus very, very well. We are currently probing the immune responses they make to see if, in fact, we can get some insight into inducing that. The problem is, maybe they make that immune response because they have the right genetic background and that people who don't have the right genetic background are not going to readily make those kinds of immune responses.  So, what you have to do is, when you make a vaccine, you put it in a form that elicits a response that you wouldn't necessarily, readily make on the basis of your natural genetically-programmed response to a virus. So, you almost have to trick the body into making the kind of response that would be protective.  The other field of discipline that we are very much joining with, is the whole issue that you mentioned a moment ago, is structural biology and the crystallographic and atomic structures of these binding sites that we speak of and how to get that in a form that would be what we call an immunogen or something that you can inject into someone to make a good immune response against that particular binding site. FLATOW: So, you're talking about tinker-toy stuff here. Right shapes of things and get them to bind to the right sites and a lot of it may be an engineering problem, too. Dr. FAUCI: Indeed, and when you talk about structural biology and fitting an antibody into a particular cryptic site on a molecule, that's exactly what it is. That's engineering. That's biological engineering. FLATOW: So, you're waiting now then to - for a new kind of study or something. A lot more focus. Dr. FAUCI: Yeah. I would entertain a study using the same product, but it's got to be designed to get the answer as quickly as possible as to whether or not this particular candidate does have the positive effect of lowering the viral load. If it does, then we can expand a study in trying to all the kinds of correlates to see if we can get some clues as to what the right immune response is that's leading to this positive effect. FLATOW: Well, there are a lot of people out there listening. Maybe you've stimulated somebody. Dr. FAUCI: I hope so, Ira. FLATOW: Send you a proposal. Thank you, Dr. Fauci, as always. Dr. FAUCI: You're quite welcome. It's good to be here. FLATOW: Thank you for taking your time to be with us. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. That's at NIH in Bethesda. We're going to take a break. When we come back, we're going to talk about working with a different kind of vaccine, this one for cancer and growing these vaccines in tobacco plants. Can you imagine tobacco treating cancer? We'll talk about it after this break. Stay with us.  IRA FLATOW, host:  This is Talk of the Nation: Science Friday. I'm Ira Flatow. We're going to be switching gear now, talking about AIDS vaccines, because earlier this month, the National Institutes of Health announced that it would not go forward with a planned major trial of a potential AIDS vaccine, that more basic focus research was needed first on how such vaccines interact with the immune system before such a trial could proceed. The news follows the failure last year of another experimental AIDS vaccine produced by Merck.   So, what are we going to do now about the immune system and these vaccines and what more do we need to know? Do we need new thinking? A new direction for AIDS research? Do we need new blood coming in to do the research? More funding? Joining me now is a frequent Science Friday guest, Dr. Anthony Fauci. He is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at NIH, and he's the winner of the 2007 Lasker Award for Public Service. Welcome back to the program, Dr. Fauci.  Dr. ANTHONY FAUCI (Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, NIH): It's good to be here, Ira.  FLATOW: Tell us a little bit of the history. Why the cancellation?  Dr. FAUCI: Well, the cancellation because the trial that was proposed was of a size and magnitude that, given what we know, or more frankly, what we don't know, about what we call the correlate of immunity, namely the kind of immune response that we're trying to induce in people who are vaccinated with an AIDS vaccine. I felt that we needed to do a much leaner, meaner trial that precisely asked and answered one question: does this particular vaccine work in lowering the viral set point to the viral load were someone to get infected anyway?   And we don't need a trial as large as was proposed given the failures that we've seen up to now. So, I would entertain a smaller trial, but I thought given the situation we're in and the fact that we know so little about these correlates of immunity that it would be more prudent to try and do a much more precise trial. That's the reason why I did not accept the proposal for the larger trial. So, I'm waiting to see and hopefully they'll come in with a proposal for a much smaller approach to this particular question.  FLATOW: Was there fear on your part that we might have another failure, failure like that Merck trial?  Dr. FAUCI: Well, it was less a question of failure than a question of the balance of resources that you put into what we call an empiric approach, namely taking a product and doing a large trial, not only to see if it works good, but also to see if you can get some hint of some correlation with a particular response, and perhaps the favorable response clinically in some of the vaccinees. What you alluded to when you were introducing the program was we're thinking much more now, towards turning the knob a bit more towards asking and answering some of the fundamental, basic, unanswered questions in HIV vaccine.   It's a very unique situation, much different than what we face with any other virus for which we're trying to make a vaccine, because mostly when you get natural infection with anything, polio, small pox, measles, you call it, the body makes an immune response that, for the most part, in most people, even though it causes death and disease in some, that people's immune system can respond, clear the virus, eradicate it completely from the body, and then allow you to be protected, literally, protected completely from subsequent challenge with the same virus.   Unfortunately, with HIV that's not what we have, because the history of HIV tells us that, for reasons that we still don't understand, the body does not respond adequately to the HIV virus. There are virtually no instances of people who once they get established infection can actually eradicate the virus from the body or even well control it, except some few people who have genetic programming to do that. So, we're really swimming in the dark. We've got to answer some fundamental basic questions of why the body does not make a good immune response against HIV.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number, talking with Dr. Anthony Fauci. You could not learn that from the drugs, not the vaccines, but the drugs that are used to treat people with HIV.  Dr. FAUCI: No, Ira, it's an entirely different ball game, because, as you know, the drugs block the virus by having a direct effect on the virus. It doesn't impact the body's immune response to the virus. When you're dealing with a vaccine, you're trying to marshal the body's defenses and prepping it, so that when it sees the virus for the first time, it will have a head start in making a good immune response, and hopefully, as we see with most successful vaccines, block the initial infection or if not block the initial infection, at least protect the person from severe disease. So, it's really apples and oranges when you're talking about a drug verses a vaccine.   FLATOW: You write in the paper in Science about the need to explore new avenues and to attract new and young investigators into this area and maintain their involvement. I have two questions about that. Is there a shortage of new ideas that you're looking to come through now?  Dr. FAUCI: Well, I would say less a shortage of new ideas than a shortage of good ideas, because what we've tried so far in a empiric way, hoping that by trial and error we would come up with the answer to an HIV vaccine. It's becoming very clear that we need to do some basic fundamental probing and answer the questions. The questions are clear. How we get to the answers is the issue.   Why does not the body make a very good robust response against the virus that's able to control it? We do that with virtually every other virus. Why not with HIV? We have some leads, but we really need to do those fundamental concept-type experiment, as opposed to just empirically testing a group of potential candidates for a vaccine.  And what we say we want new ideas and new blood, and young people who really don't have a predetermined notion about what the direction should be, because that's the way science works. When you get these new fresh ideas, they give leads and then others can take up on them and that's how you get the answers. So, that's really what we're calling for, getting back to answering some of the fundamental question.  FLATOW: Yeah. You write it very well. You write, you know, \"the design of a vaccine will require some enormous intellectual leaps beyond present day knowledge. \"   Dr. FAUCI: Right.  FLATOW: That's - some - so you really want to just brainstorm this even more?  Dr. FAUCI: Well, we want to brainstorm and then we when get the - a good idea to try and test it first, you know, perhaps in an animal model, and you note from the paper that we just put out in Science that we stress the need to enhance what we call the nonhuman primate model, so that we can get some idea. There's no animal model that's a perfect model for HIV, but some of them are pretty close. So, that's the thing that we really need to expand upon and perfect.  FLATOW: And that's one of the mysteries - I think if I read the paper correctly, you get better results in the nonhuman primates and you can't transfer those results.  Dr. FAUCI: Right. Exactly, and some of the models, you cannot transfer the results. Because in one of the models in particular, using, for example, the Merck candidate that actually was the disappointing results from several months ago, one of the animal models looked like they may have been protected from the high level of virus that you get after you get infected and they made a certain immune response. The humans made a similar immune response, but they were not at all protected, and when you looked at the vaccinated verses the unvaccinated, there really was no benefit at all.  FLATOW: Then it sounds like there's something unknown going on here.  Dr. FAUCI: That's exactly the point, Ira, you put your finger right on it, there's something unknown. It's not like the body is the experiment of nature with a natural virus like we've done with polio and with measles and with other virus vaccines that we've been so successful in developing. The body's natural response serves as, you know, your first solid experiment. The body already tells you that it can make a good immune response. Unfortunately with HIV, that doesn't happen and we have to figure out why. So, we don't have the experiment of nature to help us along, because the experiment of nature has actually failed. The body does not do a good job in protecting against HIV.  FLATOW: You know how physicists have their dark energy problem? You've got your dark HIV problem.  Dr. FAUCI: That's in fact the case, unfortunately.  FLATOW: You know, what is their - could there be something about the immune system that is there that we have not discovered how it works yet?  Dr. FAUCI: No, what we suspect it is, Ira, is that the way the virus presents itself to the body that the components of the virus that would induce, and it does sometimes rarely, what we call a good neutralizing antibody response, so something that you would predict would be protected, is presented into the body in a very cryptic way. So, the body surveillance mechanism doesn't see clearly that component of the virus that it needs to make an immune response against it, and if it doesn't see it clearly, it's very difficult to make a good immune response, and you superimpose upon that the fact that this virus is very divergent. It mutates very rapidly and gives it a big head start on eluding the body's immune response. So, there are number of reasons why this is such a difficult scientific problem.   FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Carol in Santa Cruz. Hi, Carol.  CAROL (Caller): Hi. What he just said is exactly what I was going to ask the question about. What I heard a long time ago was that the virus mutates within the body very quickly, and for that reason, developing a vaccine would be futile because the virus would just again mutate and then the vaccine wouldn't work against that next variety of the virus.  FLATOW: Is it that hard, Dr. Fauci? Don't other, you know, disease, viruses mutate also?   Dr. FAUCI: Well, first thing, what the caller said is quite correct, and I'll explain a little bit of a difference there. Yes, other viruses mutate, but HIV is the mother of all mutating viruses. I mean, it just mutates extraordinarily rapidly, and becomes very divergent. When you make a vaccine against a virus that mutates, what you try to do is to make a vaccine that gets a response against the constant region of the virus that can't really mutate because if it mutates, it would make the virus functionless.   One of the points on the virus that we want to make the immune response against is the part of the virus that binds to the receptor on the target cell in the body. And that's how the HIV gets its foothold in the body. It binds to particularly vulnerable target cells and it infects them. That binding site is what we call very cryptic. It's very, very difficult to reveal that to the body's immune-surveillance mechanism.   If we can get that binding site that binds to a particular molecule on the cell and put that in a form that when you vaccinate people, they'll make a very robust response against it. That's one big leap towards a successful vaccine. But thus far, we've been unable to get that particular component of the virus into a form that would elicit a good immune response by the body. So, that's one of the directions. . .  FLATOW: Interesting.  Dr. FAUCI: That we're trying to pursue with this new idea.  FLATOW: Let me see if I can - we can tease that out a little bit. So, there's a site on the cell that the virus binds to.  Dr. FAUCI: Right. It's called the receptor.  FLATOW: The receptor and it fits like a key, like a jigsaw puzzle, any way you'd like to describe it.  Dr. FAUCI: Exactly.  FLATOW: And the idea is that you could make a medication that floods the body and binds to that site so that the virus can't bind to it itself.  Dr. FAUCI: No, it's a little bit different. Almost there, Ira. What it means is that you inject into the body the particular component of a virus in a very safe way that would elicit a response on the body's part so that the body makes an antibody or a cell-mediated response that actually blocks that interaction that you're talking about.  FLATOW: I see.  Dr. FAUCI: That lock-and-key interaction. But you have to induce the body to make a good immune response to do that. That's what we've been unsuccessful in doing. So, you're really trying to ask the body or coax the body to make a response against the critical part that the virus needs to bind to its receptor before the person gets exposed to HIV, so that if and when the person does get exposed to HIV, that substance, which would be an antibody or a particular specific cell, will already be in the body revved up, ready to protect you against HIV.

I'm Alex Cohen. ALEX CHADWICK, host: I'm Alex Chadwick. In many Latino communities around the country, people are buying prescription drugs without a prescription. They find them at swap meets or in store fronts. Local police often don't know about the problem, or don't know how to stop it. But in Los Angeles, a team of county health officers is working with law enforcement to do something. From member station KXJZ, Kelley Weiss reports. (Soundbite of music) KELLEY WEISS: It's a Sunday morning, and hundreds of people are moving through the Crows Landing flea market in California's Central Valley. Cristina Correa is guiding me. She works for the California Medical Association Foundation. Her job is to raise awareness about the overuse of antibiotics. She spots a card table at one stand, openly displaying dozens of bottles of medication. Ms. CRISTINA CORREA (AWARE Director, California Medical Association Foundation): There's tetracycline, there's a lot of creams at the table, there is amoxicillin, amphycillin (ph). WEISS: Correa says displays like this one are common. (Soundbite of music) WEISS: As we walk down a crowded aisle we find 24 year old Armando Rivera (ph). Rivera says he doesn't have health insurance and gets medicine at a flea market when he needs it. Mr. ARMANDO RIVERA: My mom she's, you know, as soon as I get a sore throat, so we got to go to the flea market and get some penicillin. WEISS: Cristina Correa says it's part of the culture for many recent Latino immigrants to get prescription drugs this way. Antibiotics are a popular choice because, in countries like Mexico, for example, you can just buy them over the counter. Dean Blumberg is an infectious disease specialist at UC Davis Medical Center. He says this is a big problem, because misusing antibiotics can make it harder to fight off subsequent infections. Dr. DEAN BLUMBERG (Infectious Disease Specialist, UC Davis Medical Center): What we've seen in the past is a rise in antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and then these bacteria end up causing severe infections, pneumonia, meningitis and other very severe infections that don't respond to first line treatment. WEISS: The problem is, it's hard to track these illegal sales. That's what John Hirai says. He works with the Medical Board of California and goes after people who practice medicine without a license. Mr. JOHN HIRAI (Medical Board of California): I think probably the biggest thing is not knowing how much more is out there, you know, and being able to really, you know, track that, since it is so underground. WEISS: Still, that challenge hasn't stopped Los Angeles County. It put together a group of cops and health officers to not only track the sales, but stop them. The Health Authority Law Enforcement Task Force, or HALT, started about 10 years ago, when two children in Orange County died after getting prescription drugs from an unlicensed provider. And, as far as HALT knows, it's the only task force like it in the country. Today, HALT is hitting five locations in south central L. A. L. A. Police Officer, Juan Gomez (ph), bought prescription drugs undercover in botanicas and general stores in this Latino neighborhood. Now he has search warrants and the team is seizing the pharmaceuticals. (Soundbite of store) WEISS: At this general store, or tienda, the owner sells groceries, cigarettes and party favors. HALT pharmacist; Daniel Hancz; also finds antibiotics and pain relievers. Mr. DANIEL HANCZ (HALT Pharmacist): And this is for worms, worm infections. We also found some urinary antibiotics, and then another product called Intestomesina (ph) which is a combination antibiotic and has chloral phenacolin (ph) in it, which was banned in the U. S. in the oral formulation. WEISS: Hancz says it's common to find injectable steroids or penicillin at these places as well, because they're in high demand. He says many of these drugs haven't been approved for sale in the U. S. They're usually brought in from Latin America and some, he says, are counterfeit. That means, at best, the drug could be just a placebo, at worst it could contain harmful ingredients. The task force comes away with only a few boxes full of seized pharmaceuticals today. Health Officers Eric Aguilar and Daniel Hancz hope it's a sign the busts are working. They say drugs are much harder to find these days. Mr. HANCZ: But, in the past, years ago, it was on its way, and we'd come out of businesses with, you know, truck loads. WEISS: Still, they suspect the decline may be due to the sales being pushed further underground. Dr. Dean Blumberg says this type of enforcement isn't enough. He says physicians need to warn patients about the dangers of illegally sold prescription drugs. Dr. BLUMBERG: If people have a health care provider that they trust and that they respect, and they hear it from them, that's going to have the most impact in terms of education. Ms. WEISS: Blumberg recognizes it's not always that simple and that access to healthcare plays a role here. Some immigrants, he says, can't afford health insurance. Others are here illegally, and are scared to go to the doctor. So, he says, there should be more outreach, to give them better options than the neighborhood tienda, or weekend swap meet.

That means, at best, the drug could be just a placebo, at worst it could contain harmful ingredients.  The task force comes away with only a few boxes full of seized pharmaceuticals today. Health Officers Eric Aguilar and Daniel Hancz hope it's a sign the busts are working. They say drugs are much harder to find these days.  Mr. HANCZ: But, in the past, years ago, it was on its way, and we'd come out of businesses with, you know, truck loads.  WEISS: Still, they suspect the decline may be due to the sales being pushed further underground. Dr. Dean Blumberg says this type of enforcement isn't enough. He says physicians need to warn patients about the dangers of illegally sold prescription drugs.  Dr. BLUMBERG: If people have a health care provider that they trust and that they respect, and they hear it from them, that's going to have the most impact in terms of education.  Ms. WEISS: Blumberg recognizes it's not always that simple and that access to healthcare plays a role here. Some immigrants, he says, can't afford health insurance. Others are here illegally, and are scared to go to the doctor. So, he says, there should be more outreach, to give them better options than the neighborhood tienda, or weekend swap meet.

No, it's not the biggest snake or the longest snake or the deadliest snake. A scientist claims to have found the world's smallest snake. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce has this tiny tale. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE: A couple of years ago, biologist Blair Hedges was working on a field guide to amphibians and reptiles of the West Indies. He went to the island of Barbados to photograph animals for his book. Mr. BLAIR HEDGES (Biologist): And so we were driving around the island and finding rocks and logs on the side of the road to turn because these animals tend to get underneath things and hide, you know, during the day. GREENFIELDBOYCE: In a small patch of forest next to a school, he turned over a rock and found a little, grayish, wiggly creature with yellow stripes. Mr. HEDGES: It does look like a worm. It's actually even - honestly, it's smaller than many worms. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But he knew it couldn't be a worm or a centipede. It had scales and no feet. It was a snake, a snake as thin as a spaghetti noodle. At first, Hedges thought it was a species of snake that scientists already knew about from the nearby island of Martinique, but as he looked closer, he realized it was different. Mr. HEDGES: Not only was it a valid species, distinct from the one on Martinique, but also it was smaller. GREENFIELDBOYCE: In fact, he now says it's the smallest species of snake in the world. In the journal Zootaxa, he says adult snakes of this species average just under four inches. Now, Hedges is an evolutionary biologist at Penn State University, and this isn't the first time he's found something super-tiny. He's previously identified the world's smallest frog species and the world's smallest lizard. He swears it's just a coincidence that he's now found the smallest snake. Mr. HEDGES: You could never search for a smallest anything, and so this is luck times three, really. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Part of his luck could come from the fact that he's done a lot of work on island. The tiny snake, frog and lizard all live on islands. And Hedges says islands are known to host an unusual number of small species. Still, he says, after three world records: Mr. HEDGES: I find it highly unlikely that I will ever find a smallest anything for the rest of my life. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Which is too bad, because he's gotten good and perching tiny creatures on top of coins to take photos showing how small they are. The snake, for example, looks very sweet on top of a quarter. He named it: Mr. HEDGES: Leptotyphlops carlae. GREENFIELDBOYCE: After his wife, Carla. I wanted to see just how tiny this snake really was. Hedges had already donated his snakes to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D. C. , so I went there. Scientist Roy McDiarmid showed me two glass jars full of alcohol. Each had a snake floating inside. Doctor ROY McDIARMID (Curator of Amphibians and Reptiles, Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History): So here are the specimens. GREENFIELDBOYCE: They're cure. Dr. McDIARMID: I think they're pretty neat-looking, but cute is not where I would go, but that's fine. If you had one of these things, you'd think well, it's kind of a weird little thing, but they don't - you know, they don't have a striking coloration. They're hard to sort of see what the head looks like and imagine what they do. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Mostly what these snakes do is eat insect larvae. They're harmless to people. McDermott and a colleague seemed amused that someone was after the title of the world's smallest snake instead of the biggest and the baddest. Now that the claim is out there, maybe someone will say they've got a tinier one, but Blair Hedges thinks his little guys are probably close to the limit of how small a snake can be and still be a snake.

But when you clear out all the smoke mirrors and occasional fireworks, at the heart of magic is the ability to make people see something that's not really there or miss something that really is. Psychologists and neurologists have been looking into how magicians manipulate our perceptions in any case, and one of those researchers is Susana Martinez-Conde of the Barrow Neurological Institute. She and her co-authors, including five internationally-known magicians, recently published a paper on the topic in the journal Nature Reviews Neuroscience. Professor Martinez-Conde joins us from member station KJZZ in Phoenix. Thanks so much. Professor SUSANA MARTINEZ-CONDE (Director, Laboratory of Visual Neuroscience, Barrow Neurological Institute): Thank you. My pleasure. SIMON: And why was this important to find out? What made you decide to look into this, professor? Professor MARTINEZ-CONDE: As committed neuroscientists, we realized that we had a very good and previously untapped resource which was the magicians. We find that a number of the principles that we take advantage of in the laboratory and visual illusions that we use to understand what the brain is doing, in many occasions these have not been discovered by scientists but have been discovered by artists such as painters, for instance. Magicians are these artists of awareness and cognition. These are expert manipulators of attentional levels.  SIMON: So how, for example, do they pull off a coin trick? Professor MARTINEZ-CONDE: To make a coin disappear, or a coin appear, or a coin to change positions, you may have a number of techniques that magicians use. They may pretend to change the position of the coin, but the coin has always been in their hand, or they may use a duplicate. What's interesting from a scientific point of view is how it is that we miss the maneuver. SIMON: How do we miss it? Professor MARTINEZ-CONDE: Basically, we don't pay attention to it. Magicians not only manipulate attention in space - that is they don't only manipulate where you pay attention to within the visual scene - but also they manipulate at what point in time you pay attention to. So very often when we're witnessing a magic trick, what we think is the most important part of the action is not so, and the magic trick itself has already happened, or perhaps it hasn't even started. So. . . SIMON: So we're watching the - we're watching exactly the wrong place because they distract our attention to it, if you please. Professor MARTINEZ-CONDE: Exactly. The wrong place and the wrong time. Say that a magician gives you a coin and asks you to place it yourself in your pocket. You're absolutely sure that you have put it in your pocket. Now the magician says, OK, now I'm going to take it out of your pocket without you noticing, and they may produce a coin. Now you think this is the coin out of your pocket, but it's not. It's a duplicate. Now the coin is still in your pocket at that time. But while you're distracted watching the coin that the magician had just produced, it may be that now after the trick appears to be over, he steals the coin from your pocket. SIMON: The weasel! Are magic shows less fun for you now because you know what to look for? Professor MARTINEZ-CONDE: Well, first off, I don't know what to look for. These techniques are so powerful and so sophisticated that it's very difficult even if you have some idea of what the general brain principles are maybe involved. It's very hard to catch the trick. And the fact is that this is what makes magic such a powerful form of entertainment. Part of the fun is trying to figure out all the time how the tricks are being done, and after the show, to think about it and try to reconstruct how the trick happened. And most often, you are going to fail at that. SIMON: Now you see it, now you don't. Professor MARTINEZ-CONDE: That's right.

Research in brain science could lead to technologies from mind control to drugs that make troops alert or adversaries confused or to methods to help interrogators detect lies. U. S. Intelligence Agencies asked the National Academy of Sciences to assess global research in the field of brain science. NPR's Richard Harris has this story on what they found. RICHARD HARRIS: The book-sized study is chock-full of possibilities that seem to border on the science fiction. But report chairman Kit Green says a surprising number of technologies could well emerge in the next 20 years. Starting with some of the most likely advances, it's quite possible scientists somewhere will develop an aerosol that can carry drugs from the air to the brain. And there's certainly no shortage of mind-altering drugs available today. Professor KIT GREEN (Psychiatry and Radiology, Wayne State School of Medicine): All of those kinds of things which are being used now for direct prescriptive use and medication globally also can be turned and used in an opposite way. HARRIS: Or consider the quest for a reliable lie detector. Green says a big chunk of the report deals with this technology. Prof. GREEN: We did this because there's hardly a day that goes by that there isn't some newspaper article or magazine article that talks about being able to look into somebody's brain with functional brain (unintelligible), for example, and telling a person's state of mind in terms of not only their emotionality but in terms of whether they're telling the truth or whether they're telling a lie. HARRIS: The report concludes that brain imagers don't work, at least not as lie detectors. However, Green says brain scanners have helped scientists realize that people's brains are organized differently depending on their culture. That means everybody doesn't make decisions the same way. Prof. GREEN: We have hidden biases in the West in terms of what we think are values that result in an individual's making a decision of what is right and wrong. And so we tend to look at other people in other places and other cultures mere imaging what we think we know as right or wrong. But the way in which decisions are processed is quite different. HARRIS: Deeper insights like this could, in the long run, matter more than the speculative technologies, such as mind control, brainwashing, or bionically enhanced soldiers. Kit Green, who's from the Wayne State School of Medicine, says cultural differences even affect the way other countries conduct brain research. Prof. GREEN: The way in which other countries than in the West are approaching trying to understand brain behavior is different from the linear hypothesis testing methodology that's done in the tried and true science method of the United States and Western Europe. HARRIS: Those very different approaches could ultimately lead to some big surprises. Well, that's how the expectations develop in the West. So his most important recommendation to the defense intelligence community is it needs to increase international collaboration in brain science to figure out where those approaches could lead. Now, the U. S. intelligence community has a checkered history in brain research, including clandestine testing of LSD some decades ago and the use of unreliable lie detector technology.

New research shows that running slows the aging process. That's at least according to a new study out from the Stanford School of Medicine. Eliza Chakravarty is the lead author of that study. So, you found that runners have longer lifespans. Dr. ELIZA CHAKRAVARTY (Immunology and Rheumatology, Stanford University Medical Center): Yes. BRAND: Did you also found that they suffer from less debilitating diseases? Dr. CHAKRAVARTY: We didn't look at other diseases. But we looked at our measure of disability, and our measure of disability ranges zero to three, zero being no disability at all and three represents almost complete inability to do anything without assistance. And over time, we found that the runners had much lower disability rates and their rate of increasing disability was much slower than the control group. BRAND: Now, everyone talks about how running is really bad for the knees and bad for the joints. What did you find there? Dr. CHAKRAVARTY: We had initially anticipated that the runners were going to have the worst osteoarthritis or wear-and-tear type of arthritis of the knees in the people who didn't run. And we were very surprised to find that there was no significant difference between the groups. BRAND: And so, would there be a minimum? Someone listening to this would say, you know, how much would I have to run to experience these benefits? Dr. CHAKRAVARTY: The way the study was designed wasn't designed to look at a threshold level. What we do believe though is that any form of vigorous exercise or aerobic exercise that gets the heart rate up is beneficial. BRAND: So, it's not just running? It's any aerobic exercise? Dr. CHAKRAVARTY: That's what we believe. BRAND: What is it about aerobic exercise that confers all these benefits, these anti-aging properties? Dr. CHAKRAVARTY: This study was an epidemiologic study, so we weren't able to look at that. But there had been other studies and other hypotheses about why exercise is beneficial, and some of these are increasing muscle mass, increasing the strength and the stability of the ligaments that surround the joints. There have also been studies that people who exercises regularly, even in the later years, have increased responses to vaccinations and possibly decreased levels of inflammation that's circulating in their system. Although the study wasn't designed to look at this, it was a nice long-term study that looked at people from age of about 60 when the study started to about 80. And we were able to show at least epidemiologically, that there was a definite survival advantage to vigorous exercise as well as a significant decrease in disability or increase in functional ability. BRAND: Now, is it possible that the group of runners is just healthier to begin with? They're eating better. They're not smoking. They are doing other things that could confer these benefits that it's not just the running. Dr. CHAKRAVARTY: Absolutely, and in these sort of observational studies, there are always variables that we can't measure. And other things that play into why someone would choose to run or participate in vigorous exercise compared to someone who chooses to be more sedentary. The way we tried to approach this and address these issues was several-fold. First, we chose our control group to be very similar to the runners group, meaning they were - had a normal body mass index, were not overweight, had low smoking and alcohol use, were educated and from similar backgrounds. So, we tried to eliminate differences outside of running or vigorous exercise. BRAND: Are you a runner? Dr. CHAKRAVARTY: No. (Soundbite of laughter) BRAND: You're not? Dr. CHAKRAVARTY: No, Jim Fries is a very active runner and he is almost 70. BRAND: This is your coauthor? Dr. CHAKRAVARTY: Yes, my coauthor. I do aerobics.

But we looked at our measure of disability, and our measure of disability ranges zero to three, zero being no disability at all and three represents almost complete inability to do anything without assistance. And over time, we found that the runners had much lower disability rates and their rate of increasing disability was much slower than the control group.  BRAND: Now, everyone talks about how running is really bad for the knees and bad for the joints. What did you find there?  Dr. CHAKRAVARTY: We had initially anticipated that the runners were going to have the worst osteoarthritis or wear-and-tear type of arthritis of the knees in the people who didn't run. And we were very surprised to find that there was no significant difference between the groups.  BRAND: And so, would there be a minimum? Someone listening to this would say, you know, how much would I have to run to experience these benefits?  Dr. CHAKRAVARTY: The way the study was designed wasn't designed to look at a threshold level. What we do believe though is that any form of vigorous exercise or aerobic exercise that gets the heart rate up is beneficial.  BRAND: So, it's not just running? It's any aerobic exercise?  Dr. CHAKRAVARTY: That's what we believe.  BRAND: What is it about aerobic exercise that confers all these benefits, these anti-aging properties?  Dr. CHAKRAVARTY: This study was an epidemiologic study, so we weren't able to look at that. But there had been other studies and other hypotheses about why exercise is beneficial, and some of these are increasing muscle mass, increasing the strength and the stability of the ligaments that surround the joints.  There have also been studies that people who exercises regularly, even in the later years, have increased responses to vaccinations and possibly decreased levels of inflammation that's circulating in their system. Although the study wasn't designed to look at this, it was a nice long-term study that looked at people from age of about 60 when the study started to about 80. And we were able to show at least epidemiologically, that there was a definite survival advantage to vigorous exercise as well as a significant decrease in disability or increase in functional ability.  BRAND: Now, is it possible that the group of runners is just healthier to begin with? They're eating better. They're not smoking. They are doing other things that could confer these benefits that it's not just the running.  Dr. CHAKRAVARTY: Absolutely, and in these sort of observational studies, there are always variables that we can't measure. And other things that play into why someone would choose to run or participate in vigorous exercise compared to someone who chooses to be more sedentary. The way we tried to approach this and address these issues was several-fold. First, we chose our control group to be very similar to the runners group, meaning they were - had a normal body mass index, were not overweight, had low smoking and alcohol use, were educated and from similar backgrounds. So, we tried to eliminate differences outside of running or vigorous exercise.  BRAND: Are you a runner?  Dr. CHAKRAVARTY: No.  (Soundbite of laughter)  BRAND: You're not?  Dr. CHAKRAVARTY: No, Jim Fries is a very active runner and he is almost 70.  BRAND: This is your coauthor?  Dr. CHAKRAVARTY: Yes, my coauthor. I do aerobics.  BRAND: Eliza Chakravarty is the lead author of a paper that's says running can extend your life and confer significant health benefits. She's also assistant professor of medicine at Stanford University. Thank you very much.  Dr. CHAKRAVARTY: Thank you very much. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.

I'm Ira Flatow.  If we could turn back the clock 65 billion years ago, what would we see?  Well, wouldn't we like to save some of those dinosaurs that were dying out around then and other species that were perishing during that mass extinction?   And if you're still dreaming of dinos, my next guest might say, wake up, because the amphibians now need you.  New research published in the Journal of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests the rapid frog die-offs and other species declines we are witnessing now could be harbingers of a sixth mass extinction that could be happening, and it would be a grim picture.   Well, my next guest says there are actions we can take to cut our losses, and joining me now to talk about it is Dr. Paul Ehrlich, president of the Center for Conservation Biology, also professor of population studies at Stanford, and author of the new book, \"The Dominant Animal: Human Evolution and the Environment. \"  Welcome back to Science Friday. Dr. PAUL EHRLICH (President, Center for Conservation Biology, Professor, Population Studies, Stanford University; Author, \"The Dominant Animal:  Human Evolution and the Environment\"):  It's nice to be back, Ira. FLATOW:  This - just reading from the title of your paper here, says where does biodiversity go from here?  A grim business as usual forecast and a hopeful portfolio of partial solutions.  A grim business as usual. Dr. EHRLICH:  Well, we are in the middle of the sixth-grade extinction.  Many people are confused to think that the only problem is loss of species, but, of course, everybody who understands that the other organisms of the planet are the working parts of our life support systems, also understands that the loss of populations, that is, the reduction in the ranges of species is equally or in some cases more important.   A good example is the honeybees we have over here came originally from Italy.  If you had one population of honey bees around Rome that was going to be there forever, you would not have lost any species diversity, but of course, if all the honeybees were going from North America, we would lose billions of dollars and lot of wonderful food that we depend on, because they pollinate our crops.   So - and of course, as you may know, we're already in trouble with the honeybees.  So the mass extinction is a very serious problem, and what's worse is, when you look at it, we are not doing anything about it. FLATOW: Mm-hm. Dr. EHRLICH: We are continuing all the things that are contributing to the extinction. FLATOW:  And you write that, quote, \"because that outlook is bleaker than we are willing to accept, we can then outline a more hopeful set of answers. \"  Things are worse than people are telling us? Dr. EHRLICH:  I think they're much worse, because there hasn't been enough attention paid to the loss of populations, which is just beginning to attract attention.  We're just beginning to understand how incredibly diverse those populations are, and how very important that is when we're facing a period of probably incredibly rapid climate change.   All the news is indicating that the IPCC estimates were much too conservative.  You may have seen even today the arctic ice is melting much faster than expected.  And of course, they explain - now expect an ice-free arctic in about five years.   And that means the planet's going to heat even more, that lots of organisms in the arctic are going to start dying off, like we've already heard about the polar bears.  And the climate is going to change even more rapidly, because the arctic - it functions in the climate system in a very important way.   So, all those changes are going to make it harder for the biodiversity to persist, for our crops to be pollinated, for our crops to be protected, and so on.  And on top of that, of course, we have already probably entrained(ph) almost a thousand years of relatively rapid change in patterns of precipitation.   And guess what, you know, what we're depended upon for our foods is where the rain falls, and as that changes, we're going to be chasing it, and it's going to be tough. FLATOW:  Mm-hm.  So, even though that you've - you are the grim reaper here, giving us this bad news, you do say, there's a hopeful side of all of this.  There are steps we could take. Dr. EHRLICH:  Well, you know, when people ask me whether I'm an optimist or a pessimist, I tend to say, I'm optimistic, although not as much I used to be about what we could do. FLATOW: Mm-hm. Dr. EHRLICH: I'm very pessimistic about what we will do.  In other words, it's like Al Gore's saying, that in 10 years, we could get largely off the fossil-fuel standard for at least running our electricity system.   Well, that's perfectly correct.  I think Al is right, but it would require a World War II type mobilization, and we need the same kind of mobilization to save the working parts of our life support systems.  And there's no single silver bullet, but there's a whole array of things that we could do, that would make the future much more optimistic.   I mean, one of the things we talk about in the scientific community, always talks about, is bringing population growth to a halt as soon as possible, and starting as slow decline.  And yet today, or I guess yesterday in the newspapers, they were bragging about how the United States is going to be 439 million people by 2050.   That's roughly 300 million people more than anybody has ever given a reason for having alive in the United States at one time.  Just think about it, another 137 million people in the U. S. competing for all the necessary things that the working parts of our life support systems, the biodiversity also needs, you know. FLATOW: Mm. Dr. EHRLICH: When we pave over things, we lose biodiversity, we add toxins to the planet, and not only do we threaten ourselves, we lose biodiversity.  We change our climate rapidly, not only does that threaten our health in many ways, but we lose biodiversity, and again, the biodiversity is what's giving us food, maintaining the proper quality of the atmosphere, preventing floods, and on, and on. FLATOW:  Mm-hm.  This paper really seems like a call to scientists to get down from their ivory towers and talk about these issues.  I have had scie - I've mentioned this on the program before. I've had scientists who have pulled me over to the side and said in private, much the - what you're saying, the situation is much worse than we're willing to talk about in public, because we don't want to scare people. Dr. EHRLICH:  Well, I think people need to be scared.  I think that when Americans said - I - there are very advantages to getting older.  But one of them is, you can remember things historically. FLATOW: Mm-hm. Dr. EHRLICH: And I remember the way the country organized after Pearl Harbor, you know.  Americans got scared, Americans got together, Americans changed their entire economy in basically a year.   I mean, you know, 1941, we're producing hundreds of thousands of automobiles.  1942, we're producing hundreds of thousands of tanks, and airplanes, and battleships, and so on, and so forth.  You can do it, if you have the right incentive, and fear is. . . FLATOW: Mm-hm. Dr. EHRLICH: Ought to be a big incentive now if we care anything about our children and grandchildren's world. That's the crucial thing.  In other words, you and I probably will - people around the world are already in trouble, because of for instance climate change, but not here.   FLATOW: Mm-hm. Dr. EHRLICH: And sea level will rise, but we'll be able to out walk it.  FLATOW: Mm-hm. Dr. EHRLICH: But in terms of what's going to happen to our kids and grandkids, then we have a totally different story, and there's a lot of reasons to be extremely scared for them. FLATOW:  If scientists do - are scared enough.  What about none scientists who want to help preserve biodiversity?  What should the rest of us do? Dr. EHRLICH:  Well, there - one of the things is get politically active.  In other words, we're having a campaign for president, were you get issues coming up that in the big picture are absolutely trivial.  Should gays be able to get married?  What movie starlet is wearing her panties?  Who had an affair, and so on, and so forth.   Have you heard anything about ecosystem services?  Have you heard any real plans to do something serious about the climate situation? I mean the big debate that's related to climate is where should we drill for oil.  And, of course, the scientific answer is nowhere.  And as any economist will tell you, gasoline is too cheap.   We need to raise the price of gasoline, and get off of the gasoline, the oil standard.  But the debate is insane, it says, where should we drill?  Should we drill in ANWAR?  We shouldn't drill in a waste land.  We've already discovered more than enough oil, that if we burn it, we're likely to just, you know, ruin the climate for our children or our grandchildren completely. FLATOW:  Mm-hm. Dr. EHRLICH:  And so, one of the things to do, get politically active, write to your politicians.  Vote, and vote for the right people.  And I don't have to tell you who that is these days, because we have now suffered through eight years of an administration that has fought very hard to keep science out of the news, to counter all the scientific information we have, to destroy the Endangered Species Act, which is inadequate.   But it's all we've got, so you know, learn about it, don't necessarily listen to me, I could be a - you know, a paid agent of the contraceptive industry or something.  Learn about it, there are lots of places you can learn about it, and then take political actions. FLATOW:  Mm-hm. Dr. EHRLICH:  That's a starter. FLATOW:  Mm-hm.  1-800-989-8255, talking with Dr. Paul Ehrlich, author of \"The Dominant Animal: Human Evolution and the Environment. \"  Let's go to the phones.  To Roger in Cleveland.  Hi, Roger. ROGER (Caller):  Hi, Ira.  Hi, Paul.  How are you doing today? Dr. EHRLICH:  Hi.  It's a very nice day here in California. ROGER:  Well, up here in Cleveland, it's kind of hot and sunny, but that's OK. FLATOW:  Get used to it. ROGER:  Yeah, yeah. (Soundbite of laughter) ROGER: Listen, I'm a crayfish-conservation biologist and I've been - I've worked in aquatic ecology for 30 years.  And I just wanted to bring out the point that almost 50 percent of the crayfish here in the United States and Canada are in need of some conservation attention.   In terms of three big groups in aquatic systems, the fish, the bivalves - the bivalve mussels, and the crayfish, on average, about 33 percent of the species in those three groups are endangered.  And I just finished participating in a court case where there was a species of crayfish found in a small drainage base in about a couple of square miles, very, very small and someone wants to dig a big old mine right in the middle of its habitat.  And the state of Tennessee couldn't stop them from doing it.  So, our environmental laws are really - they're empty.  They're not doing much.  We have laws, but they're ineffective. Dr. EHRLICH:  They're ineffective, and the Bush administration has been struggling very hard to make them less effective.  And as you know, when we talked to any specialist in any group, I mean, for instance, I did a lot of my work on evolution in butterflies, and you go back to place after place where there used to be populations, they're gone.  In the oceans, if we're going to get wet, the number of oxygen-starved dead zones in the coastal waters has about doubled every decade since the 1960s killing off populations of fish, crabs, other marine life.  And we're just doing this all over the world, and we can't do without these organisms.  Thank you for calling and pointing out to me that I often neglected to talk about fresh water organisms which are some of the most endangered in our country and around the world. FLATOW:  Thank you, Roger.  Let's go to Sarah in Good Thunder, Minnesota.  Hi, Sarah. SARAH (Caller):  Hi. Dr. EHRLICH:  Hi. SARAH:  Thanks for having me.  It's a great conversation.  I'm just calling to comment that in Minnesota where the mosquitoes should be prevalent, I noticed on my farm in the last three years, there'd been bursts of mosquitoes in the spring, followed by nothing, and the frog populations are down.  I used to, you know, work out in the garden all year long or out summer long with a mosquito repellent.  I haven't bought any four years.  So, what's happening?  I know that this administration and many local - has the USDA, you know, said that farmers don't have to report the pesticides that they're using now.  I believe that was in the paper the other day.  I just - you're right about changing administrations or leaders that go against our natural environment, and it's going to leave us, you know, in a death row. Dr. EHRLICH:  Well, the frogs are particularly worrying because to mix my metaphors, they sort of can be the canary in the mine because they're dependent on both aquatic and terrestrial habitats, most of them, and they breathe through their skins and they're very sensitive to everything from the toxics, which we release in gigantic amounts, the pesticides, herbicides, and just the industrial chemicals in general. And they're also very sensitive to ultraviolet light, which of course we've had problems with because of the partial depletion of the ozone layer.   So, we're not sure why the frogs are disappearing.  But all of the scientist who looked at it are very worried.  I should point out, by the way, that I am a crazy ecologist.  But I'm actually expressing on a general picture of which way - where humanity is going, the grim business as usual forecast.  I am speaking for the entire scientific community.  Go to www. dominantanimal - written as one word - dot org and click on further information, and you'll see the statements that were put out by 58 academies of science in 1993 and the world scientist's warning the humanity which was signed by more than 1500 scientist including more than half of the living Nobel laureates all saying, if we don't change our ways, we're going to get down the drain and that attracted no attention, and it's still the view of the scientific community. FLATOW:  We're talking with Dr. Paul Ehrlich, author of the \"Dominant Animal: Human Evolution and the Environment\" on Talk of the Nation, Science Friday from NPR News.  I'm Ira Flatow.  Does the fact that Europe at least is a little greener-thinking than we are give you any hope? Dr. EHRLICH:  Well, that gives me - listen, there are a lot of reasons for hope if we do something, and one of the things that most hopeful about Europe is, of course, that their birth rates are way down.  And where you want to see birth rates way down, of course, is in the richest countries because they are the ones whose levels of consumption put most of the pressure on the planet's environmental system.  And so we could easily - we ought to be imitating what's going on in Europe.  Instead, we're the most over populated country in the world.   The third largest in actual numbers of people, but of course, when you factor in our huge levels of consumption, we're way behind beyond China and India in our impact on the planet.  And we're still growing like a sky rocket and we don't - unlike most poor countries, we don't even have a population policy.  I mean, in United States, we argue about migration immigration policy without having a population policy.  It's kind of like saying to somebody, design me an airplane that'll load 100 people a minute.  And when you say, well, how many should it fly with?  You say, well, don't worry about that - just one little, you know, load a 100 people a minute. ' FLATOW:  But doesn't the expansion of China, both economically and the population wise concern you? Dr. EHRLICH:  Oh, it certainly does. FLATOW:  Does that concern you? Dr. EHRLICH:  I think.  In 1972, a political scientist colleague and I wrote an op-ed for the New York Times saying, \"What if All the Chinese had Wheels? \"  Asking what would happen with the planet's environment if the five - then 500 million Chinese started getting interested in cars.  Now, we have 1. 3 billion Chinese who are getting interested in cars.  They're soon going to pass us as a polluter in many areas.  They're virtually out of water.  There's essentially no potable water in the country.  One of the reasons their rain is so acid is that they keep coal fires going all the time to boil their water.  They're building coal-fired power plant which is the worst possible thing you can do in terms of climate change at an incredible rate several a week.   So, yes I'm extremely concerned about China.  But you know, It's hard for an American to talk about what China should be doing when we're doing the opposite.  And we set a terrible example for the world.  In this like it's very hard to criticize politicians for not getting on top of these problems when still many of our colleagues in science are still sticking to their experiments and not worrying about the world coming to an end. FLATOW:  Though yet, you still want to keep a hopeful attitude about this. Mr. EHRLICH:  Yes because there's so many things we could do.  And one of the reasons to be hopeful is the reasons we don't fully understand.  Societies can change extremely rapidly in their behavior and attitude.  So if you remember in the 1960s, we changed the United States dramatically in terms of race relations late '50s and '60s.  Birth rates change quite rapidly in the United States in the early '70s, and the best recent example is nobody that I know expected the Soviet Union and Communism to collapse in the 1990s, but they did.  So, one can hope that when the time is right, we will change our attitudes both on how we treat our environment and something that's total - tightly tied to what how we treat each other.  And if we do that and do it rapidly then I think our kids could have - and our grandkids, particularly, could have a wonderful world. FLATOW:  All right.  That's a good thought to end the week on Dr. Ehrlich. Thank you for taking time to be with us. Mr. EHRLICH:  All right.  Nice talking to you. FLATOW:  Paul Ehrlich, president of the Center for Conservation Biology.  Also professor of Population Studies at Stanford and author of the new book \"The Dominant Animal: Human Evolution and the Environment. \"  We're going to take a break and come back and change the mood altogether.  We're going to talk about Physics and about possibility of bending light backwards.  Sounds like science fiction, well it's something that's entering in the realm of science fact.  So interesting new studies about bending lights.  Stay with us, we'll talk about it.  IRA FLATOW, host:  You're listening to Talk of the Nation: Science Friday.  I'm Ira Flatow.

We've already discovered more than enough oil, that if we burn it, we're likely to just, you know, ruin the climate for our children or our grandchildren completely.  FLATOW:  Mm-hm.  Dr. EHRLICH:  And so, one of the things to do, get politically active, write to your politicians.  Vote, and vote for the right people.  And I don't have to tell you who that is these days, because we have now suffered through eight years of an administration that has fought very hard to keep science out of the news, to counter all the scientific information we have, to destroy the Endangered Species Act, which is inadequate.    But it's all we've got, so you know, learn about it, don't necessarily listen to me, I could be a - you know, a paid agent of the contraceptive industry or something.  Learn about it, there are lots of places you can learn about it, and then take political actions.  FLATOW:  Mm-hm.  Dr. EHRLICH:  That's a starter.  FLATOW:  Mm-hm.  1-800-989-8255, talking with Dr. Paul Ehrlich, author of \"The Dominant Animal: Human Evolution and the Environment. \"  Let's go to the phones.  To Roger in Cleveland.  Hi, Roger.  ROGER (Caller):  Hi, Ira.  Hi, Paul.  How are you doing today?  Dr. EHRLICH:  Hi.  It's a very nice day here in California.  ROGER:  Well, up here in Cleveland, it's kind of hot and sunny, but that's OK.  FLATOW:  Get used to it.  ROGER:  Yeah, yeah.  (Soundbite of laughter)  ROGER: Listen, I'm a crayfish-conservation biologist and I've been - I've worked in aquatic ecology for 30 years.  And I just wanted to bring out the point that almost 50 percent of the crayfish here in the United States and Canada are in need of some conservation attention.    In terms of three big groups in aquatic systems, the fish, the bivalves - the bivalve mussels, and the crayfish, on average, about 33 percent of the species in those three groups are endangered.  And I just finished participating in a court case where there was a species of crayfish found in a small drainage base in about a couple of square miles, very, very small and someone wants to dig a big old mine right in the middle of its habitat.  And the state of Tennessee couldn't stop them from doing it.  So, our environmental laws are really - they're empty.  They're not doing much.  We have laws, but they're ineffective.  Dr. EHRLICH:  They're ineffective, and the Bush administration has been struggling very hard to make them less effective.  And as you know, when we talked to any specialist in any group, I mean, for instance, I did a lot of my work on evolution in butterflies, and you go back to place after place where there used to be populations, they're gone.  In the oceans, if we're going to get wet, the number of oxygen-starved dead zones in the coastal waters has about doubled every decade since the 1960s killing off populations of fish, crabs, other marine life.  And we're just doing this all over the world, and we can't do without these organisms.  Thank you for calling and pointing out to me that I often neglected to talk about fresh water organisms which are some of the most endangered in our country and around the world.  FLATOW:  Thank you, Roger.  Let's go to Sarah in Good Thunder, Minnesota.  Hi, Sarah.  SARAH (Caller):  Hi.  Dr. EHRLICH:  Hi.  SARAH:  Thanks for having me.  It's a great conversation.  I'm just calling to comment that in Minnesota where the mosquitoes should be prevalent, I noticed on my farm in the last three years, there'd been bursts of mosquitoes in the spring, followed by nothing, and the frog populations are down.  I used to, you know, work out in the garden all year long or out summer long with a mosquito repellent.  I haven't bought any four years.  So, what's happening?  I know that this administration and many local - has the USDA, you know, said that farmers don't have to report the pesticides that they're using now.  I believe that was in the paper the other day.  I just - you're right about changing administrations or leaders that go against our natural environment, and it's going to leave us, you know, in a death row.  Dr. EHRLICH:  Well, the frogs are particularly worrying because to mix my metaphors, they sort of can be the canary in the mine because they're dependent on both aquatic and terrestrial habitats, most of them, and they breathe through their skins and they're very sensitive to everything from the toxics, which we release in gigantic amounts, the pesticides, herbicides, and just the industrial chemicals in general. And they're also very sensitive to ultraviolet light, which of course we've had problems with because of the partial depletion of the ozone layer.    So, we're not sure why the frogs are disappearing.  But all of the scientist who looked at it are very worried.  I should point out, by the way, that I am a crazy ecologist.  But I'm actually expressing on a general picture of which way - where humanity is going, the grim business as usual forecast.  I am speaking for the entire scientific community.  Go to www. dominantanimal - written as one word - dot org and click on further information, and you'll see the statements that were put out by 58 academies of science in 1993 and the world scientist's warning the humanity which was signed by more than 1500 scientist including more than half of the living Nobel laureates all saying, if we don't change our ways, we're going to get down the drain and that attracted no attention, and it's still the view of the scientific community.  FLATOW:  We're talking with Dr. Paul Ehrlich, author of the \"Dominant Animal: Human Evolution and the Environment\" on Talk of the Nation, Science Friday from NPR News.  I'm Ira Flatow.  Does the fact that Europe at least is a little greener-thinking than we are give you any hope?  Dr. EHRLICH:  Well, that gives me - listen, there are a lot of reasons for hope if we do something, and one of the things that most hopeful about Europe is, of course, that their birth rates are way down.  And where you want to see birth rates way down, of course, is in the richest countries because they are the ones whose levels of consumption put most of the pressure on the planet's environmental system.  And so we could easily - we ought to be imitating what's going on in Europe.  Instead, we're the most over populated country in the world.    The third largest in actual numbers of people, but of course, when you factor in our huge levels of consumption, we're way behind beyond China and India in our impact on the planet.  And we're still growing like a sky rocket and we don't - unlike most poor countries, we don't even have a population policy.  I mean, in United States, we argue about migration immigration policy without having a population policy.  It's kind of like saying to somebody, design me an airplane that'll load 100 people a minute.  And when you say, well, how many should it fly with?  You say, well, don't worry about that - just one little, you know, load a 100 people a minute. '  FLATOW:  But doesn't the expansion of China, both economically and the population wise concern you?  Dr. EHRLICH:  Oh, it certainly does.  FLATOW:  Does that concern you?  Dr. EHRLICH:  I think.  In 1972, a political scientist colleague and I wrote an op-ed for the New York Times saying, \"What if All the Chinese had Wheels? \"  Asking what would happen with the planet's environment if the five - then 500 million Chinese started getting interested in cars.  Now, we have 1. 3 billion Chinese who are getting interested in cars.  They're soon going to pass us as a polluter in many areas.  They're virtually out of water.  There's essentially no potable water in the country.  One of the reasons their rain is so acid is that they keep coal fires going all the time to boil their water.  They're building coal-fired power plant which is the worst possible thing you can do in terms of climate change at an incredible rate several a week.    So, yes I'm extremely concerned about China.  But you know, It's hard for an American to talk about what China should be doing when we're doing the opposite.  And we set a terrible example for the world.  In this like it's very hard to criticize politicians for not getting on top of these problems when still many of our colleagues in science are still sticking to their experiments and not worrying about the world coming to an end.  FLATOW:  Though yet, you still want to keep a hopeful attitude about this.  Mr. EHRLICH:  Yes because there's so many things we could do.  And one of the reasons to be hopeful is the reasons we don't fully understand.  Societies can change extremely rapidly in their behavior and attitude.  So if you remember in the 1960s, we changed the United States dramatically in terms of race relations late '50s and '60s.  Birth rates change quite rapidly in the United States in the early '70s, and the best recent example is nobody that I know expected the Soviet Union and Communism to collapse in the 1990s, but they did.  So, one can hope that when the time is right, we will change our attitudes both on how we treat our environment and something that's total - tightly tied to what how we treat each other.  And if we do that and do it rapidly then I think our kids could have - and our grandkids, particularly, could have a wonderful world.  FLATOW:  All right.  That's a good thought to end the week on Dr. Ehrlich. Thank you for taking time to be with us.  Mr. EHRLICH:  All right.  Nice talking to you.  FLATOW:  Paul Ehrlich, president of the Center for Conservation Biology.  Also professor of Population Studies at Stanford and author of the new book \"The Dominant Animal: Human Evolution and the Environment. \"  We're going to take a break and come back and change the mood altogether.  We're going to talk about Physics and about possibility of bending light backwards.  Sounds like science fiction, well it's something that's entering in the realm of science fact.  So interesting new studies about bending lights.  Stay with us, we'll talk about it. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.  All rights reserved.

A hundred years ago you were just as likely to get your meds from a carpet-bagging quack as from a doctor. Then along came Abraham Flexner, not a doctor, but an expert in education. In 1908 he began an appraisal of American medical schools that would revolutionize the way doctors are trained. It's called the Flexner Report and it ultimately led to the best medical education system in the world. Dr. Gert Brieger is with Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. His expertise, the history of medicine. Dr. Brieger, welcome to the show. Dr. GERT BRIEGER (History of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore): Thank you. SEABROOK: Take us back, if you would, 100 years. What was medicine like then? Dr. BRIEGER: Medicine was a hit-or-miss proposition. Somebody said that around 1910 a random patient with a random illness consulting a random physician had just about a 50-50 chance of benefiting from that encounter. And part of that was because the training that many physician received was of very poor quality. SEABROOK: Then along came Abraham Flexner. Who is he and how did he start his appraisal of medical schools? Dr. BRIEGER: Abraham Flexner was asked by the Carnegie Foundation in New York to make an appraisal of American medical schools, which he did in 1908 and 1909. And it was a blockbuster kind of a report because it made scathing judgments about many medical schools that were really of very inferior quality. They were simply run as profit-making enterprises. It was kind of a social classic in the sense that Betty Freidan's Feminine Mystique and Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, they were sort of social classics that were very important. And Flexner did the same thing about medical schools. SEABROOK: In his report, Abraham Flexner reviewed all of the American medical schools at the time - more than 150 of them. What were some of the schools teaching? Dr. BRIEGER: Well, that's a good question. They weren't teaching very much. They were exposing their students to a little bit of anatomical dissection and maybe a little bit of physiology lab. And some of the conditions that he found were truly atrocious. And his main criticisms were that they had very poor clinical education, very poor clinical facilities. And what Flexner wanted to do was to have students understand where the knowledge came from and how it was derived, not mainly to learn memorization of facts given in a lecture. SEABROOK: Dr. Brieger, you're associated with Johns Hopkins, one of the best medical schools in the world, obviously. Do you see on a daily basis the impact today of the Flexner Report? Dr. BRIEGER: Well, you do in a sense that medical schools are much more alike today than they were in his day. And Flexner and others in his time who were involved in the reform of medical education, they all wanted a scientifically based education but what they were interested in was training good practitioners of medicine, people who would see patients. And one of the things that this sort of scientific basis for medicine and medical education has given us is an ability to understand disease much better than it was previously the case, especially in the 19th century. And it's this way of approaching illness and approaching patients that Flexner and his contemporaries, who were medical reformers, were advocating.

Question for our time, isn't it? But one company, Kinoki, says you can do it with adhesive pads that you stick to the bottom of your feet. Reporter Sarah Varney of member station KQED in San Francisco tests out that claim. SARAH VARNEY: I know, you're probably thinking: What kind of moron would believe that a toxin-sucking foot pad could work? Well, the photos in the front of the box are really convincing. There's a before photo, a white medical bandage, and an after foot pad filled with brownish, blackish gunk, supposedly heavy metals and metabolic waste. I slapped them on my feet and went off to bed. It's the next morning, so let's go ahead and pull off the pad. Ew, gross. (Soundbite of laughter) VARNEY: The pad is now full of just a gray, smoky mess. So now, we're going to take this to the lab in Berkeley and see if they find any heavy metals. And it really, really stinks. So this is my husband's sample. Mr. JOHN GOYETTE (Lab Manager): Okay. VARNEY: And these are mine. I hand over the gooey foot pads and some fresh, unused ones to John Goyette at Curtis and Thompkins lab in Berkeley. Mr. GOYETTE: The originals. Okay. Fantastic. VARNEY: The lab is EPA-certified and tests for metals, usually in consumer products like dishes and kids' toys. Lab director Dennis Doherty(ph) looks slightly puzzled and weirdly fascinated as he cuts up the patches and stuffs each one into a test tube. Then he squirts some nitric acid into each tube - which begins to digest the foot pads. A few hours later, they've turned into a liquid and are ready for testing. A glowing green machine reads the samples. And after a few minutes, out come the results. First, Doherty looks at the unused pad. The box says each one is filled with bamboo vinegar and an unknown mixture of minerals and herbs. Mr. DENNIS DOHERTY (Lab Director): And you see, we are finding low levels of zinc, some barium, even a little bit of arsenic. VARNEY: Dennis says there are very few products that have no metals in them at all, so these results aren't surprising. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. DOUGHERTY: Now this is the one from your foot. Now compared to the blank, that's almost identical to the blank pad. There's your husband's and\u2026 VARNEY: John, Dennis and the other lab technicians nod their heads in agreement. There was no significant difference between the unused pad and the gray, slimy ones. Mr. GOYETTE: It looks like three of the same sample, basically. VARNEY: There are just three samples, but the results are pretty conclusive: The toxin-sucking foot pads didn't work. I take the test results to Dr. Jim Seward. He's an environmental health physician at UC Berkeley. The news doesn't exactly rock his world. Dr. JIM SEWARD (Environmental Health Physician, UC Berkeley): Our bodies tend to eliminate metals through other mechanisms, primarily through the kidneys and through our intestinal tracts so that - the idea of drawing it out through the skin is really not very plausible. VARNEY: And what about the quote-unquote metabolic waste the product claims to remove? Dr. SEWARD: For many hundreds of thousands of years, we've been successfully eliminating them through the usual means, which is urine and feces. And there's been no demonstrated need to accelerate that. VARNEY: So, if it wasn't heavy metals or metabolic waste, what turned the Kinoki Detox Foot Pads into a gray, slimy mess? The chemists at the lab hypothesized that there's some ingredient that turns a dark color when exposed to moisture, like a sweaty foot. We decided to see if it was really that simple. (Soundbite of music) VARNEY: We've got a crowd of journalists here in the kitchen who are all waiting with bated breath to see if the pad, in fact, is going to turn black. Just hold it up over the steaming water. So we've got a pot of water on the stove that we're boiling, and now we're going to hold up the pad over the water and see what happens.

I'm Robert Siegel. MELISSA BLOCK, host: And I'm Melissa Block. There are a lot of theories out there about cows, why they sit down or stand up, or face one direction rather than the other. Now, a new study has identified one major influence on cows, the earth's magnetic field. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce has our story. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE: Hynek Burda didn't set out to study cows. He's a biologist at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany who studies small underground creatures called naked mole rats. They're blind, but have a kind of magnetic compass. They always build sleeping nests in the southern side of their little homes. Burda wondered if sleeping humans might do something similar. So he decided to look at camping tents and fired up Google Earth on his computer to get an overhead view of campgrounds. Tents were hard to see. But looking around on Google Earth, he realized he could see cows, lots and lots of cows. So he decided to see if they were affected by Earth's magnetic field. Mr. HYNEK BURDA (Biologist, University of Duisburg-Essen): We just stopped looking on camping people and started to look on cows. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Over 8,000 cows from pastures all around the world. The results appear in this week's issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. They show that cows tend to face either magnetic north or south when grazing or resting. Mr. BURDA: Most of them actually align in a north-south direction. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Regardless of where the sun was or how the wind blew. Now, Burda told one friend about these results, a hunter, who said, well, why don't you also look at deer beds, these oval hollows in the snow that deer make when they're sleeping? And again, it's on the north-south orientation. Mr. RICHARD HOLLAND (Biologist, University of Leeds): It's a very clever use of Google Earth, and the evidence is quite compelling. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Richard Holland is a biologist with the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom. Mr. HOLLAND: It does seem that these animals are detecting the Earth's magnetic field and using it to point in a north-south direction. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Holland says there's one way to confirm that this is really happening. Mr. HOLLAND: The next step is to start going out and putting magnets on the heads of cows and horses and deer and everything, to see how that affects them. That's one of the more traditional ways of testing if they have a magnetic sense. GREENFIELDBOYCE: If they really do have an internal compass, the magnet would mess it up. Now, some birds use magnetic compasses for navigation, and bats do, too, but Holland says it's not clear what cows or deer would get out of it. He says it may just be a leftover from their ancestors' ancient wanderings. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host:  This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Robert Siegel.

Now, a new study has identified one major influence on cows, the earth's magnetic field. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce has our story.  NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE: Hynek Burda didn't set out to study cows. He's a biologist at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany who studies small underground creatures called naked mole rats. They're blind, but have a kind of magnetic compass. They always build sleeping nests in the southern side of their little homes.  Burda wondered if sleeping humans might do something similar. So he decided to look at camping tents and fired up Google Earth on his computer to get an overhead view of campgrounds. Tents were hard to see. But looking around on Google Earth, he realized he could see cows, lots and lots of cows. So he decided to see if they were affected by Earth's magnetic field.  Mr. HYNEK BURDA (Biologist, University of Duisburg-Essen): We just stopped looking on camping people and started to look on cows.  GREENFIELDBOYCE: Over 8,000 cows from pastures all around the world. The results appear in this week's issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. They show that cows tend to face either magnetic north or south when grazing or resting.  Mr. BURDA: Most of them actually align in a north-south direction.  GREENFIELDBOYCE: Regardless of where the sun was or how the wind blew. Now, Burda told one friend about these results, a hunter, who said, well, why don't you also look at deer beds, these oval hollows in the snow that deer make when they're sleeping? And again, it's on the north-south orientation.  Mr. RICHARD HOLLAND (Biologist, University of Leeds): It's a very clever use of Google Earth, and the evidence is quite compelling.  GREENFIELDBOYCE: Richard Holland is a biologist with the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom.  Mr. HOLLAND: It does seem that these animals are detecting the Earth's magnetic field and using it to point in a north-south direction.  GREENFIELDBOYCE: Holland says there's one way to confirm that this is really happening.  Mr. HOLLAND: The next step is to start going out and putting magnets on the heads of cows and horses and deer and everything, to see how that affects them. That's one of the more traditional ways of testing if they have a magnetic sense.  GREENFIELDBOYCE: If they really do have an internal compass, the magnet would mess it up.  Now, some birds use magnetic compasses for navigation, and bats do, too, but Holland says it's not clear what cows or deer would get out of it. He says it may just be a leftover from their ancestors' ancient wanderings.  Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.  All rights reserved.

But it hasn't always been. There have been ups and downs in oxygen levels and they may have played a role in mass extinctions and the evolution of mammals. A new experiment suggests the history of the Earth's oxygen may need a serious rewrite. NPR's Richard Harris has our story. RICHARD HARRIS: Much as they'd love to, scientists can't travel back into time to measure the oxygen content of ancient air. So they need to find hints in the rocks. And one hint is the presence of charcoal dating back hundreds of millions of years. Charcoal means there were fires, and those fires needed oxygen. So, Claire Belcher and a colleague at University College in Dublin set out to answer a seemingly easy question, how much oxygen do you need to make a fire? HARRIS: Being able to create a low-oxygen environment that's realistic is quite hard. HARRIS: They spent well over a million dollars to build chambers that would allow them to control oxygen levels and other gases as well. HARRIS: I had to wear what kind of looks like a spacesuit. . . (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)HARRIS: . . . to actually work in the chambers because it was down to nine percent oxygen. Humans would have trouble below 18 percent oxygen. HARRIS: Belcher and her colleague tried to light pine twigs and peat moss on fire, and they very gradually increased the amount of oxygen in the chambers. HARRIS: I couldn't just go in there and strike one match, say, oh, look, it didn't light. So I was in there for a good few months in this spacesuit igniting fires. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)HARRIS: And as they now report in Science magazine, it actually takes quite a bit of oxygen in the atmosphere to sustain a fire. HARRIS: You needed atmospheric oxygen concentrations at 15 percent to ignite a wildfire, essentially. HARRIS: That 15 percent is a lot more than some previous estimates. In fact, some scientists, using other methods to estimate oxygen levels, say there are times when they are a lot lower, around 10 percent. And one of those periods of low oxygen coincides with an enormous mass extinction 240 million years ago. So, scientists suspect low oxygen could even have been a major reason for that die-off. Maybe not if this new estimate of oxygen is correct. Now, oxygen levels aren't just about understanding extinction, they could be involved in the evolution of animals. Paul Falkowski at Rutgers University has proposed that since the days of the dinosaurs, oxygen levels on Earth have gradually risen, from 10 percent to present levels of more than 20 percent. HARRIS: All data show there was a rise of oxygen from about 150 million years ago to present time. And we believe that about 55 million years ago, there was a big tick of oxygen. HARRIS: And oxygen boost gradually made the environment more favorable for our own lineage, the mammals. HARRIS: Mammals started to get very large, and they rose to massive prominence over the next 20 million years. And so, the rise of placental mammals really is a story we believe that's still based upon high concentrations of atmospheric oxygen. HARRIS: But the story gets more complicated when you look back farther in time. If, as Falkowski believes, the atmosphere was only 10 percent oxygen before the dinosaur boom times, that suggests a world with forest of ferns and conifers, but without fire. So, there could've been a period of time on Earth where, essentially, there was not enough oxygen to create wildfires. HARRIS: Exactly. HARRIS: That's a wild thought. HARRIS: It is a wild thought. HARRIS: That's also possibly contrary to some of the fossil evidence. So right now, the pieces aren't all fitting together neatly. It's a work in progress. But the payoff would be understanding how our atmosphere came to be full of life-giving oxygen today. Richard Harris, NPR News.

Scientists at CERN, the giant lab in Switzerland are very excited.  They just can't wait to set up, fire up the Large Hadron Collider, that's a 17 mile - 17 mile in a big circle is a particle accelerated that will send bits of  matter crashing into each other at speeds very close to the speed of light.   And physicists are hoping that these crashes will help them sort of recreate the big bang on a very small scale of the universe, so that they can get a better understanding of what our universe is made of and what it might have looked like back then 14 billion years ago.  We're also hoping to catch a glintz - a glimpse of what is talked about as the Higgs boson particle.    They've never seen it.  They hope to see it and why do they want to see it?  Well, Dan Hooper will tell us, he's an associate scientist at the Theoretical Astrophysics Group at Fermi Lab and an assistant professor of - at the University of Chicago.  His new book is called \" Nature's Blueprint: Supersymmetry and the Search for a Unified Theory of Matter and Force. \" Welcome to Science Friday, Dr. Hooper. Dr. DAN HOOPER (Associate Scientist, Theoretical Astrophysics Group, FermiLab; Assistant Professor, University of Chicago; Author, \"Nature's Blueprint: Supersymmetry and the Search for a Unified Theory of Matter and Force): Well, thanks for having me. FLATOW:  Are they all very excited, aren't they? Dr. HOOPER:  You wouldn't believe it. FLATOW:  How excited are - well, why is this so exciting? We've waited a long time for this. Dr. HOOPER:  Well, yeah.  This is - it's just such an enormous step forward in technology here.  So, we build accelerators and colliders, because we want to manufacture new kinds of matter that we haven't been able to see before. And to do that we need a lot energy at one place in one time.   FLATOW: Mm-hm. Dr. HOOPER:  It all comes down to the Einstein's E=MC2. If you want to create things with a lot mass, you need a lot of energy.  So what better way to put a lot of energy in one place at one time, than to take protons or something like them, and accelerate them to in this case 99. 999999 percent of the speed of light, and smash them into protons moving in the opposite direction.  That's the whole idea. FLATOW:  Mm. And then you come away with a particle that lasts maybe for a tiny fraction of  a second. Dr. HOOPER: Well, it depends what you make, and we don't know what were going to make.  You mentioned the Higgs boson.  If we create Higgs boson, they're gone in a flash of time, and we don't actually see the Higgs, we see the things that are left behind when that particle disappears. FLATOW: Mm. Mm-hm. Dr. HOOPER:  Other kinds of particles might exist, you know, for very long periods of time.  They might even be stable and then last forever. FLATOW:  Why do we want to see the Higgs boson? Dr. HOOPER:  Well, the Higgs plays a very special role in our understanding of nature's blueprint.  We think that the Higgs boson is the reason that other particles have mass at all, and let me stop and explain what that means.   So, the idea is that if there were no Higgs boson, then certain particles would be completely massless, meaning they would travel at the speed of light, and you could never slow them down.   They'd be radiation and not really matter.   But if we have something called the Higgs field, which is a background of these Higgs bosons popping in and out, and frothing in this cosmic background, then those otherwise massless particles will feel this field, and flow down, and congeal, and kind of form massive states.   And we think that this Higgs boson that we're looking for is why particles have mass.  It's a really important piece of this puzzle we're trying to solve. FLATOW:  What are the odds of finding this Boson? Dr. HOOPER: Well, I think in my book, I said - I bet 99 to one that the Higgs will be found at the LHC. FLATOW:  You're that positive? Dr. HOOPER:  I'm - I tend to be little more optimistic than some of my colleagues,  but yeah, I - I'm pretty sure the Higgs will be found, or something that does the same job as the Higgs. FLATOW:  Yeah. What about proving or disproving theories of nature that were, you know - what kinds of theories will be tested here?  Will string theory be tested here? Dr. HOOPER:  Well, some people like to say string theory will be tested, but I'm a little skeptical of that sort of claim.  So, usually when people say string theory will be tested, what they're really saying is that you'll see a something called supersymmetry exist at the scales that this experiment is probing.   And supersymmetry is really only one part of string theory, it seems that you need it for string theory, but supersymmetry alone won't tell you string theory is right.  It's a one-way arrow.  Now let me stop and say what supersymmetry is, because that's I think one of the most interesting things this machine will do.   So let me back up, and use a historical analogy.  Back in the 1930s, Paul Derac, the great physicist Paul Derac, recognized that the equations of quantum physics said for every kind of matter that exists, there has to be an opposite form that he called anti-matter and we call anti-matter.  And he just saw this in the mathematics.   A few years later, it showed up in yes in fact, electrons testings we called positrons and protons have anti-protons.  There is symmetry - fundamental symmetry between all kinds of matter and anti-matter.  Well supersymmetry is like that but it posits a fundamental symmetry between the kinds of particles we know as bosons and other kinds of particle we call phermions.  Phermions are matter and bosons are the things that bring forces in the being.  According to supersymmetry, you can't have one without the other.  Matter means force and force means matter.  If those particles exist, those super-partners we haven't seen yet, it's very, very likely the LHC will see them for the first time. FLATOW:  And that will help unify all of the theories of nature? Dr. HOOPER:  Well matter and force are two of the most fundamental ideas or concepts physicists use.  This would be a way of connecting those and saying that they're not separate pieces but different sides of the same piece. FLATOW:  What would you like to see happen? Dr. HOOPER:  If I could pick?  If I can find. . . FLATOW:  Yeah.  If you could pick? Dr. HOOPER:  I would pick something very wild.  I would hope that we will discover something like an extra dimension of space. FLATOW:  Is that possible? Dr. HOOPER:  It is possible.  I wouldn't say it's likely, but we have very plausible theories that solve certain problems that involve space not having nearly the three dimensions we're familiar with.  And if there were extra dimensions of dimension it would mean some kinds of matter presumably could travel through them.  And say you are a three-dimensional observer like us.  And we are looking at a particle that's only moving at an extra dimension.  To us it looks stationary, but it's actually moving with a great speed.  Well speed is just energy, and energy is just mass.  So, a particle moving at an extra dimension of space to us just looks like a very, very heavy version of a normal particle.  So we are hoping to create these kinds of heavy particles we called Kaluza-Klein states(ph).  And that would be evident of extra dimension existing. FLATOW:  Would it be possible to find dark matter? Dr. HOOPER:  Absolutely.  That's one of the most exciting thing that we hope to do. FLATOW:  How would we know it? Dr. HOOPER:  We know that some 90 percent of the matter in the universe is this invisible non-luminous thing we called dark matter.  It's very possible for the first time we'll build manufacture particles of dark matter in a laboratory in a Large Hadron Collider and study the properties in a controlled environment. FLATOW:  Any dark energy? Dr. HOOPER:  That's a harder nut to crack.  Not only do I not think the Large Hadron Collider will tell us what dark energy, but it wouldn't surprise me at all if I die without knowing what it is 50 years from now. FLATOW:  That is the really spooky part, isn't it? Dr. HOOPER:  Yes, it is. FLATOW:  Knowing with that - so when does this get fired up and what will be the first experiment? Dr. HOOPER:  Well it's September 10th, I believe is the official day that they are going to turn on the beams.  You know, and this will be at a lower energy than its design and not quite as many particles will travel through it but it will still - it will start doing experiments.  So I work at Fermilab, which is the kind of the American leading particle physics lab right now, and we are all going to have a pajama party there and stay up all night while they turn the machine on in Europe.  And so we are all looking forward to it immensely.  And hopefully in the next few months, something surprising will show up.  If not then, maybe next few years. FLATOW:  Let's get a phone call in from Jim in Jamesville, Wisconsin.  Hi, Jim. JIM (Caller):  Hi there.  Thank you for taking my call.  My question is what kind of safety precautions are being made if I am hearing you correctly, it sounds as though you are not sure exactly what's going to happen and what can be created.  Are there some type of containment procedures that are going to take place so that, you know, we don't create something that shouldn't have been - or should be contained? Dr. HOOPER:  So there are good reasons to think this machine is completely harmless.  And that's an understatement.  There's a bulletproof argument for why this machine is not going to be dangerous. FLATOW: Because people talked about black holes being created also. Dr. HOOPER:  Sure, and hopefully we will.  That will be great if we create black holes.  But they will be harmless black holes.  The reason we know that is because these sort of collisions have been every second of every day.  The particles from space are striking the Earth's atmosphere, and these are called cosmic rays.  We study these in detail.  They have been constantly.  Those collisions are not different than the collisions that will go on at the LHC.  The only thing that makes the LHC different is we can look at them more carefully and study them better.  So, if a black hole would be created at LHC that would say, destroy the Earth, it would have happened eons ago for particle heating the Earth's atmosphere doing the same thing. FLATOW:  Is this Collider going to make all the other ones even your Fermilab one obsolete? Dr. HOOPER:  Well, you know for the time being, the Fermilab accelerator will be running.  But yeah, it will supersede that and we going to have to look in the United States and at Fermilab towards building a bigger and better machine down the road. FLATOW:  There's always that huge project, what 15 years ago that got killed in Texas. Dr. HOOPER:  The Super Collider - Superconducting Super Collider.  It's a shame that that got shot down but I am optimistic for the future for American accelerator physics. FLATOW:  You think that American will spring for that -what, it was 10 billion dollars in those dollars if I remember. Dr. HOOPER:  Yeah, that's a right ballpark, yeah.  But we're rather optimistic that down the road we are either going to build something we called linear collider or maybe even a more exotic machine we call Huon Collider.  I have my fingers crossed, FLATOW:  Would you be more surprised if you found something unusual or don't find anything? Dr. HOOPER:  I'd be shocked if we don't find something.  It's just such an incredibly large step forward and the amount of energy we're going to be using and the amount - this discovery potential.  That if nothing exists there are to be found it would be beyond shocking. FLATOW:  And so when this - is there a long waiting list for scientist who want to make use of the machine. Dr. HOOPER:  Well, there are many thousands of scientists who are involved with the machine.  Many of them have their own pet projects, so they'll take the data and look for different things it.  Some people will be looking for (unintelligible) bosons.  Some people will be looking for supersymmetry.  Some people will be looking for extra dimension.  And some people will be testing, well, less exotic ideas.  And in the end, you know, those thousands of people will come together and try to make the most out of that data site, enormous data site. FLATOW:  And this is a giant ring underground between Switzerland and France? Dr. HOOPER:  That's right.  It's mostly under Geneva, Switzerland but it does cross the border in France.  It's 17 miles in circumference.  Around that ring, they shoot these protons around in bunches and they are about a hundred billion protons in each bunch.  And it accelerates 30 bunches a second.  So this is billions of billions of protons being injected every second.  It's amazing that they can even - that not only they can accelerate these particles at this speeds, but then they can actually watch them happen.  They measure the properties of six hundred collisions a second.  Oh, no, I am sorry, that's wrong six hundred million collisions a second. FLATOW:  We're talking with Dan Hooper, author of \"Nature Blueprint,\" \"Supersymmetry\" and the \"Search for Unified Theory of Matter and Force\" on Talk of the Nation Science Friday from NPR News, and talking about the Large Hadron Collider, coming online.  So scientists are just there waiting for it to be turned on.  Do you actually just flip a switch or how does it work? Dr. HOOPER:  You might have to ask the more of the engineering types.  I am theoretical physicist.  I just wait for them to tell me what they discovered. FLATOW:  How far back in time can you go with this, you know?  To the beginning or how? Dr. HOOPER:  Yes, yes.  So the ideas that the farther you go back in the history of our universe the hotter it was, the smaller and hotter it was.  And if you go back to the first instance then you have infinite density and temperature at times zero, the big bang.  Well, we're going to be putting collisions together of particles that have about 14 tera-electron volts of energy.  This is at a point in time before there were atoms, before there were nuclei, before there were even protons and neutrons.  Where they were just corks that made up the atoms itself.  It's a very, very tiny fraction of a second. FLATOW:  Well, thank you very much, Dan, and good luck to you. Dr. HOOPER:  Thanks for having me on. FLATOW:  Dan Hooper who is author of \"Nature Blueprint,\" \"Supersymmetry\" and the \"Search for Unified Theory of Matter and Force,\" waiting for the activation of Large Hadron Collider next month.  Now we're going to bring on our weekly feature. Flora Lichtman is here.  Hi, Flora. FLORA LICHTMAN: Hi. FLATOW:  She's our producer for digital media and what do we got up on the Science Friday Pick of the Week this week? LICHTMAN:  It's actually this week is a two-for-one deal on the videos so. . . FLATOW:  It's what?  A two for one.  A double header, as we say in baseball. LICHTMAN:  Yes.  A double header, double feature.  One is directly related to the segment.  It is an original rap music video about the Large Hadron Collider.  I am not kidding. FLATOW:  Really?  Someone made a music video about it? LICHTMAN:  It's a Ph. D student in linguistics in the U. K and a science writer teamed up and there is dancing, hot beats everything you would expect in the rap except that's it's about the Large Hadron Collider. FLATOW:  You wouldn't think that people will get so excited about this.  But the geeks out there.  The scientists out there. LICHTMAN:  It's awesome. FLATOW:  It's awesome.  And you can see it on - just go our website.  It's sciencefriday. com.  And you can go look on the video section. It's the video pick of the week.  And it runs for how long? You say? LICHTMAN:  I will run about a week. FLATOW:  Will run about a week and how long is the video itself? LICHTMAN:  The video itself is about five minutes. FLATOW:  Five minutes of the Large Hadron Collider rap music. LICHTMAN:  I mean, every minute you'll want to watch it.  It's very entertaining. FLATOW:  And the second one. LICHTMAN:  And the second video is a new research that's out this week about flies. FLATOW:  You mean those little buzzy things.  What do you mean?  What does it show in the research? LICHTMAN:  This researcher at Caltech used super, super fast video cameras, and he watched flies, and he revealed with this footage why flies are hard to swat. FLATOW:  And you can watch this extra slow-motion video. LICHTMAN:  Right.  So you can watch this unbelievably graceful ballet that the fly does to basically avoid the swatter.  So there is a lot going on.  You think you know, you think OK.  So you swat a fly and then nothing.  There is a lot of thinking going on the fly that it takes to avoid your swat. FLATOW:  And if fly has to take certain positions and he does this really quickly right? LICHTMAN:  Very fast and in fact, you would never be able to know what's going on without these super high-speed cameras, so. FLATOW:  Wow, so you got the video from the guy who studies the fly? LICHTMAN:  Right. FLATOW:  And you can watch this - and you'll also get to see what the fly sees, sort of, as he flies through them. LICHTMAN:  Yes, they don't just do take off.  This researcher has done lots of different studies on flies.  So he looks at how they move.  How they fly?  And so he has lots of techniques and tools, devices for studying flies including a fly flight simulator. FLATOW:  A fly. . . (Soundbite of laughter) LICHTMAN:  It's a tongue twister. FLATOW:  A fly flight simulator. Well - we'll going to have to go to www. sciencefriday. com and look at the videos, Flora. LICHTMAN:  Yeah, check it out. FLATOW:  Thank you very much.  That's about all the time we have for this hour of Science Friday.  I'd like to thank everybody who was involved in the program today.

So what better way to put a lot of energy in one place at one time, than to take protons or something like them, and accelerate them to in this case 99. 999999 percent of the speed of light, and smash them into protons moving in the opposite direction.  That's the whole idea.  FLATOW:  Mm. And then you come away with a particle that lasts maybe for a tiny fraction of  a second.  Dr. HOOPER: Well, it depends what you make, and we don't know what were going to make.  You mentioned the Higgs boson.  If we create Higgs boson, they're gone in a flash of time, and we don't actually see the Higgs, we see the things that are left behind when that particle disappears.  FLATOW: Mm. Mm-hm.  Dr. HOOPER:  Other kinds of particles might exist, you know, for very long periods of time.  They might even be stable and then last forever.  FLATOW:  Why do we want to see the Higgs boson?  Dr. HOOPER:  Well, the Higgs plays a very special role in our understanding of nature's blueprint.  We think that the Higgs boson is the reason that other particles have mass at all, and let me stop and explain what that means.    So, the idea is that if there were no Higgs boson, then certain particles would be completely massless, meaning they would travel at the speed of light, and you could never slow them down.   They'd be radiation and not really matter.    But if we have something called the Higgs field, which is a background of these Higgs bosons popping in and out, and frothing in this cosmic background, then those otherwise massless particles will feel this field, and flow down, and congeal, and kind of form massive states.    And we think that this Higgs boson that we're looking for is why particles have mass.  It's a really important piece of this puzzle we're trying to solve.  FLATOW:  What are the odds of finding this Boson?  Dr. HOOPER: Well, I think in my book, I said - I bet 99 to one that the Higgs will be found at the LHC.  FLATOW:  You're that positive?  Dr. HOOPER:  I'm - I tend to be little more optimistic than some of my colleagues,  but yeah, I - I'm pretty sure the Higgs will be found, or something that does the same job as the Higgs.  FLATOW:  Yeah. What about proving or disproving theories of nature that were, you know - what kinds of theories will be tested here?  Will string theory be tested here?  Dr. HOOPER:  Well, some people like to say string theory will be tested, but I'm a little skeptical of that sort of claim.  So, usually when people say string theory will be tested, what they're really saying is that you'll see a something called supersymmetry exist at the scales that this experiment is probing.    And supersymmetry is really only one part of string theory, it seems that you need it for string theory, but supersymmetry alone won't tell you string theory is right.  It's a one-way arrow.  Now let me stop and say what supersymmetry is, because that's I think one of the most interesting things this machine will do.   So let me back up, and use a historical analogy.  Back in the 1930s, Paul Derac, the great physicist Paul Derac, recognized that the equations of quantum physics said for every kind of matter that exists, there has to be an opposite form that he called anti-matter and we call anti-matter.  And he just saw this in the mathematics.    A few years later, it showed up in yes in fact, electrons testings we called positrons and protons have anti-protons.  There is symmetry - fundamental symmetry between all kinds of matter and anti-matter.  Well supersymmetry is like that but it posits a fundamental symmetry between the kinds of particles we know as bosons and other kinds of particle we call phermions.  Phermions are matter and bosons are the things that bring forces in the being.  According to supersymmetry, you can't have one without the other.  Matter means force and force means matter.  If those particles exist, those super-partners we haven't seen yet, it's very, very likely the LHC will see them for the first time.  FLATOW:  And that will help unify all of the theories of nature?  Dr. HOOPER:  Well matter and force are two of the most fundamental ideas or concepts physicists use.  This would be a way of connecting those and saying that they're not separate pieces but different sides of the same piece.  FLATOW:  What would you like to see happen?  Dr. HOOPER:  If I could pick?  If I can find. . .  FLATOW:  Yeah.  If you could pick?  Dr. HOOPER:  I would pick something very wild.  I would hope that we will discover something like an extra dimension of space.  FLATOW:  Is that possible?  Dr. HOOPER:  It is possible.  I wouldn't say it's likely, but we have very plausible theories that solve certain problems that involve space not having nearly the three dimensions we're familiar with.  And if there were extra dimensions of dimension it would mean some kinds of matter presumably could travel through them.  And say you are a three-dimensional observer like us.  And we are looking at a particle that's only moving at an extra dimension.  To us it looks stationary, but it's actually moving with a great speed.  Well speed is just energy, and energy is just mass.  So, a particle moving at an extra dimension of space to us just looks like a very, very heavy version of a normal particle.  So we are hoping to create these kinds of heavy particles we called Kaluza-Klein states(ph).  And that would be evident of extra dimension existing.  FLATOW:  Would it be possible to find dark matter?  Dr. HOOPER:  Absolutely.  That's one of the most exciting thing that we hope to do.  FLATOW:  How would we know it?  Dr. HOOPER:  We know that some 90 percent of the matter in the universe is this invisible non-luminous thing we called dark matter.  It's very possible for the first time we'll build manufacture particles of dark matter in a laboratory in a Large Hadron Collider and study the properties in a controlled environment.  FLATOW:  Any dark energy?  Dr. HOOPER:  That's a harder nut to crack.  Not only do I not think the Large Hadron Collider will tell us what dark energy, but it wouldn't surprise me at all if I die without knowing what it is 50 years from now.  FLATOW:  That is the really spooky part, isn't it?  Dr. HOOPER:  Yes, it is.  FLATOW:  Knowing with that - so when does this get fired up and what will be the first experiment?  Dr. HOOPER:  Well it's September 10th, I believe is the official day that they are going to turn on the beams.  You know, and this will be at a lower energy than its design and not quite as many particles will travel through it but it will still - it will start doing experiments.  So I work at Fermilab, which is the kind of the American leading particle physics lab right now, and we are all going to have a pajama party there and stay up all night while they turn the machine on in Europe.  And so we are all looking forward to it immensely.  And hopefully in the next few months, something surprising will show up.  If not then, maybe next few years.  FLATOW:  Let's get a phone call in from Jim in Jamesville, Wisconsin.  Hi, Jim.  JIM (Caller):  Hi there.  Thank you for taking my call.  My question is what kind of safety precautions are being made if I am hearing you correctly, it sounds as though you are not sure exactly what's going to happen and what can be created.  Are there some type of containment procedures that are going to take place so that, you know, we don't create something that shouldn't have been - or should be contained?  Dr. HOOPER:  So there are good reasons to think this machine is completely harmless.  And that's an understatement.  There's a bulletproof argument for why this machine is not going to be dangerous.  FLATOW: Because people talked about black holes being created also.  Dr. HOOPER:  Sure, and hopefully we will.  That will be great if we create black holes.  But they will be harmless black holes.  The reason we know that is because these sort of collisions have been every second of every day.  The particles from space are striking the Earth's atmosphere, and these are called cosmic rays.  We study these in detail.  They have been constantly.  Those collisions are not different than the collisions that will go on at the LHC.  The only thing that makes the LHC different is we can look at them more carefully and study them better.  So, if a black hole would be created at LHC that would say, destroy the Earth, it would have happened eons ago for particle heating the Earth's atmosphere doing the same thing.  FLATOW:  Is this Collider going to make all the other ones even your Fermilab one obsolete?  Dr. HOOPER:  Well, you know for the time being, the Fermilab accelerator will be running.  But yeah, it will supersede that and we going to have to look in the United States and at Fermilab towards building a bigger and better machine down the road.  FLATOW:  There's always that huge project, what 15 years ago that got killed in Texas.  Dr. HOOPER:  The Super Collider - Superconducting Super Collider.  It's a shame that that got shot down but I am optimistic for the future for American accelerator physics.  FLATOW:  You think that American will spring for that -what, it was 10 billion dollars in those dollars if I remember.  Dr. HOOPER:  Yeah, that's a right ballpark, yeah.  But we're rather optimistic that down the road we are either going to build something we called linear collider or maybe even a more exotic machine we call Huon Collider.  I have my fingers crossed,  FLATOW:  Would you be more surprised if you found something unusual or don't find anything?  Dr. HOOPER:  I'd be shocked if we don't find something.  It's just such an incredibly large step forward and the amount of energy we're going to be using and the amount - this discovery potential.  That if nothing exists there are to be found it would be beyond shocking.  FLATOW:  And so when this - is there a long waiting list for scientist who want to make use of the machine.  Dr. HOOPER:  Well, there are many thousands of scientists who are involved with the machine.  Many of them have their own pet projects, so they'll take the data and look for different things it.  Some people will be looking for (unintelligible) bosons.  Some people will be looking for supersymmetry.  Some people will be looking for extra dimension.  And some people will be testing, well, less exotic ideas.  And in the end, you know, those thousands of people will come together and try to make the most out of that data site, enormous data site.  FLATOW:  And this is a giant ring underground between Switzerland and France?  Dr. HOOPER:  That's right.  It's mostly under Geneva, Switzerland but it does cross the border in France.  It's 17 miles in circumference.  Around that ring, they shoot these protons around in bunches and they are about a hundred billion protons in each bunch.  And it accelerates 30 bunches a second.  So this is billions of billions of protons being injected every second.  It's amazing that they can even - that not only they can accelerate these particles at this speeds, but then they can actually watch them happen.  They measure the properties of six hundred collisions a second.  Oh, no, I am sorry, that's wrong six hundred million collisions a second.  FLATOW:  We're talking with Dan Hooper, author of \"Nature Blueprint,\" \"Supersymmetry\" and the \"Search for Unified Theory of Matter and Force\" on Talk of the Nation Science Friday from NPR News, and talking about the Large Hadron Collider, coming online.  So scientists are just there waiting for it to be turned on.  Do you actually just flip a switch or how does it work?  Dr. HOOPER:  You might have to ask the more of the engineering types.  I am theoretical physicist.  I just wait for them to tell me what they discovered.  FLATOW:  How far back in time can you go with this, you know?  To the beginning or how?  Dr. HOOPER:  Yes, yes.  So the ideas that the farther you go back in the history of our universe the hotter it was, the smaller and hotter it was.  And if you go back to the first instance then you have infinite density and temperature at times zero, the big bang.  Well, we're going to be putting collisions together of particles that have about 14 tera-electron volts of energy.  This is at a point in time before there were atoms, before there were nuclei, before there were even protons and neutrons.  Where they were just corks that made up the atoms itself.  It's a very, very tiny fraction of a second.  FLATOW:  Well, thank you very much, Dan, and good luck to you.  Dr. HOOPER:  Thanks for having me on.  FLATOW:  Dan Hooper who is author of \"Nature Blueprint,\" \"Supersymmetry\" and the \"Search for Unified Theory of Matter and Force,\" waiting for the activation of Large Hadron Collider next month.  Now we're going to bring on our weekly feature. Flora Lichtman is here.  Hi, Flora.  FLORA LICHTMAN: Hi.  FLATOW:  She's our producer for digital media and what do we got up on the Science Friday Pick of the Week this week?  LICHTMAN:  It's actually this week is a two-for-one deal on the videos so. . .  FLATOW:  It's what?  A two for one.  A double header, as we say in baseball.  LICHTMAN:  Yes.  A double header, double feature.  One is directly related to the segment.  It is an original rap music video about the Large Hadron Collider.  I am not kidding.  FLATOW:  Really?  Someone made a music video about it?  LICHTMAN:  It's a Ph. D student in linguistics in the U. K and a science writer teamed up and there is dancing, hot beats everything you would expect in the rap except that's it's about the Large Hadron Collider.  FLATOW:  You wouldn't think that people will get so excited about this.  But the geeks out there.  The scientists out there.  LICHTMAN:  It's awesome.  FLATOW:  It's awesome.  And you can see it on - just go our website.  It's sciencefriday. com.  And you can go look on the video section. It's the video pick of the week.  And it runs for how long? You say?  LICHTMAN:  I will run about a week.  FLATOW:  Will run about a week and how long is the video itself?  LICHTMAN:  The video itself is about five minutes.  FLATOW:  Five minutes of the Large Hadron Collider rap music.  LICHTMAN:  I mean, every minute you'll want to watch it.  It's very entertaining.  FLATOW:  And the second one.  LICHTMAN:  And the second video is a new research that's out this week about flies.  FLATOW:  You mean those little buzzy things.  What do you mean?  What does it show in the research?  LICHTMAN:  This researcher at Caltech used super, super fast video cameras, and he watched flies, and he revealed with this footage why flies are hard to swat.  FLATOW:  And you can watch this extra slow-motion video.  LICHTMAN:  Right.  So you can watch this unbelievably graceful ballet that the fly does to basically avoid the swatter.  So there is a lot going on.  You think you know, you think OK.  So you swat a fly and then nothing.  There is a lot of thinking going on the fly that it takes to avoid your swat.  FLATOW:  And if fly has to take certain positions and he does this really quickly right?  LICHTMAN:  Very fast and in fact, you would never be able to know what's going on without these super high-speed cameras, so.  FLATOW:  Wow, so you got the video from the guy who studies the fly?  LICHTMAN:  Right.  FLATOW:  And you can watch this - and you'll also get to see what the fly sees, sort of, as he flies through them.  LICHTMAN:  Yes, they don't just do take off.  This researcher has done lots of different studies on flies.  So he looks at how they move.  How they fly?  And so he has lots of techniques and tools, devices for studying flies including a fly flight simulator.  FLATOW:  A fly. . .  (Soundbite of laughter)  LICHTMAN:  It's a tongue twister.  FLATOW:  A fly flight simulator. Well - we'll going to have to go to www. sciencefriday. com and look at the videos, Flora.  LICHTMAN:  Yeah, check it out.  FLATOW:  Thank you very much.  That's about all the time we have for this hour of Science Friday.  I'd like to thank everybody who was involved in the program today.

Not only does this news give us humans a crucial piece of intelligence for modifying our swatting strategy, it also tells us that a fly's brain is pretty amazing. NPR's Joe Palca has more. JOE PALCA: There's probably no one in the world better to answer the question of how to swat a fly than Michael Dickinson. MICHAEL DICKINSON: We've always been interested in how flies launch and, you know, how flies fly and how flies land. And this particular study was focusing on takeoff. PALCA: Specifically, how they take off to avoid a threat, like a rapidly-approaching fly swatter. Dickinson is at Cal Tech, where he has all sorts of sophisticated equipment for following fly flight, including infrared stereoscopic cameras and specialized flight software. His latest tool is a high-speed video camera capable of shooting 5,400 frames per second. DICKINSON: By contrast, the standard video records at about 30 frames per second. PALCA: To study a fly's takeoffs, he first had to get the fly to stand in front of the camera. DICKINSON: That's actually one of the challenges of this study. And my graduate student, Gwyneth Card, is just a master at fly wrangling. PALCA: If fly wrangling calls up images of miniature lassos and whips, well, the reality is more prosaic. You chill the flies a bit and then get them to move toward a light, which they apparently like to do. DICKINSON: So, we were - rather she was able to lure individual flies out onto a little prismatic platform surrounded by a little water moat. PALCA: The prism in the platform let them see the fly from the bottom and side simultaneously. Once the fly is in the right place, a mini-fly swatter moves toward it. DICKINSON: What we noticed, because we could use these fancy high-speed video cameras, is before they actually jump, they perform an elegant little ballet with their legs. They move their legs around and they reposition their body so that when they do jump, they will push themselves away from the looming threat. PALCA: Dickinson says this little ballet is pretty remarkable. In less than a tenth of a second the fly has to perceive the threat using its eyes, determine what direction the threat is coming from, and then make the appropriate movement with its legs so it'll jump in the right direction to avoid the threat. DICKINSON: When you see a fly flittering around your hair or your potato salad, you know, you might see an annoyance. But in my lab we really see a marvelous machine, arguably the most sophisticated flying device on the planet, and it's all controlled by this brain about the size of a poppy seed. PALCA: Dickinson's future studies will continue to explore the amazing things a fly brain can do. But for now his study that appears in the journal Current Biology could be helpful to people as they flail away at a fly. DICKINSON: You shouldn't swat where you see them; you should anticipate that they're going to jump away from you. So you should extend your swat in the direction of the fly's anticipated motion. PALCA: So people who have this idea that they always jump up are mistaken; they jump away. DICKINSON: That's correct. However, I didn't enter in this research in order to help people swat flies better. In fact, I rarely swat flies. PALCA: To each his own, I say. Joe Palca, NPR News, Washington.

Of course, this is the weekend to say so long to summer, but before it's completely gone, we thought we'd take a scientific look at some of the boons and banes of the season. And we're calling it Summer Out of the Box. (Soundbite of music) LYDEN: First up: corn. If you've ever shucked a pile of it for dinner, you know how corn silk gets into just about everything. But what's it good for other than making a big mess? To find out, we called up Ken MacCaulay(ph), a farmer who at this very instant is standing in his cornfield in White Cloud, Kansas. Hello there, Ken. Mr. KEN MACCAULAY (Farmer): Hi, Jacki. It's good to be here. LYDEN: What does corn silk do, Ken? Mr. MACCAULAY: Well, corn silks are just essential to the production of corn because it's actually the pathway that the male pollen takes to get to the kernel, which is in the ear. So, it's the reproductive system of the corn. And, you know, you can call it the fallopian tubes of the corn plant really, because it actually carries the pollen from the tassel down to the ear. LYDEN: I'll be using that phrase at dinner with my husband tonight. (Soundbite of laughter) LYDEN: So, if I have an ear of corn at dinner and it's got some missing kernels, is that because nature didn't work and that particular strand of silk never got pollinated? Mr. MACCAULAY: That's exactly it. You've got to have that dust off of the tassel up at the top touch that fertile piece of silk. That pollen travels down through that silk to the spot on the ear, and every one of those kernels has a strand of pollen that it has to work. So, they're individually reproductive system for each kernel. LYDEN: So, if corn is pollinated by wind, does that mean you worry on days that are calm and hot? Mr. MACCAULAY: Yes, we do. The hot is the biggest issue and moisture. If you have cool nights, that helps you a lot. But if that silk gets too dry during the pollination period, which is usually about seven to ten days, then your pollination won't have as good a chance of happening and that's the end of your - the viability of that ear. You could either have a really good one, big, lots of kernels or, you know, sparse and missing a lot of kernels. LYDEN: Well, Ken MacCaulay, thanks so much for revealing the mysteries of the silk tassel. And you joined us from your farm. You're standing in the cornfield in northeastern Kansas in White Cloud. Thanks again. Mr. MACCAULAY: Thank you, Jacki. I really enjoyed it. LYDEN: Okay. Enough of that summer joy. Now, let's talk about a summer plague: mosquitoes. Are you 'squito candy? Do they dive bomb you and leave your friends alone? For answers, we turn to Carl Olson of the University of Arizona's department of entomology. Although, Mr. Olson, I guess there's not a lot of agreement on why some people are tastier than others. Mr. CARL OLSON (University of Arizona, Department of Entomology): Well, there's a complex of issues, and it can start with the amount of CO2 you breathe out; it could include your body temperature, could include what's in your sweat -lactic acid and citric acid. Or some of the mosquitoes are ankle biters, which are a plague. It's the bacteria on your feet - certain smelly feet are more attractive to those types of mosquitoes than others. LYDEN: Bad enough to have stinky feet. Mosquitoes like them? Mr. OLSON: Some mosquitoes do. In fact, one of my colleagues actually used to use old dirty socks that he put in his traps to bait these mosquitoes. (Soundbite of laughter) LYDEN: You mentioned lactic acid and citric acid. Does that mean mosquitoes are more likely to attack if you're running outside or working out outside or playing tennis or something like that? Mr. OLSON: Well, depending on the fitness and how much you're producing of those acids in your sweat. Each person's physiology seems to dictate different attractions. Generally they think that the more fit a person is, the less likely they're going to attract mosquitoes. LYDEN: Another reason to be buff. Well, we know that certain mosquito repellants work, but is there anything that we can do to become less of a mosquito magnet, for example, eat a lot of garlic or something like that? Mr. OLSON: Certainly garlic may help, or eating bananas. But, again, there hasn't been enough research done to say, oh, this person needs to each five gloves of garlic. It's an individual thing. LYDEN: Carl Olson is the associate curator of the department of entomology at the University of Arizona, and he joined us from the studios of KUAZ in Tucson. Thanks very much. Have a good Labor Day. Mr. OLSON: Okay. Thank you.  JACKI LYDEN, host:  It may be the quintessential scene of summer: the back porch dinner - peaches and tomatoes and corn from the farm stand, maybe a pitcher of margaritas, something sizzling on the grill and, of course, mosquitoes, hordes of them having their own summer feast on whatever bit of skin you've left uncovered.

Mr. MACCAULAY: That's exactly it. You've got to have that dust off of the tassel up at the top touch that fertile piece of silk. That pollen travels down through that silk to the spot on the ear, and every one of those kernels has a strand of pollen that it has to work. So, they're individually reproductive system for each kernel.  LYDEN: So, if corn is pollinated by wind, does that mean you worry on days that are calm and hot?  Mr. MACCAULAY: Yes, we do. The hot is the biggest issue and moisture. If you have cool nights, that helps you a lot. But if that silk gets too dry during the pollination period, which is usually about seven to ten days, then your pollination won't have as good a chance of happening and that's the end of your - the viability of that ear. You could either have a really good one, big, lots of kernels or, you know, sparse and missing a lot of kernels.  LYDEN: Well, Ken MacCaulay, thanks so much for revealing the mysteries of the silk tassel. And you joined us from your farm. You're standing in the cornfield in northeastern Kansas in White Cloud. Thanks again.  Mr. MACCAULAY: Thank you, Jacki. I really enjoyed it.  LYDEN: Okay. Enough of that summer joy. Now, let's talk about a summer plague: mosquitoes. Are you 'squito candy? Do they dive bomb you and leave your friends alone? For answers, we turn to Carl Olson of the University of Arizona's department of entomology. Although, Mr. Olson, I guess there's not a lot of agreement on why some people are tastier than others.  Mr. CARL OLSON (University of Arizona, Department of Entomology): Well, there's a complex of issues, and it can start with the amount of CO2 you breathe out; it could include your body temperature, could include what's in your sweat -lactic acid and citric acid. Or some of the mosquitoes are ankle biters, which are a plague. It's the bacteria on your feet - certain smelly feet are more attractive to those types of mosquitoes than others.  LYDEN: Bad enough to have stinky feet. Mosquitoes like them?  Mr. OLSON: Some mosquitoes do. In fact, one of my colleagues actually used to use old dirty socks that he put in his traps to bait these mosquitoes.  (Soundbite of laughter)  LYDEN: You mentioned lactic acid and citric acid. Does that mean mosquitoes are more likely to attack if you're running outside or working out outside or playing tennis or something like that?  Mr. OLSON: Well, depending on the fitness and how much you're producing of those acids in your sweat. Each person's physiology seems to dictate different attractions. Generally they think that the more fit a person is, the less likely they're going to attract mosquitoes.  LYDEN: Another reason to be buff. Well, we know that certain mosquito repellants work, but is there anything that we can do to become less of a mosquito magnet, for example, eat a lot of garlic or something like that?  Mr. OLSON: Certainly garlic may help, or eating bananas. But, again, there hasn't been enough research done to say, oh, this person needs to each five gloves of garlic. It's an individual thing.  LYDEN: Carl Olson is the associate curator of the department of entomology at the University of Arizona, and he joined us from the studios of KUAZ in Tucson. Thanks very much. Have a good Labor Day.  Mr. OLSON: Okay. Thank you. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Anthropologists have long debated whether indigenous people in the tropical Amazon developed an urban culture.  As NPR's Christopher Joyce reports, these latest findings suggest they did. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE:  Five hundred years ago, the Spanish explorer Francisco de Orellana paddled length of the Amazon River in search of El Dorado, the fabled city of gold.  He didn't find it, and no one has found lost cities in the Amazon forests.  Twentieth-century anthropologists concluded that urbanism in pre-Columbian South America existed only in the Andes Mountains. Michael Heckenberger didn't believe that.  He's an anthropologist and he's been working in a place in the Southern Amazon called Xingu.  There, he's found signs of dozens of villages at least 750 years old. Mr. MICHAEL HECKENBERGER (Anthropologist, University of Florida):  The real kind of head-ringer is the fact that they never occur alone. JOYCE:  Instead, they were built in clusters.  Satellite photographs reveal ancient disturbances of the earth where people had built the villages.  They were laid out geometrically, with a larger village in a big plaza in the middle of each cluster.  Heckenberger, from the University of Florida, compares them to medieval villages in Europe. Mr. HECKENBERGER:  The Xinguan communities, not only were there settlements as large as some of the small to medium-sized medieval towns, but there was four of them tied to a major center, and they were tied in very specific orientation.  It's like a - you know, almost like laying out a compass. JOYCE:  These clusters were aligned toward points in the sky for summer and winter solstices, when the sun reaches its northernmost and southernmost extremes.  Heckenberger's team has excavated what were wide roads running through the villages, and more roads connecting the clusters to each other.  Though very little remains of these towns, there are still deep ditches where Heckenberger believes palisade fences - much like medieval European walls - once stood. Mr. HECKENBERGER:  One of the things that Xingu has in spades, I mean, just blows your mind.  Its self-organization is just off the scale.  And this is just written on the landscape. JOYCE:  Heckenberger believes tens of thousands of people would have lived there.  These were not cities as the Incas built them.  They were more dispersed, yet connected.  Heckenberger says the layout is unique and calls it a sort of garden city. Jonathan Haas is an archeologist at the Field Museum in Chicago who studies Latin American cultures.  He says this runs counter to traditional views of early Amazonian living. Mr. JONATHAN HAAS (Archeologist, Field Museum, Chicago):  I mean, what you have in the Amazon is you don't have the ability to centralize production of resources because the landscape doesn't lend itself to that.  The landscape is dispersed in terms of its distribution of resources.  And that's why you don't get the full, formal centralization that you get in those other large city-states. JOYCE:  Haas says that's one reason why people doubted that Amazonians would bother to build centralized cities.  He says the discovery in the Xingu region suggests a sort of middle way for rainforest urbanization. Mr. HAAS:  It shows you how humans will take a different kind of environment and experiment with it, and they come up with different kinds of solutions in different areas.

NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE: The story of this gene starts not with men, but with prairie voles - small furry rodents that have underground burrows. Prairie voles stay with one mate to raise their little ones, and that's intriguing because other species of voles don't do that. A few years ago, a scientist named Larry Young at Emory University showed the bonding behavior of male prairie voles was linked to a single gene: a gene associated with a brain hormone called vasopressin. Dr. LARRY YOUNG (Scientist, Emory University): Yeah. We were actually able to take the gene from the prairie vole and inject it into the brain of the meadow vole, which normally should not form bonds. And when we did that, the meadow voles were actually able to form an attachment to their mate. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Everyone wanted to know: Could this same gene be at work in people? Hasse Walum is a researcher at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden who decided to do a study. Dr. HASSE WALUM (Researcher, Karolinska Institute): So what we wanted to do was to see if the variation in the same gene was associated with the variation in how humans bond with their partners. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He and his colleagues had DNA samples from hundreds of men who were participating in a study of twins.

GREENFIELDBOYCE: The researchers say that men who had a certain variant of the gene didn't score as high on these measures of bonding. And having two copies of this gene variant doubled the chances that men would report having had a marital crises in the last year. The results are reported in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Larry Young, the vole researcher, says other scientists need to confirm the finding to make sure it's real.

What is wrong with men anyway? Why don't they commit? Brothers, it is not our fault, or not entirely, for some of us, anyway. A new study published by the National Academy of Sciences says it's in our genes. And you can believe this study because it involves rodents. Reporter Nell Greenfieldboyce is here from the vaunted NPR Science Desk. Nell, what about this gene? NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE:  It's a gene associated with a brain hormone named vasopressin. And scientists got interested in it back when they were studying rodents called voles. You might have seen this if your cat brought them in. They're like little mice-like things that live out in the meadow. And some species of them are monogamous, while some aren't.  And so a few years ago, scientists found that, if they took this gene from a species of vole that was monogamous, the prairie vole, and they put it into another kind of vole, the meadow vole, suddenly, they could make the meadow vole bond to its mate in a way it hadn't before. And this got a lot of attention, and reporters immediately dubbed this the monogamy gene. CHADWICK:  And this gene is present in humans, or something like it. And so there's speculation about how it might apply to us. GREENFIELDBOYCE:  Yes, there was immediately speculation, and the researchers who did the original vole work say they get a lot of calls around Valentine's Day from people wanting to know if this was at work in men, too. But there hadn't been any studies until this new one.  A group in Sweden looked at this gene in hundreds of men, and they also looked at the men's answers to a bunch of questions. So things like how often do you kiss your wife or significant other? How often do you or your wife go out and do things together, you know, have interests outside the family? CHADWICK:  So what did they find? GREENFIELDBOYCE:  Basically, they found that men with one particular variant of this gene were more likely to score lower on this test. And what's more, they found that men with two copies of this gene variant were twice as likely to say that they'd had a marital crisis or threats of divorce in the last year. CHADWICK:  Now, is that statistically pretty significant? GREENFIELDBOYCE:  It was statistically shown to be real. It wasn't a huge effect. It was a small effect, a small association, but according to their study, it was real. Now that said, some researchers I spoke with said that they'd want to see this repeated by another group, just to make sure that there actually is this link. CHADWICK:  So how useful, really, is this info for a woman thinking about any particular man? Should she really ask now for some kind of gene analysis, or at least wonder about it? GREENFIELDBOYCE:  Yeah, I don't think you're going to see would-be brides taking their man into genetic testing clinics for this anytime soon, for a bunch of reasons. One, this gene, even though they found this association by looking at groups of men, it wasn't predictive for any one individual man. So that means, in this study, you had men who had the gene variant who didn't show any marital trouble at all. And meanwhile, you also had men who seemed to have some marital trouble who didn't have the gene. So you can't look at this gene for any one man and be able to make a prediction about what his relationship is going to be like.  Another thing to consider is, yeah, they found an association, but it was a modest one. And when you think about human relationships and all the things that go into human relationships, the effect of any single gene is going to be really, really small compared to a lot of other things that you could find out just by talking to the guy instead of looking at his DNA.

I'm Melissa Block. MICHELE NORRIS, host: And I'm Michele Norris. (Soundbite of shucking) NORRIS: That's the sweet sound of oysters being shucked at the Flying Fish restaurant in Seattle, Washington. (Soundbite of slurping) NORRIS: And that's the sweet sound of oysters being slurped. Most of these oysters come from oyster farms. The only wild oyster native to the North American West Coast is the Olympia. Once abundant, it's now hard to find. Scientists are turning north to Vancouver Island to study some of the last intact wild Olympia oyster reefs in the world. David Hyde of member station KUOW reports. DAVID HYDE: Brian Kingzett is a Canadian shellfish biologist. He's walked nearly every oyster beach in British Columbia. About 15 years ago, Kingzett was exploring a narrow inlet on Vancouver Island when he discovered oyster nirvana. Mr. BRIAN KINGZETT (Shellfish Biologist): In this particular area we're standing today, in Port Eliza, and just a very few other areas in the coast, we noted these really dense pockets of the native oyster, which is quite unusual because we actually surveyed several thousand beaches. HYDE: Kingzett is standing on the edge of a freshwater stream with two black bears feeding nearby. Dozens of Olympia oysters glisten in the mud at his boots. They're golden and tiny \u2014 about the size of 50-cent coins. And they occupy a solid band on this cobbly beach that starts just above the eel grass in the inlet. The Olympia oyster was at one time abundant on the West Coast and an important food source for bear, otters, as well as coastal tribes. Mr. KINGZETT: What is really important here is is that this is an animal that, you know, at the turn of the century \u2014 1800s \u2014 had extensive distributions from San Francisco all the way up into British Columbia where you, you know, you very rarely find it now in very large amounts, and then suddenly they're gone. HYDE: So what decimated the Olympia oysters? Kingzett says it started with the California Gold Rush, when commercial harvesters cleared entire beaches up and down the coast. Mr. KINGZETT: We know that, you know, over-fishing was a problem. We know that they're very sensitive to industrial pollution. HYDE: Human activities change the chemistry of these waters, destroying wild reefs. In Puget Sound in Washington State, wild Olympia oyster harvest has declined from the peak of more than 200 million oysters a year to nearly zero. Globally, all species of wild oysters have declined by more than 90 percent. But on this trip, scientists documented the fact that this remote inlet has the highest known density of wild Olympia oysters in the world. They say this bed is as healthy as it was hundreds of years ago. And it's so robust, it's drawn scientists from all over the U. S. and Canada. Joth Davis is a shellfish biologist from Puget Sound. Mr. JOTH DAVIS (Shellfish Biologist): What I'm doing here is digging the veneer of oysters in rocks away from the underlying sediment and I'm putting a quarrying device, see, into the ground. Take a core of the sediment under the veneer of oysters in small rocks. HYDE: Davis says understanding these intact wild beds will help restore Olympia oysters elsewhere. Mr. DAVIS: There are lots of oysters here. And the question I have - the ultimate question I have and what I would like to pass on to my children is, we need to try to understand how and why these beds retain their longevity. How do they persist? And that, to me, is going to be the ultimate challenge. HYDE: Davis thinks the pristine streams flowing down from the forest above onto the oyster beach may hold the key. Mr. DAVIS: There is nothing but trees and undisturbed watershed on this particular beach which is very rich in native oysters. HYDE: Davis works with an organization that's trying to bring wild Olympias back in Washington State despite ongoing pollution problems. They're seeing sites with young oysters and setting down old oyster shells to give the Olympias a place to grow. Similar programs to restore wild oysters are gaining momentum on both coasts in North America. And at least now, they're got a blueprint to show them where they want to go.

(Soundbite of slurping)  NORRIS: And that's the sweet sound of oysters being slurped. Most of these oysters come from oyster farms. The only wild oyster native to the North American West Coast is the Olympia. Once abundant, it's now hard to find. Scientists are turning north to Vancouver Island to study some of the last intact wild Olympia oyster reefs in the world.  David Hyde of member station KUOW reports.  DAVID HYDE: Brian Kingzett is a Canadian shellfish biologist. He's walked nearly every oyster beach in British Columbia. About 15 years ago, Kingzett was exploring a narrow inlet on Vancouver Island when he discovered oyster nirvana.  Mr. BRIAN KINGZETT (Shellfish Biologist): In this particular area we're standing today, in Port Eliza, and just a very few other areas in the coast, we noted these really dense pockets of the native oyster, which is quite unusual because we actually surveyed several thousand beaches.  HYDE: Kingzett is standing on the edge of a freshwater stream with two black bears feeding nearby. Dozens of Olympia oysters glisten in the mud at his boots. They're golden and tiny \u2014 about the size of 50-cent coins. And they occupy a solid band on this cobbly beach that starts just above the eel grass in the inlet. The Olympia oyster was at one time abundant on the West Coast and an important food source for bear, otters, as well as coastal tribes.  Mr. KINGZETT: What is really important here is is that this is an animal that, you know, at the turn of the century \u2014 1800s \u2014 had extensive distributions from San Francisco all the way up into British Columbia where you, you know, you very rarely find it now in very large amounts, and then suddenly they're gone.  HYDE: So what decimated the Olympia oysters? Kingzett says it started with the California Gold Rush, when commercial harvesters cleared entire beaches up and down the coast.  Mr. KINGZETT: We know that, you know, over-fishing was a problem. We know that they're very sensitive to industrial pollution.  HYDE: Human activities change the chemistry of these waters, destroying wild reefs. In Puget Sound in Washington State, wild Olympia oyster harvest has declined from the peak of more than 200 million oysters a year to nearly zero. Globally, all species of wild oysters have declined by more than 90 percent.  But on this trip, scientists documented the fact that this remote inlet has the highest known density of wild Olympia oysters in the world. They say this bed is as healthy as it was hundreds of years ago. And it's so robust, it's drawn scientists from all over the U. S. and Canada.  Joth Davis is a shellfish biologist from Puget Sound.  Mr. JOTH DAVIS (Shellfish Biologist): What I'm doing here is digging the veneer of oysters in rocks away from the underlying sediment and I'm putting a quarrying device, see, into the ground. Take a core of the sediment under the veneer of oysters in small rocks.  HYDE: Davis says understanding these intact wild beds will help restore Olympia oysters elsewhere.  Mr. DAVIS: There are lots of oysters here. And the question I have - the ultimate question I have and what I would like to pass on to my children is, we need to try to understand how and why these beds retain their longevity. How do they persist? And that, to me, is going to be the ultimate challenge.  HYDE: Davis thinks the pristine streams flowing down from the forest above onto the oyster beach may hold the key.  Mr. DAVIS: There is nothing but trees and undisturbed watershed on this particular beach which is very rich in native oysters.  HYDE: Davis works with an organization that's trying to bring wild Olympias back in Washington State despite ongoing pollution problems. They're seeing sites with young oysters and setting down old oyster shells to give the Olympias a place to grow.  Similar programs to restore wild oysters are gaining momentum on both coasts in North America. And at least now, they're got a blueprint to show them where they want to go.

I'm Michele Norris. MELISSA BLOCK, host: And I'm Melissa Block. The human thumb is one of nature's great accomplishments. Beyond its usefulness for hitchhiking, our opposable thumbs allow us to grasp and manipulate tools in ways no other animal can. Now scientists are reporting new information that helps explain how the human thumb came to be. NPR's Joe Palca has our story. JOE PALCA: Geneticist James Noonan of Yale University is trying to understand what makes humans human - why we can speak and other animals can't, why we can walk upright on two legs, why we can snap our fingers. To do that, he combs through the billions of letters of DNA that make up the human genome. Professor JAMES NOONAN (Genetics, Yale University): We're proceeding from the idea that there are sequences in the genome that distinguish humans from other species. And we really don't know what those are or where they are. PALCA: To find these hidden sequences, Noonan has an interesting strategy. He doesn't just look at the DNA in humans. He looks through the DNA in a variety of species: mice, chickens, dogs, chimpanzees. Prof. NOONAN: We asked: Are there any where it's clear that the sequence has been evolutionarily stable for a long period of evolutionary time, but now in humans is different? PALCA: You can think of it this way: Let's say there's a sequence of DNA in, say, a mouse that sounds like this\u2026 (Soundbite of song, \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\") PALCA: Then you look the same region of DNA in a chicken and a dog, even a chimpanzee, it sounds the same. (Soundbite of song, \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\") PALCA: But if you look at the sequence in humans, it's changed, mutated. It's still the same tune, but more complex. (Soundbite of song, \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\") PALCA: Geneticist Noonan searched for these DNA sequences that were different in humans than other animals and found one. As he reports in the journal Science, at first he had no idea what this sequence did. It didn't look like a traditional gene. It looked like what's called a regulatory element, something that controls when and where genes switch on and off. So he took his human DNA sequence and injected into a mouse egg to see which cells it became active in as the mouse embryo developed. To his delight, it affected cells near the developing limbs, specifically to the place where a mouse thumb would be if a mouse had a real thumb. Noonan says this sequence, unique to humans, appears to control a critical aspect of hand development. Prof. NOONAN: That's why we're so excited about this result, because we think maybe this sequence is one of those components that changed our evolution and is driving those sorts of developmental changes in the hand that differentiate us from other species. PALCA: That's an extremely reasonable hypothesis, at least according to Brian Richmond. Richmond is an anthropologist at George Washington University. Professor BRIAN RICHMOND (Anthropologist, George Washington University): Most changes in human evolution don't involve brand new structures that come out of nowhere. Rather, almost all of the ways that humans are different from other animals and other primates is mainly due to changes in the rate, timing and duration of growth. PALCA: Richmond says the bones, tendons and muscles that make up a hand in humans and chimpanzees are basically the same. It's how fast they grow and when they start and stop growing that makes all the difference. Prof. RICHMOND: That seems to be how we grow fingers that are shorter and grow a thumb that is long compared to an ape's. PALCA: So it makes sense that the new DNA sequence Noonan found would control when genes are turning on and off in a developing limb. Greg Gray of Duke University says Noonan's technique for finding hidden by important pieces of DNA should reveal a lot about evolution. Dr. GREG GRAY (Duke University): The fact that we don't always know exactly what those pieces do doesn't mean they can't tell us something about our history, and that's what's really interesting. PALCA: Because everybody likes to know what makes humans special. Joe Palca, NPR News, Washington.  MICHELE NORRIS, host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Michele Norris.

A doctor can use a balloon in a blood vessel to crush the gunky buildup that blocks blood flow in there. It works even better when you add a stent - that's a wire mesh tube - to keep things open. Nonemergency patients get this treatment, too, but should they? Dr. Sydney Spiesel joins us regularly to talk about medical research. He is a Yale Medical School professor. Syd, welcome back. You wanted to talk about a new study on angioplasty. Let's begin here. Who does get this treatment on a nonemergency basis? Dr. SYDNEY Z. SPIESEL (Pediatric Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine): Well, this study focused on patients with angina, that is, chest pain or tightness which is often associated with exertion. And these - this is a serious symptom. It can really limit a patient's life when it's severe. Even the exertion of dressing oneself can be daunting, and so, we're very aware of the effect of this illness.

CHADWICK: Well, tell us about the study. And I'll just say, I had a brother in law who has had this done on a nonemergency basis and, I think, actually, a lot of families have this now, this angioplasty to try to fix the blood vessels before a heart attack. Dr. SPIESEL: Well, I think it is actually fairly common, and the question is, just how useful is it? And there are two ways of looking at the question of usefulness. One way is the question of whether angioplasty and putting in a stent actually saves lives. Does it prevent future heart attacks? Does it decrease mortality? And unfortunately, the answer to that one, and that was clearly - that was an early part of the same study, said no. There's absolutely no benefit of angioplasty in these patients, not patients with - who are having acute coronary problems, but patients with what is called stable angina. There's really no benefit in terms of preventing heart attacks or decreasing mortality. CHADWICK: Well, if it doesn't prevent death, maybe there are other benefits. Maybe it improves the quality of life or it prevents pain. Dr. SPIESEL: Well, the answer here, again, from the same study, is sort of it does, but not by much. What was very striking about this study, though, was just how dramatically helpful the high-quality medical treatment was for both groups right away. That is, there was much, much greater improvement in the first few months for both groups that just got - because both groups got the medical treatment - than the small increment provided by angioplasty.

Scientists at the cutting edge of hurricane research say one reason we're seeing more storms this year may have to do with African dust. NPR's Jon Hamilton reports. JON HAMILTON: Big hurricanes like Gustav usually start out as small storms coming off the coast of Africa. These so-called African easterly waves tend to get stronger when they encounter favorable winds and warm water. They tend to dissipate if they hit cool water, disruptive air currents or dust. GREG JENKINS: Last year, we saw African easterly waves just get taken apart by dust storms. HAMILTON: Greg Jenkins is a hurricane expert at Howard University. He says dust also seem to weaken a lot of storms in 2006. But Jenkins says this year, the satellite images are telling a different story. JENKINS: We don't see any dust - any significant dust. But we do see Josephine, Ike and we see Hanna. HAMILTON: It's not clear why the amount of dust vary so much from year to year. But Jenkins is one of a growing number of scientists who believe that dust helps explain why some storms become hurricanes and some don't. He says the dust get swept up into the atmosphere as winds whip across the deserts of northern Africa. JENKINS: So in the summertime, we see a layer, basically about three miles up to probably six, seven miles high where we see a dust layer. We call it the Saharan air layer. HAMILTON: And it carries a lot of dust, millions of tons each season. For the past few years, scientists have been trying to figure out just what that dust does to baby storms. In 2006, NASA spent a month flying planes near developing storm systems along the African coast. During one of those flights, NASA scientist Robbie Hood described what happened to one of the storm system she was tracking. ROBBIE HOOD: The first day we flew it, it was pretty much clear in the center of it, just normal moisture pattern. The next day we flew it, we got in the center of it and it was filled with dust. HAMILTON: The storm petered out. That sort of research has added to the evidence that dust tends to tamp down developing storms. Bill Lau, who works at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, has published several studies on dust and storms. He says they all reach the same conclusion. BILL LAU: More dust, less hurricane and more hurricane, less dust. HAMILTON: But it's not entirely clear why. Lau says one likely reason is that dust particles absorb some of the sun's heat. They also reduce the amount of sunlight that reaches the ocean. LAU: So as a result, the ocean absorbs less heat from the sun, and therefore, it has an effect of cooling the ocean. HAMILTON: Meaning, less potential energy to fuel a hurricane. And Lau says there's another factor. LAU: Accompanying the dust are always dry air from the Sahara. And hurricane does not like dry air. So both of these effect, the dry air itself and also the blocking(ph) of solar radiation can suppress a hurricane. HAMILTON: Dust researchers say they are not trying to downplay other factors affecting the hurricane season - things like sea surface temperature and the presence of El Ni\u00c3\u00b1o wind patterns. But they say it may be time to start considering dust when making seasonal forecasts. Greg Jenkins says the lack of dust this year tells him that Josephine won't be the season's last storm. JENKINS: I'm a little nervous because unless dust really starts to develop or we get some other factors to weaken them, you know, it may be a rough ride in September and in October.

I'm Joe Palca sitting in for Ira Flatow.  When you ask people to name the kingdoms, most people get the big ones, animals, plants, bacteria.  Some people may even come up with the protists.  But there is one more.  Here's a hint.  Yeast are part of it, so are shiitakes.  Are you getting it?  Well, the answer is, fungi, or perhaps, I should say fungi.  We'll come up with that answer some time during hour two.  Either way you say it, members of this kingdom are everywhere.  From the protist aisle of the supermarket, to your backyard, to in between your toes.   Experts say there are more than a million species of fungi on the planet, and we've only discovered five percent or so.  So this hour, we salute you, fungi, from the macro, the ones you hot - find on your steak or in your sandwich, to the micro, the ones the cause illness and disease.  It's all things fungal this hour.  I can hear a new show on NPR.  Anyway, now, let me introduce my first two guests.  Kathie Hodge is associate professor of mycology at Cornell University.  She joins us from a studio on a campus in Ithaca, New York.  Welcome to Science Friday, Dr. Hodge. Dr. KATHIE HODGE (Associate Professor of Mycology, Cornell University):  It's a pleasure to be here, Joe. PALCA:  And my other guest to start off with is David Fischer.  He's a mycologist, and we'll get him to explain exactly what that means at some point, and the author of \"Edible Wild Mushrooms of North America. \" He joins us from the studios of WAER in Syracuse, New York.  Welcome to Science Friday, Mr. Fisher. Mr. DAVID FISCHER (Mycologist; Author, \"Edible Wild Mushrooms of North America\"):  Thank you, Joe.  Good afternoon. PALCA:  So this is all things fungal and if you wan to join the call, our number is 800-989-8255, that's 800-989-TALK.  If you want more information about what we'll be talking about this hour, go to our website at www. sciencefriday. com, where you'll find links to our topic.  And we'd also be interested in hearing from you, if you're listening or joining people on the Science Island in Second Life, and we'll (unintelligible) try and take some of your calls from there as well.  But let's start with you Dr. Hodge, and give us some definitions.  What's a fungus? Dr. HODGE:  Oh, I knew you were going to ask me that.  That's a tough one.  (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. DAVIS:  Don't worry.  I thought I was pitching the easy one first. Dr. HODGE:  Well, I used to teach that a fungus was heterotrophic. Right? PALCA:  Uh-oh. Dr. HODGE:  Can't make its own food. PALCA:  Yeah. Dr. HODGE:  So, no photosynthesis going on here. PALCA:  Right. Dr HODGE:  They are filamentous usually, so they're kind of fussy little things.  They make spores, and like us, they're eukaryotic, so they have a nucleus and mitochondria inside their cells. PALCA:  OK.  So, what - you used to say that. Dr. HODGE:  Yeah, because there's all these exceptions.  You know, we just talked about yeast on this show, and they're unicellular. . . PALCA: Yeah. Dr. HODGE:  For the most part.  Fungi can do lots of different things.  And they include everything from mushrooms, to yeasts, to the mold growing on your shower curtain. PALCA:  Uh-huh.  And filamentous, why would that be a requirement, as you were starting to say.  I mean, I presume filamentous means - to normal people - what it means to myco - what do you call yourselves, mycologist or. . . Dr. HODGE:  We are mycologists. Yes. PALCA:  OK.  So, does a filamentous mean the same thing as it's just something that's sort of stringy? Dr. HODGE:  Yeah, it's sort of stringy, so - but the shell - the cells themselves are actually shaped like little tiny threads, almost too small to actually see, but inside those tiny threads is where the cells of the fungi are. PALCA:  Uh-huh. Dr. HODGE:  And they grow outwards at the tips. PALCA:  And so, give me a little clue about - I mean, we were hearing - yes, as you mentioned, we talked earlier in the day with - about yeast and whether they reproduce sexually or asexually and, you know, without being - getting us into trouble with the FCC, can you tell us how yeast reproduce? (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. HODGE:  Well, yeah, most fungi are capable of either having sex and having sexual offspring, or they can make spores asexually just by budding off little pieces of themselves, and most fungi can do it either way. PALCA:  And - right, and so in a fungal world, what does having sex mean? (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. HODGE:  Let me see.  How can I. . . PALCA:  I think we can probably - I have a feeling it has to do with exchanging DNA rather than other things. Dr. HODGE:  That's right.  You go to a bar, you meet a compatible fungus, if you. . . (Soundbite of laughter) PALCA:  This is no fair.  I'm supposed to make the jokes. Dr.  HODGE:  You get together. (Soundbite of laughter) PALCA:  OK, so seriously. Dr. HODGE:  So seriously, yes, fungi can have sex. PALCA:  Really. Dr. HODGE:  Two compatible fungi get together, they swap nuclei.  Their nuclei recombine, and go through meiosis in much the same way that human nuclei go to meiosis during mating.  And the offspring are haploid products of meiosis.  So each offspring of a sexual reproduction is genetically different from its parents. PALCA:  OK. All right.  So, David Fisher, how important is sexual reproduction or asexual reproduction in the world of edible mushrooms? Mr. FISCHER:  Well, mushrooms in particular, are all reproductive structures, more specifically, sexual reproductive structures.  Everything that we would call a mushroom is a sexual reproductive structure. PALCA:  Huh. And so, tell me - OK.  So what - how do you define what a mushroom is as opposed to some other kind of fungus?  Does it have special properties that we can identify? Mr. FISCHER:  Well, a mushroom essentially is used as a term for, you know, macroscopic sexual reproducing fungi, particularly to the fruiting bodies - which is basically a synonym for mushroom.  If it produces a mushroom, a macroscopic - excuse me - a macroscopic structure specifically for sexual reproduction, then we would call that a mushroom. And we also would term the whole organism a mushroom. PALCA:  Huh. So - sorry - so, the spongy outer part of this fruiting body, this mushroom, the part that we actually wind up eating, is that mostly protein, or is it sugars, or what's that made up of, cells? Mr. FISCHER:  Well, they're - it's all cellular.  PALCA: Right. Mr. FISCHER: It's all hyphel(ph), it's all filamentous, as Kathie noted.  It's - the cells are essentially the same.  All the cells in the mushrooms - in the mushroom or the fruiting body are the same.  The magic happens on little cells called basidia, or in little tubular cells called asai(ph). PALCA:  Uh-huh.  And magic. . . Mr. FISCHER:  And that's where the sexual process of meiosis, and mitosis, and karyogamy, and all that exciting stuff happens. PALCA:  I got it.  And so, you are focused on these edible mushrooms.  How - I mean, how - what's the difference - I mean, I can - non-edible mushroom, one is I presume that don't taste good and B that can make you sick, but what are the qualities that an edible mushroom brings that makes people eat them?  Are they nutritious?  Are they helpful in some way?   Why would people eat mushrooms?  Or why did they start eating fungus? Mr. FISCHER:  Well, a big part of the answer to that, Joe, is that mushrooms, as a rule, have a wide assortment of proteins and amino acids.  In fact, because of that fact, that they're so loaded with amino acids and a variety of amino acids, that gives them a savory flavor and it makes them, for example, and ideal food for vegetarians, who don't get any animal protein in their diet. Fungi are very helpful from a nutritional aspect, for vegetarians in particular. PALCA:  Mm. OK.  Well, let's take some calls now.  And as I said, our number is 800-989-8255, that's 800-989-TALK.  And let's go first to Paul in Kansas City, Missouri.  Paul, welcome to Science Friday.   PAUL (Caller):  Hello, Joe Palca.   PALCA:  Hello. PAUL:  I have an amazing story to tell you, and maybe I can get explanation from the conversation today. PALCA:  That's what we're here for.  PAUL:  Wonderful.  We live in a region just south of us, the South Ozarks region where we do a lot of rafting and canoeing, and after getting off of the river, looking for firewood just after dark, you know, just the moonlight, my buddy stepped on a log.  And the log crumpled into - a particular stick glowed in a green phosphorescence.  And you know, if you look at a fire and it glows in a kind of a red tone, it was like identical to that, but it was green.  It was scary, I thought it was really, to be honest with you, the kids were like, what is this?  And I took the log and heaved it over the mountain side and it crumpled down the cliff side and into the trees and it was just a shower of glowing green, I called it phosphorescence, like a lightning bug, I call it. PALCA:  Well, Paul, let's see if you've given enough indication to get Kathie Hodge or David Fischer to identify that for you. PAUL:  Yes, sir. PALCA: Kathie? Dr. HODGE:  That sounds really cool, Paul.  That's something we call Fox fire.  And Fox fire. . .  PAUL:  Fox fire. Dr. HODGE: Yeah.  That can be produced by fungi.  So probably what you had there was a log colonized by a mushroom, maybe Armillaria, a honey mushroom.  And the mycelium of that mushroom grows throughout the log and for reasons we don't understand, makes this beautiful glow, bioluminescence. PAUL:  Yes.  That's what I wish we'd understood that, because I've done my research and I've never found the answer.  It was amazing, guys.  You just can't believe it, unless you were there.  It's unbelievable. PALCA:  Wow, Paul, thanks for that story.  It sounds remarkable.  Let's take another call now from Sylvia in Long Island, New York.  Sylvia, welcome to Science Friday. SYLVIA (Caller):  Hello.  When I was in college, I don't know if this was something that they said because they were having fun with mushrooms.  But they said that mushrooms came from outer space.  And I was just wondering if that's the case. PALCA:  Well, what about that David Fischer, do you buy that theory?  I guess it goes back to Panspermia(ph) we were also talking about earlier today. Mr. FISCHER:  Right.  I haven't seen personally good evidence that makes a believer out of me of the idea that a fungal spore could survived a trip through space.  I wouldn't categorically rule it out, but it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.  Spores - some spores have pretty good longevity, viability - to be able to germinate, but it just doesn't seem - it doesn't seem very practical to me.  But again, I can't rule it out, I just don't know. PALCA  It's an interesting one.  One final call before we have to take a break and let's go to Kevin in Knoxville, Tennessee. KEVIN (Caller):  Hi there.  How are you folks today? PALCA  Good. KEVIN:  So I wanted to mention that there is a fellow named Tom Michaels in Kingston, Tennessee who is successfully cultivating the Black Perigord Truffle. PALCA:  Really. KEVIN:  And he's only being going at it for about three years now.  So the supplies are still extremely limited but he is selling them to three star restaurants in New York, and Atlanta, and Chicago. PALCA:  Interesting, Kevin, let me see David, do you anything about that? Mr. FISCHER:  Yes I do.  Growing the Perigord Truffle on the roots of Filbert trees, it's a symbiotic relationship as many mushrooms have with various plant species, trees in particular.  A gentleman in North Carolina named Franklin Garland pioneered this technique.  To the best of my understanding from what I've seen, the money so far is not in the crop, but in selling the inoculated trees, now whether we may get to a point. . . PALCA:  OK, David.  David, I am sorry.  We have to take a short break.  I am sorry to interrupt you there, but we'll have more about truffles and other members of the fungal kingdom when we come back after this short break.  Stay with us. PALCA:  This Talk of The Nation from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) PALCA:  From NPR News this is Talk Of The Nation Science Friday, I am Joe Palca.  We are talking this hour about \"fungi\" or \"fungi\" with my guest Kathie Hodge, associate professor of mycology at Cornell University and David Fischer, he is a mycologist and author of \"Edible Wild Mushrooms of North America. \"  And those are the big guys but last year, - big guys in terms of size of the mushrooms, of the fungal world - but last year, the American Academy of Microbiology decided that the fungi were not getting enough attention, not because people don't like mushrooms, but because research on fungi and fungal diseases they argued has been seriously neglected.  And as a result, we humans and even plants and animals were becoming increasingly susceptible to the devastating effects of some fungi.  So they did what scientists do, they organized a colloquium and the nation's leading experts on fungi gathered in Tucson to plan their strategy, a way to get people to pay more attention to fungi.   Well joining me now to talk more about that is my guest, Arturo Casadevall is the chairman of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.  He is also former head of Infectious Diseases there.  Thanks for talking with us today, Dr. Casadevall. Dr. ARTURO CASADEVALL (Chairman, Department of Microbiology and Immunology):  Hi, Joe. PALCA:  Hi.  And by the way, I am sorry, if you want to talk to us, give us a call.  Our number is 800-989-8255.  So I guess the first question, was - was the colloquium a success and are people paying more attention? Dr. CASADEVALL:  I think it was a success. Just the fact that you are calling me is an indication that I think that we have connected in making the point.  In making the public and other scientists more aware of the importance of the medical fungi. PALCA:  So can you give me some idea of the fungal diseases that affect humans?  I don't think people - I mean, they maybe have heard of athlete's foot or something like that but maybe there's more serious things out there that they don't know about. Dr. CASADEVALL:  I think most people are familiar with athlete's foot and with the nail fungi.  But I think what people are not that aware of is that, especially in hospitalized patients, that we are having an epidemic of fungal diseases, including for example, infections with Candida albicans and other species of Candida which can go to practically any organ. PALCA:  And what are the symptoms of Candida? Dr. CASADEVALL:  Well, the symptoms of Candida are similar to the symptoms of other types of infections.  You get fever.  You get redness.  You get - but these tend to often - when they affect the internal organs, they can - they are life threatening, you know?  Athlete's foot doesn't kill you, but certainly fungal diseases that are systemic are often lethal. PALCA:  And are there anti-fungal drugs in the same sense that there are anti-bacterial drugs that - are very effective? Dr. CASADEVALL:  Yes, there are, but there is a big difference.  We don't have that many.  The treatment for these diseases often requires prolonged therapy.  And by prolonged I mean, many months.  And they often don't work as well.  So from the point of view of therapy, we do have therapy but the therapy is not as good as we would like it to be. PALCA:  So is - I mean, is fungal research being vigorously supported by the federal government, or not enough, or is there a need for more, and are the pharmaceutical companies interested because of, yes, because of the prevalence of these diseases? Dr. CASADEVALL:  I mean, I think the answer is that we all feel that there should be more.  In reality, the government has supported fungal research.  The problem has been that in contrast to viruses and bacteria and parasites - this field is small and there are relatively few investigators trying to deal with what is in an entire kingdom.  And so the problem is, it's not that it has not been funded but that the amount of research that is going on is relatively small, relative to the problem. PALCA:  Now, we've been talking about the potential threat that fungal - certain fungi present to human health but I gather that the fungi had been implicated in several recent die-offs in other species - frogs, bee populations that were devastated, even the bat die-offs that have been occurring in New York state.  Is that your understanding as well? Dr. CASADEVALL:  That's right.  I mean, what has happened to the amphibians is a catastrophe.  In the last 20 years or so, new fungus appeared to have come out of nowhere and has led to the extinction.  And I underline the word \"extinction\" of entire species of frogs.  Before this happened, we did not think that a single infectious disease could wipe out a species.  And so this fungus is making its way around the world and it continues to be a problem that may be made worse by global warming.  And now, as you mentioned, and I believe there was program by NPR, the bats in the northeast appear to be infected with this white-nose fungus, we don't really know what's going on there.  But we're having major fungal bat die-offs. PALCA:  Remarkable.  And just finally, your report also talked about a rather scary scenario of possibly having a fungi of some sort use as bio-terrorism weapon?  I mean, presumably I guess you're thinking, it could be use against us.  Is that a real threat? Dr. CASADEVALL:  Well, fungi have always been known to be major pathogens of plants.  And there is already a lot of concern that they could be used to destroy agriculture.  But interestingly, they have done almost no attention as to biological weapons against humans, and against animals.  And I don't -certainly don't want to give anyone any ideas, but I just want to point out that this is an enormous kingdom with a million and a half species that is - many of these are easily available.  The spores are very stable.  And some of us are very concerned that many of these species have the potential to be major biological weapons. PALCA:  Well, if that doesn't get people's attention, I expect well, a few things would.  That's a rather interesting and perhaps alarming scenario but in any case, Dr. Arturo Casadevall, thank you very much for coming on and talking about this with us today. Dr. CASADEVALL:  You're very welcome. PALCA:  Dr. Casadevall is the chairman of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.  He is also a former head of Infectious Diseases there.  And now we are going to turn back to more of the macro world, although, we can still talk about that micro-fungi or micro-fungal organisms if you like.  We are talking with Kathie Hodge, she is an associate professor of mycology at Cornell University.  And David Fischer, he is a mycologist and the author of \"Edible Wild Mushrooms of North America. \"  Kathie Hodge, I just wander, what did you think of Dr. Casadevall's comments about the potential terrorist threat of fungi? Dr. HODGE:  I think he raises some very important points, and we've also got to think about the bio-security of our crops.  I'd hate to have crop wiped out by bioterrorism by introducing a new plant pathogen. PALCA:  Yeah, interesting.  All right.  Well, let's -we're also taking calls from 800-989-8255, and let's take another now from John in Hyattsville, Maryland.  John, welcome to Science Friday. JOHN (Caller):  Thank you for having me.  Dr. Hodge and David, this John Elfridge Vermont. Dr. HODGE:  Hi, John. Mr. FISCHER:  Hi, John. JOHN:  We had David Fischer as our guest mycologist previously on our fall forays in Pennsylvania. PALCA:  What did you say the name of your group was? JOHN:  MAW, Microbiological Association of Washington. PALCA:  Oh, there you go. JOHN:  And anyway, I am going to be giving a talk to the Western Pennsylvania Mushroom Club a week from tomorrow on \"What is the species, and should I care? \" and in doing a lot of reading in genetics and evolution, I've sort of come to the conclusion that the -even though fungi have been described for the last two or three hundred years, mainly on the basis of structure that the biological definition that leaves the variation that two compatible individuals that produced viable offspring in the wild, it seems to me the most objective one. But in recent years DNA sequencing has been used to a great extent to at least, as a means of confirming or denying or rearranging relationships among different groups of fungi.  Can it be considered as more accurate as a means of defining species without using far more DNA sequences from different areas? PALCA:  Kathie Hodge, what about that?  This is sort of - what's a species in a fungal world?  What does it mean? Dr. HODGE:  Well, it's a really good question and species concepts are a really hot area of study right now and again, I wish I could give you a simple answer but people have written entire books about different species concepts.  So, John mentioned the biological species concept, you know, if two things can mate and produce a viable offspring, that must - they must belong to the same species.   But more recently, we've been looking at fungal DNA, and deciding what's a fungal species by looking at kind of a historical approach, looking at the lineage of a fungus.  So, defining species by their history, rather than by what they can happen to do right now.  And an example that might be more familiar to you guys, is orchids.   You can take orchids that belong to two different genre, and hybridize them and produced viable offspring, but nobody would argue that those two parents are really the same species, because their dramatically different.  So, there's some conflict between those two species concepts that we're still straightening out. PALCA:  Mm. Mm. OK. Well, that's - thank you for that call, John.  Let's go now to Sky(ph) in San Antonio, Texas.  Sky, welcome to Science Friday. SKY (Caller):  Hi, there.  Thanks for taking my call. PALCA:  Sure.   SKY:  I have - oh, I have so many things on my mind, but let me just rattle off a couple of things here, and I'll take my answers off the air.   PALCA:  OK. SKY:  The first thing is that I'm getting ready to go vegetarian.  And I want to know if processed mushrooms - does the processing destroy the nutritive value of them, am I better off eating fresh.  The second thing I wanted to know is, are they a separate kingdom or phylum?  I mean, are they're not animals obviously, but they don't seem to be plants.  I've heard that there are some slime molds that are ambulatory.  And so, I was wondering if one of your guests could possibly say something about that as well.   PALCA:  OK.  Sky, thank you for that.  I'm a little terrified by ambulatory slime molds. . . (Soundbite of laughter) PALCA:  But let's start with the first question.  And maybe, David Fischer, processed mushrooms, I presume that means cultivated versus wild ones that you would pick in the wild.  Is there a nutritional difference? Mr. FISCHER:  Well, I think actually - I interpreted this question as implying, you know, cooking, canning, freezing those sorts of things.   PALCA:  Ah, OK, OK, well, let's answer that way. Mr. FISCHER:  Well, the shortest answer is that generally speaking we do not recommend that mushrooms be eaten raw, they have to be cooked, generally speaking.  Personally, I won't even eat, you know, the white grocery store buttoned mushrooms cooked raw, because there is a substance in there and more research needs to be done. PALCA:  Really? Mr. FISCHER:  Regarding this substance, a garetine(ph) which has been shown to have at least some carcinogenic potentials.  So, I'm a little bit nervous about that. PALCA:  But - and cooking breaks down the garetine? Mr. FISCHER:  Right.  And it also breaks down some amino acids, some proteins into simpler forms. There are a lot of wild mushrooms, for example, black morels, which - well, morels in general - which cause people severe gastrointestinal upset, I won't go into details.   PALCA:  Thank you. Mr. FISCHER:  If they're eaten raw, but if they're eaten, you know, after thorough cooking, then they're fine, and they're scrumptious and they're wonderful. PALCA:  Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well, we're talking about mushrooms.  As members of the fungal community, and as they stand alone or as they're cooked in butter, I'm Joe Palca and this is Talk of the Nation from NPR News.  So, I mean, maybe we should get to this, because it's obviously going to come up as a point.  People are wise to be cautious about picking up mushrooms that they see in the woods, and even cooking them and eating them.  You've got to know what you're doing in this world, I presume. Mr. FISCHER:  Oh, absolutely.  It's - you know, it's - I like to compare it to parachuting.  You know, packing your own chute, or using dynamite to blow up that old stump in your backyard, one mistake may be your last.  We can't stress the importance of proper identification of a mushroom carefully enough.   People poison themselves all the time with mushrooms, by doing things like matching the picture to their specimen, you know, and they want the mushroom that they found to be a morel, or to be a chanterelle.  And if they will it to be, then it ends up in there saut\u00e9 pan, and it very well may be another bioluminescent mushroom for example, the Jack-O-Lantern which a lot of people poison themselves with, thinking that they found chanterelles. PALCA:  Yeah.  So, care is needed.  But it is possible - I mean, you can teach yourself to properly sky dive.  So, I presume that, you know, people who buy your book about the wild mushrooms at least in cooking them, you're not advocating that they go find them and cook them, you're advocating that they cook them after somebody else's found them for them? Mr. FISCHER:  No, I actually - I'm - presuming that there is a reasonable lever - level of literacy on the part of the person with the book in their hand.  Whether they're using \"Edible Wild Mushrooms of North America\" or the \"Audubon Society Field Guide,\" or \"Mushrooms Demystified,\" or of any of the other great mushroom books that are available.   The importance is to make sure that you are thorough in the identification process, and that you'll rule out other possibilities.  For example, one thing we typically do with a mushroom is sever the cap from the stalk, put the cap on a piece of white paper, actually I like clear plastic, and see what color the spores are. And when people skip that process with a guild mushroom in particular, they're courting danger.  PALCA:  OK.  Let's take another call now from Kim in New Braunfels, Texas.  Kim, welcome to the program. KIM (Caller):  Yes, just kind of a comment, and then maybe your guest could comment on it.  It seems, so far fungi have been getting a little bit of a bad rap.  And I just wanted maybe him to point out the benefits of some like the mycorrhizal fungi that is very, very beneficial in agriculture.  And one people are making compost piles and what have you.  If you could comment on that, now I will listen off the air. PALCA:  OK.  Thanks.   KIM: Thanks. . . PALCA:  Actually, if it's all right with you, I'm going to direct that question to Kathie Hodge, fungi or fungi that are good and useful.  Because I didn't mean - I certainly didn't set this show up to make an attack on fungi, please don't think that. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. HODGE: Well, we've already talked about yeast.  So we know some of the goodness of fungi already.  But Kim's right, there are very, many fungi that do a lot of good for us, and she mentioned mycorrhizal fungi.  Which are the fungi that are associated with the roots of plants and trees, and helps the plants and trees gather nutrients and really support their growth. They're really essential for forests. PALCA: Mm-hm. Dr. HODGE: And you'd be hard press to find a plant that doesn't have a fungal partner working with it.  Some other good fungi that I can think of are ones that we use industrially to make things we like to eat. So, if you're a drinking a Sprite right now, you're probably drinking a fungal product, citric acid is mostly produced from fungi.   PALCA:  OK.  Dr. HODGE:  So, lots of good things to say. PALCA:  Good, well we'll come back and have lots more good things to say, but we have to take a short break.  Please stay with us.  (Soundbite of music) PALCA:  From NPR News, this is Talk of the Nation: Science Friday.  I'm Joe Palca.  We're talking this hour about fungi.  My guests are Kathie Hodge, associate professor of mycology at Cornell University, David Fischer, he's a mycologist and author of \"Edible Wild Mushrooms of North America. \"  We're taking your calls at 800-989-8255.   And we're also taking questions from people listening or joining the show.  I don't know what the right verb is actually, from Second Life, but I wanted to introduce a Second Life question here from Beurlyn Loon(ph), who writes, I heard a giant fungus underground in Oregon was the largest living thing on earth.  Is that true Kathie Hodge? Dr. HODGE:  Could be, could be true, the humongous fungus.  We've got a few contenders for the humongous fungus, but yeah. . . PALCA: Uh-huh. Mr. FISCHER:  Mm-hm. Dr. HODGE:  There's a - there's one out West, and I don't recall its actual size, but. . . PALCA:  But how big are we. . . Dr. HODGE:  (Unintelligible). PALCA:  How big approximately are we talking about?  I mean, it's - you know, feet, yards, miles. Dr. HODGE:  We're talking about acres. . . PALCA:  Acres?  Dr. HODGE:  Like hundreds of acres. PALCA:  Wow. Dr. HODGE:  So, this is a fungal mycelium that grows in the forest floor, and attacks the roots of trees as it grows, it's a honey mushroom, Armillaria.  And this single individual of a mushroom species covers an area hundreds of acres in diameter.  Pretty awesome. PALCA:  All right. Wow.  Let's take another question from Nat Domain(ph) from Space Ecscape(ph) Bridges at the Science Friday Island, who asks, do fungi have roots, or fungi have roots?  And David Fischer, I guess, you sort of went at this question, but what's the answer there? Mr. FISCHER:  Well, Kathie sort of inferred in her answer to the last question.  A mushroom is the fruiting body, when you pick up a mushroom for example, that you see on the forest floor growing from a log, you're essentially doing the equivalent of pulling an apple from a tree.  You're not removing the organism, the mushroom, the fruiting body it's - is not the organism.   PALCA: Mm-hm. Mr. FISCHER:  The thallus, the body of that organism remains in that rotten log or down in the soil, perhaps wrapped around the roots of trees in the case of a mycorrhizal fungus. PALCA: Right. Mr. FISCHER:  So if you want to call it roots, I don't - we don't use that term. PALCA:  They're not roots, I guess it's a different word.  But there's something that's growing underneath the thing that looks like the fruiting body. Mr. FISCHER:  Right.   PALCA: Right. Mr. FISCHER:  We call that the mycelium.   PALCA:  OK. Mr. FISCHER:  And that is the thallus, the body if you will.   PALCA:  Excellent.  OK, well, we're going to move on slightly, although we're staying with fungi. My next guest is not a mycologist, she's an entomologist and she's been studying the Asian longhorn beetle, an invasive insect that's found a new home here in the U. S.  The beetle makes its living eating trees, healthy maple trees in fact.   But just how the beetle digests all that wood isn't clear, or at least it wasn't clear until recently, when researchers discovered that the beetle has a fungal companion.  A microscopic ally that does a lot of the heavy lifting, or I guess, you'd think of it as heavy digesting for the insect.   And joining me now to talk more about that is Kelli Hoover, she's an associate professor of entomology at Penn State University in State College, Pennsylvania.  Dr. Hoover, welcome to the program. Dr. KELLI HOOVER (Associate Professor, Entomology, Penn State University, State College):  Well, thanks very much for having me. PALCA:  So, OK, you're studying this beetle that's eating trees.  What led you to the possibility that a fungus was involved here? Dr. HOOVER:  Well, we just started to look.  There hadn't been anybody looking, except for bacteria.  And we decided to start sequencing what was inside the gut, and discovered that there was fungus that we found in every specimen we looked at, including beetles we collected out of trees in New York City and lo and behold it's the same fungus.   And it's a common fungus that you find all over the place, (unintelligible). It's a species complex, so there are many, many species within that complex.  And this one happens to be unique, it sort of lines up with a few related fusarium, but it seems to be novel.   PALCA:  And this particular fusarium is capable of digesting wood? Dr. HOOVER:  We believe that it does.  We've been looking for - well, what our paper showed was that when wood goes into beetle and comes out the other end, the lignin in the wood has actually been degraded.   That had never been shown before for any insect, even termite.  We also did look at a termite and found that they can do it too.  But the method to be able to prove that this is actually happening, had not been done before on insects. So, what we found with this fungus is that it's producing enzymes that we believe are capable of helping to digest the wood. PALCA:  Really?  And how does this differ - I mean, we've heard about - we've been talking in this hour about fungus forming symbiotic relationships with other organisms, what's the good relationship between the fungus - well, I mean, for the fungus not for the tree of course, but the relationship between the fungus and the beetle? Dr. HOOVER:  Well, I suspect for the fungus, what it gets out of it is that it gets moved around from tree to tree.  I suspect what the - obviously what the beetle's getting out of it is assistance in breaking down wood.  So, it's a wonderful symbiotic relationship.  This insect has been encountering related fungi for probably thousands of years, maybe millions of years and it makes sense that why not have it live inside your gut and take it with you. PALCA:  Sure, why not?  Well. . . Dr. HOOVER:  And there are other termites for example, that cultivate fungal combs outside their body or grow fungus gardens. PALCA:  Mm. Dr. HOOVER:  And, you know, that's how they are able to breakdown woody material.  This guy decided to have the fungus live inside of him. PALCA:  Mm.  Now we've been talking about the sort of the negative consequences of this beetle having shown up, and the threat it poses for trees, but I gather there's another way to turn this around and think, well, gosh this may turn out to be a useful fungus to have stumbled across.  Can you explain about that? Dr. HOOVER:  Sure.  One of the things that we're very interested in is you know, sort of bio-prospecting for new enzymes that can be used in bio-fuels production.  So, this fungus may very well turn out be a good source for those kinds of enzymes because, you know, with wood, you know, to make cellulostic ethanol, the ligament in the wood is like this binding adhesive matrix that holds all the cellulose together and makes that inaccessible to getting to the cellulose which is the part that you want to make ethanol.  So, if you can get rid of the ligament in a nice safe way, the problem with getting rid of ligament is the way it's done now is you have to use high temperatures and nasty chemicals.  But in biological systems, this beetle has evolved a way to do it fairly rapidly and in a nice micro-environment, if you will.  Maybe we can figure out a way to get - to grow those enzymes outside of the insect. PALCA:  There you go. Dr. HOOVER:  And we may have some applications for bio-fuel. PALCA:  The silver lining to an apparently dark cloud. Dr. HOOVER:  Yeah. PALCA:  Anyway, well, Kelly Hoover, it's a very interesting story.  Thanks for coming on and sharing it with us. Dr. HOOVER:  You're welcome. PALCA:  Kelly Hoover is an associate professor of entomology at Penn State University in State College Pennsylvania.  We've been talking this hour, we are talking this hour about more largely - larger members of the fungal family.  My guests are Kathie Hodge, she's an associate professor of mycology at Cornell University, and David Fischer is the author or \"Edible Wild Mushroom of North America. \"  And let's take another call now and go to Steve in Wilmington, North Carolina.  Steve, welcome to the program. STEVE (Caller):  Well, thank you very much and I want you first to know how thoroughly I enjoy Science Friday. PALCA:  Oh good. STEVE:  I look forward to it every week. PALCA:  Well. . . STEVE:  Part of my (unintelligible) the earlier gentleman that was regarding it - it had edibility and nutrition content of mushrooms, now, I'm trying to understand on the edibility of some of the mushrooms.  I hear there's - is it true or just a fable about a death ring on the stem or the stalk if you're trying to pick some in the wilds - to taste, to try, or whatever is it - is it notorious that all poisonous mushrooms have this death ring or they do not have it?  Is it still safe?  Is there any sense in all this? PALCA:  Rule of thumb.  OK.  Let's ask David Fischer for his views on that. Mr. FISCHER:  Yeah.  Well there are no safe simple rules of thumb.  There are a bunch of folk myths, one is that you - if you cook a mushroom with the silver coin or a silver spoon, if it's a poisonous mushroom, that silver will become tarnished.  That's just an example, or that all mushrooms that grow on wood are safe.  None of those principles work.  The bottom line is just as with the berry, you have to identify the thing first and then you can find out what human experience with it is.  And of course, in a lot of cases, with a lot of mushrooms that aren't so common, aren't so conspicuous or perhaps don't look so appealing from a coroner perspective, we don't know what their edibility versus toxicity is at this point.  We're always looking for testers. PALCA:  Mm.  I see.  Sounds like. . . (Soundbite of laughter) PALCA:  Sounds a little gruesome actually.  I hope. . . Mr. FISCHER:  Well, they volunteer. . . PALCA:  I hope there's an - in form of consent.  Yes, exactly.  I should point out that on the sciencefriday. com Web site, there's a really excellent video that'll show you if you don't happen to have your own field guide, you can go see a videotape that's there by Flora Lichtman about a trip to the New York Botanical Gardens where you can see some pretty interesting examples of mushrooms that are growing in the wild.  But again, caution is the key word here I think in terms of any kind of dining experience based on things you find as you're wondering through the fields. Mr. FISCHER:  Absolutely. PALCA:  Let's take another call now and go to Ann.  I'm sorry.  Ann(ph) in Austin, Texas. ANN (Caller):  Hi.  How are you all today? PALCA:  I'm good. ANN:  Good.  I'm calling - I'm really glad you all had this discussion today and I'm really interested in mushrooms and pets and being out front.  I had a pet not too long ago that had a brush with death.  A very close death.  The vet cannot - could not even find the - of course, a (unintelligible) was high - I think or low, I'm not sure exactly what it was. PALCA:  Something bad. ANN:  Yeah, it was something bad, yeah.   PALCA:  Right. ANN:  And the dog was not going to make it and with the only thing that we could figure out was in the back - about this time every year, this type of mushroom would grow in the back of the yard.  And we had had a dog before died of something - like the same thing.  And so, and fortunately, the dog came back.  I think it just, it just actually seemed as though - it's kind of funny - but had like a really bad trip on a mushroom PALCA:  Uh oh.  I knew we'd get there some place.  OK. ANN:  I mean, really bad.  But it came back and we kind of took the - and I was real surprised that the vet really didn't know what to - you know, I was just thinking that this could be a problem for other pets in the neighborhood or just around, you know.  Animals out eating just these different mushrooms. . . PALCA:  Yeah. ANN:  And then not understanding what are or how to treat that and maybe got a bad vet. PALCA:  Yeah.  Interesting problem there and thank you for identifying that.  Kathie Hodge, is that, is there anything you can do for first, first response if that sort of thing happens? Dr. HODGE:  Yeah.  That's a tough one and since we have a big vet school here at Cornell, I've actually seen three mushroom poisonings this summer with dogs.  Two of them fatal.  And, so yeah, dogs also can be poisoned by mushrooms and the tricky part with dogs, well I guess there's two tricky parts.  One is that they can't tell you what they ate.  So, you have to kind of infer what they have or you end up looking at vomit specimens which I personally prefer not to do.  But, the other problem with dogs is that we don't have much information about the effects of poison mushrooms on dogs.   PALCA:  Right. Dr. HODGE:  So, they can be poisoned by amanita species just like people but the onset is faster, the syndrome is a little different, and they also eat a lot of weird little mushrooms that people generally ignore like little Anocipe(ph) species that can be fatal to dogs as well. PALCA:  OK. Dr. HODGE:  So, it's a tough call. PALCA:  Tough call.  We're talking about mushrooms and other fungi, fungi.  I'm Joe Palca and this is Talk of the Nation from NPR News.  Kathie Hodge, it's my understanding that this has been an incredibly good year, a fruitful year, a large year for mushroom hunters, is that true? Dr. HODGE:  Yes.  Very bountiful this year.  We had a lovely wet summer here in the northeast. PALCA:  What are the conditions that are favorable for mushroom growth? Dr. HODGE:  Well, wet is good for mushrooms.  Mushrooms just depend on high humidity in the air just to disperse their spores.  So, you generally find them fruiting in wet - at wet times.  High humidity, a lot of rain, after storms and this is one of those summers, boy. PALCA:  Yeah.  And what's the best time for people to look for mushrooms? Dr. HODGE:  Well, it varies.  Depends on what you're looking for.  If you're looking for morels, you better be looking in the spring because they don't grow any other time of year.  And chanterelles maybe mid-summer and each different mushroom species has its own fruiting pattern.  So just about any time of year, there's something fruiting. PALCA:  All right.  And David Fischer, I wanted to come to you because you were saying that the cultivated, the button mushrooms, you know, those are ubiquitous, why are there so - I mean, with so many hundreds of mushroom species and certainly many of them edible, why are there so few that are actually showing up in stores?  I mean, your book describes many things that I've never seen before. Mr. FISCHER:  There are an increasing number of mushrooms showing up in some grocery stores and specialty grocers and specialty produce markets.  Chanterelles for example, here in Syracuse, you wouldn't have been able to find, you know, fresh chanterelles at the grocery store 20 years ago to save your life.  Dried ones perhaps.  But now, during the season when chanterelles are fruiting prodigiously in the Pacific Northwest, we get lots of chanterelles from there fresh in our stores. PALCA:  Mm.  And is it possible - I've heard - and we were talking about this earlier at lunch today.  Is it possible to grow your own mushrooms safely?  I've heard that there might be kits that you can buy? Mr. FISCHER:  Oh, absolutely.  In fact, a colleague of Kathie's and mine, Paul Stamets with a company called Fungi Perfecti, I don't know how many he's got at this point but you can probably buy kits from his company for at least a dozen and maybe two dozen different edible species. PALCA:  So really, well you know, we've been talking - we've talked earlier today about brewing beer, now growing fungi.  You know, we're actually providing this farm service for people.  This is really excellent.  And right guys, thank you, thank you both very much for joining me this hour.  It's been a fascinating glimpse of the fungal world. Mr. FISCHER:  Thank you, Joe. Dr. HODGE:  Thanks, Joe. PALCA:  OK.  Kathie Hodge is associate professor of mycology at Cornell University and David Fischer is a mycologist and author of \"Edible Wild Mushrooms of North America. \"  Greg Smith composed our theme music.  We had help today from NPR librarian Kee Malesky who insists that it's fungi but she'll accept fungi.

For NPR News in New York, I'm Joe Palca.  JOE PALCA, host:   This is Talk of the Nation: Science Friday from NPR News.  I'm Joe Palca sitting in for Ira Flatow.  When you ask people to name the kingdoms, most people get the big ones, animals, plants, bacteria.  Some people may even come up with the protists.  But there is one more.  Here's a hint.  Yeast are part of it, so are shiitakes.  Are you getting it?  Well, the answer is, fungi, or perhaps, I should say fungi.  We'll come up with that answer some time during hour two.  Either way you say it, members of this kingdom are everywhere.  From the protist aisle of the supermarket, to your backyard, to in between your toes.    Experts say there are more than a million species of fungi on the planet, and we've only discovered five percent or so.  So this hour, we salute you, fungi, from the macro, the ones you hot - find on your steak or in your sandwich, to the micro, the ones the cause illness and disease.  It's all things fungal this hour.  I can hear a new show on NPR.  Anyway, now, let me introduce my first two guests.  Kathie Hodge is associate professor of mycology at Cornell University.  She joins us from a studio on a campus in Ithaca, New York.  Welcome to Science Friday, Dr. Hodge.  Dr. KATHIE HODGE (Associate Professor of Mycology, Cornell University):  It's a pleasure to be here, Joe.  PALCA:  And my other guest to start off with is David Fischer.  He's a mycologist, and we'll get him to explain exactly what that means at some point, and the author of \"Edible Wild Mushrooms of North America. \" He joins us from the studios of WAER in Syracuse, New York.  Welcome to Science Friday, Mr. Fisher.  Mr. DAVID FISCHER (Mycologist; Author, \"Edible Wild Mushrooms of North America\"):  Thank you, Joe.  Good afternoon.  PALCA:  So this is all things fungal and if you wan to join the call, our number is 800-989-8255, that's 800-989-TALK.  If you want more information about what we'll be talking about this hour, go to our website at www. sciencefriday. com, where you'll find links to our topic.  And we'd also be interested in hearing from you, if you're listening or joining people on the Science Island in Second Life, and we'll (unintelligible) try and take some of your calls from there as well.  But let's start with you Dr. Hodge, and give us some definitions.  What's a fungus?  Dr. HODGE:  Oh, I knew you were going to ask me that.  That's a tough one.   (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. DAVIS:  Don't worry.  I thought I was pitching the easy one first.  Dr. HODGE:  Well, I used to teach that a fungus was heterotrophic. Right?  PALCA:  Uh-oh.  Dr. HODGE:  Can't make its own food.  PALCA:  Yeah.  Dr. HODGE:  So, no photosynthesis going on here.  PALCA:  Right.  Dr HODGE:  They are filamentous usually, so they're kind of fussy little things.  They make spores, and like us, they're eukaryotic, so they have a nucleus and mitochondria inside their cells.  PALCA:  OK.  So, what - you used to say that.  Dr. HODGE:  Yeah, because there's all these exceptions.  You know, we just talked about yeast on this show, and they're unicellular. . .  PALCA: Yeah.  Dr. HODGE:  For the most part.  Fungi can do lots of different things.  And they include everything from mushrooms, to yeasts, to the mold growing on your shower curtain.  PALCA:  Uh-huh.  And filamentous, why would that be a requirement, as you were starting to say.  I mean, I presume filamentous means - to normal people - what it means to myco - what do you call yourselves, mycologist or. . .  Dr. HODGE:  We are mycologists. Yes.  PALCA:  OK.  So, does a filamentous mean the same thing as it's just something that's sort of stringy?  Dr. HODGE:  Yeah, it's sort of stringy, so - but the shell - the cells themselves are actually shaped like little tiny threads, almost too small to actually see, but inside those tiny threads is where the cells of the fungi are.  PALCA:  Uh-huh.  Dr. HODGE:  And they grow outwards at the tips.  PALCA:  And so, give me a little clue about - I mean, we were hearing - yes, as you mentioned, we talked earlier in the day with - about yeast and whether they reproduce sexually or asexually and, you know, without being - getting us into trouble with the FCC, can you tell us how yeast reproduce?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. HODGE:  Well, yeah, most fungi are capable of either having sex and having sexual offspring, or they can make spores asexually just by budding off little pieces of themselves, and most fungi can do it either way.  PALCA:  And - right, and so in a fungal world, what does having sex mean?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. HODGE:  Let me see.  How can I. . .  PALCA:  I think we can probably - I have a feeling it has to do with exchanging DNA rather than other things.  Dr. HODGE:  That's right.  You go to a bar, you meet a compatible fungus, if you. . .  (Soundbite of laughter)  PALCA:  This is no fair.  I'm supposed to make the jokes.  Dr.  HODGE:  You get together.  (Soundbite of laughter)  PALCA:  OK, so seriously.  Dr. HODGE:  So seriously, yes, fungi can have sex.  PALCA:  Really.  Dr. HODGE:  Two compatible fungi get together, they swap nuclei.  Their nuclei recombine, and go through meiosis in much the same way that human nuclei go to meiosis during mating.  And the offspring are haploid products of meiosis.  So each offspring of a sexual reproduction is genetically different from its parents.  PALCA:  OK. All right.  So, David Fisher, how important is sexual reproduction or asexual reproduction in the world of edible mushrooms?  Mr. FISCHER:  Well, mushrooms in particular, are all reproductive structures, more specifically, sexual reproductive structures.  Everything that we would call a mushroom is a sexual reproductive structure.  PALCA:  Huh. And so, tell me - OK.  So what - how do you define what a mushroom is as opposed to some other kind of fungus?  Does it have special properties that we can identify?  Mr. FISCHER:  Well, a mushroom essentially is used as a term for, you know, macroscopic sexual reproducing fungi, particularly to the fruiting bodies - which is basically a synonym for mushroom.  If it produces a mushroom, a macroscopic - excuse me - a macroscopic structure specifically for sexual reproduction, then we would call that a mushroom. And we also would term the whole organism a mushroom.  PALCA:  Huh. So - sorry - so, the spongy outer part of this fruiting body, this mushroom, the part that we actually wind up eating, is that mostly protein, or is it sugars, or what's that made up of, cells?  Mr. FISCHER:  Well, they're - it's all cellular.   PALCA: Right.  Mr. FISCHER: It's all hyphel(ph), it's all filamentous, as Kathie noted.  It's - the cells are essentially the same.  All the cells in the mushrooms - in the mushroom or the fruiting body are the same.  The magic happens on little cells called basidia, or in little tubular cells called asai(ph).  PALCA:  Uh-huh.  And magic. . .  Mr. FISCHER:  And that's where the sexual process of meiosis, and mitosis, and karyogamy, and all that exciting stuff happens.  PALCA:  I got it.  And so, you are focused on these edible mushrooms.  How - I mean, how - what's the difference - I mean, I can - non-edible mushroom, one is I presume that don't taste good and B that can make you sick, but what are the qualities that an edible mushroom brings that makes people eat them?  Are they nutritious?  Are they helpful in some way?    Why would people eat mushrooms?  Or why did they start eating fungus?  Mr. FISCHER:  Well, a big part of the answer to that, Joe, is that mushrooms, as a rule, have a wide assortment of proteins and amino acids.  In fact, because of that fact, that they're so loaded with amino acids and a variety of amino acids, that gives them a savory flavor and it makes them, for example, and ideal food for vegetarians, who don't get any animal protein in their diet. Fungi are very helpful from a nutritional aspect, for vegetarians in particular.  PALCA:  Mm. OK.  Well, let's take some calls now.  And as I said, our number is 800-989-8255, that's 800-989-TALK.  And let's go first to Paul in Kansas City, Missouri.  Paul, welcome to Science Friday.    PAUL (Caller):  Hello, Joe Palca.    PALCA:  Hello.  PAUL:  I have an amazing story to tell you, and maybe I can get explanation from the conversation today.  PALCA:  That's what we're here for.   PAUL:  Wonderful.  We live in a region just south of us, the South Ozarks region where we do a lot of rafting and canoeing, and after getting off of the river, looking for firewood just after dark, you know, just the moonlight, my buddy stepped on a log.  And the log crumpled into - a particular stick glowed in a green phosphorescence.  And you know, if you look at a fire and it glows in a kind of a red tone, it was like identical to that, but it was green.  It was scary, I thought it was really, to be honest with you, the kids were like, what is this?  And I took the log and heaved it over the mountain side and it crumpled down the cliff side and into the trees and it was just a shower of glowing green, I called it phosphorescence, like a lightning bug, I call it.  PALCA:  Well, Paul, let's see if you've given enough indication to get Kathie Hodge or David Fischer to identify that for you.  PAUL:  Yes, sir.  PALCA: Kathie?  Dr. HODGE:  That sounds really cool, Paul.  That's something we call Fox fire.  And Fox fire. . .   PAUL:  Fox fire.  Dr. HODGE: Yeah.  That can be produced by fungi.  So probably what you had there was a log colonized by a mushroom, maybe Armillaria, a honey mushroom.  And the mycelium of that mushroom grows throughout the log and for reasons we don't understand, makes this beautiful glow, bioluminescence.  PAUL:  Yes.  That's what I wish we'd understood that, because I've done my research and I've never found the answer.  It was amazing, guys.  You just can't believe it, unless you were there.  It's unbelievable.  PALCA:  Wow, Paul, thanks for that story.  It sounds remarkable.  Let's take another call now from Sylvia in Long Island, New York.  Sylvia, welcome to Science Friday.  SYLVIA (Caller):  Hello.  When I was in college, I don't know if this was something that they said because they were having fun with mushrooms.  But they said that mushrooms came from outer space.  And I was just wondering if that's the case.  PALCA:  Well, what about that David Fischer, do you buy that theory?  I guess it goes back to Panspermia(ph) we were also talking about earlier today.  Mr. FISCHER:  Right.  I haven't seen personally good evidence that makes a believer out of me of the idea that a fungal spore could survived a trip through space.  I wouldn't categorically rule it out, but it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.  Spores - some spores have pretty good longevity, viability - to be able to germinate, but it just doesn't seem - it doesn't seem very practical to me.  But again, I can't rule it out, I just don't know.  PALCA  It's an interesting one.  One final call before we have to take a break and let's go to Kevin in Knoxville, Tennessee.  KEVIN (Caller):  Hi there.  How are you folks today?  PALCA  Good.  KEVIN:  So I wanted to mention that there is a fellow named Tom Michaels in Kingston, Tennessee who is successfully cultivating the Black Perigord Truffle.  PALCA:  Really.  KEVIN:  And he's only being going at it for about three years now.  So the supplies are still extremely limited but he is selling them to three star restaurants in New York, and Atlanta, and Chicago.  PALCA:  Interesting, Kevin, let me see David, do you anything about that?  Mr. FISCHER:  Yes I do.  Growing the Perigord Truffle on the roots of Filbert trees, it's a symbiotic relationship as many mushrooms have with various plant species, trees in particular.  A gentleman in North Carolina named Franklin Garland pioneered this technique.  To the best of my understanding from what I've seen, the money so far is not in the crop, but in selling the inoculated trees, now whether we may get to a point. . .  PALCA:  OK, David.  David, I am sorry.  We have to take a short break.  I am sorry to interrupt you there, but we'll have more about truffles and other members of the fungal kingdom when we come back after this short break.  Stay with us.  PALCA:  This Talk of The Nation from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  PALCA:  From NPR News this is Talk Of The Nation Science Friday, I am Joe Palca.  We are talking this hour about \"fungi\" or \"fungi\" with my guest Kathie Hodge, associate professor of mycology at Cornell University and David Fischer, he is a mycologist and author of \"Edible Wild Mushrooms of North America. \"  And those are the big guys but last year, - big guys in terms of size of the mushrooms, of the fungal world - but last year, the American Academy of Microbiology decided that the fungi were not getting enough attention, not because people don't like mushrooms, but because research on fungi and fungal diseases they argued has been seriously neglected.  And as a result, we humans and even plants and animals were becoming increasingly susceptible to the devastating effects of some fungi.  So they did what scientists do, they organized a colloquium and the nation's leading experts on fungi gathered in Tucson to plan their strategy, a way to get people to pay more attention to fungi.    Well joining me now to talk more about that is my guest, Arturo Casadevall is the chairman of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.  He is also former head of Infectious Diseases there.  Thanks for talking with us today, Dr. Casadevall.  Dr. ARTURO CASADEVALL (Chairman, Department of Microbiology and Immunology):  Hi, Joe.  PALCA:  Hi.  And by the way, I am sorry, if you want to talk to us, give us a call.  Our number is 800-989-8255.  So I guess the first question, was - was the colloquium a success and are people paying more attention?  Dr. CASADEVALL:  I think it was a success. Just the fact that you are calling me is an indication that I think that we have connected in making the point.  In making the public and other scientists more aware of the importance of the medical fungi.  PALCA:  So can you give me some idea of the fungal diseases that affect humans?  I don't think people - I mean, they maybe have heard of athlete's foot or something like that but maybe there's more serious things out there that they don't know about.  Dr. CASADEVALL:  I think most people are familiar with athlete's foot and with the nail fungi.  But I think what people are not that aware of is that, especially in hospitalized patients, that we are having an epidemic of fungal diseases, including for example, infections with Candida albicans and other species of Candida which can go to practically any organ.  PALCA:  And what are the symptoms of Candida?  Dr. CASADEVALL:  Well, the symptoms of Candida are similar to the symptoms of other types of infections.  You get fever.  You get redness.  You get - but these tend to often - when they affect the internal organs, they can - they are life threatening, you know?  Athlete's foot doesn't kill you, but certainly fungal diseases that are systemic are often lethal.  PALCA:  And are there anti-fungal drugs in the same sense that there are anti-bacterial drugs that - are very effective?  Dr. CASADEVALL:  Yes, there are, but there is a big difference.  We don't have that many.  The treatment for these diseases often requires prolonged therapy.  And by prolonged I mean, many months.  And they often don't work as well.  So from the point of view of therapy, we do have therapy but the therapy is not as good as we would like it to be.  PALCA:  So is - I mean, is fungal research being vigorously supported by the federal government, or not enough, or is there a need for more, and are the pharmaceutical companies interested because of, yes, because of the prevalence of these diseases?  Dr. CASADEVALL:  I mean, I think the answer is that we all feel that there should be more.  In reality, the government has supported fungal research.  The problem has been that in contrast to viruses and bacteria and parasites - this field is small and there are relatively few investigators trying to deal with what is in an entire kingdom.  And so the problem is, it's not that it has not been funded but that the amount of research that is going on is relatively small, relative to the problem.  PALCA:  Now, we've been talking about the potential threat that fungal - certain fungi present to human health but I gather that the fungi had been implicated in several recent die-offs in other species - frogs, bee populations that were devastated, even the bat die-offs that have been occurring in New York state.  Is that your understanding as well?  Dr. CASADEVALL:  That's right.  I mean, what has happened to the amphibians is a catastrophe.  In the last 20 years or so, new fungus appeared to have come out of nowhere and has led to the extinction.  And I underline the word \"extinction\" of entire species of frogs.  Before this happened, we did not think that a single infectious disease could wipe out a species.  And so this fungus is making its way around the world and it continues to be a problem that may be made worse by global warming.  And now, as you mentioned, and I believe there was program by NPR, the bats in the northeast appear to be infected with this white-nose fungus, we don't really know what's going on there.  But we're having major fungal bat die-offs.  PALCA:  Remarkable.  And just finally, your report also talked about a rather scary scenario of possibly having a fungi of some sort use as bio-terrorism weapon?  I mean, presumably I guess you're thinking, it could be use against us.  Is that a real threat?  Dr. CASADEVALL:  Well, fungi have always been known to be major pathogens of plants.  And there is already a lot of concern that they could be used to destroy agriculture.  But interestingly, they have done almost no attention as to biological weapons against humans, and against animals.  And I don't -certainly don't want to give anyone any ideas, but I just want to point out that this is an enormous kingdom with a million and a half species that is - many of these are easily available.  The spores are very stable.  And some of us are very concerned that many of these species have the potential to be major biological weapons.  PALCA:  Well, if that doesn't get people's attention, I expect well, a few things would.  That's a rather interesting and perhaps alarming scenario but in any case, Dr. Arturo Casadevall, thank you very much for coming on and talking about this with us today.  Dr. CASADEVALL:  You're very welcome.  PALCA:  Dr. Casadevall is the chairman of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.  He is also a former head of Infectious Diseases there.  And now we are going to turn back to more of the macro world, although, we can still talk about that micro-fungi or micro-fungal organisms if you like.  We are talking with Kathie Hodge, she is an associate professor of mycology at Cornell University.  And David Fischer, he is a mycologist and the author of \"Edible Wild Mushrooms of North America. \"  Kathie Hodge, I just wander, what did you think of Dr. Casadevall's comments about the potential terrorist threat of fungi?  Dr. HODGE:  I think he raises some very important points, and we've also got to think about the bio-security of our crops.  I'd hate to have crop wiped out by bioterrorism by introducing a new plant pathogen.  PALCA:  Yeah, interesting.  All right.  Well, let's -we're also taking calls from 800-989-8255, and let's take another now from John in Hyattsville, Maryland.  John, welcome to Science Friday.  JOHN (Caller):  Thank you for having me.  Dr. Hodge and David, this John Elfridge Vermont.  Dr. HODGE:  Hi, John.  Mr. FISCHER:  Hi, John.  JOHN:  We had David Fischer as our guest mycologist previously on our fall forays in Pennsylvania.  PALCA:  What did you say the name of your group was?  JOHN:  MAW, Microbiological Association of Washington.  PALCA:  Oh, there you go.  JOHN:  And anyway, I am going to be giving a talk to the Western Pennsylvania Mushroom Club a week from tomorrow on \"What is the species, and should I care? \" and in doing a lot of reading in genetics and evolution, I've sort of come to the conclusion that the -even though fungi have been described for the last two or three hundred years, mainly on the basis of structure that the biological definition that leaves the variation that two compatible individuals that produced viable offspring in the wild, it seems to me the most objective one. But in recent years DNA sequencing has been used to a great extent to at least, as a means of confirming or denying or rearranging relationships among different groups of fungi.  Can it be considered as more accurate as a means of defining species without using far more DNA sequences from different areas?  PALCA:  Kathie Hodge, what about that?  This is sort of - what's a species in a fungal world?  What does it mean?  Dr. HODGE:  Well, it's a really good question and species concepts are a really hot area of study right now and again, I wish I could give you a simple answer but people have written entire books about different species concepts.  So, John mentioned the biological species concept, you know, if two things can mate and produce a viable offspring, that must - they must belong to the same species.    But more recently, we've been looking at fungal DNA, and deciding what's a fungal species by looking at kind of a historical approach, looking at the lineage of a fungus.  So, defining species by their history, rather than by what they can happen to do right now.  And an example that might be more familiar to you guys, is orchids.    You can take orchids that belong to two different genre, and hybridize them and produced viable offspring, but nobody would argue that those two parents are really the same species, because their dramatically different.  So, there's some conflict between those two species concepts that we're still straightening out.  PALCA:  Mm. Mm. OK. Well, that's - thank you for that call, John.  Let's go now to Sky(ph) in San Antonio, Texas.  Sky, welcome to Science Friday.  SKY (Caller):  Hi, there.  Thanks for taking my call.  PALCA:  Sure.    SKY:  I have - oh, I have so many things on my mind, but let me just rattle off a couple of things here, and I'll take my answers off the air.    PALCA:  OK.  SKY:  The first thing is that I'm getting ready to go vegetarian.  And I want to know if processed mushrooms - does the processing destroy the nutritive value of them, am I better off eating fresh.  The second thing I wanted to know is, are they a separate kingdom or phylum?  I mean, are they're not animals obviously, but they don't seem to be plants.  I've heard that there are some slime molds that are ambulatory.  And so, I was wondering if one of your guests could possibly say something about that as well.    PALCA:  OK.  Sky, thank you for that.  I'm a little terrified by ambulatory slime molds. . .  (Soundbite of laughter)  PALCA:  But let's start with the first question.  And maybe, David Fischer, processed mushrooms, I presume that means cultivated versus wild ones that you would pick in the wild.  Is there a nutritional difference?  Mr. FISCHER:  Well, I think actually - I interpreted this question as implying, you know, cooking, canning, freezing those sorts of things.    PALCA:  Ah, OK, OK, well, let's answer that way.  Mr. FISCHER:  Well, the shortest answer is that generally speaking we do not recommend that mushrooms be eaten raw, they have to be cooked, generally speaking.  Personally, I won't even eat, you know, the white grocery store buttoned mushrooms cooked raw, because there is a substance in there and more research needs to be done.  PALCA:  Really?  Mr. FISCHER:  Regarding this substance, a garetine(ph) which has been shown to have at least some carcinogenic potentials.  So, I'm a little bit nervous about that.  PALCA:  But - and cooking breaks down the garetine?  Mr. FISCHER:  Right.  And it also breaks down some amino acids, some proteins into simpler forms. There are a lot of wild mushrooms, for example, black morels, which - well, morels in general - which cause people severe gastrointestinal upset, I won't go into details.    PALCA:  Thank you.  Mr. FISCHER:  If they're eaten raw, but if they're eaten, you know, after thorough cooking, then they're fine, and they're scrumptious and they're wonderful.  PALCA:  Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well, we're talking about mushrooms.  As members of the fungal community, and as they stand alone or as they're cooked in butter, I'm Joe Palca and this is Talk of the Nation from NPR News.  So, I mean, maybe we should get to this, because it's obviously going to come up as a point.  People are wise to be cautious about picking up mushrooms that they see in the woods, and even cooking them and eating them.  You've got to know what you're doing in this world, I presume.  Mr. FISCHER:  Oh, absolutely.  It's - you know, it's - I like to compare it to parachuting.  You know, packing your own chute, or using dynamite to blow up that old stump in your backyard, one mistake may be your last.  We can't stress the importance of proper identification of a mushroom carefully enough.    People poison themselves all the time with mushrooms, by doing things like matching the picture to their specimen, you know, and they want the mushroom that they found to be a morel, or to be a chanterelle.  And if they will it to be, then it ends up in there saut\u00e9 pan, and it very well may be another bioluminescent mushroom for example, the Jack-O-Lantern which a lot of people poison themselves with, thinking that they found chanterelles.  PALCA:  Yeah.  So, care is needed.  But it is possible - I mean, you can teach yourself to properly sky dive.  So, I presume that, you know, people who buy your book about the wild mushrooms at least in cooking them, you're not advocating that they go find them and cook them, you're advocating that they cook them after somebody else's found them for them?  Mr. FISCHER:  No, I actually - I'm - presuming that there is a reasonable lever - level of literacy on the part of the person with the book in their hand.  Whether they're using \"Edible Wild Mushrooms of North America\" or the \"Audubon Society Field Guide,\" or \"Mushrooms Demystified,\" or of any of the other great mushroom books that are available.    The importance is to make sure that you are thorough in the identification process, and that you'll rule out other possibilities.  For example, one thing we typically do with a mushroom is sever the cap from the stalk, put the cap on a piece of white paper, actually I like clear plastic, and see what color the spores are. And when people skip that process with a guild mushroom in particular, they're courting danger.   PALCA:  OK.  Let's take another call now from Kim in New Braunfels, Texas.  Kim, welcome to the program.  KIM (Caller):  Yes, just kind of a comment, and then maybe your guest could comment on it.  It seems, so far fungi have been getting a little bit of a bad rap.  And I just wanted maybe him to point out the benefits of some like the mycorrhizal fungi that is very, very beneficial in agriculture.  And one people are making compost piles and what have you.  If you could comment on that, now I will listen off the air.  PALCA:  OK.  Thanks.    KIM: Thanks. . .  PALCA:  Actually, if it's all right with you, I'm going to direct that question to Kathie Hodge, fungi or fungi that are good and useful.  Because I didn't mean - I certainly didn't set this show up to make an attack on fungi, please don't think that.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. HODGE: Well, we've already talked about yeast.  So we know some of the goodness of fungi already.  But Kim's right, there are very, many fungi that do a lot of good for us, and she mentioned mycorrhizal fungi.  Which are the fungi that are associated with the roots of plants and trees, and helps the plants and trees gather nutrients and really support their growth. They're really essential for forests.  PALCA: Mm-hm.  Dr. HODGE: And you'd be hard press to find a plant that doesn't have a fungal partner working with it.  Some other good fungi that I can think of are ones that we use industrially to make things we like to eat. So, if you're a drinking a Sprite right now, you're probably drinking a fungal product, citric acid is mostly produced from fungi.    PALCA:  OK.   Dr. HODGE:  So, lots of good things to say.  PALCA:  Good, well we'll come back and have lots more good things to say, but we have to take a short break.  Please stay with us.   (Soundbite of music)  PALCA:  From NPR News, this is Talk of the Nation: Science Friday.  I'm Joe Palca.  We're talking this hour about fungi.  My guests are Kathie Hodge, associate professor of mycology at Cornell University, David Fischer, he's a mycologist and author of \"Edible Wild Mushrooms of North America. \"  We're taking your calls at 800-989-8255.    And we're also taking questions from people listening or joining the show.  I don't know what the right verb is actually, from Second Life, but I wanted to introduce a Second Life question here from Beurlyn Loon(ph), who writes, I heard a giant fungus underground in Oregon was the largest living thing on earth.  Is that true Kathie Hodge?  Dr. HODGE:  Could be, could be true, the humongous fungus.  We've got a few contenders for the humongous fungus, but yeah. . .  PALCA: Uh-huh.  Mr. FISCHER:  Mm-hm.  Dr. HODGE:  There's a - there's one out West, and I don't recall its actual size, but. . .  PALCA:  But how big are we. . .  Dr. HODGE:  (Unintelligible).  PALCA:  How big approximately are we talking about?  I mean, it's - you know, feet, yards, miles.  Dr. HODGE:  We're talking about acres. . .  PALCA:  Acres?   Dr. HODGE:  Like hundreds of acres.  PALCA:  Wow.  Dr. HODGE:  So, this is a fungal mycelium that grows in the forest floor, and attacks the roots of trees as it grows, it's a honey mushroom, Armillaria.  And this single individual of a mushroom species covers an area hundreds of acres in diameter.  Pretty awesome.  PALCA:  All right. Wow.  Let's take another question from Nat Domain(ph) from Space Ecscape(ph) Bridges at the Science Friday Island, who asks, do fungi have roots, or fungi have roots?  And David Fischer, I guess, you sort of went at this question, but what's the answer there?  Mr. FISCHER:  Well, Kathie sort of inferred in her answer to the last question.  A mushroom is the fruiting body, when you pick up a mushroom for example, that you see on the forest floor growing from a log, you're essentially doing the equivalent of pulling an apple from a tree.  You're not removing the organism, the mushroom, the fruiting body it's - is not the organism.    PALCA: Mm-hm.  Mr. FISCHER:  The thallus, the body of that organism remains in that rotten log or down in the soil, perhaps wrapped around the roots of trees in the case of a mycorrhizal fungus.  PALCA: Right.  Mr. FISCHER:  So if you want to call it roots, I don't - we don't use that term.  PALCA:  They're not roots, I guess it's a different word.  But there's something that's growing underneath the thing that looks like the fruiting body.  Mr. FISCHER:  Right.    PALCA: Right.  Mr. FISCHER:  We call that the mycelium.    PALCA:  OK.  Mr. FISCHER:  And that is the thallus, the body if you will.    PALCA:  Excellent.  OK, well, we're going to move on slightly, although we're staying with fungi. My next guest is not a mycologist, she's an entomologist and she's been studying the Asian longhorn beetle, an invasive insect that's found a new home here in the U. S.  The beetle makes its living eating trees, healthy maple trees in fact.    But just how the beetle digests all that wood isn't clear, or at least it wasn't clear until recently, when researchers discovered that the beetle has a fungal companion.  A microscopic ally that does a lot of the heavy lifting, or I guess, you'd think of it as heavy digesting for the insect.    And joining me now to talk more about that is Kelli Hoover, she's an associate professor of entomology at Penn State University in State College, Pennsylvania.  Dr. Hoover, welcome to the program.  Dr. KELLI HOOVER (Associate Professor, Entomology, Penn State University, State College):  Well, thanks very much for having me.  PALCA:  So, OK, you're studying this beetle that's eating trees.  What led you to the possibility that a fungus was involved here?  Dr. HOOVER:  Well, we just started to look.  There hadn't been anybody looking, except for bacteria.  And we decided to start sequencing what was inside the gut, and discovered that there was fungus that we found in every specimen we looked at, including beetles we collected out of trees in New York City and lo and behold it's the same fungus.    And it's a common fungus that you find all over the place, (unintelligible). It's a species complex, so there are many, many species within that complex.  And this one happens to be unique, it sort of lines up with a few related fusarium, but it seems to be novel.    PALCA:  And this particular fusarium is capable of digesting wood?  Dr. HOOVER:  We believe that it does.  We've been looking for - well, what our paper showed was that when wood goes into beetle and comes out the other end, the lignin in the wood has actually been degraded.    That had never been shown before for any insect, even termite.  We also did look at a termite and found that they can do it too.  But the method to be able to prove that this is actually happening, had not been done before on insects. So, what we found with this fungus is that it's producing enzymes that we believe are capable of helping to digest the wood.  PALCA:  Really?  And how does this differ - I mean, we've heard about - we've been talking in this hour about fungus forming symbiotic relationships with other organisms, what's the good relationship between the fungus - well, I mean, for the fungus not for the tree of course, but the relationship between the fungus and the beetle?  Dr. HOOVER:  Well, I suspect for the fungus, what it gets out of it is that it gets moved around from tree to tree.  I suspect what the - obviously what the beetle's getting out of it is assistance in breaking down wood.  So, it's a wonderful symbiotic relationship.  This insect has been encountering related fungi for probably thousands of years, maybe millions of years and it makes sense that why not have it live inside your gut and take it with you.  PALCA:  Sure, why not?  Well. . .  Dr. HOOVER:  And there are other termites for example, that cultivate fungal combs outside their body or grow fungus gardens.  PALCA:  Mm.  Dr. HOOVER:  And, you know, that's how they are able to breakdown woody material.  This guy decided to have the fungus live inside of him.  PALCA:  Mm.  Now we've been talking about the sort of the negative consequences of this beetle having shown up, and the threat it poses for trees, but I gather there's another way to turn this around and think, well, gosh this may turn out to be a useful fungus to have stumbled across.  Can you explain about that?  Dr. HOOVER:  Sure.  One of the things that we're very interested in is you know, sort of bio-prospecting for new enzymes that can be used in bio-fuels production.  So, this fungus may very well turn out be a good source for those kinds of enzymes because, you know, with wood, you know, to make cellulostic ethanol, the ligament in the wood is like this binding adhesive matrix that holds all the cellulose together and makes that inaccessible to getting to the cellulose which is the part that you want to make ethanol.  So, if you can get rid of the ligament in a nice safe way, the problem with getting rid of ligament is the way it's done now is you have to use high temperatures and nasty chemicals.  But in biological systems, this beetle has evolved a way to do it fairly rapidly and in a nice micro-environment, if you will.  Maybe we can figure out a way to get - to grow those enzymes outside of the insect.  PALCA:  There you go.  Dr. HOOVER:  And we may have some applications for bio-fuel.  PALCA:  The silver lining to an apparently dark cloud.  Dr. HOOVER:  Yeah.  PALCA:  Anyway, well, Kelly Hoover, it's a very interesting story.  Thanks for coming on and sharing it with us.  Dr. HOOVER:  You're welcome.  PALCA:  Kelly Hoover is an associate professor of entomology at Penn State University in State College Pennsylvania.  We've been talking this hour, we are talking this hour about more largely - larger members of the fungal family.  My guests are Kathie Hodge, she's an associate professor of mycology at Cornell University, and David Fischer is the author or \"Edible Wild Mushroom of North America. \"  And let's take another call now and go to Steve in Wilmington, North Carolina.  Steve, welcome to the program.  STEVE (Caller):  Well, thank you very much and I want you first to know how thoroughly I enjoy Science Friday.  PALCA:  Oh good.  STEVE:  I look forward to it every week.  PALCA:  Well. . .  STEVE:  Part of my (unintelligible) the earlier gentleman that was regarding it - it had edibility and nutrition content of mushrooms, now, I'm trying to understand on the edibility of some of the mushrooms.  I hear there's - is it true or just a fable about a death ring on the stem or the stalk if you're trying to pick some in the wilds - to taste, to try, or whatever is it - is it notorious that all poisonous mushrooms have this death ring or they do not have it?  Is it still safe?  Is there any sense in all this?  PALCA:  Rule of thumb.  OK.  Let's ask David Fischer for his views on that.  Mr. FISCHER:  Yeah.  Well there are no safe simple rules of thumb.  There are a bunch of folk myths, one is that you - if you cook a mushroom with the silver coin or a silver spoon, if it's a poisonous mushroom, that silver will become tarnished.  That's just an example, or that all mushrooms that grow on wood are safe.  None of those principles work.  The bottom line is just as with the berry, you have to identify the thing first and then you can find out what human experience with it is.  And of course, in a lot of cases, with a lot of mushrooms that aren't so common, aren't so conspicuous or perhaps don't look so appealing from a coroner perspective, we don't know what their edibility versus toxicity is at this point.  We're always looking for testers.  PALCA:  Mm.  I see.  Sounds like. . .  (Soundbite of laughter)  PALCA:  Sounds a little gruesome actually.  I hope. . .  Mr. FISCHER:  Well, they volunteer. . .  PALCA:  I hope there's an - in form of consent.  Yes, exactly.  I should point out that on the sciencefriday. com Web site, there's a really excellent video that'll show you if you don't happen to have your own field guide, you can go see a videotape that's there by Flora Lichtman about a trip to the New York Botanical Gardens where you can see some pretty interesting examples of mushrooms that are growing in the wild.  But again, caution is the key word here I think in terms of any kind of dining experience based on things you find as you're wondering through the fields.  Mr. FISCHER:  Absolutely.  PALCA:  Let's take another call now and go to Ann.  I'm sorry.  Ann(ph) in Austin, Texas.  ANN (Caller):  Hi.  How are you all today?  PALCA:  I'm good.  ANN:  Good.  I'm calling - I'm really glad you all had this discussion today and I'm really interested in mushrooms and pets and being out front.  I had a pet not too long ago that had a brush with death.  A very close death.  The vet cannot - could not even find the - of course, a (unintelligible) was high - I think or low, I'm not sure exactly what it was.  PALCA:  Something bad.  ANN:  Yeah, it was something bad, yeah.    PALCA:  Right.  ANN:  And the dog was not going to make it and with the only thing that we could figure out was in the back - about this time every year, this type of mushroom would grow in the back of the yard.  And we had had a dog before died of something - like the same thing.  And so, and fortunately, the dog came back.  I think it just, it just actually seemed as though - it's kind of funny - but had like a really bad trip on a mushroom  PALCA:  Uh oh.  I knew we'd get there some place.  OK.  ANN:  I mean, really bad.  But it came back and we kind of took the - and I was real surprised that the vet really didn't know what to - you know, I was just thinking that this could be a problem for other pets in the neighborhood or just around, you know.  Animals out eating just these different mushrooms. . .  PALCA:  Yeah.  ANN:  And then not understanding what are or how to treat that and maybe got a bad vet.  PALCA:  Yeah.  Interesting problem there and thank you for identifying that.  Kathie Hodge, is that, is there anything you can do for first, first response if that sort of thing happens?  Dr. HODGE:  Yeah.  That's a tough one and since we have a big vet school here at Cornell, I've actually seen three mushroom poisonings this summer with dogs.  Two of them fatal.  And, so yeah, dogs also can be poisoned by mushrooms and the tricky part with dogs, well I guess there's two tricky parts.  One is that they can't tell you what they ate.  So, you have to kind of infer what they have or you end up looking at vomit specimens which I personally prefer not to do.  But, the other problem with dogs is that we don't have much information about the effects of poison mushrooms on dogs.    PALCA:  Right.  Dr. HODGE:  So, they can be poisoned by amanita species just like people but the onset is faster, the syndrome is a little different, and they also eat a lot of weird little mushrooms that people generally ignore like little Anocipe(ph) species that can be fatal to dogs as well.  PALCA:  OK.  Dr. HODGE:  So, it's a tough call.  PALCA:  Tough call.  We're talking about mushrooms and other fungi, fungi.  I'm Joe Palca and this is Talk of the Nation from NPR News.  Kathie Hodge, it's my understanding that this has been an incredibly good year, a fruitful year, a large year for mushroom hunters, is that true?  Dr. HODGE:  Yes.  Very bountiful this year.  We had a lovely wet summer here in the northeast.  PALCA:  What are the conditions that are favorable for mushroom growth?  Dr. HODGE:  Well, wet is good for mushrooms.  Mushrooms just depend on high humidity in the air just to disperse their spores.  So, you generally find them fruiting in wet - at wet times.  High humidity, a lot of rain, after storms and this is one of those summers, boy.  PALCA:  Yeah.  And what's the best time for people to look for mushrooms?  Dr. HODGE:  Well, it varies.  Depends on what you're looking for.  If you're looking for morels, you better be looking in the spring because they don't grow any other time of year.  And chanterelles maybe mid-summer and each different mushroom species has its own fruiting pattern.  So just about any time of year, there's something fruiting.  PALCA:  All right.  And David Fischer, I wanted to come to you because you were saying that the cultivated, the button mushrooms, you know, those are ubiquitous, why are there so - I mean, with so many hundreds of mushroom species and certainly many of them edible, why are there so few that are actually showing up in stores?  I mean, your book describes many things that I've never seen before.  Mr. FISCHER:  There are an increasing number of mushrooms showing up in some grocery stores and specialty grocers and specialty produce markets.  Chanterelles for example, here in Syracuse, you wouldn't have been able to find, you know, fresh chanterelles at the grocery store 20 years ago to save your life.  Dried ones perhaps.  But now, during the season when chanterelles are fruiting prodigiously in the Pacific Northwest, we get lots of chanterelles from there fresh in our stores.  PALCA:  Mm.  And is it possible - I've heard - and we were talking about this earlier at lunch today.  Is it possible to grow your own mushrooms safely?  I've heard that there might be kits that you can buy?  Mr. FISCHER:  Oh, absolutely.  In fact, a colleague of Kathie's and mine, Paul Stamets with a company called Fungi Perfecti, I don't know how many he's got at this point but you can probably buy kits from his company for at least a dozen and maybe two dozen different edible species.  PALCA:  So really, well you know, we've been talking - we've talked earlier today about brewing beer, now growing fungi.  You know, we're actually providing this farm service for people.  This is really excellent.  And right guys, thank you, thank you both very much for joining me this hour.  It's been a fascinating glimpse of the fungal world.  Mr. FISCHER:  Thank you, Joe.  Dr. HODGE:  Thanks, Joe.  PALCA:  OK.  Kathie Hodge is associate professor of mycology at Cornell University and David Fischer is a mycologist and author of \"Edible Wild Mushrooms of North America. \"  Greg Smith composed our theme music.  We had help today from NPR librarian Kee Malesky who insists that it's fungi but she'll accept fungi.

They're also having an effect on mental health. Severe stress can spark some mental illnesses or exacerbate them. NPR's Joanne Silberner talked to several psychiatrists to see what they're expecting from current and future patients. JOANNE SILBERNER: Diving markets and screaming headlines are enough to make people on and off Wall Street anxious. And that can be normal, says John Markowitz. He's a research psychiatrist at New York State Psychiatric Institute. Dr. JOHN MARKOWITZ (Research Psychiatrist, New York State Psychiatric Institute): If you're a little worried about your money and your work security, that may well be appropriate in a given circumstance. SILBERNER: But Markowitz says he started seeing signs of financially based stress a year ago among some of his Wall Street patients as the market began to turn. Psychiatrist Deborah Cross, who heads the New York State Psychiatric Association, says she hasn't seen any changes in the last week, but she expects an uptake soon, just like the one she saw last spring after the collapse of giant brokerage firm Bear Stearns. Dr. DEBORAH CROSS (Vice President, New York State Psychiatric Association): Within a week to 10 days, when it really began to sink in to the people who were being most affected, who were getting the pink slips, who were seeing their friends getting pink slips, then we started getting calls. SILBERNER: It's not just depression. Psychiatrists report that people who have gotten eating disorders under control may be pushed back into old behaviors. Substance abuse can become a problem. Family violence goes up. Some people have panic attacks. You know you're in trouble when daily habits change, says New York City psychoanalyst Charles Goodstein. New symptoms like. . . Dr. CHARLES GOODSTEIN (Psychoanalyst, New York): Difficulties in eating and sleeping, changes in mood, irritability, a sense of worthlessness, and for some, a sense of withdrawal. SILBERNER: Agitation, inability to concentrate, thoughts of suicide, you've moved from anxiety and sadness into clinical depression. For people at the top of the failing Wall Street firms, things may be a little different, says psychiatrist Deborah Cross. Dr. CROSS: The big guys, the wheelers and dealers of the hedge funds and the mutual funds and such, their stresses come from a little bit different angle. It's not the financial so much as it's the loss of their identity. And if they don't have a life other than their company, then they really are at a loss. SILBERNER: Psychiatrists who treat Wall Street traders say they expect the current woes will have more effect than the dot com bust of 2000 because the financial situation is worse. Again, Charles Goodstein. Dr. GOODSTEIN: Nobody was calling back then for the rescue of Internet companies, after all. Today we're talking about icons of the American financial industry. Some Internet startup that went bust, well, that's one thing. Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns, Fanny Mae? I mean, gee, this is a different story. SILBERNER: Still, John Markowitz says, psychiatrically things are better than they were when the markets failed in 1929. Dr. MARKOWITZ: Back in the Great Depression, there was great depression, I'm sure, but it was hard to diagnose. Nowadays, we can accurately diagnose the conditions, and we know how to treat many of them. SILBERNER: But that doesn't mean everyone will be able to get treatment. When jobs go, employer-paid health insurance goes, too. Psychiatrist Deborah Cross saw it with Bear Stearns patients. Dr. CROSS: These people were well enough off that they didn't qualify for Medicaid, they were not old enough to qualify for Medicare, and they had no insurance. SILBERNER: Leaving them to pay from their savings or go to a public health clinic or ask for reduced fees; approaches, she says, that kept some people suffering from depression or other problems from seeking care. Joanne Silberner, NPR News.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host:  This year's troubles on Wall Street aren't just hitting people's pocketbooks. They're also having an effect on mental health. Severe stress can spark some mental illnesses or exacerbate them. NPR's Joanne Silberner talked to several psychiatrists to see what they're expecting from current and future patients.  JOANNE SILBERNER: Diving markets and screaming headlines are enough to make people on and off Wall Street anxious. And that can be normal, says John Markowitz. He's a research psychiatrist at New York State Psychiatric Institute.  Dr. JOHN MARKOWITZ (Research Psychiatrist, New York State Psychiatric Institute): If you're a little worried about your money and your work security, that may well be appropriate in a given circumstance.  SILBERNER: But Markowitz says he started seeing signs of financially based stress a year ago among some of his Wall Street patients as the market began to turn. Psychiatrist Deborah Cross, who heads the New York State Psychiatric Association, says she hasn't seen any changes in the last week, but she expects an uptake soon, just like the one she saw last spring after the collapse of giant brokerage firm Bear Stearns.  Dr. DEBORAH CROSS (Vice President, New York State Psychiatric Association): Within a week to 10 days, when it really began to sink in to the people who were being most affected, who were getting the pink slips, who were seeing their friends getting pink slips, then we started getting calls.  SILBERNER: It's not just depression. Psychiatrists report that people who have gotten eating disorders under control may be pushed back into old behaviors. Substance abuse can become a problem. Family violence goes up. Some people have panic attacks. You know you're in trouble when daily habits change, says New York City psychoanalyst Charles Goodstein. New symptoms like. . .  Dr. CHARLES GOODSTEIN (Psychoanalyst, New York): Difficulties in eating and sleeping, changes in mood, irritability, a sense of worthlessness, and for some, a sense of withdrawal.  SILBERNER: Agitation, inability to concentrate, thoughts of suicide, you've moved from anxiety and sadness into clinical depression. For people at the top of the failing Wall Street firms, things may be a little different, says psychiatrist Deborah Cross.  Dr. CROSS: The big guys, the wheelers and dealers of the hedge funds and the mutual funds and such, their stresses come from a little bit different angle. It's not the financial so much as it's the loss of their identity. And if they don't have a life other than their company, then they really are at a loss.  SILBERNER: Psychiatrists who treat Wall Street traders say they expect the current woes will have more effect than the dot com bust of 2000 because the financial situation is worse. Again, Charles Goodstein.  Dr. GOODSTEIN: Nobody was calling back then for the rescue of Internet companies, after all. Today we're talking about icons of the American financial industry. Some Internet startup that went bust, well, that's one thing. Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns, Fanny Mae? I mean, gee, this is a different story.  SILBERNER: Still, John Markowitz says, psychiatrically things are better than they were when the markets failed in 1929.

Clark and other researchers will keep monitoring and recording the whales near New York City and all around the world.

At first, scientists think it was like a big, hot blob of magma. Then it began to cool and formed a rocky crust. Geologists would love to find samples of those early rocks to help them understand what the Earth was like back then and how the continents emerged. But it's not easy to look this far back into the past because the planet's surface is constantly changing. Scientists have found some ancient rocks. One, in Canada's Northwest Territories, is known to be about 4 billion years old. But now, researchers say they may have something even closer to Earth's beginnings. Jonathan O'Neil is a geologist with McGill University in Montreal. He knows this is a bold claim. BLOCK: Of course, there is going to be controversy. I'm expecting that.

After a much anticipated and seemingly successful test, the particles came to a screeching halt last week at the Large Hadron Collider.  It appears that the super-cold helium used to chill the magnets, sprung a leak.   Things had to be shut down for repairs, and it might be a while before the particle smasher is fired up again.  And we start getting some answers to those burning questions about the origins of the universe.  Joining me now to tell us about what went on is Dan How - Hooper.   Dan is the assistant professor at the University of Chicago.  Dr. Hooper is also an associate scientist at FermiLab in the National Laboratory in Batavia, New York, and out - Batavia, Illinois, outside Chicago.  His book is called \" Nature's Blueprint: Supersymmetry and the Search for a Unified Theory of Matter and Force,\" Welcome back to Science Friday, Dr. Hooper. Dr. DAN HOOPER (Assistant Professor at the University of Chicago; Author, \"Nature's Blueprint Supersymmetry and a Search a Unified Theory of Matter and Force. \"):  Well, thanks for having me on again. FLATOW:  Sorry my mouth is not working so well this afternoon. Dr. HOOPER:  No problem. FLATOW:  It must be getting chilled by all that helium.  What happened?  Did the helium leak out? Is that what happened? Dr. HOOPER:  Well, yeah, around September 19th or so, some repairs were being finalized on one of the large transformers at the LHC.  There was some sort of faulty electro connection, so it seems, and this seems to have caused about a ton of the liquid helium to leak, and for parts of the detector, the parts for the accelerator, that heat up and the magnets have some malfunctions as well.   FLATOW:  Mm-hm. And so why is it going to take so long to put this back on line, they were talking about months?  Dr. HOOPER:  Well, the thing is, the reason we use liquid helium is to keep the accelerator very, very cold.  So we want it to be around two degrees above absolute zero.   FLATOW: Mm-hm. Dr. HOOPER: And to work on it, it has to be at roughly room temperature, which is you know, hundreds of degrees higher. So it takes about a month simply to heat up the detector to room temperature, or rather the accelerator-room temperature, so it can be worked on.  And then it will take some time to actually do the maintenance and the work, and then it takes another month to cool it down to liquid-helium kind of temperatures.   So we're now instead of looking at late in 2009, we're looking at maybe March or April of - and I'm sorry - instead of late 2008, they're looking at March or April in 2009, before they start getting full-energy collisions. FLATOW:  Were any of the parts damaged that would need to be replaced? Dr. HOOPER:  Well, not all of the answers are in yet.  It's going to take the next month before it's warmed up, and they can go in it and really learn all those things in detail.  But yes, some of the magnets are almost certainly damaged, and some of the electronics as well.  FLATOW:  Mm-hm.  Do they. . . Dr. HOOPER:  But nothing that can't be repaired. FLATOW:  Yeah, I guess. . . Dr. HOOPER:  This is a relatively small part of the accelerator, and you know it's - we've been building this thing for, well, 10 years of construction. . . FLATOW:  Yeah. Dr. HOOPER:  And 20 years of R&D, and 30 years of just thinking about such a machine.   FLATOW:  Right. Dr. HOOPER:  This is just a few months in that long path. FLATOW:  They actually had turned the machine on for a test and had gotten some results, hadn't they, on this?   Dr. HOOPER:  Well, the first day or so was very successful.  So, on September 10th I was at FermiLab with a few hundred physicists watching the experiment turn on in the middle of the night.  And it took, you know, in the matter of a few hours they had beams of protons going in both directions around the 17-mile track of the experiment.   It was very successful. It exceeded all expectations.  But then shortly after that they had the first problem with the transformer that happened, and a week or so later the problems with the magnets and the helium. FLATOW:  Mm. And how much do you think it's going to cost to fix all of this stuff? Dr. HOOPER:  Well, I'm not really sure how to put it - how to estimate the dollars on this.  I haven't heard any one make such an estimate.  But it is a small fraction of the cost of the experiment.  Like I said, this is something that talk - that took deca - more than a decade to construct, and 20 years to design.   So, you know, what the cost of having these scientists work on it another six months before it's up and running, I think are quiet small. And also these are sorts of - the sort of problems that you expect in a huge prototype-like experiment like the LHC that to have - you know, no one's ever built a machine like this.   FLATOW:  Mm-hm.   Dr. HOOPER: You expect a machine like this to have problems, you know, growing pains as you get it to work operationally. FLATOW:  Right. Question from Second Life from Rudy   He asks, will it come back on line before power must be diverted to keep the cities there warm?  Because it uses a lot of juice, doesn't it? Dr HOOPER:  Well, that's right.  And as I understand they have an arrangement with the city of Geneva where they have scheduled shutdowns in the winter to conserve on energy.  But the schedule now is actually - now is that they hope to bring it online in late March, which, you know, the winter will be largely over by then. FLATOW:  Mm-hm.  And so you just have to sit back and wait.  You must be very disappointed, I would think, and along with a lot of other scientists. Dr. HOOPER:  Well, you know, we would love to see data coming in sooner than that, but you know, I've been waiting a long time for this.  Six months isn't going to kill me or anyone else. FLATOW:  All right.  Thank you, Dan, for taking your time to be with us, and I hope you have a short winter. Dr. HOOPER:  Sure.  Thanks for having me on.

That coupled with his own experience rushing to fit voting into a busy schedule made him want to look more closely at how all this rushing might affect safety on the roads on voting day. Dr. DONALD REDELMEIER (Professor of Medicine, University of Toronto; Trauma Center Internist): We studied all U. S. presidential elections for the last 32 years beginning with Jimmy Carter in 1976 and ending with George Bush in 2004. NEIGHMOND: Redelmeier studied the U. S. in particular because he says the U. S. keeps the best crash statistics. He compared Election Day to the Tuesdays before and after and found an increase of 18 percent in motor vehicle deaths on voting day. Dr. REDELMEIER: This equaled about 24 people per election, was remarkably consistent across different locations and years. NEIGHMOND: Redelmeier also found about 800 more people suffered disabling injuries as a result of the crashes. These injuries and deaths far outnumber those reported during times when people might be drinking and driving, on Super Bowl Sundays, for example, and on New Year's Eve. But unlike on those days, Redelmeier says, alcohol didn't seem to be an issue on voting day. There was no increase in crashes in the evening when people might be more likely to drink. It may just be that on voting day, he says, emotions run high. Dr. REDELMEIER: There's an election going on. Everybody's talking about it. And everybody's paying attention to the polls when they maybe should be paying a little bit more attention to their driving. NEIGHMOND: In the end, Redelmeier can't say exactly why people crash. He thinks they may have been speeding trying to fit voting into hectic schedules. Research has already shown speeding significantly increases the risk of car accidents and deaths. On top of that, Redelmeier says, there may be less police presence on voting days to monitor that speeding. Dr. REDELMEIER: Simply because the police are busy themselves voting. And secondly a crackdown on motorists is a public relations loser, simply because it comes across as the authorities interfering with the democratic process. NEIGHMOND: Leonard Evans is a longtime traffic safety researcher. He says part of the problem with car crashes in general is the American mindset when it comes to car safety. Mr. LEONARD EVANS (Traffic Safety Researcher): When I talk to random people and they discover that I do traffic safety, the reaction is very, very likely to be something about tires, air bags, what vehicle is safest. NEIGHMOND: While these are important, Evans says, they pale compared to the real culprits in traffic accidents: drivers. Drivers who sometimes work hard to get around the law. Mr. EVANS: Here in Michigan, as in most U. S. states, you can buy a radar speed detector. The one and only purpose of a radar speed detector is to assist people to behave in such a way as to threaten the lives of other people on the road. NEIGHMOND: So the take-home message for American voters this Election Day: Keep your eye on the road, and slow down. Patti Neighmond, NPR News.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. It is the week of Nobel Prize announcements, and now we're going to hear about the achievements of the three winners in the category of Physiology or Medicine. Two French researchers won for discovering the virus that causes AIDS, and a German scientist got the prize for showing that most cervical cancer is caused by human papilloma viruses. NPR's Richard Knox has our story. RICAHRD KNOX: This year's medical Nobel ends decades of speculation about who would win the everlasting credit for discovering HIV, the deadliest virus of our time. The surprise is not that French researchers Francoise Barre-Sinoussi and Luc Montagnier won the Nobel, but that American scientist Robert Gallo did not share in it. Throughout most of the 1980s, the American and French researchers fought bitterly over who deserved the credit. Eventually, President Ronald Reagan and French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac signed a declaration that they were co-discoverers.  Today, Gallo directs the Institute for Human Virology at the University of Maryland. Its Web site identifies him as the co-discoverer of HIV, but the Nobel Committee said, no, the French got there first. Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health says that's the way the scientific cookie crumbles. Dr. ANTHONY FAUCI (Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health): When the Nobel Committee looks at it, they look and they say, first observation, 1983. Boom, that's it. You know, I respect that. It's just too bad because Bob's contribution was very important, but there's a limited number of people that can get the prize. KNOX: The rules say only three people can share a Nobel. And the Nobel Committee chose to split the award this year between the HIV and papilloma virus discoveries rather than include Gallo in a singular HIV prize. Fauci says that while the French were the first to isolate the virus, Gallo did a lot of the work that proved it causes AIDS. Dr. FAUCI: The actual intellectual link between the virus and HIV as the cause of AIDS was really very much slam-dunked in the series of papers in 1984 by Gallo's group in Science. KNOX: That's the journal Science. Today, Gallo told a reporter he was disappointed. Montagnier, who's in Africa, said his old rival deserved to share the prize. But San Francisco researcher Jay Levy, the third scientist to publish the discovery of HIV, was content. Dr. JAY LEVY (Virologist, University of California San Francisco): In the end, what they did was quite fair, and I congratulate them. KNOX: No such questions hover over this year's other medical Nobel laureate, German scientist Harald zur Hausen. He's worked since 1970 to convince skeptics that human papilloma viruses cause cervical cancer. Bennett Jenson, a scientific colleague at the University of Louisville, says zur Hausen has been in the running for a Nobel for a long time. Dr. BENNETT JENSON (Research Professor, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville): He's the founding father. And we would have been sorely upset if he hadn't been the Nobel Prize laureate for medicine this year. KNOX: Fauci, the NIH scientist, says zur Hausen was way ahead of his time. It's been 24 years since he first tried to persuade drug companies to develop a vaccine against cervical cancer. Two years ago, the first such vaccine won approval. Zur Hausen wasn't available today, but Jensen says his friend hopes the $350 cost of the vaccine can be brought way down so millions of women around the world can avoid cervical cancer.

I'm Ari Shapiro. STEVE INSKEEP, Host: And I'm Steve Inskeep. Good morning. Let's get up to date now on this year's Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. It goes to scientists who made a couple of separate discoveries about the ways that viruses cause serious illnesses. Those illnesses are AIDS and cancer of the cervix. We're going to get more now from NPR's Richard Knox who's covering the announcement. Richard, good morning. RICHARD KNOX: Good morning. INSKEEP: Now let's start with these two French scientists who won for their work on HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. What did they learn that hadn't been learned? KNOX: Well, there were two groups, one in France and one in America, who both claimed to discover the AIDS virus back in the early '80s. The French team, Luc Montagnier and Francoise Barre-Sinoussi, got the virus out of lymph nodes that they took from an AIDS patient. And Robert Gallo of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda published papers saying that his team had discovered the AIDS virus. And the dispute went on for years. A lot was at stake. Among the issues was that - who gets royalties for the blood tests that were made possible by these discoveries. INSKEEP: Are you saying here that by awarding this to the French scientists, and not the American, then Richard Knox, the Nobel committee is basically saying that in this dispute it's the French scientists who actually made the discovery first and who deserve credit for it? KNOX: The Nobel Committee has settled that controversy in probably the most definitive way. They seem to have accepted an investigation that was done about 15 years ago which looked at the viruses from both labs and concluded that they were in fact the same virus. And what happened, apparently, was that the French had shared a sample of the virus with the Americans, and the French sample accidentally got into a laboratory dish that Bob Gallo was using to grow the virus. And it's a common problem in labs. It's a question of contamination. But in fact the French discovered the virus. INSKEEP: And I suppose it's worth mentioning here that, setting aside the controversy, this is a discovery that shaped our understanding of much of what's happened in the world for the past couple of decades or more. This is one of the worst epidemics on record. KNOX: It is. And it's clearly - I mean, I think it was only a matter of time in most scientists' view that the Nobel Committee would award a prize for the discovery of the AIDS virus. It's just a gargantuan public health problem, probably unprecedented. And certainly nothing like it has happened in terms of public impact on people around the world since the flu pandemic of 1918. INSKEEP: OK. So we have two French scientists, each winning, as I understand it, one quarter of a Nobel Prize. Between them they get half of a Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. Who gets the other half of the prize money? KNOX: The other half goes to a German scientist, Harald Zur Hausen. And he did a long series of experiments beginning in the 1970s that established there's a whole variety of - whole family viruses called human papilloma viruses that, in fact, some of which cause cancer of the cervix. And that was an important discovery about the long-disputed notion of whether viruses could cause cancer. INSKEEP: Well, now is this the discovery then that led to the vaccine that many women now take for cancer of the cervix? KNOX: Indeed, yeah, it really paved the way for that vaccine. And you know, it's a vaccine that's very effective. It provides at least 95 percent protection against cervical cancer. And this is really the first time that anybody has made a vaccine that demonstrably protects against cancer. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: This was the first vaccine DESIGNED to prevent cancer. For more than 25 years, the hepatitis B vaccine -- developed to prevent hepatitis -- has had the effect of protecting against liver cancer. ]INSKEEP: OK. So three people then share the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. How much do they split? KNOX: The total is 1. 3 million dollars these days, and Professor Zur Hausen gets 650,000 and the French get about 325,000 apiece. But the prestige, of course, is priceless.

We non-physicists see symmetry in people's faces, in snowflakes. But as NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports, these Nobel winners think about symmetry as it relates to the fundamental workings of the universe. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE:  Yoichiro Nambu is 87 years old.  He lives in Chicago, and he got woken up early this morning by a phone call.  It was Sweden's Royal Academy of Sciences telling him that he'd won the Nobel Prize for a paper he wrote on something called spontaneous broken symmetry in subatomic physics.  It helped explain some of the fundamental forces of nature and why different particles have different masses. Dr. YOICHIRO NAMBU (Physicist, Nobel Prize Winner):  My paper came out 1960, I believe. GREENFIELDBOYCE:  1960? Mr. NAMBU:  Yes. GREENFIELDBOYCE:  So that was 48 years ago? Mr. NAMBU:  Yes, that's correct. GREENFIELDBOYCE:  So that's a long time. Mr. NAMBU:  Yes, long, long time ago. GREENFIELDBOYCE:  Nambu came to the United States in 1952 and is now a citizen.  He's worked at the University of Chicago for decades.  Some of his colleagues in Chicago say the honor is long overdue.  Joe Lykken is a particle physicist at Fermilab. Dr. JOE LYKKEN (Particle Physicist, Fermilab):  We'd been talking about it for years that he deserved it, and that he's such a shy and humble man that those kinds of people don't always win the prize. But the Nobel committee has finally wised up and done the right thing for him. GREENFIELDBOYCE:  Nambu will share his prize and around $1. 4 million with two researchers in Japan.  Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa explored another kind symmetry breaking. Their work back in the 1970s led to the prediction that physicists should eventually find new types of the subatomic particles known as Quarks, and experiments proved them right.  Joe Lykken of Fermilab says that work built on the research of an Italian physicist named Nicola Cabibbo. Mr. LYKKEN:  These three people are - Cabibbo, Kobayashi, and Maskawa - are mentioned so often together that we usually just say C-K-M rather than saying all three of their multisyllabic names. GREENFIELDBOYCE:  So some scientists might wonder why Cabibbo wasn't honored by the committee.  But the rules say the Nobel can only go to three scientists.  Philip Schewe, a spokesperson for the American Institute of Physics, says this year's award is well-deserved. Mr. PHILIP SCHEWE (Spokesperson, American Institute of Physics):  These three gentlemen provided theories that explain one of the most fundamental aspects of existence, how symmetric is the universe?  We sort of instinctively want the universe to be symmetric. We want it to be regular, and the fact that it's not is kind of interesting. GREENFIELDBOYCE:  It's more than just interesting. It's what makes life possible.  For example, when the Big Bang created the cosmos some 14 billion years ago, it didn't create equal amounts of matter and antimatter.  That's a good thing because they would have canceled each other out.  Scientists are still trying to understand why there was just a tiny bit of extra matter, a little asymmetry that became the seed of our universe.

But this year's prize for Chemistry has been awarded to a crowd-pleaser. It goes to three scientists who made things glow in the dark with a jellyfish gene. NPR's Dan Charles explains. DAN CHARLES: Life, when you look at it really closely, is an intricate dance of proteins inside every cell of our bodies. But you can't see those proteins. They're too tiny. So for decades, scientists have been trying to find a way to make that invisible world visible. Fifteen years ago, Roger Tsien, at the University of California, San Diego, tried to attach chemical dyes to a protein. But it didn't work very well. He thought to himself, what I really need is a gene that makes the protein visible. Dr. ROGER TSIEN (Scientist): Nobody knew of such a thing in the literature but I sort of vaguely remembered that there was this protein called green fluorescent protein. CHARLES: It came from a kind of jellyfish. A Japanese researcher named Osamu Shimomura working at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts had purified it and described it. The protein glowed green when exposed to ultraviolet light. Both Tsien and Martin Chalfie at Columbia University tried inserting the gene that produced this green fluorescent protein into cells. Tsien says no one knew if it would work Mr. TSIEN: And the amazing thing is that nature suddenly smiled. CHARLES: The gene worked beautifully, in bacteria, worms and lots of other creatures. Under ultraviolet light, it made proteins in the cell glow a ghostly shade of green. Thousands of researchers all over the world now are using it to track proteins. They can watch cancer cells or viruses multiply and spread. And early this morning, Tsien, Chalfie and Osamu Shimomura all got calls from the Swedish Academy of Sciences. Martin Chalfie slept through his call. At a press conference today, he explained he'd set his phone by mistake to ring very softly. When he got out of bed though, he remembered the Nobel prize in Chemistry was announced today. Dr. MARTIN CALFIE (Scientist): So I decided to find out who the schnook was that won it this year. So I opened up my laptop and found out that I was the schnook. The other two people are very good scientists. CHARLES: Chalfie's research group was the first to insert the green florescent protein into another cell, but, in the years since, it was Roger Tsien who built a whole toolbox of similar techniques. There are now are dozens of florescent tags, glowing in many colors so biologists can label different proteins and watch how they interact. John Frangioni, who teaches at Harvard Medical School says, it's great that this technique is finally getting recognized. Prof. JOHN FRANGIONI (Harvard Medical School ): This is a practical Nobel prize, this is something that has transformed medical research. This is, you know, when we're able to cure, you know, terrible human diseases such as cancer and neurologic diseases, we're going to be able to trace that back to research that at some point used these fluorescent proteins. CHARLES: Roger Tsien says he was thinking, maybe it was time to stop working on fluorescent proteins and move on to something new. But then, just recently, he discovered something else about them that he wants to pursue. The science calls, he says and I can't quite punt this one away. Dan Charles, NPR News, Washington. BLOCK: And tomorrow, we'll learn who has won the Nobel Prize for literature. If you're a literary buff and a betting man or woman, don't put your money on an American writer taking the prize this year. An American hasn't won since Toni Morrison did in 1993. Add to that, last week the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobels, made it clear he has little use for modern American literature. Horace Engdahl said, the U. S. is too isolated, too insular, they don't translate enough and don't really participate in the big dialogue of literature. He said, that ignorance is restraining.  And Engdahl's comments could be restraining American odds in at least on big betting house. The British Ladbrokes gives Philip Roth and Joyce Carol Oates a fighting chance, putting their odds of winning a Nobel around five to one, but they trail several big contenders including front runner, Claudio Magris. Haven't heard of him? He's a novelist and essayist from Italy. Still, if you're in the mood for an even bigger gamble you'll find one more American further down the list, much further down. It's Bob Dylan and his odds are placed at 150 to one. Why he's on the list, we're not sure.

The reason, they're looking for cooler temperatures. And as the planet gets warmer, more and more species may struggle with the same choice - to migrate or die. NPR's Dan Charles reports. DAN CHARLES:  The oldest detailed records of wild life in Yosemite National Park are at the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at the University of California, Berkeley. Craig Morris is the director.  Dr. CRAIG MORITZ (Director, Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of California, Berkeley): The Museum of Vertebrate Zoology is really unusual for an academic institution in that it has a soul and the sense of purpose.   CHARLES: The old notebooks bound into blue volumes and shelved in glass-fronted book cases are filled with notes from field expeditions. Some of the oldest and most detailed were collected by the museum's first director, Joseph Grinnell, in Yosemite.  Grinnell wrote in 1910 that these notes would be most valuable a hundred years later, when other scientist might want to know what's changed. Mr. MORITZ: So, in 1910, Grinnell set the table, basically told us what to do, and that is to come back in a century.   CHARLES: Craig Moritz and his colleagues did go back recently. They found the same kinds of mice, squirrels, and lizards that Grinnell had seen, but they found many of them in different places. Most had moved to higher elevations.   Mr. MORITZ: We've got one species that's moved a kilometer upwards from the east side over the Sierra Crest to colonize high elevations on the west side. That's a very dramatic change. This is not a subtle stuff we're talking about. CHARLES: The reason Moritz says is that Yosemite doesn't get as cold anymore.  According to weather records, the average monthly low temperature has increased by about six degrees Fahrenheit over the past century. That's a local change, but it's an example of what's likely to happen as global temperatures increase. Mr. MORITZ: We didn't set out to look for an effect of climate change. It has hit us right between the eyes when we started looking at the data.  CHARLES: Their study appears in this week's issue of the journal Science. And right next to it in the magazine, there's a paper about the potential effects of global warming on wildlife in the tropics. Robert Colwel in the University of Connecticut studied plants and insects in the valleys and mountains of Costa Rica and found that half of them stay within a fairly narrow range of temperatures. If the earth warms up as predicted, they'll probably have to move. But species in the tropics, he says, have a particular problem. Dr. ROBERT COLWEL (Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Connecticut): It's a very long way to somewhere that's cooler. CHARLES: Temperatures in the tropics are the same across thousands of miles, from Mexico City to Sao Paulo, Brazil. Dr. COLWEL: The point is that the only escape route - if they have to move - the only route is basically uphill. CHARLES: Just as they did in Yosemite. Many probably will have to climb more than 2,000 feet, Colwel says, into entirely new areas. Some may not be able to make the leap.  He also says it's not clear how many species will remain behind in the hottest areas, the tropical lowlands. Some biologists are optimistic. They say creatures in the tropical lowlands won't mind if it gets hotter. They'll stay put. But Colwel isn't so sure.  Dr. COLWEL: There is no evidence whatsoever that they're able to tolerate any amount of more heat, and I asked, why should they be an exception. Why should they not be adapted to their current climate? CHARLES: So as thousands of tropical species move uphill, the rich diversity of life in the lowlands could start to disappear.

I'm Ira Flatow.  You know, we're all taught about the web of life, the famous food chain where animals at the top devour those below them as sources of food.  But this week, researchers report that they have found one place, at least, where that kind of interaction just doesn't occur, and doesn't need to.  They've found a bactera - bacterium that is self sufficient.   These bacteria contain all the tools they need to eat, and grow, and reproduce, and these bacteria live virtually entirely by themselves in one little spot.  Joining me now to talk about it is Dylan Chivian.  He's the bioinformatics lead at the Joint BioEnergy Institute, as part of the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in Berkeley.  And he joins us by phone from there.  Welcome. Mr. DYLAN CHIVIAN (Bioinformatics Lead, Joint BioEnergy Institute):  Hello. FLATOW:  Tell us about these bacteria.  Where did you find them? Mr. CHIVIAN:  So, these bacteria are found in South Africa, and the way they were found was by going into gold mines, going down 2. 8 kilometers, and drilling into fluid-filled fracture that's down there.  These mines have to avoid blowing into these fractures, because otherwise, it'll flood the mines.   So they carefully avoid them, but they were able to get a shaft close enough that we were able to drill through into it, and extract out 5,000 liters of water and filter it out, and collect that DNA, and sequence it.  And so, when we did this, we discovered from that DNA that there was really only one organism present in that DNA.  It's very exciting. FLATOW:  Wow!  So what does it live on? Mr. CHIVIAN:  So, it lives on sulfate.  So, here at the surface, most organisms are going to be dependent on oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor, and so they extract energy by moving electrons from chemicals that, you know, at which there are higher potential, and move them to oxygen which is greedy for electrons.   Well, there's no oxygen down there, and in fact, earlier before (unintelligible) bacteria changed the atmosphere, there really wasn't any oxygen to speak of.  So, organisms had to use and have to use down in the deep, other chemical species, in this case, sulfate. FLATOW:  It sounds very much like the kinds of things we hear growing in the bottom of the ocean in those hot climates, you know, where they're living off the sulfate. Mr. CHIVIAN:  That's right.  And in fact, one of the things that's sort of special about this genome, is that it's managed to assemble the blueprint it needs for a single species' ecosystem, partly by combining those genes it's inherited from it's bacterial lineage.  But additionally, it's picked up genes from archaea, these extreme halophilic archaea.   So, for example, the nitrogenates it has is - most closely resembles high-temperature archaeal-type nitrogenates.  So it can fix nitrogen from the - its environment to that. FLATOW:  Mm. Mr. CHIVIAN:  It also has genes for the sulfate utilization that look like archaeal genes, and also, it's carbon-fixing machinery.  Part of that also looks like that from extreme halophilic archaea.   So it's managed to piece together this solution, but it's done it by combining pieces from different kingdoms. FLATOW:  When you say it's done it by combining pieces, does that mean that it once co-existed with these archaea, or is part of them, or subclass, or lived with them, or came the same time they did?  Take a choice. Mr. CHIVIAN:  So - yeah.  Exactly.  So, it seems like a bit of conundrum, right? FLATOW:  Yeah. Mr. CHIVIAN: And here it is, living by itself and yet, its solution for this ecosystem is combining things from different organisms.  Well, the solution here is actually that the ancestor to this organism, Desulforudis audaxviator, was living in contact with our archaea in the past.   FLATOW:  Mm-hm. Mr. CHIVIAN:  And so, that's when those genes made their way into this genome, and eventually were brought with this colonizing ancestor into this fracture. FLATOW:  Do we then might believe that they were at the bottom of the ocean in these hot thermal vents too, at some point? Mr. CHIVIAN:  Well, so, if we look at scraps of marker genes that you can find flowing out of vents in these various surveys that are done, we actually find that there are not exact relatives, but sort of a little bit beyond the genus level relatives\u2026 FLATOW:  Mm. Mr. CHIVIAN:  To Desulforudis that are coming out of (unintelligible) vents, and coming from fluid seeps from the Gulf of Cadiz off Spain\u2026 FLATOW:  Mm. Mr. CHIVIAN:  And there's similar relatives in Denmark and in an aquifer in New Mexico. FLATOW:  Wow.  Mr. CHIVIAN:  Yeah. FLATOW:  Wow. It's all over the place. And it gets its energy from the sulfur, but you say, it can also fix the nitrogen and the carbon on its own? Mr. CHIVIAN:  That's right. FLATOW:  How long do we think it's been down there? Mr. CHIVIAN:  Well so, it's hard to say.  It's fairly diverged from surface organisms, but probably the best minimum estimate would be that isotopic studies of the water date the youngest water, meaning the last time it saw the surface, at at least three million years, possibly up to ten million years.  So, it's probably somewhere in that range.   But it's hard to really pinpoint it, because we can't\u2026 FLATOW:  Mm. Mr. CHIVIAN:  We don't know the division rate, we don't know\u2026 FLATOW:  Mm-mm. Mr. CHIVIAN:  It's hard to measure based on the divergence of the genome without knowing several factors. FLATOW:  So, I guess it has no interest in evolving into moving up to the surface anymore? Mr. CHIVIAN:  No, it doesn't really need to.  I mean, what it's really found here is - you know, there's this concept in ecology of a niche, right?  Well, this is essentially a literal niche.  I mean, it's perfectly optimized to this one spot, and so it's coming and taking it over, and it's really happy right where it is. FLATOW:  Do you think that if you'd - that you have found this in this gold mine, it's probably in lots of other places then? Mr. CHIVIAN:  Well, it's hard to say exactly how similar its relatives would be in other locations.  You have to sequence the entire gnome, and there's a lot of variation, even in very close organisms, and we're finding this as we sample more and more from different - like in the ocean for example.   But we - numerous very, very similar strains at one level, but if you actually go and look at the genome\u2026 FLATOW:  Mm. Mr. CHIVIAN:  The genes that are present in it are quite different, and so their capabilities are somewhat different. FLATOW:  Mm. Mr. CHIVIAN:  So, that may be the case. FLATOW:  Right. Mr. CHIVIAN:  We may find similar organisms throughout the deep subsurface, but the exact content of the genes, the exact abilities of those organisms may be slightly different. FLATOW:  Why is it living alone?  Is it because that's the only thing that can survive under those conditions? Mr. CHIVIAN:  Well, it's a very interesting question.  It's not quite possible to say right now.  One possible explanation is that you would think that, well, it has these gifted genes from, you know, extreme halophilic archaea, well, why aren't we finding them there?  And one possible explanation is that, well, archaea can't form endospores.   This is an ability that's been granted to it from its gram-positive Firmicutes lineage.  So, it's possible that it's this combination of bacterial abilities and archaeal abilities\u2026 FLATOW:  Mm-mm. Mr. CHIVIAN: That has really given it the ability to survive. FLATOW:  Mm-hm. And it's - you gave it a very interesting name, and has an interesting derivate. Mr. CHIVIAN:  Yes.  So the genes' name, Desulforudis, is based on the fact that it uses sulfate for its energy, and then the rudis-system morphology, the shape is a rod-like shape.  And then the audaxviator, we were inspired by Jules Verne's \"Journey to the Center of the Earth. \"  There's a message that inspires their journey, which tells them to descend, bold traveler, which in Latin is audaxviator.   This is a message given in Latin.  So descend, audaxviator, and you will attain the center of the earth. FLATOW:  That's a very good place to end, and thank you very much, Dr. Chivian, for taking time to be with us. Mr. CHIVIAN:  Thank you.

Mr. CHIVIAN:  Well, so, if we look at scraps of marker genes that you can find flowing out of vents in these various surveys that are done, we actually find that there are not exact relatives, but sort of a little bit beyond the genus level relatives\u2026  FLATOW:  Mm.  Mr. CHIVIAN:  To Desulforudis that are coming out of (unintelligible) vents, and coming from fluid seeps from the Gulf of Cadiz off Spain\u2026  FLATOW:  Mm.  Mr. CHIVIAN:  And there's similar relatives in Denmark and in an aquifer in New Mexico.  FLATOW:  Wow.   Mr. CHIVIAN:  Yeah.  FLATOW:  Wow. It's all over the place. And it gets its energy from the sulfur, but you say, it can also fix the nitrogen and the carbon on its own?  Mr. CHIVIAN:  That's right.  FLATOW:  How long do we think it's been down there?  Mr. CHIVIAN:  Well so, it's hard to say.  It's fairly diverged from surface organisms, but probably the best minimum estimate would be that isotopic studies of the water date the youngest water, meaning the last time it saw the surface, at at least three million years, possibly up to ten million years.  So, it's probably somewhere in that range.    But it's hard to really pinpoint it, because we can't\u2026  FLATOW:  Mm.  Mr. CHIVIAN:  We don't know the division rate, we don't know\u2026  FLATOW:  Mm-mm.  Mr. CHIVIAN:  It's hard to measure based on the divergence of the genome without knowing several factors.  FLATOW:  So, I guess it has no interest in evolving into moving up to the surface anymore?  Mr. CHIVIAN:  No, it doesn't really need to.  I mean, what it's really found here is - you know, there's this concept in ecology of a niche, right?  Well, this is essentially a literal niche.  I mean, it's perfectly optimized to this one spot, and so it's coming and taking it over, and it's really happy right where it is.  FLATOW:  Do you think that if you'd - that you have found this in this gold mine, it's probably in lots of other places then?  Mr. CHIVIAN:  Well, it's hard to say exactly how similar its relatives would be in other locations.  You have to sequence the entire gnome, and there's a lot of variation, even in very close organisms, and we're finding this as we sample more and more from different - like in the ocean for example.    But we - numerous very, very similar strains at one level, but if you actually go and look at the genome\u2026  FLATOW:  Mm.  Mr. CHIVIAN:  The genes that are present in it are quite different, and so their capabilities are somewhat different.  FLATOW:  Mm.  Mr. CHIVIAN:  So, that may be the case.  FLATOW:  Right.  Mr. CHIVIAN:  We may find similar organisms throughout the deep subsurface, but the exact content of the genes, the exact abilities of those organisms may be slightly different.  FLATOW:  Why is it living alone?  Is it because that's the only thing that can survive under those conditions?  Mr. CHIVIAN:  Well, it's a very interesting question.  It's not quite possible to say right now.  One possible explanation is that you would think that, well, it has these gifted genes from, you know, extreme halophilic archaea, well, why aren't we finding them there?  And one possible explanation is that, well, archaea can't form endospores.    This is an ability that's been granted to it from its gram-positive Firmicutes lineage.  So, it's possible that it's this combination of bacterial abilities and archaeal abilities\u2026  FLATOW:  Mm-mm.  Mr. CHIVIAN: That has really given it the ability to survive.  FLATOW:  Mm-hm. And it's - you gave it a very interesting name, and has an interesting derivate.  Mr. CHIVIAN:  Yes.  So the genes' name, Desulforudis, is based on the fact that it uses sulfate for its energy, and then the rudis-system morphology, the shape is a rod-like shape.  And then the audaxviator, we were inspired by Jules Verne's \"Journey to the Center of the Earth. \"  There's a message that inspires their journey, which tells them to descend, bold traveler, which in Latin is audaxviator.    This is a message given in Latin.  So descend, audaxviator, and you will attain the center of the earth.  FLATOW:  That's a very good place to end, and thank you very much, Dr. Chivian, for taking time to be with us.  Mr. CHIVIAN:  Thank you.  FLATOW:  Dylan Chivian is the bioinformatics lead at the Joint BioEnergy Institute.  That's part of the Lawrence Berkeley Lab in Berkeley, California.

Congressman Rush Holt, Democrat from New Jersey, decided - or he decried the state of federal funding of scientific research, saying we will have not lived up to our responsibility to fund fully those efforts, warnings that we were risking our status as a scientific superpower and fearing that many scientists' jobs will be lost.  And he, Holt, urged Congress not to cut back on funding for the Department of Energy and National Science Foundation. Well, that was then, and you know the story since then. Our financial markets have unraveled, our government pledged huge sums of money for an economic bailout. So, where does that leave science?  Has it gone from the frying pan back there now into the fire? Joining me now, back with us is Democrat Rush Holt, who is - who represents the 12 district of New Jersey in the House of Representatives, and in his other life, he is a plasma physicist, and he joins us from West Windsor, New Jersey, welcome to Science Friday. Representative RUSH HOLT (Democrat, New Jersey, and Plasma Physicist): Ira, it's always a pleasure to talk with you. FLATOW: It is a scarier time now for science? Representative HOLT: Well, it's a - not for science per se. FLATOW: Funding-wise. Representative HOLT: I mean - I thinks it's a carrier time for everybody. It's a tough economic situation. You know, and let me say, I hope the point that I was making last January, is not that we need to look after jobs for scientists. I mean, science should not be considered a make-work program for people in lab coats\u2026 FLATOW: Hmm. Representative HOLT: But rather the other way around, what does science mean for jobs, not what - in other words, how are we going to use science to build productivity to produce economic innovation and job growth, as well as economic growth and improved quality of life? FLATOW: Are we going to be able to do that in this financial situation the government finds itself? Representative HOLT: Well, of course, no one knows how this is going to play out. The real question is, what happens to government revenue over the next couple of years, if it it's a deep recession or depression as some people are suggesting, then government revenue will fall, and any government programs will be curtailed and certainly in the private sector, investment in research will be curtailed, and people will so to speak eat their seed corn.  But the - if there is money to spend at all, I would argue that to stimulate the economy, we should be doing things like, well, extending on employment benefits and things that actually put money in circulation. But at least as important is to invest in science, into research, so that we end up doing things that we will - with the money that we are spending. . . FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Representative HOLT: Doing things that we will want anyway, that will improve people's quality of life. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Let's talk about a few other issues if we might. In a letter to the Times, the New York Times back in July, you wrote, it is time we stop using elections as beta tests for unreliable electronic voting machines.  Despite failed attempts so far, Congress should still pass a national standard requiring that all voters can record their votes on paper, and that in every election randomly selected precincts be audited. How are we doing that in that regard? Representative HOLT: Well, of course, you, and your experts, and your listeners have talked about this a lot over the years. We are in a situation now, where roughly a third of voters next month will vote on electronic voting systems that are not only demonstrably unreliable, but really unverifiable, and that's the real problem.  There will - in any voting system, there are going to be some problems. Voters are ingenious in finding ways to do the unexpected on Election Day. You know, by circling the boxes, instead of putting X's in them, or by doing something that the machine wasn't programmed to do, if it's electronic.  What is really important, is that there be a way of verifying what the voter intended to do. And the voter has to be the one who can conduct that verification. The voter, because it's a secret ballot, is the only one who can know whether the - what's recorded reflects the voter's intention.  And the only practical way of doing that is with paper ballots that voters can inspect. And then there is something real to check if there is any question, in fact, I would call for an automatic audit, even if there is no question. Because you might find that there - that after you do the audit, that indeed there is a question.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Representative HOLT: So, about a third of Americans will be voting without the ability to actually verify that their vote is recorded properly. You know, I imagine, most of the voting will go fine, but I'm sure in a lot places around the country, there will be questions, and in many cases those questions can not be resolved, because there's no voter-verified record.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Representative HOLT: That's why I've called for paper - you know, paper record. FLATOW: Right. And especially because the - if all indications are accurate about the size of the turnout this year, there's going to be a lot of folks at the polling places. Representative HOLT: That's right. And of course, that will cause problems whatever system you use. If you have to have paper, well, that means you have to print up even more, because you're not sure how many voters you're going to have. If you're using machines, you'll have to, well, make do with the number of machines you've got. . . FLATOW: Yeah. Representative HOLT:  Because it's too late to order any more. FLATOW: Right. . Representative HOLT: And you'll have to have efficient ways to manage the lines of people, if there - you know, if there is that kind of turnout. FLATOW: We've had a couple of experts on - offering an interesting solution, saying, if you have a very long line, and if you do have a readable paper ballot that people can mark, and then it gets read by the machines, so you'll have that paper trail. They - if things get really long, they might just hand out the ballots to people waiting in line, and then they could hand them in and have them recorded as they go through. Representative HOLT: Well, that's only if you have that kind of system. But in some - you know, in some jurisdictions in fact. . . FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Representative HOLT:  In very many jurisdictions, you're not allowed to vote that way. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Representative HOLT:  So, that won't work. . . FLATOW: Yeah. Representative HOLT: You have to go into the voting booth with the electronic machine. FLATOW: Let me ask you one other question before I let you go, and that is about the FBI and the Justice Department saying that they were closing the books on the anthrax investigation, and you disagree with that. Representative HOLT: Well, I followed this closely, not only did the anthrax attacks originate in my district, as best anyone can tell, the letters that havd the spores were mailed from central New Jersey. They were sorted in a mail facility next door to my congressional district. So - and my office in Washington was one of the contaminated offices.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Representative HOLT: So, I followed it quick closely, and I'm not at all pleased with the way the investigation has been conducted. And I think it not only reflects some - well, some poor investigative procedure, but the scientific forensics have created a problem, because like so many people in the country, most of the people in the FBI aren't very good at thinking scientifically.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Representative HOLT: And so, the way that evidence was collected, and the way conclusions were drawn from the evidence, would, I think, give most of your listeners pause.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Representative HOLT: And so I've called for a commission to look at this, kind of like the 9/11 commission, probably not on that scale, but to look at the actual occurrences, and also to make recommendations on what we should be doing to protect Americans from bioterrorism, to detect, to - and to investigate, and to prosecute, and so forth, as might be appropriated in the future. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Congressman Holt, I want to thank you for taking time to be with us. Representative HOLT: Always good to be with you. Thanks, Ira. FLATOW: Good. You're welcome.

I'm Joe Palca.  A brief program note, they live in both real and virtual worlds.  They post their new baby's pics on Facebook.  They blog, vlog, and chronicle their daily lives digitally.  They are generation net.  Join Neal Conan and Don Tapscott on his new book \"Growing Up Digital. \"  Next Talk of the Nation from NPR News.   But for now, we're talking about science and beauty.  In 1609, Galileo built a new optical device, a tube with lenses.  His telescope was pretty weak compared to the ones we used to gaze at the heavens today.  But he turned it on the moon and was startled to see its lumpy, cratered surface.  Far different from the smooth and perfect sphere famous scholars and philosophers had described.  Soon afterwards, he turned his telescope toward Jupiter and discovered four moons orbiting the giant planet.  He made dozens of drawings in his observations, and published them in 1610 in a book called \"The Starry Messenger. \"   You can take a look at one of these original volumes of Galileo's observations, and even peer through a replica of this telescope at a new exhibition called \"Beautiful Science: Ideas That Changed the World. \"  It opens this weekend at California's Huntington Library.  That's in Pasadena.  And it highlights the ark of scientific research through the centuries.  My next guest has spent several years delving into these beautiful stories of science from Galileo's time to today.  Let me introduce him now.  Daniel Lewis is the Dibner Senior Curator of History of Science and Technology at the Huntington Library in San Marino, which is right next to Pasadena, California.  He joins us from the studios of KPCC in Pasadena.  Dan Lewis, welcome to the program. Mr. DANIEL LEWIS (Dibner Senior Curator, Huntington Library):  Thanks Joe.  Happy Halloween. PALCA:  Thank you.  I wonder if they're out in force in Pasadena now.  But we'll talk about that later.  Let's start by asking the question - this notion, beautiful science, what are you trying to capture in this exhibition? Mr. LEWIS:  Well, one of the things that this does is sort of crook a seductive finger towards and unwilling public because talking about science and talking about history has a potential to be a doubly eye-glaze over topic for a visiting public.  And I know that science is beautiful and muscular and delicate.  And it's beautiful in different ways.  And so to talk about beauty is to talk about a number of specific things, but it's also a chance to talk about different kinds of beauty, because there's certainly not one certain stripe of beauty and at times, it's like a delicate cloth.  At times, it's a very robust, burly sort of thing.  And some of this works in the exhibit - I assembled this over the last couple of years.  If you look at them visually, they're really spectacularly uninteresting in text or form.  And I'm trying to break away from library exhibit.   It's at least where you find yourself staring into a case, looking at something like Charles Darwin's origin of species, which is 502 pages long and has about a single illustration in all that text and there's a chart in the illustrations.  So, there's a beautiful idea behind that relatively uninteresting visual object that is of vital and giant importance.  Other works are really spectacular visually.  They range from the beautiful and gory in the medical domain, to the first illustrations of the moon and modification by Galileo, as you mentioned.  So, it spans a wide spectrum. PALCA:  It's - as you know, I've seen some of the pieces in the exhibit and they are mesmerizing.  I'd like to ask our listeners if they would like to join the conversation, please give us a call.  The number is 800-989-8255.  That's 800-989-TALK.  I guess I should say this exhibit is going to be around for a while, so it's not like you have to run out and see it tomorrow. Mr. LEWIS:  It's a permanent exhibit.  And permanent exhibits are challenging for all institutions whether it's a museum or a library.  That's because light is the enemy of artwork and paper and ink.  And so we actually have conservators come in to do a page change anywhere from 12 weeks to six months for a work.  So there's a lot of activity, making sure that things aren't damaged by the materials.  And just as scientists are stewards of historical ideas over the centuries, curators in libraries are also - stewards of material that really is just passing through their hands that they really hope will be preserved for future generations. So there's a really long term stewardship notion, the physical protection of the material in library exhibits. PALCA:  So, we've talk some about the Galileo \"Starry Messenger. \"  What are some of the other greatest hits of the kinds of volumes and pictures that they'll be able to see in the exhibit? Mr. LEWIS:  Well, we have so many things, Joe.  We've got Isaac Newton. . . PALCA:  We've only got about 15 more minutes, so. . . Mr. LEWIS:  This is my challenge.  Exhibits always take of a tiny fraction of a percent of library's holdings, library exhibits doing so.  It's challenging to find things that tell a story and are high spots as well.  But we've got Newton - Isaac Newton's own copy of the Principia Mathematica - his great work on the structure of the Laws of the Universe.  And it has annotations in his own hand - it's not the only copy, and Newton had other copies annotated more extensively but we certainly have that one. We got - we've also got Newton's own copy of the \"Optics,\" which was his great work on optics, and another section of the gallery which is in four parts - astronomy, natural history, medicine, and then light and optics.   We've got stars, super stars in every one of the sections.  We've got Robert Hook's \"Micrographia\" in the Natural History Section, accompanied by  a facsimile of a microscope where you can look at a flea, (unintelligible) irritants, it's the flea that Hook drew and that is represented there.  And I've been trying to find the 17th century flea to show on the slide for this microscope to go with the 17th century illustrations on the book.  So there's Robert Hook, there are a whole bevy of beautiful medical works.  Robert Hunter's book on the \"Gravity of Uterus. \"  A state of the body and pregnancy.   A fabulous book by a Frenchman name Gaultier Dagoti(ph) with his beautiful mezzotinths from the 18th century in color, very, very rare and very labor-intensive process.  So these works span a bunch of different types of artistry as well as a bunch of different topics and different ideas that worked their way along through this notion of beautiful science. PALCA: OK. Let's take another call now - take a call now and go to Andrew in Philadelphia.  Andrew, welcome to Science Friday.   ANDREW (Caller): Hi, I love the show.  I just wanted to make the observation that I've lately fallen in love with astrolabes, the Islamic ones in particular from I think the 12th century.  I saw some of them in the Smithsonian, and I've seen some photographs in books, and I think there - you know, it's just spectacular artistically.  PALCA: OK.  That's interesting.  And Dan Louise, are you familiar with these Islamic works? Mr. LEWIS:  Astrolabes are wonderful, and they stem out of an Islamic tradition. And one of the things that came along with this collection that evolved into this exhibit is something called the Burndy library which was based at MIT for many years.  And in the Burndy library was a series of objects that are based on astronomical observation - either for direct observation or as didactic teaching tools.  So along with astrolabes - I don't have any astrolabes in the exhibit because they're often big, not always and there were very few in the Burndy collection.  But I've got spectacular sundials which date back to the 16th century, and I've got - what's called an armillary sphere which - the one we have is the one that's been in the Huntington's collections for many decades, that dates to about 1550.   And their bands of strips of wood that serve as a model for rotating heavens around in this case, the Earth which proved to be incorrect because the heavens don't rotate around the earth.  But it's the way - they're really beautiful visually and they let you perform operations and move things around.  But astronomers also used really big instruments, so Tycho Brahe, the Swedish astronomer based on the Island of Havine, had these gigantic tools he used for naked eye astronomy, something called the Mural Quadrant.  We've got a great big work on Atlas by Yohann Blaw(ph) showing one of these Mural Quadrants of Tycho Brahe's. And so the tools of astronomy were really spectacular, one of the greatest works in the history of astronomy is something called the astronomical (unintelligible) by Petro Sapianis(ph) printed in 1540 in Ingolstadt.   And it - and Owen Gingrich(ph), who is a well-known historian of science and an astronomer at Harvard, has called this the most beautiful scientific book ever printed.  And I'm not - that's a hard superlative to use in a field rich with goodies.  But it really is spectacular and it makes use of these rotating paper disks or volvels to perform astronomical calculations.  They were very accurate, within perhaps a minute of arc in some cases.  And it's lavishly printed and lavishly colored, and done as a homage to a king.  And it's not often, if ever seen on exhibit.  So that's open in the astronomy section of the exhibit.  PALCA:  We're talking with Daniel Lewis about his new exhibit or the new exhibit.  But I guess you can call it his at the Huntington Library that shows science or beautiful science. Our number is 800-989-8255, that's 800-989-TALK.  And let's go now to James in Cincinnati, Ohio.  James, welcome to the program. JAMES (Caller): Hi, thanks for taking my call.  I was wondering whether this exhibit included maybe the ancient - like Incan and Mayan stuff, or what they were able to predict the movement of the stars and the moving stuff with the great precision and all the artifacts from that.  And also, from Egypt and those types of areas like before common era.   PALCA:  OK.  Interesting.   JAMES:  (Unintelligible). I'll take my answer off. . . PALCA:  OK.  Great.  Thanks James.  Yeah. Daniel Lewis. JAMES:  Bye-bye. PALCA:  Pre-historic.   Mr. LEWIS:  That's a field called archeoastronomy and it's widely represented and talked about.  Exhibits always emerge out of the contents of an institutions collections and so, a lot of this archeoastronomy isn't stuff that is easily collectible in paper forms.  So if it is on a gigantic piece of stone, sitting in a Mayan village, it's hard to work into the exhibit.  There's a bit of that.  This exhibit tends to privileged Anglo-American astronomy and to some degree Islamic astronomy, which is another grand traditional source of astronomical discovery and knowledge.   So, a lot of the archeoastronomy doesn't show up in this exhibit.  It's not placed well as a material type for an exhibit.  It's hard to show.  As I said some of these really gigantic things - if I had more space I could have expanded it into a newer, into a more really, really comprehensive set of things.  So this has a particular focus that doesn't include the archeoastronomy details.  PALCA:  OK.  Interesting.  Let's take another call now from Mary in Louisville, Kentucky.  Mary, welcome to Science Friday. MARY (Caller):  Thank you for taking my call. I really enjoyed the program.  I'd like to ask if you have had a particular focus on how woman have contributed to science. I know that probably there's a publication bias in the ancient times towards that.  But I'm just curious if you had noticed that at all or if you tried to find manuscripts or lectures.  PALCA:  Interesting. MARY:  I'm embarrassed and I'll take my answer off the air. PALCA:  OK.  Thank you, Mary.  Dan Lewis, women. Mr. LEWIS:  There's a great tradition of women in the history of science and every domain.  And even though it tended to be men, as a rule working in science, women made many vitally important discoveries and observations, and I've got a number of works in there that will speak to that.  A woman named Maria (unintelligible) did a spectacular volume on the insects of Suriname that I've got up in the exhibit, in digital form as well, so you can turn the pages of the spectacular work - a very brave pioneer who went to Suriname with her daughter and collected and drew for quite some time these insects and plants of Suriname.   Annie Jump Canon, a twentieth century astronomer at Mount Wilson, who classified stars by the tens of thousands, writes a great letter about how she hates to go on vacation because she's leaving behind her star catalogue and wishes she could keep working on it.  Caroline Herschel, one of the great Herschel family of astronomers, has observation work that's mentioned and covered in the show.  There's also a thing that - there's also a section in the medicine subsection on child birth which is a particular strength of a Hichens(ph) collections, but is also obviously a female topic and midwives for many centuries were the ones who facilitated birth and knew the most about the birthing process.   We have a really, really rare ivory model of an - it's an obstetrics model from about 1550 with removable parts, so this ivory model has a woman laying there and you can remove the belly and then remove the (unintelligible), kind of work your way down to the little fetus inside as a teaching tool.  So. . . PALCA:  Oh, very interesting. Mr. LEWIS:  So, the childbirth section is something that speaks to women's issues. PALCA:  Excellent. Excellent.  We're talking with Dan Lewis about a new exhibit at the Huntington Library.  I'm Joe Palca, and this is Talk of the Nation from NPR News.  And let's take another call now, this time we'll go to Paul in Portland, Oregon.  Paul, welcome to Science Friday. PAUL (Caller):  Yes, I'm just curious as to whether you know about Adam Elsheimer's \"Painting of the Night Sky? \"  Was done in Rome in 1609 and it includes the details of Galileo's sky.  I always thought how did - they must have known each other through the extremely detailed and slow painter and I happen to have a print that was done in 1611 of this painting, and it just seems extraordinary. I've never found any actual historical connection between the two, but they had to know each other. PALCA:  Well, possibly, but you say Elsheimer is the name? PAUL:  Yes, Adam Elsheimer. PALCA:  OK, Dan Lewis. Mr. LEWIS:  I must confess, I haven't heard of Adam Elsheimer.  There - the telescope came along in about 1608 and was patented simultaneously by three different people.  So, Galileo wasn't the first to use the telescope certainly and he was the first to produce a printed work, but I have not heard of this (unintelligible) I'd be really curious to hear more about that.  That's an interesting find. PALCA:  All right.  Well. . . PAUL:  He's the - the painting itself is in a museum in Germany, and I've been fascinated by it for a long time because I just think they had to know each other because it's an amazing - the first truly amazing painting of the night sky, a very detailed, and very accurate. PALCA:  Paul, thanks very much for that.  You know, it doesn't surprise me actually that artists unconnected specifically with science have been drawn into science because when we were looking into flooding issues in Venice for example, in Italy, some of the famous paintings from the Venetian school showed buildings that are still around today, and you can see where the water line was, so you get some information from the painting that way. Mr. LEWIS:  There are all sorts of clues, individual records about many different things.  One - speaking of evidence in books and manuscripts, one of the things that is that Isaac Newton did with his own books is he would actually dog ear the pages of the book to point to a particular passage.   So, if there was a paragraph in there he wanted to highlight, he'd dog ear the page up from the corner or down from the corner, so it pointed to it and that's behavior we don't usually prohibit - don't allow in our reading room and so I'm going to have to have this books in the Burndy library that go out with dog ears, but there are really direct physical evidence sort of thing like the water line, you know the painting shows, you know how - there's a life to these things, and it's one of the things I love about all books and manuscripts is that there's a life to them, they have stains and fingerprints and marginalia are written in the margins of books.  And the subtitle of this exhibit is 'It's Beautiful Science Ideas that change the World,' and that's my stand in for saying history, which is a word there is nowhere in the exhibit because of the fact that these things are a continuum over a long period of time, from the distant past up to the present and then on into the future. PALCA:  All right. Well, we have to leave it there, Dan.  Thanks for that lovely thought, Dan.  Dan Lewis is the Dibner Senior curator of History of Science and Technology at the Huntington Library in San Marino.  Thanks for joining us today. Mr. LEWIS:  My pleasure.  Thank you. PALCA:  And thanks to all of you for joining me  today.    JOE PALCA, host:  From NPR News, this is Talk of the Nation, Science Friday.  I'm Joe Palca.  A brief program note, they live in both real and virtual worlds.  They post their new baby's pics on Facebook.  They blog, vlog, and chronicle their daily lives digitally.  They are generation net.  Join Neal Conan and Don Tapscott on his new book \"Growing Up Digital. \"  Next Talk of the Nation from NPR News.    But for now, we're talking about science and beauty.  In 1609, Galileo built a new optical device, a tube with lenses.  His telescope was pretty weak compared to the ones we used to gaze at the heavens today.  But he turned it on the moon and was startled to see its lumpy, cratered surface.  Far different from the smooth and perfect sphere famous scholars and philosophers had described.  Soon afterwards, he turned his telescope toward Jupiter and discovered four moons orbiting the giant planet.  He made dozens of drawings in his observations, and published them in 1610 in a book called \"The Starry Messenger. \"    You can take a look at one of these original volumes of Galileo's observations, and even peer through a replica of this telescope at a new exhibition called \"Beautiful Science: Ideas That Changed the World. \"  It opens this weekend at California's Huntington Library.  That's in Pasadena.  And it highlights the ark of scientific research through the centuries.  My next guest has spent several years delving into these beautiful stories of science from Galileo's time to today.  Let me introduce him now.  Daniel Lewis is the Dibner Senior Curator of History of Science and Technology at the Huntington Library in San Marino, which is right next to Pasadena, California.  He joins us from the studios of KPCC in Pasadena.  Dan Lewis, welcome to the program.  Mr. DANIEL LEWIS (Dibner Senior Curator, Huntington Library):  Thanks Joe.  Happy Halloween.  PALCA:  Thank you.  I wonder if they're out in force in Pasadena now.  But we'll talk about that later.  Let's start by asking the question - this notion, beautiful science, what are you trying to capture in this exhibition?  Mr. LEWIS:  Well, one of the things that this does is sort of crook a seductive finger towards and unwilling public because talking about science and talking about history has a potential to be a doubly eye-glaze over topic for a visiting public.  And I know that science is beautiful and muscular and delicate.  And it's beautiful in different ways.  And so to talk about beauty is to talk about a number of specific things, but it's also a chance to talk about different kinds of beauty, because there's certainly not one certain stripe of beauty and at times, it's like a delicate cloth.

It's at least where you find yourself staring into a case, looking at something like Charles Darwin's origin of species, which is 502 pages long and has about a single illustration in all that text and there's a chart in the illustrations.  So, there's a beautiful idea behind that relatively uninteresting visual object that is of vital and giant importance.  Other works are really spectacular visually.  They range from the beautiful and gory in the medical domain, to the first illustrations of the moon and modification by Galileo, as you mentioned.  So, it spans a wide spectrum.  PALCA:  It's - as you know, I've seen some of the pieces in the exhibit and they are mesmerizing.  I'd like to ask our listeners if they would like to join the conversation, please give us a call.  The number is 800-989-8255.  That's 800-989-TALK.  I guess I should say this exhibit is going to be around for a while, so it's not like you have to run out and see it tomorrow.  Mr. LEWIS:  It's a permanent exhibit.  And permanent exhibits are challenging for all institutions whether it's a museum or a library.  That's because light is the enemy of artwork and paper and ink.  And so we actually have conservators come in to do a page change anywhere from 12 weeks to six months for a work.  So there's a lot of activity, making sure that things aren't damaged by the materials.  And just as scientists are stewards of historical ideas over the centuries, curators in libraries are also - stewards of material that really is just passing through their hands that they really hope will be preserved for future generations.

The election is only a few days away and while most of us of course are focused on the race for President, voters in Michigan will have an added decision to make.  On the ballot there's something called Proposal 2.   General speaking, a yes vote on Proposal 2 would broaden the ability of scientists in Michigan to work with human embryonic stem cells.  Those in opposition to the proposal say the current limits on the research should remain in place.  Michigan is the only state this election to have a stem cell research initiative on the ballot, but that hasn't kept the issue out of the presidential race.   Both senators McCain and Obama have run ads about the research, ads that some say are a little misleading.  Joining me now to talk more about embryonic-stem-cell research in the upcoming election are my two guests.   First, in the studio here we have Julie Rovner, she's my colleague on the Science desk at NPR. She's the health correspondent and the author of a new book \"Health Care Policy and Politics A to Z. \" JULIE ROVNER:  Hi, Joe. PALCA:  Hi, Julie.  Also with us is Sean Morrison, he's director of the University of Michigan Center for Stem Cell Biology and an investigator for the Howard Hughes Medical Institution.  He joins us by phone from Ann Arbor, Michigan.  Thanks for talking with us today, Sean. Dr. SEAN MORRISON (Director, Center for Stem Cell Biology, University of Michigan; Investigator, Howard Hughes Medical Institute):  Hey, Joe. PALCA:  So we only have a minute or so before we have to go to a break, Sean, but let's start with you, and tell us just a little bit about what Proposal 2 is supposed to do? Dr. MORRISON:  Proposal 2 would loosen Michigan's restriction on embryonic-stem-cell research by bringing Michigan law in line with federal law.  Currently in Michigan, it's illegal to destroy a human embryo for research, which may sound like a good idea to people, but the reason why almost nobody outside of Michigan has laws like that, is that doesn't make sense.  Because the embryos that would be used for this research are already being thrown away by fertility clinics.  There are thousands of embryos that are routinely discarded by fertility clinics across the country, and for a variety of reasons those embryos could never be used for fertility treatment, but they could be used for stem-cell research that patients across the country consider their best hope. PALCA:  Right.  And the ideas you use these discarded or embryos that are no longer needed for fertility treatments, to extract the embryonic stem cells that scientists like you want to study? Dr. MORRISON:  Yeah, exactly.  So Proposal 2 would actually entrench in the Michigan constitution a number of restrictions on stem-cell research, like you couldn't buy or sell embryos, the embryos would have to have been created for fertility treatment.   But either surplus to the clinical need or unsuitable for clinical use, such that the embryos would otherwise be discarded, if not donated with informed consent for research. PALCA:  I got it.  OK.  Well, as I said, we have to take a short break, but when we come back, we'll talk about the situation in Michigan and the situation with the rest of the country with regard to stem-cell research.  Please stay with us. This is Talk of the Nation from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) PALCA:  From NPR News this is Talk of the Nation: Science Friday. I'm Joe Palca.  We're talking this hour about embryonic-stem-cell research and the elections.  My guests are Julie Rovner, she's a health correspondent for National Public Radio, and Sean Morrison, he's a stem-cell researcher at the University of Michigan.   And Sean Morrison was just explaining that Proposition 2 would relax some of the restrictions currently on the books in Michigan about destroying an embryo, because that's what you have to do to obtain embryonic stem cells, and of course many embryos - human embryos are destroyed anyway in fertility clinics when the couples who've created them for fertility purposes don't want them anymore.   So, that's the nut of the decision, but - before I start with - before we get on the national scene, I want to stay with you, Sean Morrison, for one second and say, you can still do embryonic-stem-cell research in Michigan, right? Dr. MORRISON:  That's right.  We can import lines that are created in other parts of the country or other parts of the world, and we do research on those lines.  But the difficulty is that for many of the lines that scientists would like to be able to use to study various diseases right now, many of the lines don't exist.  And often times even when lines do exist in another part of the world, and the people that made the lines are willing to share them, it's still often impossible to get the lines, because this research is obviously and appropriately very highly regulated.   There's probably no form of medical research that is as highly regulated, and to do any kind of embryonic-stem-cell research, the providence of the lines has to be proven that the lines were ethically conducted.  And unless you can affirmatively prove that lines created in another part of the world were obtained with appropriate informed consent and ethically derived, then nobody in Michigan or in other U. S. universities wouldn't be able to study them.  And that process is often very onerous to provide the paperwork, you know, the documentation from the laboratories that derive the lines in, many labs just aren't in a position to be able to share that level of paperwork with labs in other places. PALCA:  All right.  I think, I may have misspoken at the top of the hour.  This is a proposal to change the law, not a change in the law yet.  Any sense of where the polls are saying whether this will pass or not? Dr. MORRISON:  Well, all the polls have the yes side ahead, but different - some polls put it extraordinarily close, some polls had the yes side leading by a little bit more.  I think, all we know at this stage is that it will be close on Tuesday, and it could go either way. PALCA:  OK.  Now let's turn to the national story and where - and Julie Rovner, where this comes in to a national issue is even if Michigan changes its law, you still wouldn't be able to get federal funds to make the embryonic-stem-cell lines.  But an interesting thing is I don't believe either presidential candidate is suggesting that federal funds be used to derive embryonic stem cells which - and this is a fine point - they're both suggesting it might be OK to use federal funds to do research on cells that somebody else derived. ROVNER:  That's right, and you know, it's interesting given the fact that both candidates have ostensibly the same position on embryonic-stem-cell research.  We've certainly seen a lot of debate on this issue since - really since the campaign - the general election campaign started in earnest around Labor Day. We've seen dueling ads if you will, we have - here's one ad that Senator McCain was running during the fall. (Soundbite of Senator McCain's campaign ad) Unidentified Woman:  John McCain will lead his Congressional allies to improve America's health.  Stem cell research, to unlock the mystery of cancer, diabetes, heart disease. Stem cell research, to help free families from the fear and devastation of illness.  Stem cell research, to help doctors repair spinal cord damage, knee injuries, serious burns.  Stem cell research, to help stroke. . . PALCA:  So what's wrong with that? Stem cell research, stem cell research, stem cell research? ROVNER:  Well, now, John McCain it should be said is - has a nearly 100 percent pro-life voting record.  He's been anti-abortion down the line, but embryonic-stem-cell research is the one place where he has broken with the anti-abortion community. He has voted in favor of a bill to relax President Bush's restrictions on funding of federal-embryonic-stem-cell research. However, the Republican platform is against embryonic-stem-cell research, so this ad which goes on about stem cell research, stem cell research, stem cell research didn't say what kind of stem cell research.   So it could be adult-stem-cell research, which is not controversial, or stem-cell research using umbilical cord blood, also not controversial, it was very carefully tailored to not say embryonic-stem-cell research for which it was rather roundly criticized.  Again, on Senator McCain's website there was a statement that talked about stem-cell research needs to go forward in an ethical manner.  It was written in such a way that it really could describe what President Bush's position has been.   PALCA: So. . . ROVNER:  It took me until last week to pry out of Senator McCain's aides the fact that yes, if he was elected, he would actually sign the bill that he voted for as senator. PALCA:  So, this is one these things - these topics that's extremely hard to parse, and I should say if you want to join us in this conversation, please give us a call, the number is 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK.  One question I'll be interested - what our callers have to say is whether this is an issue for them in the election.   I mean, does it make that much of a difference?  But I guess we have also heard of Mr. Obama has tried to have it a little bit both ways in this issue too. ROVNER:  Yes.  Senator Obama started running his own radio ad after Senator McCain was running the stem-cell ad.  And I think we have a piece of that ad. (Soundbite of Senator Obama's campaign ad) Unidentified Woman: Stem cell research could unlock cures for diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer's too.  But John McCain has stood in the way.  He's opposed stem-cell research.  Picked a running mate who's against it, and he's earning on a platform even more extreme than George Bush's on this vital research. PALCA:  So, conveniently neglecting to mention that Senator McCain voted in favor of embryonic-stem-cell research when he was in the - as a senator where he is now. ROVNER:  Yes, side-by-side with Senator Obama.  They voted exactly the same way on that embryonic stem-cell research.  Now, of course the last two pieces of the ad were true about Senator Palin and about the Republican.   I mean, Governor Palin and the Republican platform, but the first part about Senator McCain's standing in the way of embryonic - of stem-cell research is demonstrably false, and Senator Obama has been roundly criticized by various fact-checking organizations for running that ad. PALCA:  OK.  Well, let's take a call now and go to Nanette(ph) in Royal Oak, Michigan.  Nanette, welcome to the program. NANETTE (Caller):  Thank you.  I live in Michigan as you mentioned. PALCA:  Mm-hmm. NANETTE:  We're going to be voting on the constitutional amendment to allow stem-cell research, and first I have to say I am very much in favor of stem-cell research.  I think it's very, very important. I think there's a lot of good that's going to come from it.  I also have to say it bothers me tremendously that we are looking to amend our state constitution to do this.  Now, am I correct that Michigan is the only state that is amending or has it will amend - has will - past, present, future tense. . . PALCA:  Mm-hmm. NANETTE:  The state constitution for this and all other states have passed sufficient laws? PALCA:  You know, I don't know.  Sean Morrison, do you know the answer to that question? Dr. MORRISON:  Yeah.  That's not correct.  Other states have amended their constitutions to allow stem-cell research, most notably, including Missouri and California amended their constitutions to allow more far-reaching protection over stem-cell research than the State of Michigan. In that they have protected not only the derivation of new-stem-cell lines, but also therapeutic cloning which is illegal in Michigan, and would remain illegal in Michigan if people vote for Proposal 2.   Because the other important point here is that the reason why it's necessary in the State of Michigan to look for a constitutional amendment, rather than just to change in the law is that the same groups that are behind the no campaign on Proposal 2, opposed repeated attempts to change the law in the state legislature to bring Michigan law in line with the laws of other states. And so, the proponents to the proposal are really left with no choice, but to try to amend the state constitution. PALCA:  Nanette, I'd like to ask you a question.  So, when you say you're in favor of stem-cell research, does that include embryonic-stem-cell research? NANETTE:  Yes. PALXCA:  OK.  Good.  And is it going to affect the way you vote for President one way or the other?  I don't mean to put you on the spot there if you don't want to answer, it's OK. (Soundbite of laughter) PALCA:  I know, you usually think you ask the questions.  But now I'm just asking the. . . NANETTE:  That's OK.  I've already decided who I'm going to vote for, for president, but you know, this - I've been putting my own ballot together, it's just what I do before the election, it makes life simpler on Election Day.  And I got - really got hung up on this one. PALCA:  OK.  Well, I hope we were able to help unhang(ph) you just a bit today. ROVNER:  Yeah.  You've given me a couple of things to look at too.  Thank you. PALCA:  OK.  Thanks very much.  Let's take another call now and go to Steve in - is it Erie, Colorado? STEVE (Caller):  Yeah. PALCA:  Steve, welcome to the program. STEVE:  Thank you.  We in Colorado currently are facing an amendment that's - it's kind of titled the Persons Amendment, although it doesn't specifically mention stem-cell research, the concept behind it is that personhood occurs immediately upon fertilization of an egg.  And I'm been curious to hear your comments about what that might - how that might impact, you know. PALCA:  OK.  Steve, that's interesting. STEVE:  I'll take that off the air. PALCA:  Sure, Julie is nodding her head, I can see in the studio.  So how is that amendment, do you think how - I guess it would make - certainly destroying a person is considered illegal in this country, so. . . ROVNER:  Yes.  I think in my looking over what the implications of that would be, which certainly seem to make embryonic-stem-cell research illegal, because it would seem to make in vitro fertilization illegal.   PALCA: Yeah. ROVNER:  So one would - you would not be able to have the precursor to get to the embryos to get to the embryonic-stem-cell research. PALCA:  Right.  I - someone was spinning out.  There seem to be some interesting legal issues that you could spin out from that, like can you sue an embryo in that case, or can an embryo bring a lawsuit? STEVE:  And what about the 400,000 embryos that are currently frozen down in fertility clinics across the country?  You know, if we were to consider them all people, who's going to have to implant all those embryos? ROVNER:  Well, that's - yes, there's lots of fascinating legal questions. PALCA:  And census issues I think. ROVNER:  Yes. PALCA:  All right.  Well, perhaps we shouldn't go too far down that path right now, because it sounds a little bit like jumping through the looking glass.  OK.  Let's go next to Eric in Orangeburg, South Carolina.  Eric, welcome to Science Friday. ERIC (Caller):  Hi, Ira. PALCA:  Well, I'm Joe, but that's close enough.  Go ahead. ERIC:  OK.  I would like to know if it wasn't for the Bush's conservative policies on this, where would we be in the science of stem-cell research.  Will we be near or close to - since it was eight years, if we still were under the Clinton years, legally under it, will we be close, will we - how will we progress fast? How far will we be into the science? PALCA:  Eric, that's a great question.  And Sean Morrison has been doing this research, and I expect he has - well, take a stab at the answer there.  Sean? Dr. MORRISON:  It's always hard to say where we would've been, because it's always risky to try to predict into the future and know exactly on how things could be different.  But anytime you impose restrictions on a form of research that is internationally agreed upon to be one of the most promising areas of medical research, and you say to certain groups of scientist that they can't pursue certain promising avenues of discovery, then you slow down the process of medical research, and you slow the process towards new cures.   And so it's really important at this stage that we have policies that reflect the reality in this science, and that allow scientists to go forward in the war against disease, using all the weapons at their disposal. PALCA:  We're talking with Sean Morrison, he's a researcher at the University of Michigan and Julie Rovner, who's my colleague on the science desk about the role of embryonic-stem-cell research, both in the national election and in the election that is going to take place in Michigan over - on a ballot proposal.   I'm Joe Palca, and this is Talk of the Nation from NPR News.  And let's take a - well, let me ask you Julie, have - or maybe Sean, both of you.  This issue - this embryonic-stem-cell-research issue was pretty hot, I would say, about a year ago, and it seems to me that some of the air was taken - or wind was taken out of it sails when first the Japanese scientists and then scientists in this country showed that you could make embryonic stem cells without destroying an embryo.   And a lot of scientists are very excited - not exactly embryonic stem cells, but stem cells that do all the things that embryonic stem cells do, without destroying an embryo.  Julie, do you sense that that's changed the political landscape at all? ROVNER:  I think it did for a while, the idea that you can have pluripotent stem cells that you don't necessarily have to destroy an embryo to take.  And certainly John McCain has been talking about that.   And you know, there's hopes that we won't need to worry about this, you know, morally questionable avenue of research perhaps after a few years.  But I think, you know, there are concerns even though these candidates, as we say, ostensibly have the same position on embryonic-stem-cell research.   There are concerns on among - certainly among Democrats about Senator McCain for instance.  They say that Senator Obama has said that as soon - if he becomes President, as soon as he takes office, he will lift President Bush's executive order.  That he would simply change the Federal Government's policy on restricting research, the day he becomes President, where Senator McCain might wait until Congress were to pass a bill.   That would be a different - that Senator Obama would devote perhaps more money to research on not just embryonic-stem-cell research, but the type of - other types of research you're talking about where Senator McCain has talked about cutting the budget.  So that there may be other differences beyond simply, you know, the position on this specific type of research. PALCA:  So Sean Morrison, let me ask you.  Is it worth the political capital that you have to spend to convince people to support embryonic-stem-cell research when it's clearly somewhat controversial, and simply go ahead and study these new cells that seemed to be able to do all the same things? Dr. MORRISON:  It's absolutely worth it.  What you have to bear in mind is that the very discovery - this exciting discovery that you can reprogram adult human cells to have properties similar to embryonic stem cells.   That discovery would never have occurred without embryonic-stem-cell research.  And so the people that are arguing that we should stop embryonic-stem-cell research and focus on these reprogrammed cells - who knows what additional future discoveries could come from embryonic-stem-cell research that we would foreclose if we just closed off that avenue of discovery now.  So rather than representing an alternative, iPS cells simply demonstrate the power of. . . PALCA:  Those are the - these iPS are the new cells that (unintelligible). Dr. MORRISON:  Yeah, sorry.  The reprogrammed cells demonstrate the power of research in this area.  It's also important to remember that right now, the techniques that are required so far to reprogram adult, human cells involve techniques that predispose the cell's turning into cancer.   And so as of now, none of the reprogrammed lines that have been made could ever be used in patients.  So what - the one thing that I think all stem-cell biologists agree on is the need for the research to go forward with all types of stem cells.  So that no matter where the cures come from, we can get to them sooner, rather than later. PALCA:  So, just in closing here, Sean Morrison.  I mean, you've been doing this for, well, for almost a decade now.  How confident are you at this point that there really will be therapies to come out of this field? Dr. MORRISON:  I'm confident that there will be therapies that will come.  I just - we just don't know exactly where they'll come from, you know.  There are many different ways in which embryonic-stem-cell research and pluripotent-stem-cell research could lead to new treatments.   Either new cell therapies for diseases like Parkinson's Disease or Juvenile Diabetes.  Or a better understanding of inherited human diseases from studying embryonic-stem-cell lines that carry the exact genetic defects that cause disease in patients, or from improving the drug-discovery process by screening for safer and more effective new drugs on cells that derive from embryonic stem cells in laboratory dishes, and there's just. . . PALCA:  Sean. Sean, I got to cut you off there because we've run out of time.  That was Sean Morrison, he's the director of the University of Michigan Center for Stem Cell Biology.  And I - we were also talking this segment with Julie Rovner, she's my colleague on the science desk at NPR.  When we come back, we'll be talking about the planet Mercury.  So stay with us. This is Talk of the Nation from NPR News.  JOE PALCA, host:  Up next, embryonic stem cell research and the battle at the polls.

ROVNER:  Yes, side-by-side with Senator Obama.  They voted exactly the same way on that embryonic stem-cell research.  Now, of course the last two pieces of the ad were true about Senator Palin and about the Republican.    I mean, Governor Palin and the Republican platform, but the first part about Senator McCain's standing in the way of embryonic - of stem-cell research is demonstrably false, and Senator Obama has been roundly criticized by various fact-checking organizations for running that ad.  PALCA:  OK.  Well, let's take a call now and go to Nanette(ph) in Royal Oak, Michigan.  Nanette, welcome to the program.  NANETTE (Caller):  Thank you.  I live in Michigan as you mentioned.  PALCA:  Mm-hmm.  NANETTE:  We're going to be voting on the constitutional amendment to allow stem-cell research, and first I have to say I am very much in favor of stem-cell research.  I think it's very, very important. I think there's a lot of good that's going to come from it.  I also have to say it bothers me tremendously that we are looking to amend our state constitution to do this.  Now, am I correct that Michigan is the only state that is amending or has it will amend - has will - past, present, future tense. . .  PALCA:  Mm-hmm.  NANETTE:  The state constitution for this and all other states have passed sufficient laws?  PALCA:  You know, I don't know.  Sean Morrison, do you know the answer to that question?  Dr. MORRISON:  Yeah.  That's not correct.  Other states have amended their constitutions to allow stem-cell research, most notably, including Missouri and California amended their constitutions to allow more far-reaching protection over stem-cell research than the State of Michigan. In that they have protected not only the derivation of new-stem-cell lines, but also therapeutic cloning which is illegal in Michigan, and would remain illegal in Michigan if people vote for Proposal 2.    Because the other important point here is that the reason why it's necessary in the State of Michigan to look for a constitutional amendment, rather than just to change in the law is that the same groups that are behind the no campaign on Proposal 2, opposed repeated attempts to change the law in the state legislature to bring Michigan law in line with the laws of other states. And so, the proponents to the proposal are really left with no choice, but to try to amend the state constitution.  PALCA:  Nanette, I'd like to ask you a question.  So, when you say you're in favor of stem-cell research, does that include embryonic-stem-cell research?  NANETTE:  Yes.  PALXCA:  OK.  Good.  And is it going to affect the way you vote for President one way or the other?  I don't mean to put you on the spot there if you don't want to answer, it's OK.  (Soundbite of laughter)  PALCA:  I know, you usually think you ask the questions.  But now I'm just asking the. . .  NANETTE:  That's OK.  I've already decided who I'm going to vote for, for president, but you know, this - I've been putting my own ballot together, it's just what I do before the election, it makes life simpler on Election Day.  And I got - really got hung up on this one.  PALCA:  OK.  Well, I hope we were able to help unhang(ph) you just a bit today.  ROVNER:  Yeah.  You've given me a couple of things to look at too.  Thank you.  PALCA:  OK.  Thanks very much.  Let's take another call now and go to Steve in - is it Erie, Colorado?  STEVE (Caller):  Yeah.  PALCA:  Steve, welcome to the program.  STEVE:  Thank you.  We in Colorado currently are facing an amendment that's - it's kind of titled the Persons Amendment, although it doesn't specifically mention stem-cell research, the concept behind it is that personhood occurs immediately upon fertilization of an egg.  And I'm been curious to hear your comments about what that might - how that might impact, you know.  PALCA:  OK.  Steve, that's interesting.  STEVE:  I'll take that off the air.  PALCA:  Sure, Julie is nodding her head, I can see in the studio.  So how is that amendment, do you think how - I guess it would make - certainly destroying a person is considered illegal in this country, so. . .  ROVNER:  Yes.  I think in my looking over what the implications of that would be, which certainly seem to make embryonic-stem-cell research illegal, because it would seem to make in vitro fertilization illegal.    PALCA: Yeah.  ROVNER:  So one would - you would not be able to have the precursor to get to the embryos to get to the embryonic-stem-cell research.  PALCA:  Right.  I - someone was spinning out.  There seem to be some interesting legal issues that you could spin out from that, like can you sue an embryo in that case, or can an embryo bring a lawsuit?  STEVE:  And what about the 400,000 embryos that are currently frozen down in fertility clinics across the country?  You know, if we were to consider them all people, who's going to have to implant all those embryos?  ROVNER:  Well, that's - yes, there's lots of fascinating legal questions.  PALCA:  And census issues I think.  ROVNER:  Yes.  PALCA:  All right.  Well, perhaps we shouldn't go too far down that path right now, because it sounds a little bit like jumping through the looking glass.  OK.  Let's go next to Eric in Orangeburg, South Carolina.  Eric, welcome to Science Friday.  ERIC (Caller):  Hi, Ira.  PALCA:  Well, I'm Joe, but that's close enough.  Go ahead.  ERIC:  OK.  I would like to know if it wasn't for the Bush's conservative policies on this, where would we be in the science of stem-cell research.  Will we be near or close to - since it was eight years, if we still were under the Clinton years, legally under it, will we be close, will we - how will we progress fast? How far will we be into the science?  PALCA:  Eric, that's a great question.  And Sean Morrison has been doing this research, and I expect he has - well, take a stab at the answer there.  Sean?  Dr. MORRISON:  It's always hard to say where we would've been, because it's always risky to try to predict into the future and know exactly on how things could be different.  But anytime you impose restrictions on a form of research that is internationally agreed upon to be one of the most promising areas of medical research, and you say to certain groups of scientist that they can't pursue certain promising avenues of discovery, then you slow down the process of medical research, and you slow the process towards new cures.    And so it's really important at this stage that we have policies that reflect the reality in this science, and that allow scientists to go forward in the war against disease, using all the weapons at their disposal.  PALCA:  We're talking with Sean Morrison, he's a researcher at the University of Michigan and Julie Rovner, who's my colleague on the science desk about the role of embryonic-stem-cell research, both in the national election and in the election that is going to take place in Michigan over - on a ballot proposal.    I'm Joe Palca, and this is Talk of the Nation from NPR News.  And let's take a - well, let me ask you Julie, have - or maybe Sean, both of you.  This issue - this embryonic-stem-cell-research issue was pretty hot, I would say, about a year ago, and it seems to me that some of the air was taken - or wind was taken out of it sails when first the Japanese scientists and then scientists in this country showed that you could make embryonic stem cells without destroying an embryo.    And a lot of scientists are very excited - not exactly embryonic stem cells, but stem cells that do all the things that embryonic stem cells do, without destroying an embryo.  Julie, do you sense that that's changed the political landscape at all?  ROVNER:  I think it did for a while, the idea that you can have pluripotent stem cells that you don't necessarily have to destroy an embryo to take.  And certainly John McCain has been talking about that.    And you know, there's hopes that we won't need to worry about this, you know, morally questionable avenue of research perhaps after a few years.  But I think, you know, there are concerns even though these candidates, as we say, ostensibly have the same position on embryonic-stem-cell research.    There are concerns on among - certainly among Democrats about Senator McCain for instance.  They say that Senator Obama has said that as soon - if he becomes President, as soon as he takes office, he will lift President Bush's executive order.  That he would simply change the Federal Government's policy on restricting research, the day he becomes President, where Senator McCain might wait until Congress were to pass a bill.    That would be a different - that Senator Obama would devote perhaps more money to research on not just embryonic-stem-cell research, but the type of - other types of research you're talking about where Senator McCain has talked about cutting the budget.  So that there may be other differences beyond simply, you know, the position on this specific type of research.  PALCA:  So Sean Morrison, let me ask you.  Is it worth the political capital that you have to spend to convince people to support embryonic-stem-cell research when it's clearly somewhat controversial, and simply go ahead and study these new cells that seemed to be able to do all the same things?  Dr. MORRISON:  It's absolutely worth it.  What you have to bear in mind is that the very discovery - this exciting discovery that you can reprogram adult human cells to have properties similar to embryonic stem cells.    That discovery would never have occurred without embryonic-stem-cell research.  And so the people that are arguing that we should stop embryonic-stem-cell research and focus on these reprogrammed cells - who knows what additional future discoveries could come from embryonic-stem-cell research that we would foreclose if we just closed off that avenue of discovery now.  So rather than representing an alternative, iPS cells simply demonstrate the power of. . .  PALCA:  Those are the - these iPS are the new cells that (unintelligible).  Dr. MORRISON:  Yeah, sorry.  The reprogrammed cells demonstrate the power of research in this area.  It's also important to remember that right now, the techniques that are required so far to reprogram adult, human cells involve techniques that predispose the cell's turning into cancer.    And so as of now, none of the reprogrammed lines that have been made could ever be used in patients.  So what - the one thing that I think all stem-cell biologists agree on is the need for the research to go forward with all types of stem cells.  So that no matter where the cures come from, we can get to them sooner, rather than later.  PALCA:  So, just in closing here, Sean Morrison.  I mean, you've been doing this for, well, for almost a decade now.  How confident are you at this point that there really will be therapies to come out of this field?  Dr. MORRISON:  I'm confident that there will be therapies that will come.  I just - we just don't know exactly where they'll come from, you know.  There are many different ways in which embryonic-stem-cell research and pluripotent-stem-cell research could lead to new treatments.    Either new cell therapies for diseases like Parkinson's Disease or Juvenile Diabetes.  Or a better understanding of inherited human diseases from studying embryonic-stem-cell lines that carry the exact genetic defects that cause disease in patients, or from improving the drug-discovery process by screening for safer and more effective new drugs on cells that derive from embryonic stem cells in laboratory dishes, and there's just. . .  PALCA:  Sean. Sean, I got to cut you off there because we've run out of time.  That was Sean Morrison, he's the director of the University of Michigan Center for Stem Cell Biology.  And I - we were also talking this segment with Julie Rovner, she's my colleague on the science desk at NPR.  When we come back, we'll be talking about the planet Mercury.  So stay with us.

I am Joe Palca.  Later in the hour, a new exhibition at the intersection of science and beauty, but first it's Halloween and we're going to talk about a creature that has fangs, drinks blood, and comes out only at night and that is the aptly-named creature, the vampire bat.  Vampire bats lived in the tropical of Central and South America.  They scour the night for unsuspecting prey like chickens and cows, slice the skin or hide of their prey with razor-sharp teeth, and gently lick the wound, collecting the draining stream of blood with their mouths.   And my next guest has raised this delicate blood-letters.  He joins me know to talk about them and other creatures that are happy to drink your blood.  Bill Schutt is the author of the new book, \"Dark Banquet:  Blood and the Curious Lives of Blood-Feeding Creatures. \"  He is also an associate professor of biology at the CW Post-College of Long Island University, and he is also a research associate in mammalogy at the American Museum of National History in New York.  He joins on the phone from Connecticut today.  Welcome to the program, Dr. Schutt. Dr. DAVID SCHUTT (Author/Professor, Dark Banquet:  Blood and the Curious Lives of Blood-Feeding Creatures):  It's a pleasure to be on your show. PALCA:  Well, so first of all, what, I am curious, drew you to the study of vampire bats in the first place? Dr. SCHUTT:  Well, I guess, I've always been into strange animals when I was a kid.  You know, I was the kid who had a monkey, and a boa constrictor, and all sorts of weird critters so, you know, 30 years later when people contact me for the first time in a long time, and they find out that I spent a lot of time studying vampire bats as part of my career, they are not surprised. PALCA:  They go, what figures. Dr. SCHUTT:  Exactly. PALCA:  What would else would you expect from young Bill Schutt?  Oh, I should remind people are our number is 800-989-8255, that's 800-989-TALK, and if you want to talk with Bill Schutt about vampire bats or several of the other interesting blood-sucking.  I guess, we think of it as sucking but actually, they, I guess, it drips into their mouth.  You describe this interesting capillary tubes that sort of help extract the blood.  But my question is, you make the point in the book, I thought it was interesting that, you know, blood is not the world's most nutritious substance.  You have to have a specialized digestive system to get a satisfactory meal out of it. Dr. SCHUTT:  Yeah.  Not only a specialized digestive system, but basically your entire physiology needs to be highly evolved in order to deal with the fact that blood for instance doesn't have any fat in it.  So you can't store fat, which means that you have to feed on blood every day.  And that presents some major problems. PALCA:  So, such as. Dr. SCHUTT:  Well, you can't hibernate. PALCA:  So vampire bats don't hibernate, that's why there in the tropics I presume. Dr. SCHUTT:  Excuse me. PALCA:  I say, vampire bats don't hibernate so they're in the tropics, unlike the brown bats that we were just hearing about in New York State, they do hibernate. Dr. SCHUTT:  Yes, that's the reason why you're never going to find them in the United States, because the bats around here run out of insects during the fall and winter and so they get by, by hibernating.  Vampire bats would never be able to do that. PALCA:  I guess, you also have to have pretty sophisticated kidneys or blood - I mean, water-balanced mechanisms because blood is mostly water anyway. Dr. SCHUTT:  Exactly.  They've got to get rid of - initially, they have to get rid of high amount of water.  So while they're feeding, they're actually urinating.  And then it becomes a problem of conserving water at a certain point so their kidneys kick into a second gear that turns into a more of a water conservation device.  So any of the anatomical systems that you look at in a vampire bat digestive system, you know, their reproductive systems, anything you can think of is really neat to study from an anatomical point of view. PALCA:  All right.  So, have you ever been bitten by a vampire bat? Dr. SCHUTT:  No. PALCA:  Are there reports of them biting humans? Dr. SCHUTT:  Oh, yeah.  I mean, nowadays, these are or generally really poor people who are living in areas where for example, you don't have screens or doors.  But if you're out camping in the middle of an area where vampire bats exist, and you're not using mosquito nets then, yeah, you can get bitten.  It doesn't happen very often but it does happen.  Primarily, vampire bats are feeding on livestock and other animals. PALCA:  I see but I guess, what I am curious about is the bite of a vampire bat painful?  I mean, would you know that you've been bitten by - one of this - the teeth are so sharp and the wound is so small that it wouldn't bother you. Dr. SCHUTT:  Well, if you were handling a vampire bat and got bit, you would know that in a hurry because with the animal struggling and frightened, it could put a real hurt on you and put a serious bite onto you.  If it's sneaking up and trying to feed, that's a completely different matter and most likely if you were asleep, you would never know that you'd been bitten because the - their teeth are so sharp that they generally make a painless bite when they do bite - when they're looking for food. PALCA:  All right, interesting.  I thought I suspected because you describe some of these animals that they sort of nuzzle up to these chickens and trick the chicken into thinking their young is coming along, then take a little snack. Dr. SCHUTT:  Yeah, that's the white-wing vampire bat and we saw that behavior with that colony that I was keeping at Cornell University when I was a graduate student there.  The bat approached the birds, we thought the bird was going to attack at the bat, and suddenly the bat went underneath the breast of the birds, and sort of snuggled into this region where the chicks usually go to warm themselves, and the bird just kind of hunkered down and fell asleep and meanwhile, we saw this - a couple of minutes later - we see this trail of blood coming out from underneath the bird.  The bat was feeding underneath this hen. PALCA:  Clever bat. Dr. SCHUTT:  Yeah, great stuff. PALCA:  Let's take a call now.  Remember, our number is 800-989-8255.  Let's go to Gayle(ph) in San Antonio, Texas.  Gayle, welcome to Science Friday. GAYLE (Caller):  Welcome, thank you.  Hi. PALCA:  Hi. GAYLE:  I have a question.  A friend of mine - I have an interest in entomology, insects, and so a friend of mine told me about this new moth that they had found would actually drink blood and they - I got to watch a bit of the video on the Internet where it was showing, you know, sticking its probe into a finger and another part it was, you know, on the person's face and it was actually drinking the blood and, I didn't get to watch the whole program so I was hoping that he could tell us a little bit more about that if he knew. PALCA:  Blood-thirsty moth. Dr. SCHUTT:  I think that that, excuse me, I think that moth lives in Southeast Asia, if I'm not wrong, and it's really one of the creatures that I wanted to study but didn't get a chance to.  So, I do know that not a whole lot is known about its behavior except that it's got this curious diet and do you remember if this was an Asian species? GAYLE:  It was, and I remember that the person studying it was female but yeah, she was in Southeast Asia. PALCA:  But this is also blood-gathered opportunistic or do they have a sharp enough proboscis to. . . GAYLE:  They figured they had a sharp-enough proboscis and they would stick - and they showed it drilling into the person's finger, and another time they showed it where it was like hovering on a man's lip and sticking it into the softer lip, but they still were able to get it even from the finger.  It was quite unique to - what I would think of is how a moth could feed. Dr. SCHUTT:  Yeah, that's wild.  I know there some moths that have sharpened a probosci they'll use to drill into fruit, but this is probably been - this behavior hasn't been known for very long, and I imagine if there are going to be some people looking into this to see if there are other blood-feeding adaptations they are like an anticoagulant.  Sounds like a fascinating animal, and from the little I know, it seems that, you know, it's a creature that is in need of study. PALCA:  Well, Bill Schutt, we may have to get a ruling from NPR librarian Kee Malesky on whether it's probosci or proboscises but anyway,  GAYLE:  Actually, I watched it. PALCA:  Gayle, thanks very much for your call. GAYLE:  Thank you. PALCA:  OK.  Let's take another call now and go to Adam in Anchorage, Alaska.  Adam, welcome to Science Friday. ADAM (Caller):  Hello, I had a question about the vampire bats and other blood-feeding creatures.  Do they, sometime received diseases from the creature that they're sucking on and have those infected the bat or other blood-suckers? PALCA:  Interesting. Dr. SCHUTT:  That's a really good question.  I get this question a lot about vampire bats, and sometime I hear about would these creatures - could they transmit AIDS.  While blood-feeding creatures are known to transmit different bacteria and disease-causing agents, there has never been - I don't believe there has ever been a study that shows that blood taken in from a vampire bat or blood-feeding creature that was diseased blood, that that disease could then be transmitted to sort of a second host or a second victim.   These relationships between pathogenic organisms and the creatures that carry them are very complex, and they are highly evolved, and that they've taken a long time to develop.  And so , it's not saying that that couldn't happen, it's just saying that at this point there - that I know of, there are no instances of where - so for example, if somebody had malaria and you had a bat withdraw blood from somebody and then bite someone else, you could transmit malaria.  It's. . . PALCA:  No, I don't - I think there's - the malaria parasite has an interesting life cycle, and part of it depends on the - whatever the - environment is inside the mosquito gut.   Mr. SCHUTT: Yeah. PALCA:  So I don't think that's going to be - actually while we were talking, our crack editorial staff has found the link to this moth, this Asian moth that drinks blood, and we'll get that up on our website sometime in the not too distant future.  So check back and you can find out exactly about this moth. But what - you started with the vampire bats, and that's obviously your research interest, but what got you into this book of other blood-sucking animals.  Again, is it your childhood love of the macabre or is it - was there some other idea to understand better the evolution of blood drinking as an evolutionary process?   Mr. SCHUTT:  Well, that was all part of it.  I think one of the things that was a real stimulus to getting me started on this book was when I started - when I learned that there were these - that creatures that were as different as vampire bats and leeches and ticks and bedbugs all shared these common adaptations that had evolved convergently. Ah, excuse me, had evolved separately.  And so you've got these - all of them share sharpened teeth and stealthy approach, and they're all real small.  If you're going to feed on blood, you're going to have to do it quite often for the most part.  And if you need to feed on a lot of blood, that's just going to make it more difficult.   So those connections that I've - that I saw between very, very different animals, that was one of the things that got me interested in telling the stories of some of these other blood-feeders besides vampires, things like leeches and bedbugs.  And the fact that that there is so much news today built around these animals like ticks and bedbugs are having this unbelievable resurgence.  So once I started to delve into the things that I didn't know a great deal about, the learning curve was really steep.  It got interesting in a hurry.  I just met these wonderful people.  You could not write - if you're writing fiction, you could use probably some of these folks. PALCA:  Yeah, yeah. Mr. SCHUTT:  And the book just took off from there. PALCA:  That's right.  Yeah.  That's an excellent story.  I have to tell you, by the way, we all - according to the paragon of literary virtue or chromatically usage and language here at NPR.  Kim Meleski, she tells me in an email that its proboscises or proboscises.  I have to - it's not clear whether the 'C' is hard or soft, but maybe I'll get another email before the show. . . Mr. SCHUTT:  Well, I stand corrected and see.  You learned something there from that. PALCA:  Isn't that great?  Isn't that - that's just what we tried to do here at National Public Radio.  We give you something new to learn everyday. Mr. SCHUTT:  Well, thanks. PALCA:  But right now, we're talking about blood and blood animals with Bill Schutt.  He's the author of a new book called \"Dark Banquet: Blood and the Curious Lives of Blood-Feeding Creatures. \"  I'm Joe Palca and you're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News.  OK.  Let see if we can find another call now and how about - let's talk to Michael in Cape Coral, Florida.  Michael, you're in a swing state.  What's on your mind? MICHAEL (Caller):  Yes.  Hi.  How are you doing? PALCA:  I'm great. MICHAEL:  I've been in pest control for about 14 years.  I know there's a beetle in South America.  I don't know the name of it.  Unfortunately it's - I've lost the name of it.  But I know it feeds on blood on your face and it's not the bite that's actually dangerous, but it leaves droppings on your face. Mr. SCHUTT:  Yeah.  (unintelligible). MICHAEL:  If you rub that into your face, until recently, the only cure was a heart transplant. Mr. SCHUTT:  Right.  That would be the assassin bug, Reduviidae. MICHAEL:  Yeah. Mr. SCHUTT:  It's not actually a beetle.  It's a card-carrying bug, and they're one of the creatures that - we think that might be one of the reasons that Charles Darwin had lifelong chronic illnesses when he returned from his voyage around the world, because he had gotten bit by Reduviidaes when he was in - I believed Bolivia or Ecuador. PALCA:  Really.  Now, is that the same as Chagas disease?  I thought that was called the kissing beetle, and that was transmitted by a beetle. Mr. SCHUTT:  Yeah.  I'm not positive what the distinction is there, but - so there's probably more than one.   PALCA:  Yeah. Mr. SCHUTT:  But it - the feces to me sounds like the assassin bug. PALCA:  Yeah, yeah, it could be.  Interesting, interesting point.  All right, let's try another call now and go to - how about Jaime in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.  Jamie, welcome to the program. JAMIE (Caller):  Hi. PALCA:  Hi, Jamie. JAMIE:  How are you? PALCA:  Great. JAMIE:  I overheard that you guys were studying - this gentleman is studying the blood-sucking bats in South Americ,a and I'm from Chile in South America, and I was studying that over there in South America.  They also have the chupacabra, which means 'blood-sucking goat. ' PALCA:  Mm hmm. JAMIE:  And I was wondering if there's any possibility that there has been some kind of a cross high-breed with a goat, a dog, and a bat somehow because that's what these pictures look like of the strange phenomenon over there. PALCA:  Wow. Mr. SCHUTT:  Jamie, I think. . . JAMIE:  It's Halloween.  I thought I'd ask you. PALCA:  Yeah, well, for Halloween it's a completely fair question.  Jamie, thanks for the call.  What about that goat, Schutt? Mr. SCHUTT:  Yeah.  I think chupacabra means 'goat sucker,' and the implication there was that goats have been blood drawing(ph) killed.  I've never heard before that chupacabras are some type of a mutant bat goat creature. PALCA:  Yeah. Mr. SCHUTT:  It's a new one for me. PALCA:  So again, I want you to talk a little bit before I let you go about the bed bugs.  They - you know, what's the deal with them?  They actually - they do eat blood as well and largely, our blood. Mr. SCHUTT:  Yeah.  There's been a wild resurgence of these creatures.  They're very well adapted to the way - to all of our habits - clutter and travel.  And they are very, very difficult to get rid of once you've got an infestation.  You know, I could run down -  there's many new things that we do that just make it very easy for them to get into our houses.  If you pick up furniture on the side of the curb and bring it in, these creatures may have - may be infesting that nice-looking bookshelf, or if you have people come over to your house to come to a party, where do you have them throw their coats when they come in? PALCA:  Right.  And what - I mean, do they cause problems or they're just annoying? Mr. SCHUTT:  They're just - well, I think it just freaks people out that you're lying in bed and you're getting bitten by these things, but there are no reports of any type of disease transmitted by them, luckily. PALCA:  OK.  All right.  Well, Bill Schutt, we'll leave it there.  I like the idea of not letting the bed bugs bite.  What was the Latin name?  I forget now. Mr. SCHUTT:  Cimex lectularius. PALCA:  Yeah.  Don't let the Cimex lectularius bite you.  Anyway, thanks very much for coming on the show. Mr. SCHUTT:  It's my pleasure.  Thank you very much. PALCA:  Bill Schutt is the author of the new book \"Dark Banquet: Blood and the Curious Lives of Blood-Feeding Creatures. \"  He's also an associate professor of Biology at the C. W. Post College of Long Island University and he's a research associate at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.  When we come back, we'll be talking about the intersection of science and beauty and books that exhibit both.  So stay with us.  JOE PALCA, host:  From NPR News, this is Talk of the Nation, Science Friday.  I am Joe Palca.  Later in the hour, a new exhibition at the intersection of science and beauty, but first it's Halloween and we're going to talk about a creature that has fangs, drinks blood, and comes out only at night and that is the aptly-named creature, the vampire bat.  Vampire bats lived in the tropical of Central and South America.  They scour the night for unsuspecting prey like chickens and cows, slice the skin or hide of their prey with razor-sharp teeth, and gently lick the wound, collecting the draining stream of blood with their mouths.    And my next guest has raised this delicate blood-letters.  He joins me know to talk about them and other creatures that are happy to drink your blood.  Bill Schutt is the author of the new book, \"Dark Banquet:  Blood and the Curious Lives of Blood-Feeding Creatures. \"  He is also an associate professor of biology at the CW Post-College of Long Island University, and he is also a research associate in mammalogy at the American Museum of National History in New York.  He joins on the phone from Connecticut today.  Welcome to the program, Dr. Schutt.  Dr. DAVID SCHUTT (Author/Professor, Dark Banquet:  Blood and the Curious Lives of Blood-Feeding Creatures):  It's a pleasure to be on your show.  PALCA:  Well, so first of all, what, I am curious, drew you to the study of vampire bats in the first place?  Dr. SCHUTT:  Well, I guess, I've always been into strange animals when I was a kid.  You know, I was the kid who had a monkey, and a boa constrictor, and all sorts of weird critters so, you know, 30 years later when people contact me for the first time in a long time, and they find out that I spent a lot of time studying vampire bats as part of my career, they are not surprised.  PALCA:  They go, what figures.  Dr. SCHUTT:  Exactly.  PALCA:  What would else would you expect from young Bill Schutt?  Oh, I should remind people are our number is 800-989-8255, that's 800-989-TALK, and if you want to talk with Bill Schutt about vampire bats or several of the other interesting blood-sucking.  I guess, we think of it as sucking but actually, they, I guess, it drips into their mouth.  You describe this interesting capillary tubes that sort of help extract the blood.  But my question is, you make the point in the book, I thought it was interesting that, you know, blood is not the world's most nutritious substance.  You have to have a specialized digestive system to get a satisfactory meal out of it.  Dr. SCHUTT:  Yeah.  Not only a specialized digestive system, but basically your entire physiology needs to be highly evolved in order to deal with the fact that blood for instance doesn't have any fat in it.  So you can't store fat, which means that you have to feed on blood every day.  And that presents some major problems.  PALCA:  So, such as.  Dr. SCHUTT:  Well, you can't hibernate.  PALCA:  So vampire bats don't hibernate, that's why there in the tropics I presume.  Dr. SCHUTT:  Excuse me.  PALCA:  I say, vampire bats don't hibernate so they're in the tropics, unlike the brown bats that we were just hearing about in New York State, they do hibernate.  Dr. SCHUTT:  Yes, that's the reason why you're never going to find them in the United States, because the bats around here run out of insects during the fall and winter and so they get by, by hibernating.  Vampire bats would never be able to do that.  PALCA:  I guess, you also have to have pretty sophisticated kidneys or blood - I mean, water-balanced mechanisms because blood is mostly water anyway.  Dr. SCHUTT:  Exactly.  They've got to get rid of - initially, they have to get rid of high amount of water.  So while they're feeding, they're actually urinating.  And then it becomes a problem of conserving water at a certain point so their kidneys kick into a second gear that turns into a more of a water conservation device.  So any of the anatomical systems that you look at in a vampire bat digestive system, you know, their reproductive systems, anything you can think of is really neat to study from an anatomical point of view.  PALCA:  All right.  So, have you ever been bitten by a vampire bat?  Dr. SCHUTT:  No.  PALCA:  Are there reports of them biting humans?  Dr. SCHUTT:  Oh, yeah.  I mean, nowadays, these are or generally really poor people who are living in areas where for example, you don't have screens or doors.  But if you're out camping in the middle of an area where vampire bats exist, and you're not using mosquito nets then, yeah, you can get bitten.  It doesn't happen very often but it does happen.  Primarily, vampire bats are feeding on livestock and other animals.  PALCA:  I see but I guess, what I am curious about is the bite of a vampire bat painful?  I mean, would you know that you've been bitten by - one of this - the teeth are so sharp and the wound is so small that it wouldn't bother you.  Dr. SCHUTT:  Well, if you were handling a vampire bat and got bit, you would know that in a hurry because with the animal struggling and frightened, it could put a real hurt on you and put a serious bite onto you.  If it's sneaking up and trying to feed, that's a completely different matter and most likely if you were asleep, you would never know that you'd been bitten because the - their teeth are so sharp that they generally make a painless bite when they do bite - when they're looking for food.  PALCA:  All right, interesting.  I thought I suspected because you describe some of these animals that they sort of nuzzle up to these chickens and trick the chicken into thinking their young is coming along, then take a little snack.  Dr. SCHUTT:  Yeah, that's the white-wing vampire bat and we saw that behavior with that colony that I was keeping at Cornell University when I was a graduate student there.  The bat approached the birds, we thought the bird was going to attack at the bat, and suddenly the bat went underneath the breast of the birds, and sort of snuggled into this region where the chicks usually go to warm themselves, and the bird just kind of hunkered down and fell asleep and meanwhile, we saw this - a couple of minutes later - we see this trail of blood coming out from underneath the bird.  The bat was feeding underneath this hen.  PALCA:  Clever bat.  Dr. SCHUTT:  Yeah, great stuff.  PALCA:  Let's take a call now.  Remember, our number is 800-989-8255.  Let's go to Gayle(ph) in San Antonio, Texas.  Gayle, welcome to Science Friday.  GAYLE (Caller):  Welcome, thank you.  Hi.  PALCA:  Hi.  GAYLE:  I have a question.  A friend of mine - I have an interest in entomology, insects, and so a friend of mine told me about this new moth that they had found would actually drink blood and they - I got to watch a bit of the video on the Internet where it was showing, you know, sticking its probe into a finger and another part it was, you know, on the person's face and it was actually drinking the blood and, I didn't get to watch the whole program so I was hoping that he could tell us a little bit more about that if he knew.  PALCA:  Blood-thirsty moth.  Dr. SCHUTT:  I think that that, excuse me, I think that moth lives in Southeast Asia, if I'm not wrong, and it's really one of the creatures that I wanted to study but didn't get a chance to.  So, I do know that not a whole lot is known about its behavior except that it's got this curious diet and do you remember if this was an Asian species?  GAYLE:  It was, and I remember that the person studying it was female but yeah, she was in Southeast Asia.  PALCA:  But this is also blood-gathered opportunistic or do they have a sharp enough proboscis to. . .  GAYLE:  They figured they had a sharp-enough proboscis and they would stick - and they showed it drilling into the person's finger, and another time they showed it where it was like hovering on a man's lip and sticking it into the softer lip, but they still were able to get it even from the finger.  It was quite unique to - what I would think of is how a moth could feed.  Dr. SCHUTT:  Yeah, that's wild.  I know there some moths that have sharpened a probosci they'll use to drill into fruit, but this is probably been - this behavior hasn't been known for very long, and I imagine if there are going to be some people looking into this to see if there are other blood-feeding adaptations they are like an anticoagulant.  Sounds like a fascinating animal, and from the little I know, it seems that, you know, it's a creature that is in need of study.  PALCA:  Well, Bill Schutt, we may have to get a ruling from NPR librarian Kee Malesky on whether it's probosci or proboscises but anyway,   GAYLE:  Actually, I watched it.  PALCA:  Gayle, thanks very much for your call.  GAYLE:  Thank you.  PALCA:  OK.  Let's take another call now and go to Adam in Anchorage, Alaska.  Adam, welcome to Science Friday.  ADAM (Caller):  Hello, I had a question about the vampire bats and other blood-feeding creatures.  Do they, sometime received diseases from the creature that they're sucking on and have those infected the bat or other blood-suckers?  PALCA:  Interesting.  Dr. SCHUTT:  That's a really good question.  I get this question a lot about vampire bats, and sometime I hear about would these creatures - could they transmit AIDS.  While blood-feeding creatures are known to transmit different bacteria and disease-causing agents, there has never been - I don't believe there has ever been a study that shows that blood taken in from a vampire bat or blood-feeding creature that was diseased blood, that that disease could then be transmitted to sort of a second host or a second victim.    These relationships between pathogenic organisms and the creatures that carry them are very complex, and they are highly evolved, and that they've taken a long time to develop.  And so , it's not saying that that couldn't happen, it's just saying that at this point there - that I know of, there are no instances of where - so for example, if somebody had malaria and you had a bat withdraw blood from somebody and then bite someone else, you could transmit malaria.  It's. . .  PALCA:  No, I don't - I think there's - the malaria parasite has an interesting life cycle, and part of it depends on the - whatever the - environment is inside the mosquito gut.    Mr. SCHUTT: Yeah.  PALCA:  So I don't think that's going to be - actually while we were talking, our crack editorial staff has found the link to this moth, this Asian moth that drinks blood, and we'll get that up on our website sometime in the not too distant future.  So check back and you can find out exactly about this moth. But what - you started with the vampire bats, and that's obviously your research interest, but what got you into this book of other blood-sucking animals.  Again, is it your childhood love of the macabre or is it - was there some other idea to understand better the evolution of blood drinking as an evolutionary process?    Mr. SCHUTT:  Well, that was all part of it.  I think one of the things that was a real stimulus to getting me started on this book was when I started - when I learned that there were these - that creatures that were as different as vampire bats and leeches and ticks and bedbugs all shared these common adaptations that had evolved convergently. Ah, excuse me, had evolved separately.  And so you've got these - all of them share sharpened teeth and stealthy approach, and they're all real small.  If you're going to feed on blood, you're going to have to do it quite often for the most part.  And if you need to feed on a lot of blood, that's just going to make it more difficult.    So those connections that I've - that I saw between very, very different animals, that was one of the things that got me interested in telling the stories of some of these other blood-feeders besides vampires, things like leeches and bedbugs.  And the fact that that there is so much news today built around these animals like ticks and bedbugs are having this unbelievable resurgence.  So once I started to delve into the things that I didn't know a great deal about, the learning curve was really steep.  It got interesting in a hurry.  I just met these wonderful people.  You could not write - if you're writing fiction, you could use probably some of these folks.  PALCA:  Yeah, yeah.  Mr. SCHUTT:  And the book just took off from there.  PALCA:  That's right.  Yeah.  That's an excellent story.  I have to tell you, by the way, we all - according to the paragon of literary virtue or chromatically usage and language here at NPR.  Kim Meleski, she tells me in an email that its proboscises or proboscises.  I have to - it's not clear whether the 'C' is hard or soft, but maybe I'll get another email before the show. . .  Mr. SCHUTT:  Well, I stand corrected and see.  You learned something there from that.  PALCA:  Isn't that great?  Isn't that - that's just what we tried to do here at National Public Radio.  We give you something new to learn everyday.  Mr. SCHUTT:  Well, thanks.  PALCA:  But right now, we're talking about blood and blood animals with Bill Schutt.  He's the author of a new book called \"Dark Banquet: Blood and the Curious Lives of Blood-Feeding Creatures. \"  I'm Joe Palca and you're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News.  OK.  Let see if we can find another call now and how about - let's talk to Michael in Cape Coral, Florida.  Michael, you're in a swing state.  What's on your mind?  MICHAEL (Caller):  Yes.  Hi.  How are you doing?  PALCA:  I'm great.  MICHAEL:  I've been in pest control for about 14 years.  I know there's a beetle in South America.  I don't know the name of it.  Unfortunately it's - I've lost the name of it.  But I know it feeds on blood on your face and it's not the bite that's actually dangerous, but it leaves droppings on your face.  Mr. SCHUTT:  Yeah.  (unintelligible).  MICHAEL:  If you rub that into your face, until recently, the only cure was a heart transplant.  Mr. SCHUTT:  Right.  That would be the assassin bug, Reduviidae.  MICHAEL:  Yeah.  Mr. SCHUTT:  It's not actually a beetle.  It's a card-carrying bug, and they're one of the creatures that - we think that might be one of the reasons that Charles Darwin had lifelong chronic illnesses when he returned from his voyage around the world, because he had gotten bit by Reduviidaes when he was in - I believed Bolivia or Ecuador.  PALCA:  Really.  Now, is that the same as Chagas disease?  I thought that was called the kissing beetle, and that was transmitted by a beetle.  Mr. SCHUTT:  Yeah.  I'm not positive what the distinction is there, but - so there's probably more than one.    PALCA:  Yeah.  Mr. SCHUTT:  But it - the feces to me sounds like the assassin bug.  PALCA:  Yeah, yeah, it could be.  Interesting, interesting point.  All right, let's try another call now and go to - how about Jaime in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.  Jamie, welcome to the program.  JAMIE (Caller):  Hi.  PALCA:  Hi, Jamie.  JAMIE:  How are you?  PALCA:  Great.  JAMIE:  I overheard that you guys were studying - this gentleman is studying the blood-sucking bats in South Americ,a and I'm from Chile in South America, and I was studying that over there in South America.  They also have the chupacabra, which means 'blood-sucking goat. '  PALCA:  Mm hmm.  JAMIE:  And I was wondering if there's any possibility that there has been some kind of a cross high-breed with a goat, a dog, and a bat somehow because that's what these pictures look like of the strange phenomenon over there.  PALCA:  Wow.  Mr. SCHUTT:  Jamie, I think. . .  JAMIE:  It's Halloween.  I thought I'd ask you.  PALCA:  Yeah, well, for Halloween it's a completely fair question.  Jamie, thanks for the call.  What about that goat, Schutt?  Mr. SCHUTT:  Yeah.  I think chupacabra means 'goat sucker,' and the implication there was that goats have been blood drawing(ph) killed.  I've never heard before that chupacabras are some type of a mutant bat goat creature.  PALCA:  Yeah.  Mr. SCHUTT:  It's a new one for me.  PALCA:  So again, I want you to talk a little bit before I let you go about the bed bugs.  They - you know, what's the deal with them?  They actually - they do eat blood as well and largely, our blood.  Mr. SCHUTT:  Yeah.  There's been a wild resurgence of these creatures.  They're very well adapted to the way - to all of our habits - clutter and travel.  And they are very, very difficult to get rid of once you've got an infestation.  You know, I could run down -  there's many new things that we do that just make it very easy for them to get into our houses.  If you pick up furniture on the side of the curb and bring it in, these creatures may have - may be infesting that nice-looking bookshelf, or if you have people come over to your house to come to a party, where do you have them throw their coats when they come in?  PALCA:  Right.  And what - I mean, do they cause problems or they're just annoying?  Mr. SCHUTT:  They're just - well, I think it just freaks people out that you're lying in bed and you're getting bitten by these things, but there are no reports of any type of disease transmitted by them, luckily.  PALCA:  OK.  All right.  Well, Bill Schutt, we'll leave it there.  I like the idea of not letting the bed bugs bite.  What was the Latin name?  I forget now.  Mr. SCHUTT:  Cimex lectularius.  PALCA:  Yeah.  Don't let the Cimex lectularius bite you.  Anyway, thanks very much for coming on the show.  Mr. SCHUTT:  It's my pleasure.  Thank you very much.  PALCA:  Bill Schutt is the author of the new book \"Dark Banquet: Blood and the Curious Lives of Blood-Feeding Creatures. \"  He's also an associate professor of Biology at the C. W. Post College of Long Island University and he's a research associate at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.  When we come back, we'll be talking about the intersection of science and beauty and books that exhibit both.  So stay with us. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.

Dr. DAVID WHITNEY (Associate Professor of Psychology, University of California, Davis): Thank you very much. STEWART: First of all, how did you come up with the idea to study tennis calls? Dr. WHITNEY: Well, my lab has actually been studying the visual system's ability to localize objects for many years now. And what we usually do is study how the brain perceives object position in rarified situations where we just look at computer monitors and videos. But when I watched the 2007 Wimbledon Championship, I came across a challenged call. And after the challenge, there was an instant replay, and it showed where the ball had actually landed. And the call was incorrect. The ball had landed on the line, but the ref had called it out. And at that moment it occurred to me that, wow, I could take all of the stuff that we've been doing and apply it to the real world. STEWART: What is it that causes the perception that this ball might be out when it's actually in? Dr. WHITNEY: The brain faces some serious challenges when trying to code information. If we're trying to drive down the road and avoid a cyclist, or see a stop sign, avoid a pedestrian; every time we're walking around; or we're trying to pick up a coffee cup, there is so much information there, the brain has to use shortcuts. It has to use heuristics or tricks to avoid getting overwhelmed with information. And one of the tricks that it uses is predicting object trajectories. With a tennis ball, it's hard though. The tennis ball makes an unpredictable change. It bounces. And the visual system can't predict this very well. And when that happens, the visual system has this slight error, and the error is that the position at which the tennis ball bounces appears shifted in the direction of motion. STEWART: This is a little bit of an obnoxious question. So if you're a tennis player and your ball has been called out, you should challenge it. Dr. WHITNEY: Well, it depends on if it's clearly out, then it's clearly out. If it's a very close call, it would benefit the players most first to maximize their challenges, use up all of your challenges, and second it would benefit them most to predominantly challenge those calls that are out. Challenge the out calls more than challenging the in calls. STEWART: Do you play tennis? Dr. WHITNEY: I used to, and I was terrible at it. And so I became a scientist.

As the legendary General Black Jack Pershing put it, you ask me what we need to win the war, I answer, tobacco as much as bullets.  During Pershing's time in the two world wars, smoking seemed almost innocuous.  Now, of course, we know better.   Still, a doctor who served in Iraq says almost two thirds of the soldiers he studied there used tobacco.  That's almost double the rate of the general population.  His name is Doctor Michael Wilson.  He's a pulmonary physician.  He was deployed to Iraq last year for about eight months with the U. S. Navy reserve, and he did the study on his own.  He presented his findings at a professional conference last week.  Half of the smokers he studied said they started using tobacco after going into the military. Dr. MICHAEL WILSON (Pulmonary Physician):  A lot of it is a learned behavior.  These young recruits that come in, they look up. They emulate their staff and COs, their young officers and beyond, and they see a lot of them chewing tobacco or smoking cigarettes, and they want to be like them because they're the people they look up to, and then they start using, as well.   It very much is a strong peer pressure, as well.  If you're with a group of buddies, and these are the guys that, you know, the guy to the right of you, the guy to the left you, that's who you're depending upon to help save your life while you're over there in Iraq, if those people, as a group, especially if the small unit leader is using some form of tobacco product, you're much more likely to use it if you're part of that group just from sheer peer pressure. SEABROOK:  So, given all these things, how do you tell them not to smoke?  What do you say? Dr. WILSON:  Well, that's a great question.  And the Department of Defense has done a very good job in the last couple of years to have the Navy and the Marine Corps to realize that this is a very big problem that has gotten worse since the war on terrorism has started.  And they have started to develop programs, particularly on the Internet, computer programs, different kinds of educational programs to try and convince military people between - especially between the age of 18 and 25 not to use tobacco products.  But what we also need to do is try and change that culture. SEABROOK:  How do you tell the general who came up in this culture to tell his people not to smoke? Dr. WILSON:  Well, as a lieutenant commander in the Navy Reserve, I don't tell the general anything. (Soundbite of laughter) SEABROOK:  Of course not. Dr. WILSON:  I would suggest strongly they all have in common the common desire to get back home alive and to care for these young men and women.  That means more than just surviving the bullets and the bombs.  That means trying to teach the kind of habits that will help them survive and do well for the rest of their lives.   In addition to that, we need to try and somehow lessen the tobacco industry's influence.  They've long pushed selling tobacco products to the military.  It's one of their biggest avenues of developing new customers, so to speak.  It's very famous that they used to stuff Red Cross packages with cigarettes or chewing tobacco to send overseas.  That's become less so, but if you look at even this current war, when they get care packages sent from home, a lot of times, these care packages have exactly that, cigarettes and tobacco.   Now, it's not fair to say the tobacco industry per say is doing that any more because they're not. But certainly, in the history of tobacco industry, they've targeted the military, and they still do so in ways, such as trying to keep the cost lower inside the exchange.  It used to be a lot cheaper to buy cigarettes and chewing tobacco at an exchange than it was right outside the base. SEABROOK:  Is there more smoking now in the military than before? Dr. WILSON:  Well, we were doing a really great job over the last 20, 25 years reducing tobacco dependence in the military.  When you look at my study, what's very concerning is, you could argue that the rate of tobacco abuse has gone way back up in the military. SEABROOK:  You say a lot more people will die from smoking-related disease than injuries suffered in war. Dr. WILSON:  If my survey is correct, if you take just one fourth of the people that likely use tobacco while they're in Iraq, about 250,000 will contract or develop some form of tobacco related-illness in the course of their lifetime.  That's compared to roughly 4,119 U. S. troops that have been killed in Iraq up to July 15th, and approximately 30,000 casualties.  The numbers pale in comparison to the number of people that are going to come back potentially with tobacco problems 20, 30 years from now.  We need to attack this problem before they go, while they're there and when they get home.   I think it should be just as important as making sure we all had body armor over there, and I'm very glad that I had body armor over there.  It has saved countless lives.  Well, so would reducing the nicotine dependence.  It would probably, in the end, save many more lives of U. S. military personnel and veterans than the body armor itself has done. SEABROOK:  Dr. Michael Wilson, thanks very much for coming in. Dr. WILSON:  Thanks for having me.  ANDREA SEABROOK, host:  Here's a vivid image of war, the weather beaten soldier leaning exhausted against a post, taking a long drag on a cigarette.  As the legendary General Black Jack Pershing put it, you ask me what we need to win the war, I answer, tobacco as much as bullets.  During Pershing's time in the two world wars, smoking seemed almost innocuous.  Now, of course, we know better.    Still, a doctor who served in Iraq says almost two thirds of the soldiers he studied there used tobacco.  That's almost double the rate of the general population.  His name is Doctor Michael Wilson.  He's a pulmonary physician.  He was deployed to Iraq last year for about eight months with the U. S. Navy reserve, and he did the study on his own.  He presented his findings at a professional conference last week.  Half of the smokers he studied said they started using tobacco after going into the military.  Dr. MICHAEL WILSON (Pulmonary Physician):  A lot of it is a learned behavior.  These young recruits that come in, they look up. They emulate their staff and COs, their young officers and beyond, and they see a lot of them chewing tobacco or smoking cigarettes, and they want to be like them because they're the people they look up to, and then they start using, as well.    It very much is a strong peer pressure, as well.  If you're with a group of buddies, and these are the guys that, you know, the guy to the right of you, the guy to the left you, that's who you're depending upon to help save your life while you're over there in Iraq, if those people, as a group, especially if the small unit leader is using some form of tobacco product, you're much more likely to use it if you're part of that group just from sheer peer pressure.  SEABROOK:  So, given all these things, how do you tell them not to smoke?  What do you say?  Dr. WILSON:  Well, that's a great question.  And the Department of Defense has done a very good job in the last couple of years to have the Navy and the Marine Corps to realize that this is a very big problem that has gotten worse since the war on terrorism has started.  And they have started to develop programs, particularly on the Internet, computer programs, different kinds of educational programs to try and convince military people between - especially between the age of 18 and 25 not to use tobacco products.  But what we also need to do is try and change that culture.  SEABROOK:  How do you tell the general who came up in this culture to tell his people not to smoke?  Dr. WILSON:  Well, as a lieutenant commander in the Navy Reserve, I don't tell the general anything.  (Soundbite of laughter)  SEABROOK:  Of course not.  Dr. WILSON:  I would suggest strongly they all have in common the common desire to get back home alive and to care for these young men and women.  That means more than just surviving the bullets and the bombs.  That means trying to teach the kind of habits that will help them survive and do well for the rest of their lives.    In addition to that, we need to try and somehow lessen the tobacco industry's influence.  They've long pushed selling tobacco products to the military.  It's one of their biggest avenues of developing new customers, so to speak.  It's very famous that they used to stuff Red Cross packages with cigarettes or chewing tobacco to send overseas.  That's become less so, but if you look at even this current war, when they get care packages sent from home, a lot of times, these care packages have exactly that, cigarettes and tobacco.    Now, it's not fair to say the tobacco industry per say is doing that any more because they're not. But certainly, in the history of tobacco industry, they've targeted the military, and they still do so in ways, such as trying to keep the cost lower inside the exchange.  It used to be a lot cheaper to buy cigarettes and chewing tobacco at an exchange than it was right outside the base.  SEABROOK:  Is there more smoking now in the military than before?  Dr. WILSON:  Well, we were doing a really great job over the last 20, 25 years reducing tobacco dependence in the military.  When you look at my study, what's very concerning is, you could argue that the rate of tobacco abuse has gone way back up in the military.  SEABROOK:  You say a lot more people will die from smoking-related disease than injuries suffered in war.  Dr. WILSON:  If my survey is correct, if you take just one fourth of the people that likely use tobacco while they're in Iraq, about 250,000 will contract or develop some form of tobacco related-illness in the course of their lifetime.  That's compared to roughly 4,119 U. S. troops that have been killed in Iraq up to July 15th, and approximately 30,000 casualties.  The numbers pale in comparison to the number of people that are going to come back potentially with tobacco problems 20, 30 years from now.  We need to attack this problem before they go, while they're there and when they get home.    I think it should be just as important as making sure we all had body armor over there, and I'm very glad that I had body armor over there.  It has saved countless lives.  Well, so would reducing the nicotine dependence.  It would probably, in the end, save many more lives of U. S. military personnel and veterans than the body armor itself has done.

I'm Madeleine Brand with Alex Chadwick with his secret story.  Alex, you've been muttering about it for weeks now. What is it? ALEX CHADWICK, host: It's being published tomorrow in the journal Microbiology. A researcher at Montana State University found a plant in South America that makes diesel. BRAND:  As in diesel fuel for cars? CHADWICK:  Yes.  Mycodiesel, myco means fungus, and diesel is diesel. (Soundbite of an engine starting) CHADWICK:  All this begins about a decade ago with a plant pathologist at Montana State University in Bozeman, Gary Strobel.  Bio-prospecting in Patagonia in southern Chile, he collected a stem from a certain tree in a very old forest there, and he extracted a fungus from it. Dr. GARY STROBEL (Plant Pathology, Montana State University):  Gliocladium roseum. CHADWICK:  He left the specimen in cold storage until he finally got around to examining it about a year ago, and he noticed peculiar properties.  And he sent the fungus off for tests, and then the report came back. Dr. STROBEL:  In over 50 years, I've never seen anything like this. CHADWICK:  That's Gary, now a professor emeritus at Montana. We spoke a few days ago. Dr. STROBEL:  What I was looking at was the essence of diesel fuel.  Not bio-diesel, but diesel, the kind of stuff that goes into buses and trucks and cars all around the world.   CHADWICK:  And if you had a spoonful of this stuff. . . Dr. STROBEL:  Yep. CHADWICK:  And poured it into a little diesel engine. Dr. STROBEL:  Yep, it would run. CHADWICK:  Without further refining, without doing anything to it? Dr. STROBEL:  Without doing anything else to it, yes. CHADWICK:  There is a name for this fungus, gliocladium roseum.  And here is one more term to know, Endophyte. Unidentified Man:  Endophyte, noun.  A plant that lives in the tissue of another plant between the cells. CHADWICK:  Thank you.  Endophytes are funguses and bacteria, most too small to see with the eye. But to be useful to their hosts, they produce some amazing compounds. (Soundbite of an engine starting) CHADWICK:  In 1892, a German inventor named Rudolf Diesel developed an engine that would run on fuel made by heating crude petroleum.  Huge industries came to pass, vast fortunes, and it now turns out that Herr Diesel was beaten by a fungus. Why would a plant make diesel fuel? Dr. STROBEL:  We can only speculate, but the answer seems to be, these compounds, as they exist, are inhibitory and lethal to other microorganisms. CHADWICK:  OK.  Follow along here. He's saying that the fungus tries to help the host plant discourage invaders.  The diesel fumes from gliocladium drive away other microbes. Dr. STROBEL:  But then, that raises another question.  Where did diesel come from in the first place? CHADWICK: Hmm. Well, it's in the ground, right?  It's the result of tens of millions of years of heat and pressure on ancient, old, organic material like plants.  Yeah, that's basically where we get diesel. Dr. STROBEL:  Is it possible, I ask, that some of the plant material might have contained microorganisms such as this gliocladium? CHADWICK:  That one's a little hard to follow, but very intriguing. Let me try rephrasing.  So, you have a theory that maybe this particular fungus is involved hundreds of millions of years ago in beginning to break down organic matter and turn it into something like petroleum. Dr. STROBEL:  You know, maybe. CHADWICK:  Gary has four patents on this fungus already and many more coming.  He shares them with colleagues and Montana State.  Yale is also a partner and interested to see what might come from gliocladium - tiny, but very productive for a fungus.  A vat of it, who knows how much diesel you could get. This could be very big. (Soundbite of an engine starting) CHADWICK:  I called an expert on technology and entrepreneurship and gave him a vague description of all this. Still secret, remember? This is what he said.   A new energy source. Well, you have to prove it will work at a reasonable cost.  A demonstration project, that's going to take a lot of money.  And then, you're going to have to convince folks it's OK to put it in their cars.  We still don't entirely trust ethanol, he said, and that's a lot more money.  And investors have to believe this will all work out, not maybe, not some day, but soon. It will not take the investor bloodhounds very long to learn more about Gary Strobel.  He's made news before and not all favorable. Dr. STROBEL:  I did have a problem about 20 years ago when I told the EPA to take a hike, and they threatened to put me in jail and throw away the key. CHADWICK:  He had a particular bacterium with altered genes.  He thought it might stop the spreading plague of Dutch elm disease that threatened the handsome trees once lining town squares and streets almost everywhere.  The Environmental Protection Agency said, wait, you need a permit, and sent an application. Dr. STROBEL:  50 pages of incomprehensible garbage. CHADWICK:  Gary ignored the permit.  On his own, he injected the altered bacterium into several young elms in a grove on the Bozeman campus and infected them with Dutch elm.  The trees that didn't get the bacterium started dying.  The ones that got it thrived, but the controversy, unauthorized release of a genetically altered life form, threatened the university.  Gary finally chose to chainsaw the trees into two-foot sections and had it all burned in an incinerator.  His wife left him. It was a bad time.   Dr. STROBEL:  Now, of all times, and even then, now is not the time to put shackles on new technology, and if we stop doing this, we're going to stagnate.  CHADWICK:  Maybe it helps a little in retrospect that Gary's treatment for Dutch elm disease was later found to be very effective.  The technique is very popular, not so much in this country, but the Dutch use it a lot. Dr. STROBEL:  I've scoured the earth for not only organisms like gliocladium, but many other endophytes. I've been to almost every rainforest on the plant. CHADWICK:  I have seen some of the places where Gary Strobel goes looking for endophytes, the old forests of Africa and the Amazon.  The plants and the things inside them, they grow old and enormous, so looking at them, you feel small. Dr. STROBEL:  It's interesting. When you go to a rainforest, there's no disease. It's very hard to find a plant that's sick.  The forest is healthy, unlike many of our grain fields.  We need to look at forests in a way other than to cut down the trees.  We need to save the forest, not only for eco reasons, that is CO2 fixation and removal of carbon dioxide, but also of the little creatures that grow there, that live inside of plants, that can change the whole way we think about our world. CHADWICK:  The endophyte, save the forest for the endophytes? Dr. STROBEL:  Why not? CHADWICK:  Gary Strobel's paper on mycodiesel will be published tomorrow in the journal Microbiology.  So now, the secret is out, and we'll see what happens next.  MADELEINE BRAND, host:  This is Day to Day.  I'm Madeleine Brand with Alex Chadwick with his secret story.

I'm Ira Flatow.  A little bit later, your thoughts on the biggest science issues facing President-elect Obama.  But first, one of the top science issues to the next president is without doubt, clean energy and sustainability.  And a new open access online journal published by the American Institute of Physics covers it all from wind turbines to tidal power, hydrogen technology to geothermal heat pumps.  The first issue of the Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy came out this week.  One of the papers in the debut issue describes that tiny solar array smaller than a fingernail.  Wow.  That's made from carbon-based polymers and these aren't your father's solar cells - you know, you don't put these on your house or your car. They're actually serving as a power supply for tiny micro censors like nanoscale devices used to detect more dangerous chemicals, so to speak.   Joining me now to talk more about the new energy journal and the miniature solar technology is my guest Craig Taylor. He's one of the editors of the Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy.  He's also a professor of Physics at Colorado School of Mines and Associate Director of the Colorado Energy Research Institute in Golden, Colorado.  He joins us from Golden.  Welcome to Science Friday. Professor CRAIG TAYLOR (Editor, Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy): Thank you very much. FLATOW:  It's interesting that - I imagine there'll going to be a lot of sort of new kinds of alternative energy devices showing up. Prof. TAYLOR:  We certainly hope so.  We're looking forward to publishing a lot of papers like the one you just mentioned. FLATOW:  Where can we find your paper online now? Prof. TAYLOR:  If you go to jrse - jrse. ait. org. FLATOW:  Give us an idea of the range and the kinds of stuff you're going to be covering in the journal. Prof. TAYLOR:  Well, as you mentioned in your introduction, we're covering bio energy, bio-reactions and bio-engineering.  We're covering geothermal energy, marine energy - that is waves and things like that and hydroelectric power from dams.  We're actually covering nuclear energy which is not strictly renewable but certainly can be sustainable for a very long time. Solar energy you mentioned, solar cells and solar thermal devices, energy from wind - wind turbines, the conversion of energy by using, for example, fuel cells to produce hydrogen.   Energy efficiency is really important so energy-efficient buildings we will cover. We cover storage that's incredibly important for those forms of energy that vary with time like solar energy and wind energy.  They may cover power distribution.  And resource assessment is also important. Where does the sun shine the best and so on.  And the transportation - that is clean ways of improving transportation.  So a very, very wide range of topics. FLATOW:  Our number 1-800-989-8255.  The phones are wide open.  We're also frittering, you can get us at scifritter if you want to Twitter with us.  You can go write the @ sign followed by scifritter and we can come a fritter for you and we can tweet, as they say.  Do you know what's that about, Craig? Prof. TAYLOR:  No. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW:  It's a new way of communicating.  People telling each other about stuff that is going on and it's the hottest rage, supposedly taking over blogging these days. Prof. TAYLOR:  Wow.  Well, I guess it shows you how old I am. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW:  You better get it to your new journal.  I mean, is this a journal that lay people can read or is it aimed at science - real science geeks? Prof. TAYLOR:  It's definitely aimed at real scientists and engineers.  But we hope to publish some review articles that might be understandable reasonably well by the general public. FLATOW:  And this is a good for this type of journalism now isn't it? Prof. TAYLOR:  Well, we hope so.  We're certainly counting on it.  The difficulty with anything to do with renewable energy is that the - all of the problems are so interdisciplinary that you need to cover a wide range of topics in order to make progress. FLATOW:  And how many entries - are they coming in or you're just starting out, you don't have a whole lot to choose from? Prof. TAYLOR:  Well, right as of now, we have over 50 in the pipeline.  There only a couple up on the public website right now.  But they'll be coming up very quickly in the future. FLATOW:  Let's talk about one of those and that is those miniature organic solar cells in the first issue.  What - tell us what they are and how small they are?  On your web page, you say that they're size of a circle.  The O in the paper. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. TAYLOR:  That's right.  Well, this is a very interesting application, affordable to access (ph) that I frankly would have never thought of.  It's, as you said, the use of solar cells to power very small micro-mechanical devices - and probably the most used devices, this type is the accelerometer that's in your car to drive the air bags.  So it senses very rapid deceleration.  And that's a micro electro-mechanical machine.  But of course, it's run off the electrical power of your car.  And this would be a way of actually powering such devices in maybe a hostile environment where you're looking for chemicals in a smokestack or something like that. FLATOW:  So go ahead. Describe the cell to us.  Prof. TAYLOR:  OK.  Well. It's a cell that uses organics so it uses polymers mixed with a very small atom - group of atoms of carbon known as carbon-60.  It's sometimes called a. . . FLATOW:  A buckyball. Prof. TAYLOR:  Buckyball, that's right because it has the Buckminsterfullerene geodesic dome structure. FLATOW:  So you have the polymers mixed in with buckyballs. Prof. TAYLOR:  Right.  And then you can - the light gets absorbed in this material, and it generates electrons and also generates absence of electrons which is holes.  And then these are collected at the opposite electrodes and create and create a current. FLATOW:  And how much current and how much voltage, wattage? Prof. TAYLOR:  The current is very, very minimal.  A few micro amps is all that's necessary because these devices are very, very small.  The difficulty - and I thought it was very interesting that these people were able to make some progress on it, the difficulty is in voltage.  These devices typically need a very large voltage so order of 10 volts for example.  So - and of course, most of electronic devices work in lower voltages. FLATOW:  Just like four batteries. Prof. TAYLOR:  Yes, that's right.  But you don't need much current so this initial device, I think, produced around eight volts.  And the way they do that is they string the cells in series to increase the voltage. FLATOW:  And so this might be used - I understand that the Department of Defense is invested heavily in this project and see it as - there's a lot of sunlight over there where we have the military.  And why not take advantage of it? Prof. TAYLOR:  Well, that's right, and they're interested in larger areas, but they're interested in flexible substances so you can wear it on your clothes and things of that sort. FLATOW:  So you can go out in the field and powering, you know, I guess will be the uniform of tomorrow or actually of today because we know batteries are great premium over where we were five. . .   Prof. TAYLOR:  That's right, and they're not very environmentally friendly, either.  Most of them. FLATOW:  And how close is something like this to actually being made and to reality or was just sort of an idea? Prof. TAYLOR:  I would have to say it's quite a few years away from any useful production there.  The reason is that they produce the cell that is about two square centimeters.  So maybe a thumbnail or two.  They hope to produce cells as small as a hundredth of a millimeter. FLATOW:  Right. Prof. TAYLOR:  So, they - that they have a long way to go when it comes to the area. FLATOW:  So you're thinking that journal then will become like an incubator for ideas like this. Prof. TAYLOR:  That's what we hope.  And we also hope that people who need to know something about solar cells, but they are experts in - for example fluctuating power or inverters or something very different while wind turbines can give - go to our journal and read the - what they need to know from other fields. FLATOW:  And you decided to make it open access. Prof. TAYLOR:  That's correct.  At least for the first year. In fact we are hoping to keep it open access forever.  That depends on whether or not we can get enough under writers on our site, people who care about renewable energy, companies that care about renewable energy. FLATOW:  And that means if that I like an idea that I see there, I cannot take a patent out on it or call it my own intellectual property. Prof. TAYLOR:  That's correct. FLATOW:  And anybody can - you go into this if you have published in your magazine knowing that this is going to be freely available for other people to use. Prof. TAYLOR:  Well, that's right.  But of course, you can patent an idea from any open-access journal if you file patent ahead of time. FLATOW:  Mm hmm.  And how many subscribe - do you have to subscribe to this or do you. . . Prof. TAYLOR:  No, we don't have a subscription base, and we hope not to have to have a subscription base, so you can go to this website and look at the articles.  Go to the website and submit a paper. FLATOW:  Mm hmm.  And who referees this paper? Prof. TAYLOR:  Well, that's been a tough a task for us because it's such an interdisciplinary journal that we're working very, very hard at getting a referee base.  In fact if there are any listeners out there who'd like to help us, we'd love to put them on our list. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. TAYLOR:  These would be scientists who were our peers in the particular field. FLATOW:  Well, you know, it looks there - it reminds me about place, you know, in the old days - they used to have the water cooler or the coffee pot where people of different interests and disciplines could come together in schmooze and trade ideas, and where they might not have come before and actually - somebody else might come away with hey I heard Joe say something - you know, and that gives me an idea how to work on something. Prof. TAYLOR:  That's right.  That's right.  It's kind of an electronic coffee room. FLATOW:  Because everybody is sitting by their desks these days and no one's - you know, we used to have people get up and leave and do stuff, but now everybody is at their desk, so they're on a virtual water cooler. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. TAYLOR:  Right. FLATOW: Which is the internet. Prof. TAYLOR:  That's right.  That's right.  And it is a new venture even for the American Institute of Physics.  So I think we are only the third entirely online journal that they've established, but we're really hoping that it will work. FLATOW:  And how often will - if the publications come out during the week, a month or. . . Prof. TAYLOR:  For the first year, it will come out every two months.  We are really focusing on quality.  The American Institute of Physics is a world-class publisher and the quality is just very, very important for all of their journals. FLATOW:  Mm hmm. Prof. TAYLOR:  So, we'll start small every two months, and we hope after the first year to have an issue come out every month. FLATOW:  And so we - you're inviting people to come to your website and have a read. Prof. TAYLOR:  Absolutely.  Send us a paper. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW:  OK. And you've got us going with the paper already.  Thank you, Craig. Prof. TAYLOR:  You're welcome. FLATOW:  Craig Taylor is one of the editors of the new Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy and of course he must have a daytime job.  He's also professor of physics at the Colorado School of Mines and Associate Director of the Colorado Energy Research Institute in Golden, Colorado.  We're going to take a break.  Switch gears.  When we come back we're going to talk about, oh, a new kind of, you know, MIT kids?  These whiz kids are MITs they - they  always have kinds of new projects.  We have new project going on up there.  A new Jamboree that you maybe interested in that has to do with all kinds of genetic engineering sort of things.  So stay with us.  We'll be right back after this break.  IRA FLATOW, host:  It's the Talk of the Nation's Science Friday.  I'm Ira Flatow.  A little bit later, your thoughts on the biggest science issues facing President-elect Obama.  But first, one of the top science issues to the next president is without doubt, clean energy and sustainability.  And a new open access online journal published by the American Institute of Physics covers it all from wind turbines to tidal power, hydrogen technology to geothermal heat pumps.  The first issue of the Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy came out this week.  One of the papers in the debut issue describes that tiny solar array smaller than a fingernail.  Wow.  That's made from carbon-based polymers and these aren't your father's solar cells - you know, you don't put these on your house or your car. They're actually serving as a power supply for tiny micro censors like nanoscale devices used to detect more dangerous chemicals, so to speak.    Joining me now to talk more about the new energy journal and the miniature solar technology is my guest Craig Taylor. He's one of the editors of the Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy.  He's also a professor of Physics at Colorado School of Mines and Associate Director of the Colorado Energy Research Institute in Golden, Colorado.  He joins us from Golden.  Welcome to Science Friday.  Professor CRAIG TAYLOR (Editor, Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy): Thank you very much.  FLATOW:  It's interesting that - I imagine there'll going to be a lot of sort of new kinds of alternative energy devices showing up.  Prof. TAYLOR:  We certainly hope so.  We're looking forward to publishing a lot of papers like the one you just mentioned.  FLATOW:  Where can we find your paper online now?  Prof. TAYLOR:  If you go to jrse - jrse. ait. org.  FLATOW:  Give us an idea of the range and the kinds of stuff you're going to be covering in the journal.  Prof. TAYLOR:  Well, as you mentioned in your introduction, we're covering bio energy, bio-reactions and bio-engineering.  We're covering geothermal energy, marine energy - that is waves and things like that and hydroelectric power from dams.  We're actually covering nuclear energy which is not strictly renewable but certainly can be sustainable for a very long time. Solar energy you mentioned, solar cells and solar thermal devices, energy from wind - wind turbines, the conversion of energy by using, for example, fuel cells to produce hydrogen.    Energy efficiency is really important so energy-efficient buildings we will cover. We cover storage that's incredibly important for those forms of energy that vary with time like solar energy and wind energy.  They may cover power distribution.  And resource assessment is also important. Where does the sun shine the best and so on.  And the transportation - that is clean ways of improving transportation.  So a very, very wide range of topics.  FLATOW:  Our number 1-800-989-8255.  The phones are wide open.  We're also frittering, you can get us at scifritter if you want to Twitter with us.  You can go write the @ sign followed by scifritter and we can come a fritter for you and we can tweet, as they say.  Do you know what's that about, Craig?  Prof. TAYLOR:  No.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW:  It's a new way of communicating.  People telling each other about stuff that is going on and it's the hottest rage, supposedly taking over blogging these days.  Prof. TAYLOR:  Wow.  Well, I guess it shows you how old I am.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW:  You better get it to your new journal.  I mean, is this a journal that lay people can read or is it aimed at science - real science geeks?  Prof. TAYLOR:  It's definitely aimed at real scientists and engineers.  But we hope to publish some review articles that might be understandable reasonably well by the general public.  FLATOW:  And this is a good for this type of journalism now isn't it?  Prof. TAYLOR:  Well, we hope so.  We're certainly counting on it.  The difficulty with anything to do with renewable energy is that the - all of the problems are so interdisciplinary that you need to cover a wide range of topics in order to make progress.  FLATOW:  And how many entries - are they coming in or you're just starting out, you don't have a whole lot to choose from?  Prof. TAYLOR:  Well, right as of now, we have over 50 in the pipeline.  There only a couple up on the public website right now.  But they'll be coming up very quickly in the future.  FLATOW:  Let's talk about one of those and that is those miniature organic solar cells in the first issue.  What - tell us what they are and how small they are?  On your web page, you say that they're size of a circle.  The O in the paper.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Prof. TAYLOR:  That's right.  Well, this is a very interesting application, affordable to access (ph) that I frankly would have never thought of.  It's, as you said, the use of solar cells to power very small micro-mechanical devices - and probably the most used devices, this type is the accelerometer that's in your car to drive the air bags.  So it senses very rapid deceleration.  And that's a micro electro-mechanical machine.  But of course, it's run off the electrical power of your car.  And this would be a way of actually powering such devices in maybe a hostile environment where you're looking for chemicals in a smokestack or something like that.  FLATOW:  So go ahead. Describe the cell to us.   Prof. TAYLOR:  OK.  Well. It's a cell that uses organics so it uses polymers mixed with a very small atom - group of atoms of carbon known as carbon-60.  It's sometimes called a. . .  FLATOW:  A buckyball.  Prof. TAYLOR:  Buckyball, that's right because it has the Buckminsterfullerene geodesic dome structure.  FLATOW:  So you have the polymers mixed in with buckyballs.  Prof. TAYLOR:  Right.  And then you can - the light gets absorbed in this material, and it generates electrons and also generates absence of electrons which is holes.  And then these are collected at the opposite electrodes and create and create a current.  FLATOW:  And how much current and how much voltage, wattage?  Prof. TAYLOR:  The current is very, very minimal.  A few micro amps is all that's necessary because these devices are very, very small.  The difficulty - and I thought it was very interesting that these people were able to make some progress on it, the difficulty is in voltage.

And why not take advantage of it?  Prof. TAYLOR:  Well, that's right, and they're interested in larger areas, but they're interested in flexible substances so you can wear it on your clothes and things of that sort.  FLATOW:  So you can go out in the field and powering, you know, I guess will be the uniform of tomorrow or actually of today because we know batteries are great premium over where we were five. . .    Prof. TAYLOR:  That's right, and they're not very environmentally friendly, either.  Most of them.  FLATOW:  And how close is something like this to actually being made and to reality or was just sort of an idea?  Prof. TAYLOR:  I would have to say it's quite a few years away from any useful production there.  The reason is that they produce the cell that is about two square centimeters.  So maybe a thumbnail or two.  They hope to produce cells as small as a hundredth of a millimeter.  FLATOW:  Right.

I'm Ira Flatow.  Can you heard of the bacterio-clock?  Yeah, can't get one for the holidays.  How about bactricity maybe a baccum-cleaner?  Well, you haven't heard of that?  Well, they have one thing in common.  They are all synthetic biology projects that whiz kid undergraduates have dreamt up for the 2008 International Genetically Engineered Machine competition, the iGEM.  The idea is to use a tool box of biological parts like different snippets of DNA, for example. To build a machine that operates inside living cells, inside bacteria, inside yeast. And using this approach, students are making cellular biofuel factories, they're devising organic sensors, even solving simple calculations with bacterial computers.   In five years, the program has grown from just a few teams to over 80 and the budding scientists this year hail from four continents and they are on their way to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology right now, to show off their creations in the 2008 International Genetically Engineered Machine competition, the iGEM, and that's what we're going to be talking about.  If you'd like to join us, our number is 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK, also we're now tweeting.  Twittering, you know what that is?

Your name @ sign scifritter, and we'll get a tweet from you. Also in Second Life, you can join the folks over there in Science Friday Island.   Let me introduce my guest, my first guest is a mentor to the Harvard team.  She's been involved in the iGEM since the beginning.  Pam Silver, is a professor of systems biology, director of the Harvard University Graduate program in systems biology at Harvard Med School, and she joins us from Boston.  Welcome to the program, Dr. Silver. Dr. PAM SILVER (Professor, Systems Biology, Director, Harvard Medical School):  Hello, Ira.  How are you? FLATOW:  Hi.  How are you? Dr.  SILVER:  Good. FLATOW:  My other guest has tackled his first iGEM project last year when he was still in high school.  Joining up with the University of California, San Francisco team and this year he's working with a Chinese team.  And he'll tell us a bit about he ended up there.  Eric Meltzer, is a competitor on the Beijing Peking University iGEM team.  He joins us over the phone from MIT.  Welcome to Science Friday, Eric. Mr. ERIC MELTZER (Member, Peking University iGEM team):  How's it going? FLATOW:  It's going well.  Well, let's talk about these projects.  Dr. Silver, why call these things Genetically Engineered Machines?  Aren't they cells or something?  What's the difference? Dr. SILVER:  Sure they're cells.  But they're machine, so machines do work, Ira.  They take in energy, and they do things.  So if you think about the kinds of machines you know. Your car takes you to work.  Drills make holes, we use computers to do calculations, but these are all non-renewing machines they don't self replicate themselves.  Then you think about what nature does.  Nature presents this with an overwhelming number of engineering ideas that aren't even being tackled by regular engineers.  Cells are incredibly elegant machines.  They can capture light and make things, they can sense single-odorant molecules, and sent signals to your brain.  So we have all of nature at our - we need to take advantage of all of nature and understand it to build interesting things. FLATOW:  So, basically are we hooking up sort of parts of our bodies to parts of machines or give me an example. Dr. SILVER:  Well, the simplest examples are some of the ones you began with are taking various - taking bacteria which is - probably the one of the best well-oiled machines that nature makes, and programming it to do things, so for example programming it to count, programming it to take pictures.  One of the original iGEM projects in the first year was making the E. coli graph.  So these were bacteria that were sensitive to light and could either make themselves either black or white.  And so you could make a picture from a group of cells growing together.  So those are some of the simplest examples.  I think you mentioned some this year, I happened to like the Harvard team one, obviously, of making cells that could measure current.  There is one I was looking through - there's making cells that will stick to things because they're going to make them muscle that the protein from muscles that causes them to stick to surfaces. FLATOW:  Mm hmm. Dr. SILVER:  So those are examples - those are very simple examples, and we work with bacteria usually in the iGEM teams because they grow fast.  We have a number of parts that can be use in bacteria - as I said they're already the well-oiled machine that nature gives us. FLATOW:  Yes. Dr. SILVER:  To work with.  That said, going forward, my laboratory and many others hope to extend this beyond simple organisms. FLATOW:  Mm hmm.  Eric, let's talk about your project.  You're competing this year with the Peking University team.  How did you end up there? Mr. MELTZER:  Actually, we met Peking at the Jamboree last year, and there was kind of talk of a bit exchange and I immediately thought that it will be really, really cool so I kind of jump on the opportunity, and it ended up that two Peking students came to UCFF this year, and I went there. FLATOW:  Mm hmm.  And what is your project? Mr. MELTZER:  So our project is an evolution machine. So essentially like in the same way that species will evolve to suit its niche like Darwin finches, for example, proteins will also evolve to better suit their purpose. FLATOW:  Mm hmm. Mr. MELTZER:  So like maybe you'd have a protein that a bacteria might use to copy DNA, and it will get better and better in copying DNA or maybe you know other protein will get better and better at breaking down the certain nutrient.  But in nature, it takes millions and millions of years to actually do that.  And so, in the lab you can actually - you can shorten that period down. You can shorten that down to maybe a few months or maybe half a year to produce a new protein by directed evolution.  But it's a really, really difficult process to do, and it's also - it's not very creative work, so it's kind of the work the most scientists hate to do.  And at Peking we thought this work was actually much better suited for bacteria than it was for people.  So we created this genetic circuit to run the whole process.  And actually very recently we got back some data that says it works.  So we're really excited. FLATOW:  What do you mean it works?  What does working mean? Mr. MELTZER:  Well, so essentially we took a protein we called the GAL4(ph), and it's a protein that found in yeast.  And actually we're using yeast rather than bacteria because yeast is - of other single cells it is very, very similar to a lot of mammalian cells and a lot of the cells that make up our own body.  Yeast is that you carry it which means that it has real nucleus, and it can process proteins in a very complex whether maybe bacteria can't.  So we decided to actually put our whole project into yeast.  Suddenly when we took this protein called GAL4, and we essentially broke it.  We made it so it doesn't work anymore and cancels all its function.  And then we put it to our evolution machine and then setup the machine such that it would evolve the protein back to full function.  And you know, this is a kind of a first proof of concept thing.  We weren't entirely sure it would work and no one was, you know, that optimistic, and then it ended up working terrifically.  So it's back to full function. FLATOW:  Mm hmm.  Dr. Silver, tell us what the Harvard team is working on this year? Dr. SILVER:  The Harvard team is trying to take advantage of cells that produce electrical current and to use that current as a measuring device, so they are going to interface this current producing cells with other cells that say, secrete something, and then the current producing cells will registered that as a current, and send it off to a vault meters.  So you can measure how much - directly how much is going on in the system.  So they're basically using the cells to generate current and as a measuring device. FLATOW:  Mm hmm. Dr. SILVER:  And there's actually - it looks like theirs actually may work too. FLATOW:  We have a tweeter - we're twittering.  Do you know what twittering is, Dr. Silver? (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. SILVER:  Yes.  Of course I know that.  Of course.  Do you know. . . FLATOW:  Well, I'm just finding out.  We're - actually Science Friday is twittering.  We have as we. . . Dr. SILVER:  So we need to make a bacteria that can twitter, right? FLATOW:  Can you make us one? (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. SILVER:  Sure. FLATOW:  I know seriously - can you make a bacteria that could twitter?  I mean, if somehow work with that. . . Dr. SILVER:  That's in essence making a simple counter which is - there are many iGEM teams trying to make bacterial computers or. . . FLATOW:  Right. Dr. SILVER:  Computer in yeast for examples, that those are some of the iGEM projects. FLATOW:  Well, we are twittering at Science Friday starting this - today and here's how you can twitter with us. Dr. SILVER:  That's really exciting. FLATOW:  You can write - do you write the @ sign followed by scifritter, that's our name - scifritter and you can twitter along with us, and we'll be very happy to hear from you.  In fact we have our very first Twitter message or tweet as they call it.  Coming in from Elainetrain(ph).  The question is can a grad students come from any school?  How do you get involve in this? Dr. SILVER:  So hi, Elaine and congratulations on being the first Twitter.  That's really exciting.  And so the beauty of iGEM is - it's very much grassroots, so any school can start a team.  The first step is you go to the website, iGEM, and it gives you very precise instructions on how to start a team, you don't need a lot of money to start a team.  What you really need are students that are willing to be engaged and willing to empower themselves to spend the summer doing this and asking themselves what do you want to build. So Elaine, what do you want to build? (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW:  She'll answer back and I guess she'll twitter back her answer. Dr. SILVER:  OK. FLATOW:  Eric, tell us your thoughts on that.  How - is it scary?  Do you feel like you're up against some big competition? Mr. MELTZER:  Well, I mean, so I guess last year when I was on the UCFF team, we were all from various high schools, and our team was the only high school team among a bunch of undergrads, and I mean UCFF was very supportive in that process and I think I'd like to echo what Pamela said that really anyone can get involved in iGEM. All it takes is interest and at Peking University we had a 160 or 170 people in the iGEM club, you know, fighting to be on the team.  So, the really - the interest is definitely there, and it's just very open thing which is great. FLATOW:  Let's go to the phone. Dr. SILVER:  And I think. . . FLATOW:  OK. Dr. SILVER:  Well, can I echo in? FLATOW:  Oh, go ahead. Dr. SILVER:  Another thing that Eric - I'm really impressed with the high school students that were involved in this and we're hoping to engage more high school students. They've really exemplified what iGEM is all about, and kudos to you Eric for doing that. FLATOW:  We're talking this hour about a synthetic biology science fair if you just joined us, coming up at MIT this weekend. It's called iGEM the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition.  Let's go to Shamari(ph) in Oakland.  Hi, there. SHAMARI (Caller):  Hello.  Thanks for taking my call. FLATOW:  Sure.   SHAMARI:  Yeah, I just had a question about Dr. Silver had mentioned that a bacterial-like machine? And my question was how do you make a bacteria machine?  Do you modify the DNA of the bacteria or? How do you do that? FLATOW:  Yeah, take a - good question.  Dr. Silver or Eric take us through the steps.  How do you put the parts together? Dr. SILVER:  So, there are pieces of DNA and they are introduced into the bacteria on what we call vectors. These are pieces of DNA that are capable of self-replicating as the cell divides.  And that's how you introduce the parts into the cell.  You add a bunch of salts and things like that to get the DNA in, and then you use a drug resistance marker or some other way to make sure that the plasmid has gotten into the cells.  That may have been a little technical.  FLATOW:  Keep going. Dr. SILVER:  It's a piece of DNA. FLATOW:  And then what when. . . Dr. SILVER:  And it goes into the cell and because DNA is the genetic material it is capable of replicating itself. FLATOW:  OK, keep going.  So it replicates in the cell, and then how does it turn it into a machine. Dr. SILVER:  That's where the design component comes in.  So, if you want to, for example, make a cell that can count then you need to design the parts that you need, and then you produce the DNA that you need for the cell to make those parts. FLATOW:  So, the DNA. . . Dr. SILVER:  And those parts can be DNA, they can be RNA, they can be proteins, they can be lipids, they can be any part of the cell. FLATOW:  Any part - and this - can we make the cell light up when it comes up with the answer? Dr. SILVER:  Yes.  Absolutely.  In fact the Nobel Prize was just given for a protein - a very special protein from the jellyfish which naturally fluoresces, and so it's a very powerful tool in that you can put in bacteria, and they will turn green when they have this protein so they can tell you an answer.  So, for example there was an iGEM project from the University of Edinburgh team where they made cells that could sense the level of arsenide in water. And so they would light up in response to how much arsenide was there, and this actually turns out to be a very useful machine because arsenide in well water is a serious problem in the third world.  So, that's a really nice example of a team doing something that has a direct application in the world. FLATOW:  Talking about iGEM this hour on Talk of the Nation: Science Friday from NPR News.  Talking with Dr. Pam Silver and with Eric Meltzer.  So, you theoretically could then take all these little parts and put them into people?  Into our own cells to monitor you know if we're getting sick or ill or poisoned? Dr. SILVER:  Sure why not. FLATOW:  Or any of that kind of that stuff? Mr. MELTZER:  Yeah. Dr. SILVER:  Sure that's the dream. FLATOW:  Eric, Eric. Mr. MELTZER:  Well, yeah.  A group that came to mind at Berkley that's making a bacteria that essentially can go through your veins and can search for cancer, and so it detects tumors because tumors tend to have lower oxygen than the rest of the body, they are not as well served by blood vessels.  And so this E. coli which has been specially modified to not set off your immune system can then just hunt through your body for tumors and when it finds one they can do a lot of things, they could you know, as we previously mentioned they can light up using that green fluorescent protein and then another thing that it could do that the people who are working on this at Berkley have engineered it to do is release a factor called tumor necrosis factor that actually shrinks the tumor. FLATOW:  Wow. Mr. MELTZER:  You could really have these bacteria you know, patrolling your body for cancer and that's just one of the kind of human interest. . . Dr. SILVER:  And I think it extension on that same idea is you could have cells that will deliver drugs under certain conditions. So you could have imagine having a drug delivery device that will only deliver drugs at night or something like that. FLATOW:  Eric, tell us what's going to happen this week, and there's a competition does everybody like those dioramas you see at science fairs? Mr. MELTZER:  Not quite.  Everyone has posters, and I guess actually some people do bring physical product to iGEM. Last year, the Berkley team had this bacto-blood, and so it's basically bacteria that had been engaged to express hemoglobin and they actually showed up with a few vials of this, you know, red liquid which is pretty cool. Dr. SILVER:  And remember the smelly bacteria? Mr. MELTZER:  Oh, right.  Also, MIT had a project where they had bacteria. So normally E. coli smells really, really bad, and they knocked out the genes that made it smell bad and they put in some genes it made it smell like a mint and smell like bananas and all sorts of nice things. So they had that  and they have people sniffing it which is pretty cool. FLATOW:  Wow, so you can make that sounds like a product? Mr. MELTZER:  Oh, yeah. Dr. SILVER:  Those are called Eau d'Coli. FLATOW:  And so there'll be people be competing - is there a prize? You make - do you win big prize money here? Mr. MELTZER:  It's not money.  There are a few awards there's like finalists and there are various medals given out for compliance with standard which I guess the big part of iGEM is that they are really trying to get people to make this standardized parts so that other teams can use them later and they are giving awards for, you know, the degree of compliance with that and then there's also you know, real awards for like how well the project did and all that kind of thing.  But there's a competition. FLATOW:  Do you patent it?  I mean will somebody could steal your idea?  I would think. Mr. MELTZER:  Well, thats - I guess the real beauty of iGEM for me is that it's really this open source thing, and it's like I guess at some conference is that if you go to a conference people are kind of jealously guarding their ideas and at iGEM it's the total opposite everyone is really you know there and sharing their ideas and there really is this phenomenally open thing which is great. Dr. SILVER:  I think there's also an atmosphere at least what we started - when we started iGEM of sort of everyone is a winner just showing up makes you a winner. FLATOW:  Well, where should we show - is it open to the public?  Can people go this weekend? Dr. SILVER:  Absolutely. FLATOW:  Where is it? Dr. SILVER:  It's at MIT in the Stada Center, it's a fabulous thing.  It's a you know - there is a registration  but it's going to be really crowded this year, this is the biggest year yet, there's 800 students and participants there, but people can come. FLATOW:  All right.  That's this weekend at MIT at Harvard, if you want to go see those great projects.  Good luck to you.   Dr. SILVER:  Thank you. Mr. MELTZER:  Thanks a lot, Ira. FLATOW:  Thanks Pam, thanks Eric.  Pam Silver is professor of systems biology and director of the Harvard University graduates program in system biology at Harvard Med School.  Eric Meltzer is a competitor on the Beijing Peking University's iGEM team.  Stay with us, we're going to come back and talk about what you think Barack Obama should pay attention to in science.  We'll be right back after this break.  I'm Ira Flatow. This is Talk of the Nation Science Friday from NPR News.    Genetic Engineering Conference Kicks Off At MIT  IRA FLATOW, host:  You're listening to Talk of the Nation: Science Friday.  I'm Ira Flatow.  Can you heard of the bacterio-clock?  Yeah, can't get one for the holidays.  How about bactricity maybe a baccum-cleaner?  Well, you haven't heard of that?  Well, they have one thing in common.  They are all synthetic biology projects that whiz kid undergraduates have dreamt up for the 2008 International Genetically Engineered Machine competition, the iGEM.  The idea is to use a tool box of biological parts like different snippets of DNA, for example. To build a machine that operates inside living cells, inside bacteria, inside yeast. And using this approach, students are making cellular biofuel factories, they're devising organic sensors, even solving simple calculations with bacterial computers.    In five years, the program has grown from just a few teams to over 80 and the budding scientists this year hail from four continents and they are on their way to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology right now, to show off their creations in the 2008 International Genetically Engineered Machine competition, the iGEM, and that's what we're going to be talking about.  If you'd like to join us, our number is 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK, also we're now tweeting.  Twittering, you know what that is?  You can - if you want to send us a tweet, if you don't know how to do that.  Here's how you do it.  Just write the  @ sign followed by scifritter, that's our address, scifritter.  Your name @ sign scifritter, and we'll get a tweet from you. Also in Second Life, you can join the folks over there in Science Friday Island.    Let me introduce my guest, my first guest is a mentor to the Harvard team.  She's been involved in the iGEM since the beginning.  Pam Silver, is a professor of systems biology, director of the Harvard University Graduate program in systems biology at Harvard Med School, and she joins us from Boston.  Welcome to the program, Dr. Silver.  Dr. PAM SILVER (Professor, Systems Biology, Director, Harvard Medical School):  Hello, Ira.  How are you?  FLATOW:  Hi.  How are you?  Dr.  SILVER:  Good.  FLATOW:  My other guest has tackled his first iGEM project last year when he was still in high school.  Joining up with the University of California, San Francisco team and this year he's working with a Chinese team.  And he'll tell us a bit about he ended up there.  Eric Meltzer, is a competitor on the Beijing Peking University iGEM team.  He joins us over the phone from MIT.  Welcome to Science Friday, Eric.  Mr. ERIC MELTZER (Member, Peking University iGEM team):  How's it going?  FLATOW:  It's going well.  Well, let's talk about these projects.  Dr. Silver, why call these things Genetically Engineered Machines?  Aren't they cells or something?  What's the difference?  Dr. SILVER:  Sure they're cells.  But they're machine, so machines do work, Ira.  They take in energy, and they do things.  So if you think about the kinds of machines you know. Your car takes you to work.  Drills make holes, we use computers to do calculations, but these are all non-renewing machines they don't self replicate themselves.  Then you think about what nature does.  Nature presents this with an overwhelming number of engineering ideas that aren't even being tackled by regular engineers.  Cells are incredibly elegant machines.  They can capture light and make things, they can sense single-odorant molecules, and sent signals to your brain.  So we have all of nature at our - we need to take advantage of all of nature and understand it to build interesting things.  FLATOW:  So, basically are we hooking up sort of parts of our bodies to parts of machines or give me an example.  Dr. SILVER:  Well, the simplest examples are some of the ones you began with are taking various - taking bacteria which is - probably the one of the best well-oiled machines that nature makes, and programming it to do things, so for example programming it to count, programming it to take pictures.  One of the original iGEM projects in the first year was making the E. coli graph.  So these were bacteria that were sensitive to light and could either make themselves either black or white.  And so you could make a picture from a group of cells growing together.  So those are some of the simplest examples.  I think you mentioned some this year, I happened to like the Harvard team one, obviously, of making cells that could measure current.  There is one I was looking through - there's making cells that will stick to things because they're going to make them muscle that the protein from muscles that causes them to stick to surfaces.  FLATOW:  Mm hmm.  Dr. SILVER:  So those are examples - those are very simple examples, and we work with bacteria usually in the iGEM teams because they grow fast.  We have a number of parts that can be use in bacteria - as I said they're already the well-oiled machine that nature gives us.  FLATOW:  Yes.  Dr. SILVER:  To work with.  That said, going forward, my laboratory and many others hope to extend this beyond simple organisms.  FLATOW:  Mm hmm.  Eric, let's talk about your project.  You're competing this year with the Peking University team.  How did you end up there?  Mr. MELTZER:  Actually, we met Peking at the Jamboree last year, and there was kind of talk of a bit exchange and I immediately thought that it will be really, really cool so I kind of jump on the opportunity, and it ended up that two Peking students came to UCFF this year, and I went there.  FLATOW:  Mm hmm.  And what is your project?  Mr. MELTZER:  So our project is an evolution machine. So essentially like in the same way that species will evolve to suit its niche like Darwin finches, for example, proteins will also evolve to better suit their purpose.  FLATOW:  Mm hmm.  Mr. MELTZER:  So like maybe you'd have a protein that a bacteria might use to copy DNA, and it will get better and better in copying DNA or maybe you know other protein will get better and better at breaking down the certain nutrient.  But in nature, it takes millions and millions of years to actually do that.  And so, in the lab you can actually - you can shorten that period down. You can shorten that down to maybe a few months or maybe half a year to produce a new protein by directed evolution.  But it's a really, really difficult process to do, and it's also - it's not very creative work, so it's kind of the work the most scientists hate to do.  And at Peking we thought this work was actually much better suited for bacteria than it was for people.  So we created this genetic circuit to run the whole process.  And actually very recently we got back some data that says it works.  So we're really excited.  FLATOW:  What do you mean it works?  What does working mean?  Mr. MELTZER:  Well, so essentially we took a protein we called the GAL4(ph), and it's a protein that found in yeast.  And actually we're using yeast rather than bacteria because yeast is - of other single cells it is very, very similar to a lot of mammalian cells and a lot of the cells that make up our own body.  Yeast is that you carry it which means that it has real nucleus, and it can process proteins in a very complex whether maybe bacteria can't.  So we decided to actually put our whole project into yeast.  Suddenly when we took this protein called GAL4, and we essentially broke it.  We made it so it doesn't work anymore and cancels all its function.  And then we put it to our evolution machine and then setup the machine such that it would evolve the protein back to full function.  And you know, this is a kind of a first proof of concept thing.  We weren't entirely sure it would work and no one was, you know, that optimistic, and then it ended up working terrifically.  So it's back to full function.  FLATOW:  Mm hmm.  Dr. Silver, tell us what the Harvard team is working on this year?  Dr. SILVER:  The Harvard team is trying to take advantage of cells that produce electrical current and to use that current as a measuring device, so they are going to interface this current producing cells with other cells that say, secrete something, and then the current producing cells will registered that as a current, and send it off to a vault meters.  So you can measure how much - directly how much is going on in the system.  So they're basically using the cells to generate current and as a measuring device.  FLATOW:  Mm hmm.  Dr. SILVER:  And there's actually - it looks like theirs actually may work too.  FLATOW:  We have a tweeter - we're twittering.  Do you know what twittering is, Dr. Silver?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. SILVER:  Yes.  Of course I know that.  Of course.  Do you know. . .  FLATOW:  Well, I'm just finding out.  We're - actually Science Friday is twittering.  We have as we. . .  Dr. SILVER:  So we need to make a bacteria that can twitter, right?  FLATOW:  Can you make us one?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. SILVER:  Sure.  FLATOW:  I know seriously - can you make a bacteria that could twitter?  I mean, if somehow work with that. . .  Dr. SILVER:  That's in essence making a simple counter which is - there are many iGEM teams trying to make bacterial computers or. . .  FLATOW:  Right.  Dr. SILVER:  Computer in yeast for examples, that those are some of the iGEM projects.  FLATOW:  Well, we are twittering at Science Friday starting this - today and here's how you can twitter with us.  Dr. SILVER:  That's really exciting.  FLATOW:  You can write - do you write the @ sign followed by scifritter, that's our name - scifritter and you can twitter along with us, and we'll be very happy to hear from you.  In fact we have our very first Twitter message or tweet as they call it.  Coming in from Elainetrain(ph).  The question is can a grad students come from any school?  How do you get involve in this?  Dr. SILVER:  So hi, Elaine and congratulations on being the first Twitter.  That's really exciting.  And so the beauty of iGEM is - it's very much grassroots, so any school can start a team.  The first step is you go to the website, iGEM, and it gives you very precise instructions on how to start a team, you don't need a lot of money to start a team.  What you really need are students that are willing to be engaged and willing to empower themselves to spend the summer doing this and asking themselves what do you want to build. So Elaine, what do you want to build?  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW:  She'll answer back and I guess she'll twitter back her answer.  Dr. SILVER:  OK.  FLATOW:  Eric, tell us your thoughts on that.  How - is it scary?  Do you feel like you're up against some big competition?  Mr. MELTZER:  Well, I mean, so I guess last year when I was on the UCFF team, we were all from various high schools, and our team was the only high school team among a bunch of undergrads, and I mean UCFF was very supportive in that process and I think I'd like to echo what Pamela said that really anyone can get involved in iGEM. All it takes is interest and at Peking University we had a 160 or 170 people in the iGEM club, you know, fighting to be on the team.  So, the really - the interest is definitely there, and it's just very open thing which is great.  FLATOW:  Let's go to the phone.  Dr. SILVER:  And I think. . .  FLATOW:  OK.  Dr. SILVER:  Well, can I echo in?  FLATOW:  Oh, go ahead.  Dr. SILVER:  Another thing that Eric - I'm really impressed with the high school students that were involved in this and we're hoping to engage more high school students. They've really exemplified what iGEM is all about, and kudos to you Eric for doing that.  FLATOW:  We're talking this hour about a synthetic biology science fair if you just joined us, coming up at MIT this weekend. It's called iGEM the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition.  Let's go to Shamari(ph) in Oakland.  Hi, there.  SHAMARI (Caller):  Hello.  Thanks for taking my call.

Talking with Dr. Pam Silver and with Eric Meltzer.  So, you theoretically could then take all these little parts and put them into people?  Into our own cells to monitor you know if we're getting sick or ill or poisoned?  Dr. SILVER:  Sure why not.  FLATOW:  Or any of that kind of that stuff?  Mr. MELTZER:  Yeah.  Dr. SILVER:  Sure that's the dream.  FLATOW:  Eric, Eric.  Mr. MELTZER:  Well, yeah.  A group that came to mind at Berkley that's making a bacteria that essentially can go through your veins and can search for cancer, and so it detects tumors because tumors tend to have lower oxygen than the rest of the body, they are not as well served by blood vessels.  And so this E. coli which has been specially modified to not set off your immune system can then just hunt through your body for tumors and when it finds one they can do a lot of things, they could you know, as we previously mentioned they can light up using that green fluorescent protein and then another thing that it could do that the people who are working on this at Berkley have engineered it to do is release a factor called tumor necrosis factor that actually shrinks the tumor.

Everyone has posters, and I guess actually some people do bring physical product to iGEM.

Dr. SILVER:  Those are called Eau d'Coli.  FLATOW:  And so there'll be people be competing - is there a prize? You make - do you win big prize money here?  Mr. MELTZER:  It's not money.  There are a few awards there's like finalists and there are various medals given out for compliance with standard which I guess the big part of iGEM is that they are really trying to get people to make this standardized parts so that other teams can use them later and they are giving awards for, you know, the degree of compliance with that and then there's also you know, real awards for like how well the project did and all that kind of thing.

There's a short list of icons in science, people who are both excellent researchers, also public symbols of what science is and does, and to anyone who's a fan of magazines like, perhaps, National Geographic, Jane Goodall is one of those icons.  From her groundbreaking work with chimpanzees in the Gombe in the 1960s, to her tireless advocacy for the environment today, she has earned her place in the Science Hall of Fame.  And she's back with us today.   So without further ado, I formally introduce my guest.  Jane Goodall is a primatologist and an environmental advocate.  She's co-winner of the 2008 Leakey Prize, and is the founder of the Jane Goodall Institute based in Arlington, Virginia.  And she joins us today from CBC studios in Toronto.  Welcome back to the program. Ms. JANE GOODALL (Primatologist; Environmental Advocate):  Well, thank you.  Thank you for inviting me. FLATOW:  It's been too long.  The last time you were on here was 2002. Ms. GOODALL:  Goodness. FLATOW:  Yeah.  Are you any more optimistic now about the prospects for the environment since then? Ms. GOODALL:  Well, I think I feel about the same.  And, you know, we're at the cross roads, we have been for the last several years.  And if we don't take action, us collectively, then maybe it's too late.  But we haven't gotten to that point yet. FLATOW:  Your group, Roots and Shoots, is an outreach to young people.  It's been going now - what, for 17 years? Ms. GOODALL:  Yes, since 1991.  But it didn't really leave Tanzania till about '93.  And so, you know, it's now in about 100 countries.  It has programs from preschool through university.  And even some senior citizens have formed groups, and it's in prison.  So it's approximately 9,000 active groups. FLATOW:  Wow.  And so some of these kids are now grown up, they have - they've gone out now on their own, and making their own marks as adults. Ms. GOODALL:  Absolutely.  And what I love is that one of the young Tanzanians who was with us right at the very beginning, he left, he got a degree in the U. S. , he got a job because he got a wife and family.  But now that we have raised more money, we can offer people employment.  He's back being the Tanzanian national director of the program.  And it's just - it's really wonderful to see this person who has never lost that commitment that he got as a child. FLATOW:  That's terrific.  1-800-989-8255, if you'd like to speak with Jane Goodall.  There are still researchers out there in the Gombe observing the chimps.  What kinds of things are they learning?  We've spoken - I've seen you recently out in San Francisco, seems like they're still learning all kinds of fascinating things about how the chimps behave. Ms. GOODALL:  Well, they really are.  And of course, a lot of what they're learning is the result of the long-term studies that began in 1960, coming up to 50 years.  Chimpanzees can live to be more than 60, so it does take a long time.  But one of the more recent technologies we've been able to incorporate is DNA testing of fecal samples which will tell us who the fathers are.  We've never known before.  So this opens up a whole new area.  You know, is there possibly any special relationship between a father and his biological child?  It's hard to see how that could be.  But maybe there is, we don't know. FLATOW:  I have a question here for you from Second Life and it's - is it possible to balance activism and advocacy with scientific research without risking the objectivity of the researcher or your objectivism as he puts it? Ms. GOODALL:  Well, I have - you know, we have serious concerns about objectivity in science.  Yes, we have to be objective.  But we should not be objective at the expense of being a human.  We should be able to have compassion and empathy at the same time, as we can stand to stand back and be objective about what's going on.  But without that, if you don't allow yourself to feel some empathy or some compassion, then science can become, I think, a very cold, hard and potentially dangerous profession. FLATOW:  You were just awarded the Leakey Prize for your work in evolutionary science.  I don't think most people have heard, at least heard of what that means.  Can you give us an idea what that whole field is about? Ms. GOODALL:  Exactly the reason I got - I was able to get into this field at the beginning, because my mentor, the late Lewis Leakey, he spent his life searching for the fossilized remains of early humans.  And he felt way ahead of his time that if we understood the behavior of our closest relatives in the natural state - that's chimpanzees and then gorillas, orangutans, and (unintelligible) that this might help him to have a better feeling for how early humans might have behaved.  Because the argument is if you find behavior that's similar or the same in chimpanzees today and humans today, the modern human, modern chimp, then possibly that behavior was present in a common ancestor, ape-like, human-like about six million years ago.  And that therefore we may have brought that characteristic or those characteristics with us throughout a long evolutionary journey.  And then, he liked to, you know - feel, 'yes, that will give me a better handle on how the Stone Age people behaved. ' FLATOW:  Do you still feel Lewis Leakey around with you?  Do you still. . . Ms. GOODALL:  Do I still what? FLATOW:  Is he still present for you - Lewis Leakey? Ms. GOODALL:  Oh, sometimes he is.  He was such a larger than life character.  And, you know, he was such an amazing person. FLATOW:  He was a seminal figure in your life. Ms. GOODALL:  Oh, absolutely.  I mean, goodness.  When he offered me this opportunity, I had no degree of any kind.  I was straight out from England.  And all he knew about me was that one, I've certainly read a lot about animals, I could answer lots of his questions.  And two, when he let me go with himself, his wife, and one young English girl, and a few Kenyans to (unintelligible) Gorge, now a very famous site of many human fossil discoveries.  But in those days, there was nothing there, it was just animals, no humans are being found.  And I think he was sort of watching how I behaved out on the plains and what I did when a young male lion followed for a good many yards.  And that's when he decided to offer this opportunity to me. FLATOW:  Over these past 40 years, has your idea or your own definition of what intelligence means changed as you watched the apes, the primates, and even (unintelligible). Ms. GOODALL:  Well, it's very, very clear.  When I began in 1960, I was told when I finally got to Cambridge University that only humans had minds and that animals, other than humans animals, were incapable of anything like thinking.  That was the accepted attitude of the European ethologists, people who study animal behavior.  And, of course, it's so obvious when you see these intelligent creatures out in the wild that they are thinking, that they definitely are capable of rational thought, and that's been substantiated again and again with experiments in the laboratory.  So I think my feeling is probably about the same, but I understand it better.  But the majority of animal behavior scientists, their attitude has changed. FLATOW:  What kinds of things have you seen for example?  One or two things that changed, that would change someone who goes out in the field and sees their behavior. Ms. GOODALL:  Well, I think if you have the opportunity to watch the young ones so closely observing the behavior of others and then imitating what they've seen and practicing it, tool-using, and it's fascinating to see a young one invent something new, doing something different and how all the other young ones all watch that and sometimes imitate, which is how new cultural traditions are introduced into a group, and something which is very, very simple.   But imagine a chimpanzee sleeping, stretched on the ground by himself, sits up, looks around, scratches in a contemplative way, wanders over to a big tuft of grass there, very carefully selects two, three, or even four blades, tucks them into that little pocket between chin and shoulder, and wanders off, maybe several hundred yards to a termite heap that's completely out of site, and there he inspects the heap, and if it's a productive one, he'll use the tools that he picked.  Well, you know, if you don't accept that this is some kind of planning ahead in thought, how can you explain that? FLATOW:  Very interesting.  1-800-989-8255. Let's take some calls.  Let's go to Jessica in Boise.  Hi, Jessica. JESSICA (Caller):  Hi there.  Thanks so much for taking my call, and it's so nice to be able to talk to you, Mrs. Goodall. FLATOW:  Go ahead. Ms. GOODALL:  Good talking to you. FLATOW:  Go ahead, Jessica. JESSICA:  All right.  I was actually just recently reading online about some cases of infanticide and cannibalism in chimpanzees.  And specifically some case that you are able to observe where there was a group of females that were stealing the babies from other females and actually eating them.  And I had two questions.   First, do you have any idea why such behavior has been occurring?  And number two, I did read that - in one particular instance you were able to save one of the infants.  And how did that work as far as your objectivity, I thought that researchers generally were just supposed to observe and not interfere, and I'll take my comments off the air. FLATOW:  Thank you, Jessica.  Good questions. Ms. GOODALL:  OK.  Well, first off, we have no idea it was one mother and her adult daughter who actually took the babies of other females.  The most common infanticide is when a group of males is patrolling its territory, and if they see a stranger, if it's a female with an infant or of course if it's a male, they may give a chase.  It's almost like hunting, and if they catch a female with an infant, they will attack her very, very severely, leave her probably to die of wounds, take the infant and sometimes kill and eat it.   Usually they just kill it.  But the - female and her daughter was different because they were attacking females in their own group.  Not really to hurt the mother, but simply to take the baby and eat it.  And they only did this when it was a brand new baby, as though the smell was different, and maybe the baby was thought of as a stranger or because there was blood - smell of blood from the placenta in the birth process.  So, we see - saw it in one other mother-infant pair, but never succeeded and I already talked on this show about objectivity.  And for me, these chimpanzees, you know, they're just like people in a way and we've always helped the chimpanzees if they're sick.   You hear people saying, you must let nature take its course, but we have interfered so profoundly, so hugely and so monstrously with nature that in most places it's not possible, like Gombe.  Gombe, a 30 square miles, once part of an interrupted forest, now a tiny little island surrounded completely by bare cultivated fields.  And if we get fewer chimps than we have today, it's gone from about 150 to 100.  Then you know that's going to be the end.  So each one is precious from a genetic point of view. FLATOW:  Mm hmm.  We have a question here also from \"Second Life About You,\" about your winning of the Leakey Prize and it asks, and this is a very good question.  Who was your co-recipient? Ms. GOODALL:  I knew you were going to ask that an I. . . FLATOW:  You know, not many people know about the very famous Japanese scientist, Toshisada Nishida.  Who is he?  And why is he so famous, at least in Japan and other parts of the world? Ms. GOODALL:  He was involved with the other longest term research. Gombe was the first, starting in 1960 and their research at Mahali began in 1966.  And Toshisada Nishida wasn't the one who started it, but he was responsible for running it and carrying on the research and finding the funding for it from many, many years until he retired from that about two years ago.  So I've known Toshi for years. FLATOW:  Mm hmm.  We're talking with Jane Goodall this hour in Talk of the Nation, Science Friday from NPR News.  Did the Japanese have a different way of studying in the wild than yours or basically mirroring yours? Ms. GOODALL:  It was pretty much the same.  I mean, I think that in some ways fascinatingly, the Japanese started completely nonobjective and the ethology.  And of course in Europe and then America it was very objective, but then as we learn more and more about these complex beings with that complex brains.  England - the British. . . FLATOW:  Mm hmm. Ms. GOODALL:  Few of animal nature, softened and the Japanese, as they learn more and more about western ways of science, they hardened a little.  So we ended up more or less exactly the same. FLATOW:  Mm hmm.  Let's go to Sam in Michigan.  Hi, Sam. SAM (Caller):  Hi.  Thank you for taking my call.  I have a quick question with regards to language being a very unique characteristic of the human race.  Can you shed some light with regards as to why we are so different in that sense?  Has there been any recent studies that sort of correlate the evolution of this unique quality that humans posses? Ms. GOODALL:  People have different theories really about the origins of language, and I'm not sure we'll ever know.  But I think what's fascinating here is that I believe it's because we have for some reason or another, there must have been many evolutionary processes, I should think, which caused us to speak, but because of it - because we have the ability to teach about things that aren't present, to plan for the distant future, to discuss and that's so important, so you can involve the collective wisdom of a grouping in discussing an idea, that I think is what's lead to the explosive development of our intellect.   And so, although chimpanzees can do things intellectually we never thought they could, like some of the amazing stuff they do with computers and things.  You know, it doesn't make sense to compare a chimp intellect with human intellect.  So it's - you know the question is if we're the most intellectual creature that's ever walked on this planet, how come we're destroying it? FLATOW:  You said, that we're not learning from our past mistakes and we're not listening to science. Ms. GOODALL:  In many cases, we're not learning from our past mistakes and some science, I'm not sure we should listen to, but it's the past mistakes of history, we're not learning very well from those, we go blindly into warfare again, not seeming to think about the consequences.  So, we're a strange mixture, and we have a dark side and we have a more noble side, and so do the chimpanzees. FLATOW:  What's science should not be listening to? Ms. GOODALL:  Well, it's nothing much.  It's a matter of listening to, but you know I'm thinking of the kind of science that led to nuclear weapons for example, that sort of thing. FLATOW:  All right.  We're going to take a short break and come back and talk about more with Jane Goodall, who was a winner of the 2008 Leakey Prize, also here to talk with us for the rest of the hour.  Our number, 1-800-989-8255, if you'd like to talk with Jane also.  We're twittering at the scifritter, and also in Second Life so there are lots of different ways you can reach this hour if you'd like to ask Dr. Goodall with questions.  She's also talking about - she's talking about more than just the chimps, talking about world problems or warfare, all of the things like that that the she has very much taken up the cause for.  So, we'll talk to her about some of those causes when we get back.  Stay tuned.  We'll be right back after this break. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW:  You're listening to Talk of the Nation, Science Friday.  I'm Ira Flatow.  We're talking this hour with Jane Goodall who has many, many accomplishments to her name including her latest book, \"Harvest for Hope: A Guide to Mindful Eating. \"  She has also written many children's books.  Her latest one and that is \"Ricky and Henry\" and \"Ann Lee,\" a true story with Ellen Marks that's put up by Penguin Young Readers Association.  You're also involved in environmentalism, especially - let's talk about something called the Forest Now Declaration.  It's a very interesting concept in a declaration.  Tell us what that is and what it's aimed at? Ms. GOODALL:  The Forest Now Declaration, if I'm remember it correctly because there are so many forest initiatives now that I seemed to be involved. . . FLATOW:  Well, let me - I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  I was going to drill down into another number.  Go ahead. Ms. GOODALL:  All right, drill.  Drill down. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW:  I heard you're speaking.  I heard you're speaking about allowing third-world countries and countries in Africa to be - to become more market savvy in the natural resources that they have, so they get fair market for what they have there. Ms. GOODALL:  Well, that's something we are deeply involved in because when I flew over the Gombe National Park about 17 years ago in a small plane, and saw the extensive deforestation outside the park, so that the soil was no longer fertile, so there were more people living there than the land could support, too poor to buy food.  I realized that - you know, there was no way we could even try to save the chimps while the people were struggling to live, so that led to our Take Care Program which is basically community center conservation.  And it's a holistic way of improving their lives in 32 villages around Gombe and it's - in ways selected by them not by us, so they say what they need.  And it's to do with different farming methods, reclaiming in fertile land, reforestation, water and sanitation projects, working with groups of women providing microcredit opportunities, scholarships for girls. . . FLATOW:  Mm hmm. Ms. GOODALL:  HIV, AIDS, and family planning information, everything like that. . . FLATOW:  Yeah. Ms. GOODALL:  And then we discovered that high up in the hills was some really good coffee, so the farmers couldn't make money because there are no proper roads.  So when I had the chance to talk to a group of coffee roasters in Seattle, I said we need some of you guys to come out. . . (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. GOODALL:  To see if it's really good coffee, and if it is, help us market it.  So Green Mountain Coffee Roaster was there within about five weeks or even less, and they found indeed the coffee was fantastic, they've been buying it.  Other coffee roasters have come in to buy some as well, helping the farmers to develop ever better ways of harvesting and storing the coffee that they have.  And because of this - this is why, this is so exciting - because of this, the locals are setting aside between 10 and 20 percent of their land for reforestation and forest protection in such a way that these forest patches will form a contiguous corridor of forest, so that the Gombe chimps who at the moment are isolated will once again be able to move out and interact with other revenant(ph) groups. FLATOW:  Now, some people might say you know, you're turning the forest into coffee plantations. Ms. GOODALL:  No, because there's no trees left. . . FLATOW:  Mm hmm. Ms. GOODALL:  And coffee is going where they've already cut down the trees.  The good news is that shade coffee gets the best prices, so the trees are coming back and all of these forest patches are at the moment bad, but the regenerated part is such that that if they stop chopping at the - is from seemingly dead trees stumps, you get a 30 foot tree in five years. FLATOW:  Well, that's pretty fast growing. Ms. GOODALL:  And also, the village management plan, that each village is required to make, sets aside so much percentage of land for agriculture and it can't be changed.  So what's changing is the efficiency of the way they're growing coffee and other crops.  Same amount of land used, but a much more efficient way of using that land. And the village management plan also includes the number of people that must live in that area.  So it's, you know, but without microcredit and family planning information, women empowerment, it means that they can actually plan a family and they couldn't before.  We already see a trend of smaller family size, at the same time more infants living. FLATOW:  Yeah.  Because we - lots of studies have shown that education is the best thing you can do. Ms. GOODALL:  Yeah.  Women's education especially, all around the world.  Yes. FLATOW:  Let's go to Elizabeth Ann in Birmingham, Alabama.  Hi, Elizabeth Ann. ELIZABETH ANN (Caller):  Hi.  I also once studied about the efforts of Orangutan Island in Borneo, to return orangutans to the wild.  Ms. GOODALL:  Yes. FLATOW:  Are you familiar with that, Orangutan Island? Ms. GOODALL:  Yeah. FLATOW:  What do you think - she wants to know what you think about it. Ms. GOODALL:  Well, I think, you know, as long as one can return animals to the wild without disturbing the existing wild populations, that is the answer.  I just wish we could do it with chimpanzees.  We're looking for a place where maybe we could return them to the wild.  But you got to find somewhere with no people, because they're used to people and they would probably harm people, same with orangutans.  And no wild chimps because the wild chimps are territorially aggressive and would probably kill them.  It's very hard to find places like that in Africa. FLATOW:  Thank you, Elizabeth. ELIZABETH (Caller):  Thank you. FLATOW:  Have a good weekend.  What is the greatest threat to chimpanzees today? Ms. GOODALL:  It depends really which part of Africa they're in - because the underlying threat is us.  It's a human population growth.  And then on top of that, you got the habitat destruction just from people farming and so forth.  You've got commercial hunting, the bush meat trade, which is very prevalent in Central Africa with the last significant populations of chimpanzees, gorillas, and the Nobos(ph) (unintelligible). And you have the logging companies - all foreign - which, even if they practiced selective logging are making roads deep into the heart of the forest - and this is opening up the forest for hunting.   And that's why the bush meat trade has taken off and it's involving lots of money, and it's the hunters shooting everything from elephants to birds and bats, smoking the meat and trucking it into the towns.  So you know, we're working there, we're working with the Congo (unintelligible) in forest partnership.  Partners being other NGOs, government USAID and such like, and our job is to make partnerships with the local people. FLATOW:  Question from Second Life from Paksasuses(ph).  Does Jane have any advice for young people who want to pursue a career in biological science?  What are some of the most crucial spaces that need to be filled by the next generation? Ms. GOODALL:  Well, that's a tough question.  I'm not sure I can answer the crucial spaces.  But the best thing to do - the only way that you'll get in the biological sciences is by really determined, really wanting to do it, working really hard, keeping your ears open for opportunities, going on to the web sites of the different colleges that offer different kinds of experience to see exactly which one it is that you want to do.  But there's just such a lot left to learn out there.  And of course, a big field opening up now is the effect of climate change, how this will effect different species, what can be done, and to help those species when this happens, because it will. FLATOW:  Question from RRW Tweet.  And we're tweeted, which we tweed - twittering - tweeting and Jane, I don't even know what I'm doing here.  I believe with tweeter.  That's sort of an instant message system that's being developed. Ms. GOODALL:  Oh, I see. FLATOW:  And he said.  Well, we have a question about.  But let me go to this question first.  Does Jane Goodall believe all living quote, 'ape-like' species have been discovered?  What about Bigfoot or the hobbit?  I know you - any update on Sasquatch at all.  I mean, I don't believe in Sasquatch, and if anything - any new discoveries on there? Ms. GOODALL:  Well, the last people I was speaking to were in Australia, talking about the yawee(ph) which is their equivalent of  Sasquatch.  I don't know if these creatures exist.  All I know is that everywhere I've been, there are tales of them and there are people who say they've seen them.  So I'm not going to go out and say they're not there.  There's something, and it's very strange ,and I find it extremely fascinating. FLATOW:  Let's go to Daven Rock(ph) from Illinois.  Hi, Dave. DAVE:  Hi. FLATOW:  Go ahead. DAVE:  Oh, it's an honor to talk to you.  I was just wondering - I read somewhere that a lot of ranchers have been doing gene banking out there.  You know, price cattle and such, I was just wondering if you had been doing the same with the chimpanzees, I mean, you're talking about the dwindling numbers and I just wondered if you'd frozen some DNA samples? Ms. GOODALL:  Not to my knowledge.  I'm certainly not involved with anything like that, although in captive breeding, it is true that some sperm has being flown across the world.  It was with the banobo.  But you know, we haven't quite got down to needing to do that with chimpanzees.  There's so many zoos and sanctuaries around the world.  And there are efforts made to conduct - well, to help them to breed in such a way as to maximize the gene put. FLATOW:  Barry Good in Second Life has asked that question about the Nobos (ph).  What are the prospects of the Nobo population.   Ms. GOODALL:  Well, there - they and the orangutans, I think of the worst (unintelligible), great apes,. I suppose mountain gorillas as well.  The lowland gorilla and the chimp - have the larger populations left.  And the banobo - well, it really depends on what's going to happen in the DRC, that's the only place where they are.  And that country is so unstable that the conservation efforts are being over difficult there. FLATOW:  The Congo there. Ms. GOODALL:  Is in the Congo, yes.  They conquer conchesa(ph). FLATOW:  Democratic.  Yeah.  I saw there - and there the war that's going on around there doesn't make anything any better. Ms. GOODALL:  No.  The banobos are way north of the war, but the whole - you know, the whole country is a sort of - it's very unsettled, very difficult to establish a long term conservation program, which is what must happen if the banobos - to be saved except in zoos. FLATOW:  Dan in Indiana.  Hi, Dan. DAN (Caller):  Yes, great to speak with both of you Ira and Jane.  I will - I saw you out in - I think it was Washington, Jane talking about saving the cougars and their habitat and stuff, and logging did seem to be the biggest reason that cougars were being diminished and have you - especially with the environments you're dealing with, have you tried to get like the CEOs of these big companies to come out, see what they've actually done because you know, they're just sitting in a desk somewhere and they - they don't see a lot of these degradation they've caused or have you even - went as far as to maybe boycott these companies?   Ms. GOODALL:  Not per se, but the book I'm working on now is about animals and plants rescued from the very brink of extinction.  And there's some interesting stories there.  And one that comes to mind, the Vancouver Island marmot in B. C. in Canada,  and there the numbers were down.  I think there were just 12 individuals left and Andrew Bryant was doing his Ph. D. on the fate of the marmot and every morning he'd arrive in the logging camp because that's where his research place was, and he'd ride with them at about 4:30 in the morning.  And one day, one of the loggers said, well, you know, what are you doing up there?  And he's trying to explain, he said, come with me on your day off and I'll show you. And that day the guy saw one of these marmots who'd been tranquilized to be banded, marked, or however they do it, and he was so moved by the whole thing that he went back and told his CEO, and the CEO went up and was similarly moved.  And as a result, changed his entire logging practice, so as to help the marmots. And now, the marmots are springing back - I think it's around 500.  I met this guy Andrew last week and he was. . . FLATOW:  This is Talk of the Nation Science Friday from NPR News.  Talking with Jane Goodall.  Jane, when you went out to meet Louis Leakey all those many decades ago, did you ever foresee yourself having to be a crusader to save the life on the Earth here? Ms. GOODALL:  I think you know the answer to that, don't you?  I couldn't - back then in 1960, you know it was so different because this conservation threat wasn't there.  FLATOW:  Yeah. Ms. GOODALL:  There were maybe way over a million chimpanzees, the African Equatorial Forest belt was virtually untouched and it was after that that this massive invasion of foreign companies came into Africa and started messing everything up. FLATOW:  Mm hmm.  So where do you see yourself doing next?  You've sort of evolved many times yourself for your lifetime.  Are you thinking you're in your last stage of evolution of where you are heading?  I mean, that you're in this one direction, you're going to change to another direction, or where do you see yourself going over the next five - let's say five to 10 years? Ms. GOODALL:  Five to 10 years, I shall be carrying on, you know it's 300 days a year on the road.  It's Africa, Europe and North America.  Next year, concentrating on the southern part of, you know, South America, Brazil, Central America.  Really it's Asia.  This year Australia, next year India.  The world is too big for me actually, but I try and do as much as I can and start the Roots and Shoots group, because this is the future and if we can create a critical mass of youth that understands this life is about more than just money, and that we need money to live but we shouldn't be living for money and you know, all these groups tackled projects to make things better for people, for animals, for the environment that (unintelligible).  Get out and take action. FLATOW:  I - I'm sorry, go ahead. Ms. GOODALL:  No, go on. FLATOW:  No, I was just saying that the - has this change of administration, do you think will help you in your work anymore? Ms. GOODALL:  Oh, absolutely without any question.  And put it the other way around, and say that the last administration hindered us, it's - I think there's a great big sigh of relief and most people I know are feeling extremely hopeful about the future. FLATOW:  Well, I wish you good luck.  I guess there's no better way than to end our conversation by wishing you good luck going around the world 300 days of the year in your travels, and be safe and come back and visit us.  It's really when you're - when is your next book do you think will (unintelligible).    Ms. GOODALL:  Around September, I think the 18th next year. FLATOW:  Ah, OK.  Well we have a date to look forward to. Ms. GOODALL:  Yeah, absolutely. FLATOW:  If not before then, thank you, Jane for taking time to be with us and good luck to you. Ms. GOODALL:  Thanks a lot.  Thank you.  Bye. FLATOW:  Bye-bye.  Jane Goodall, she doesn't need any, you know, introduction.  Well, what more can I say?  She's a primatologist, environmental advocate and co-winner of the 2008 Leakey Prize and the founder of the Jane Goodall Institute that's based in Arlington, Virginia.  That's about all the time we have for today.  If you like to write to us, send us some regular classic mail to Science Friday 4 West 43rd Street Room 306, New York, New York 10036.  Thank all of you for twittering today.  It's going to continue during the week.  If you want to twit us, you can send it @ scifritter, may change that back to scifri, make it a lot easier for folk when we get a chance to do that.   Also, we've got the Science Friday pick of the week at sciencefriday. com.  What happens when you blow up water balloons in weightlessness?  Oh, it's really interesting stuff to watch the water balloons explode because they don't do what you think they're going to do.  So you can see that video at sciencefriday. com.  Have a great weekend.  We'll see you next week.  I'm Ira Flatow in New York.  IRA FLATOW, host:  You're listening to Talk of the Nation Science Friday, I'm Ira Flatow.  There's a short list of icons in science, people who are both excellent researchers, also public symbols of what science is and does, and to anyone who's a fan of magazines like, perhaps, National Geographic, Jane Goodall is one of those icons.  From her groundbreaking work with chimpanzees in the Gombe in the 1960s, to her tireless advocacy for the environment today, she has earned her place in the Science Hall of Fame.  And she's back with us today.    So without further ado, I formally introduce my guest.  Jane Goodall is a primatologist and an environmental advocate.  She's co-winner of the 2008 Leakey Prize, and is the founder of the Jane Goodall Institute based in Arlington, Virginia.  And she joins us today from CBC studios in Toronto.  Welcome back to the program.  Ms. JANE GOODALL (Primatologist; Environmental Advocate):  Well, thank you.  Thank you for inviting me.  FLATOW:  It's been too long.  The last time you were on here was 2002.  Ms. GOODALL:  Goodness.  FLATOW:  Yeah.  Are you any more optimistic now about the prospects for the environment since then?  Ms. GOODALL:  Well, I think I feel about the same.  And, you know, we're at the cross roads, we have been for the last several years.  And if we don't take action, us collectively, then maybe it's too late.  But we haven't gotten to that point yet.  FLATOW:  Your group, Roots and Shoots, is an outreach to young people.  It's been going now - what, for 17 years?  Ms. GOODALL:  Yes, since 1991.  But it didn't really leave Tanzania till about '93.  And so, you know, it's now in about 100 countries.  It has programs from preschool through university.  And even some senior citizens have formed groups, and it's in prison.  So it's approximately 9,000 active groups.  FLATOW:  Wow.  And so some of these kids are now grown up, they have - they've gone out now on their own, and making their own marks as adults.  Ms. GOODALL:  Absolutely.  And what I love is that one of the young Tanzanians who was with us right at the very beginning, he left, he got a degree in the U. S. , he got a job because he got a wife and family.  But now that we have raised more money, we can offer people employment.  He's back being the Tanzanian national director of the program.  And it's just - it's really wonderful to see this person who has never lost that commitment that he got as a child.  FLATOW:  That's terrific.  1-800-989-8255, if you'd like to speak with Jane Goodall.  There are still researchers out there in the Gombe observing the chimps.  What kinds of things are they learning?  We've spoken - I've seen you recently out in San Francisco, seems like they're still learning all kinds of fascinating things about how the chimps behave.  Ms. GOODALL:  Well, they really are.  And of course, a lot of what they're learning is the result of the long-term studies that began in 1960, coming up to 50 years.  Chimpanzees can live to be more than 60, so it does take a long time.  But one of the more recent technologies we've been able to incorporate is DNA testing of fecal samples which will tell us who the fathers are.  We've never known before.  So this opens up a whole new area.  You know, is there possibly any special relationship between a father and his biological child?  It's hard to see how that could be.  But maybe there is, we don't know.  FLATOW:  I have a question here for you from Second Life and it's - is it possible to balance activism and advocacy with scientific research without risking the objectivity of the researcher or your objectivism as he puts it?  Ms. GOODALL:  Well, I have - you know, we have serious concerns about objectivity in science.  Yes, we have to be objective.  But we should not be objective at the expense of being a human.  We should be able to have compassion and empathy at the same time, as we can stand to stand back and be objective about what's going on.  But without that, if you don't allow yourself to feel some empathy or some compassion, then science can become, I think, a very cold, hard and potentially dangerous profession.  FLATOW:  You were just awarded the Leakey Prize for your work in evolutionary science.  I don't think most people have heard, at least heard of what that means.  Can you give us an idea what that whole field is about?  Ms. GOODALL:  Exactly the reason I got - I was able to get into this field at the beginning, because my mentor, the late Lewis Leakey, he spent his life searching for the fossilized remains of early humans.  And he felt way ahead of his time that if we understood the behavior of our closest relatives in the natural state - that's chimpanzees and then gorillas, orangutans, and (unintelligible) that this might help him to have a better feeling for how early humans might have behaved.  Because the argument is if you find behavior that's similar or the same in chimpanzees today and humans today, the modern human, modern chimp, then possibly that behavior was present in a common ancestor, ape-like, human-like about six million years ago.  And that therefore we may have brought that characteristic or those characteristics with us throughout a long evolutionary journey.  And then, he liked to, you know - feel, 'yes, that will give me a better handle on how the Stone Age people behaved. '  FLATOW:  Do you still feel Lewis Leakey around with you?  Do you still. . .  Ms. GOODALL:  Do I still what?  FLATOW:  Is he still present for you - Lewis Leakey?  Ms. GOODALL:  Oh, sometimes he is.  He was such a larger than life character.  And, you know, he was such an amazing person.  FLATOW:  He was a seminal figure in your life.  Ms. GOODALL:  Oh, absolutely.  I mean, goodness.  When he offered me this opportunity, I had no degree of any kind.  I was straight out from England.  And all he knew about me was that one, I've certainly read a lot about animals, I could answer lots of his questions.  And two, when he let me go with himself, his wife, and one young English girl, and a few Kenyans to (unintelligible) Gorge, now a very famous site of many human fossil discoveries.  But in those days, there was nothing there, it was just animals, no humans are being found.  And I think he was sort of watching how I behaved out on the plains and what I did when a young male lion followed for a good many yards.  And that's when he decided to offer this opportunity to me.  FLATOW:  Over these past 40 years, has your idea or your own definition of what intelligence means changed as you watched the apes, the primates, and even (unintelligible).  Ms. GOODALL:  Well, it's very, very clear.  When I began in 1960, I was told when I finally got to Cambridge University that only humans had minds and that animals, other than humans animals, were incapable of anything like thinking.  That was the accepted attitude of the European ethologists, people who study animal behavior.  And, of course, it's so obvious when you see these intelligent creatures out in the wild that they are thinking, that they definitely are capable of rational thought, and that's been substantiated again and again with experiments in the laboratory.  So I think my feeling is probably about the same, but I understand it better.  But the majority of animal behavior scientists, their attitude has changed.  FLATOW:  What kinds of things have you seen for example?  One or two things that changed, that would change someone who goes out in the field and sees their behavior.  Ms. GOODALL:  Well, I think if you have the opportunity to watch the young ones so closely observing the behavior of others and then imitating what they've seen and practicing it, tool-using, and it's fascinating to see a young one invent something new, doing something different and how all the other young ones all watch that and sometimes imitate, which is how new cultural traditions are introduced into a group, and something which is very, very simple.    But imagine a chimpanzee sleeping, stretched on the ground by himself, sits up, looks around, scratches in a contemplative way, wanders over to a big tuft of grass there, very carefully selects two, three, or even four blades, tucks them into that little pocket between chin and shoulder, and wanders off, maybe several hundred yards to a termite heap that's completely out of site, and there he inspects the heap, and if it's a productive one, he'll use the tools that he picked.  Well, you know, if you don't accept that this is some kind of planning ahead in thought, how can you explain that?  FLATOW:  Very interesting.  1-800-989-8255. Let's take some calls.  Let's go to Jessica in Boise.  Hi, Jessica.  JESSICA (Caller):  Hi there.  Thanks so much for taking my call, and it's so nice to be able to talk to you, Mrs. Goodall.  FLATOW:  Go ahead.  Ms. GOODALL:  Good talking to you.  FLATOW:  Go ahead, Jessica.  JESSICA:  All right.  I was actually just recently reading online about some cases of infanticide and cannibalism in chimpanzees.  And specifically some case that you are able to observe where there was a group of females that were stealing the babies from other females and actually eating them.  And I had two questions.    First, do you have any idea why such behavior has been occurring?  And number two, I did read that - in one particular instance you were able to save one of the infants.  And how did that work as far as your objectivity, I thought that researchers generally were just supposed to observe and not interfere, and I'll take my comments off the air.  FLATOW:  Thank you, Jessica.  Good questions.  Ms. GOODALL:  OK.  Well, first off, we have no idea it was one mother and her adult daughter who actually took the babies of other females.  The most common infanticide is when a group of males is patrolling its territory, and if they see a stranger, if it's a female with an infant or of course if it's a male, they may give a chase.  It's almost like hunting, and if they catch a female with an infant, they will attack her very, very severely, leave her probably to die of wounds, take the infant and sometimes kill and eat it.    Usually they just kill it.  But the - female and her daughter was different because they were attacking females in their own group.  Not really to hurt the mother, but simply to take the baby and eat it.  And they only did this when it was a brand new baby, as though the smell was different, and maybe the baby was thought of as a stranger or because there was blood - smell of blood from the placenta in the birth process.  So, we see - saw it in one other mother-infant pair, but never succeeded and I already talked on this show about objectivity.  And for me, these chimpanzees, you know, they're just like people in a way and we've always helped the chimpanzees if they're sick.    You hear people saying, you must let nature take its course, but we have interfered so profoundly, so hugely and so monstrously with nature that in most places it's not possible, like Gombe.  Gombe, a 30 square miles, once part of an interrupted forest, now a tiny little island surrounded completely by bare cultivated fields.  And if we get fewer chimps than we have today, it's gone from about 150 to 100.  Then you know that's going to be the end.  So each one is precious from a genetic point of view.  FLATOW:  Mm hmm.  We have a question here also from \"Second Life About You,\" about your winning of the Leakey Prize and it asks, and this is a very good question.  Who was your co-recipient?  Ms. GOODALL:  I knew you were going to ask that an I. . .  FLATOW:  You know, not many people know about the very famous Japanese scientist, Toshisada Nishida.  Who is he?  And why is he so famous, at least in Japan and other parts of the world?  Ms. GOODALL:  He was involved with the other longest term research. Gombe was the first, starting in 1960 and their research at Mahali began in 1966.  And Toshisada Nishida wasn't the one who started it, but he was responsible for running it and carrying on the research and finding the funding for it from many, many years until he retired from that about two years ago.  So I've known Toshi for years.  FLATOW:  Mm hmm.  We're talking with Jane Goodall this hour in Talk of the Nation, Science Friday from NPR News.  Did the Japanese have a different way of studying in the wild than yours or basically mirroring yours?  Ms. GOODALL:  It was pretty much the same.  I mean, I think that in some ways fascinatingly, the Japanese started completely nonobjective and the ethology.  And of course in Europe and then America it was very objective, but then as we learn more and more about these complex beings with that complex brains.  England - the British. . .  FLATOW:  Mm hmm.  Ms. GOODALL:  Few of animal nature, softened and the Japanese, as they learn more and more about western ways of science, they hardened a little.  So we ended up more or less exactly the same.  FLATOW:  Mm hmm.  Let's go to Sam in Michigan.  Hi, Sam.  SAM (Caller):  Hi.  Thank you for taking my call.  I have a quick question with regards to language being a very unique characteristic of the human race.  Can you shed some light with regards as to why we are so different in that sense?  Has there been any recent studies that sort of correlate the evolution of this unique quality that humans posses?  Ms. GOODALL:  People have different theories really about the origins of language, and I'm not sure we'll ever know.  But I think what's fascinating here is that I believe it's because we have for some reason or another, there must have been many evolutionary processes, I should think, which caused us to speak, but because of it - because we have the ability to teach about things that aren't present, to plan for the distant future, to discuss and that's so important, so you can involve the collective wisdom of a grouping in discussing an idea, that I think is what's lead to the explosive development of our intellect.    And so, although chimpanzees can do things intellectually we never thought they could, like some of the amazing stuff they do with computers and things.  You know, it doesn't make sense to compare a chimp intellect with human intellect.  So it's - you know the question is if we're the most intellectual creature that's ever walked on this planet, how come we're destroying it?  FLATOW:  You said, that we're not learning from our past mistakes and we're not listening to science.  Ms. GOODALL:  In many cases, we're not learning from our past mistakes and some science, I'm not sure we should listen to, but it's the past mistakes of history, we're not learning very well from those, we go blindly into warfare again, not seeming to think about the consequences.  So, we're a strange mixture, and we have a dark side and we have a more noble side, and so do the chimpanzees.  FLATOW:  What's science should not be listening to?  Ms. GOODALL:  Well, it's nothing much.  It's a matter of listening to, but you know I'm thinking of the kind of science that led to nuclear weapons for example, that sort of thing.  FLATOW:  All right.  We're going to take a short break and come back and talk about more with Jane Goodall, who was a winner of the 2008 Leakey Prize, also here to talk with us for the rest of the hour.  Our number, 1-800-989-8255, if you'd like to talk with Jane also.  We're twittering at the scifritter, and also in Second Life so there are lots of different ways you can reach this hour if you'd like to ask Dr. Goodall with questions.  She's also talking about - she's talking about more than just the chimps, talking about world problems or warfare, all of the things like that that the she has very much taken up the cause for.  So, we'll talk to her about some of those causes when we get back.  Stay tuned.  We'll be right back after this break.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW:  You're listening to Talk of the Nation, Science Friday.  I'm Ira Flatow.  We're talking this hour with Jane Goodall who has many, many accomplishments to her name including her latest book, \"Harvest for Hope: A Guide to Mindful Eating. \"  She has also written many children's books.  Her latest one and that is \"Ricky and Henry\" and \"Ann Lee,\" a true story with Ellen Marks that's put up by Penguin Young Readers Association.  You're also involved in environmentalism, especially - let's talk about something called the Forest Now Declaration.  It's a very interesting concept in a declaration.  Tell us what that is and what it's aimed at?  Ms. GOODALL:  The Forest Now Declaration, if I'm remember it correctly because there are so many forest initiatives now that I seemed to be involved. . .  FLATOW:  Well, let me - I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  I was going to drill down into another number.  Go ahead.  Ms. GOODALL:  All right, drill.  Drill down.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW:  I heard you're speaking.  I heard you're speaking about allowing third-world countries and countries in Africa to be - to become more market savvy in the natural resources that they have, so they get fair market for what they have there.  Ms. GOODALL:  Well, that's something we are deeply involved in because when I flew over the Gombe National Park about 17 years ago in a small plane, and saw the extensive deforestation outside the park, so that the soil was no longer fertile, so there were more people living there than the land could support, too poor to buy food.  I realized that - you know, there was no way we could even try to save the chimps while the people were struggling to live, so that led to our Take Care Program which is basically community center conservation.  And it's a holistic way of improving their lives in 32 villages around Gombe and it's - in ways selected by them not by us, so they say what they need.  And it's to do with different farming methods, reclaiming in fertile land, reforestation, water and sanitation projects, working with groups of women providing microcredit opportunities, scholarships for girls. . .  FLATOW:  Mm hmm.  Ms. GOODALL:  HIV, AIDS, and family planning information, everything like that. . .  FLATOW:  Yeah.  Ms. GOODALL:  And then we discovered that high up in the hills was some really good coffee, so the farmers couldn't make money because there are no proper roads.  So when I had the chance to talk to a group of coffee roasters in Seattle, I said we need some of you guys to come out. . .  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. GOODALL:  To see if it's really good coffee, and if it is, help us market it.  So Green Mountain Coffee Roaster was there within about five weeks or even less, and they found indeed the coffee was fantastic, they've been buying it.  Other coffee roasters have come in to buy some as well, helping the farmers to develop ever better ways of harvesting and storing the coffee that they have.  And because of this - this is why, this is so exciting - because of this, the locals are setting aside between 10 and 20 percent of their land for reforestation and forest protection in such a way that these forest patches will form a contiguous corridor of forest, so that the Gombe chimps who at the moment are isolated will once again be able to move out and interact with other revenant(ph) groups.  FLATOW:  Now, some people might say you know, you're turning the forest into coffee plantations.  Ms. GOODALL:  No, because there's no trees left. . .  FLATOW:  Mm hmm.  Ms. GOODALL:  And coffee is going where they've already cut down the trees.  The good news is that shade coffee gets the best prices, so the trees are coming back and all of these forest patches are at the moment bad, but the regenerated part is such that that if they stop chopping at the - is from seemingly dead trees stumps, you get a 30 foot tree in five years.  FLATOW:  Well, that's pretty fast growing.  Ms. GOODALL:  And also, the village management plan, that each village is required to make, sets aside so much percentage of land for agriculture and it can't be changed.  So what's changing is the efficiency of the way they're growing coffee and other crops.  Same amount of land used, but a much more efficient way of using that land. And the village management plan also includes the number of people that must live in that area.  So it's, you know, but without microcredit and family planning information, women empowerment, it means that they can actually plan a family and they couldn't before.  We already see a trend of smaller family size, at the same time more infants living.  FLATOW:  Yeah.  Because we - lots of studies have shown that education is the best thing you can do.  Ms. GOODALL:  Yeah.  Women's education especially, all around the world.  Yes.  FLATOW:  Let's go to Elizabeth Ann in Birmingham, Alabama.  Hi, Elizabeth Ann.  ELIZABETH ANN (Caller):  Hi.  I also once studied about the efforts of Orangutan Island in Borneo, to return orangutans to the wild.   Ms. GOODALL:  Yes.  FLATOW:  Are you familiar with that, Orangutan Island?  Ms. GOODALL:  Yeah.  FLATOW:  What do you think - she wants to know what you think about it.  Ms. GOODALL:  Well, I think, you know, as long as one can return animals to the wild without disturbing the existing wild populations, that is the answer.  I just wish we could do it with chimpanzees.  We're looking for a place where maybe we could return them to the wild.  But you got to find somewhere with no people, because they're used to people and they would probably harm people, same with orangutans.  And no wild chimps because the wild chimps are territorially aggressive and would probably kill them.  It's very hard to find places like that in Africa.  FLATOW:  Thank you, Elizabeth.  ELIZABETH (Caller):  Thank you.  FLATOW:  Have a good weekend.  What is the greatest threat to chimpanzees today?  Ms. GOODALL:  It depends really which part of Africa they're in - because the underlying threat is us.  It's a human population growth.  And then on top of that, you got the habitat destruction just from people farming and so forth.  You've got commercial hunting, the bush meat trade, which is very prevalent in Central Africa with the last significant populations of chimpanzees, gorillas, and the Nobos(ph) (unintelligible). And you have the logging companies - all foreign - which, even if they practiced selective logging are making roads deep into the heart of the forest - and this is opening up the forest for hunting.    And that's why the bush meat trade has taken off and it's involving lots of money, and it's the hunters shooting everything from elephants to birds and bats, smoking the meat and trucking it into the towns.  So you know, we're working there, we're working with the Congo (unintelligible) in forest partnership.  Partners being other NGOs, government USAID and such like, and our job is to make partnerships with the local people.  FLATOW:  Question from Second Life from Paksasuses(ph).  Does Jane have any advice for young people who want to pursue a career in biological science?  What are some of the most crucial spaces that need to be filled by the next generation?  Ms. GOODALL:  Well, that's a tough question.  I'm not sure I can answer the crucial spaces.  But the best thing to do - the only way that you'll get in the biological sciences is by really determined, really wanting to do it, working really hard, keeping your ears open for opportunities, going on to the web sites of the different colleges that offer different kinds of experience to see exactly which one it is that you want to do.  But there's just such a lot left to learn out there.  And of course, a big field opening up now is the effect of climate change, how this will effect different species, what can be done, and to help those species when this happens, because it will.  FLATOW:  Question from RRW Tweet.  And we're tweeted, which we tweed - twittering - tweeting and Jane, I don't even know what I'm doing here.  I believe with tweeter.  That's sort of an instant message system that's being developed.  Ms. GOODALL:  Oh, I see.  FLATOW:  And he said.  Well, we have a question about.  But let me go to this question first.  Does Jane Goodall believe all living quote, 'ape-like' species have been discovered?  What about Bigfoot or the hobbit?  I know you - any update on Sasquatch at all.  I mean, I don't believe in Sasquatch, and if anything - any new discoveries on there?  Ms. GOODALL:  Well, the last people I was speaking to were in Australia, talking about the yawee(ph) which is their equivalent of  Sasquatch.  I don't know if these creatures exist.  All I know is that everywhere I've been, there are tales of them and there are people who say they've seen them.  So I'm not going to go out and say they're not there.  There's something, and it's very strange ,and I find it extremely fascinating.  FLATOW:  Let's go to Daven Rock(ph) from Illinois.  Hi, Dave.  DAVE:  Hi.  FLATOW:  Go ahead.  DAVE:  Oh, it's an honor to talk to you.  I was just wondering - I read somewhere that a lot of ranchers have been doing gene banking out there.  You know, price cattle and such, I was just wondering if you had been doing the same with the chimpanzees, I mean, you're talking about the dwindling numbers and I just wondered if you'd frozen some DNA samples?  Ms. GOODALL:  Not to my knowledge.  I'm certainly not involved with anything like that, although in captive breeding, it is true that some sperm has being flown across the world.  It was with the banobo.  But you know, we haven't quite got down to needing to do that with chimpanzees.  There's so many zoos and sanctuaries around the world.  And there are efforts made to conduct - well, to help them to breed in such a way as to maximize the gene put.  FLATOW:  Barry Good in Second Life has asked that question about the Nobos (ph).  What are the prospects of the Nobo population.    Ms. GOODALL:  Well, there - they and the orangutans, I think of the worst (unintelligible), great apes,. I suppose mountain gorillas as well.  The lowland gorilla and the chimp - have the larger populations left.  And the banobo - well, it really depends on what's going to happen in the DRC, that's the only place where they are.  And that country is so unstable that the conservation efforts are being over difficult there.  FLATOW:  The Congo there.  Ms. GOODALL:  Is in the Congo, yes.  They conquer conchesa(ph).  FLATOW:  Democratic.  Yeah.  I saw there - and there the war that's going on around there doesn't make anything any better.  Ms. GOODALL:  No.  The banobos are way north of the war, but the whole - you know, the whole country is a sort of - it's very unsettled, very difficult to establish a long term conservation program, which is what must happen if the banobos - to be saved except in zoos.  FLATOW:  Dan in Indiana.  Hi, Dan.  DAN (Caller):  Yes, great to speak with both of you Ira and Jane.  I will - I saw you out in - I think it was Washington, Jane talking about saving the cougars and their habitat and stuff, and logging did seem to be the biggest reason that cougars were being diminished and have you - especially with the environments you're dealing with, have you tried to get like the CEOs of these big companies to come out, see what they've actually done because you know, they're just sitting in a desk somewhere and they - they don't see a lot of these degradation they've caused or have you even - went as far as to maybe boycott these companies?    Ms. GOODALL:  Not per se, but the book I'm working on now is about animals and plants rescued from the very brink of extinction.  And there's some interesting stories there.  And one that comes to mind, the Vancouver Island marmot in B. C. in Canada,  and there the numbers were down.  I think there were just 12 individuals left and Andrew Bryant was doing his Ph. D. on the fate of the marmot and every morning he'd arrive in the logging camp because that's where his research place was, and he'd ride with them at about 4:30 in the morning.  And one day, one of the loggers said, well, you know, what are you doing up there?   And he's trying to explain, he said, come with me on your day off and I'll show you. And that day the guy saw one of these marmots who'd been tranquilized to be banded, marked, or however they do it, and he was so moved by the whole thing that he went back and told his CEO, and the CEO went up and was similarly moved.  And as a result, changed his entire logging practice, so as to help the marmots. And now, the marmots are springing back - I think it's around 500.  I met this guy Andrew last week and he was. . .  FLATOW:  This is Talk of the Nation Science Friday from NPR News.  Talking with Jane Goodall.  Jane, when you went out to meet Louis Leakey all those many decades ago, did you ever foresee yourself having to be a crusader to save the life on the Earth here?  Ms. GOODALL:  I think you know the answer to that, don't you?  I couldn't - back then in 1960, you know it was so different because this conservation threat wasn't there.   FLATOW:  Yeah.  Ms. GOODALL:  There were maybe way over a million chimpanzees, the African Equatorial Forest belt was virtually untouched and it was after that that this massive invasion of foreign companies came into Africa and started messing everything up.  FLATOW:  Mm hmm.  So where do you see yourself doing next?  You've sort of evolved many times yourself for your lifetime.  Are you thinking you're in your last stage of evolution of where you are heading?  I mean, that you're in this one direction, you're going to change to another direction, or where do you see yourself going over the next five - let's say five to 10 years?  Ms. GOODALL:  Five to 10 years, I shall be carrying on, you know it's 300 days a year on the road.  It's Africa, Europe and North America.  Next year, concentrating on the southern part of, you know, South America, Brazil, Central America.  Really it's Asia.  This year Australia, next year India.  The world is too big for me actually, but I try and do as much as I can and start the Roots and Shoots group, because this is the future and if we can create a critical mass of youth that understands this life is about more than just money, and that we need money to live but we shouldn't be living for money and you know, all these groups tackled projects to make things better for people, for animals, for the environment that (unintelligible).  Get out and take action.  FLATOW:  I - I'm sorry, go ahead.  Ms. GOODALL:  No, go on.  FLATOW:  No, I was just saying that the - has this change of administration, do you think will help you in your work anymore?  Ms. GOODALL:  Oh, absolutely without any question.  And put it the other way around, and say that the last administration hindered us, it's - I think there's a great big sigh of relief and most people I know are feeling extremely hopeful about the future.  FLATOW:  Well, I wish you good luck.  I guess there's no better way than to end our conversation by wishing you good luck going around the world 300 days of the year in your travels, and be safe and come back and visit us.  It's really when you're - when is your next book do you think will (unintelligible).     Ms. GOODALL:  Around September, I think the 18th next year.  FLATOW:  Ah, OK.  Well we have a date to look forward to.  Ms. GOODALL:  Yeah, absolutely.  FLATOW:  If not before then, thank you, Jane for taking time to be with us and good luck to you.  Ms. GOODALL:  Thanks a lot.  Thank you.  Bye.  FLATOW:  Bye-bye.  Jane Goodall, she doesn't need any, you know, introduction.  Well, what more can I say?  She's a primatologist, environmental advocate and co-winner of the 2008 Leakey Prize and the founder of the Jane Goodall Institute that's based in Arlington, Virginia.  That's about all the time we have for today.  If you like to write to us, send us some regular classic mail to Science Friday 4 West 43rd Street Room 306, New York, New York 10036.  Thank all of you for twittering today.  It's going to continue during the week.  If you want to twit us, you can send it @ scifritter, may change that back to scifri, make it a lot easier for folk when we get a chance to do that.    Also, we've got the Science Friday pick of the week at sciencefriday. com.  What happens when you blow up water balloons in weightlessness?  Oh, it's really interesting stuff to watch the water balloons explode because they don't do what you think they're going to do.  So you can see that video at sciencefriday. com.  Have a great weekend.  We'll see you next week.  I'm Ira Flatow in New York. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.  All rights reserved.

When it first appears, you don't know what impact it will have. At the Huntington Library in San Marino, California, a new exhibition shows off a set of books that had explosive impact, dramatically altering what we know about our world and ourselves. NPR's Joe Palca has this report about the new exhibition and the man who organized it. JOE PALCA: Lovely, exquisite, delightful. Those may not be adjectives that spring to mind when talking about science books, but Dan Lewis says they should be. DAN LEWIS: We're trying to illustrate what is a sometimes slippery notion and one that's often unexpected, to think of science and beauty hand in hand. PALCA: Lewis is the senior curator of the History of Science and Technology at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. LEWIS: Some of these works are beautiful for the ideas they contain. Some of them are beautiful for the illustrations they contain because they're truly stunning visually, in some cases. Some of them are spectacularly uninteresting visually, but the idea behind them is really beautiful. PALCA: Lewis is a tallish man with a child-like glee that bursts out as he talks about his books. When we met earlier this year, he was hard at work at preparing the exhibition, \"Beautiful Science: Ideas That Changed the World. \"LEWIS: Let me just show you this here. And I've got a couple of things I want you to see - you have to see. PALCA: We're in a room that could be in an underfunded public library: mismatched furniture, books on countertops that looked like they're waiting to be re-shelved. Lewis reaches for a nondescript volume with a tan binding. LEWIS: Here, you can see Newton's \"Principia,\" one of the great landmarks in the history of science, printed in 1687. PALCA: This is the book where Newton set down the laws of physics, laws that were the final word for more than two centuries until Einstein modified them with his theories of relativity. The pages have more texture than a modern book. The type has bitten into the heavy paper. LEWIS: What's great about this is - this is actually Newton's own copy of the \"Principia. \" And Newton's, in fact, annotated a few bits in here in his own hand. PALCA: So he just lined it out and wrote, it shouldn't be in local foledo(ph). It should be inknown fiat(ph), in eudem plano(ph). LEWIS: Exactly. Well said. PALCA: Lewis says the books in the collection contain information beyond just the words on the page. He grabs another old volume, \"The Catalogue of Chemical Books,\" by William Cooper, printed in 1675. This book belonged to Newton. Lewis flips through it until he finds a page where Newton has turned down the corner. Lewis says the corner points to a particular passage Newton was interested in. LEWIS: And he's done this throughout. And you could see a librarian in a non-historic institution taking this and going, tsk, tsk, tsk(ph). We must straighten out these dog years. And in doing so, you lose all the evidence in this book about what Newton thought was important in the books he read. PALCA: After showing me several books, something dawned on me. Lewis was handling them with his bare hands, no gloves. LEWIS: That's probably the question I get asked the most, is why aren't you wearing gloves? People are gasp audibly at times when I'm handling this stuff. We found that the lack of sensitivity that you suddenly get when you put on gloves is far worse than anything you might have on your hands - well, not anything, almost anything you might have on your hands. It's always my premise that rare-book librarians and archivists and doctors are the people that wash their hands more than anybody else. PALCA: Quite possibly. Lewis reaches out his extremely clean hands for another treasure. LEWIS: Let's look at Apianus. Why not? PALCA: Why not? Petrus Apianus started illustrating his book of star charts, the \"Astronomicum Caesarium,\" in 1532. It took him eight years to finish. Richly-colored plates show constellations, and some pages have intricate moving disks for plotting star positions. LEWIS: It's an irresistibly beautiful book, and you want to show it to people, and you want to share the stuff but it deserves to sit quietly in a case with fiber-optic lighting open to a particular opening or two and let a larger public get a good look at it. PALCA: It's in the exhibition, or you can get a peak at our web site, npr. org. The Apianus manuscript is exquisitely beautiful, but Lewis is drawn even more to ideas that are beautiful. And for that, he says possibly the most beautiful book ever is Darwin's \"Origin of Species. \" Lewis says it's a book that continues to shape our thinking about what it means to be human 150 years after it was published. Lewis took me up to the conservation lab where one of the library's first editions of \"Origin of Species\" was getting a few touchups prior to going on display. LEWIS: One of the ways to tell a first edition from a second edition is to turn to page 20 and go down - one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten - 11 lines, and you see they have misspelled the word species. PALCA: There's an extra E. LEWIS: It's one of the easiest ways to determine this from later editions. So if you're ever at a garage sale and you see this dull-looking binding with Darwin's name on it, pull it out and go to page 20 and see if they've misspelled the word species. And if they have, pay their price, whether it's $5 or $8 or $10. This is now a $100,000 to $200,000 book. PALCA: For Lewis, owning a first edition or at least being able to handle one, is like being present at the moment of creation, the moment a new idea or new piece of art is born. He told me about a room in the Huntington Library known as the vault. LEWIS: It's a small room with a gigantic bank vault door that's hardened against a direct nuclear attack. And after six months, you get the right to be in that room by yourself. PALCA: Lewis recalled his first day alone in the vault. LEWIS: I'm down here, for instance, with the first two quartos of \"Hamlet. \" There are only two copies in the world. Only place - only library with the first two copies of \"Hamlet. \" I'm down here with Ben Franklin's autobiography and manuscript. I'm surrounded by untold treasures and just to be in their presence is an honor. And my first day in the room, after six months, I thought, I could die right here today, and I would die a happy man. PALCA: Because he got to commune with beautiful books that changed the world. Joe Palca, NPR News. LYNN NEARY, Host:  A book is like a newborn baby.

The bacteria in your gut lived a pampered life compared to the organisms my next guests study, creatures that live in the world of extremes at the bottom of the ocean on those hydrothermal vents deep under the surface, one of the hottest and wettest places you can find. And on the other hand, those living in one of the coldest, driest places you can imagine - the Dry Valleys of Antarctica. So, what do they have in common? Joining me now to talk about them is Craig Cary. He is chief scientist and principal investigator for Extreme 2008: A Deep-Sea Adventure. He is professor of marine biosciences in the College of Marine and Earth Studies at the University of Delaware, and he's aboard in the Atlantis out there in the Pacific. Thanks for joining us. Dr. CRAIG CARY (Marine Biology-Biochemistry, University of Delaware): You're more than welcome, Ira. FLATOW: Also with us is Ian McDonald, a microbiologist at the University of Waikato in New Zealand. He's in the Dry Valleys of Antarctica - I think our first sat-phone contact to the Dry Valleys. Welcome to Science Friday, Dr. McDonald. Dr. IAN MCDONALD (Microbiology, University of Waikato): Hi, Ira. How are you doing? FLATOW: Fine. When I was out there in the Dry Valleys about 30 years ago, they didn't have a satellite phone, so I'm glad to be able to talk to you. Tell us what you're studying there. Dr. MCDONALD: Yeah, it's great to have satellite phones. It keeps us in contact with not only people outside of the Dry Valleys, but all of our workers in other Dry Valleys as well. FLATOW: And what are you studying? Dr. MCDONALD: We're here looking at the microorganisms living that are in this very dry, very cold environment and looking to see what, indeed, is growing down here. FLATOW: And Dr. Cary, let me just give a quick ID. This is Talk of the Nation: Science Friday from NPR News. Craig Cary. . . Dr. CARY: How are you doing? FLATOW: Fine. What are you studying on your boat there? Dr. CARY: For about the (unintelligible) 5 years, we've been looking at vents and this is the sort of first expedition that's actually begun to explore the predators of the bacteria that have become very famous in a hydrothermal vent system. So, we're interested in looking at the diversity of both viruses, which are what we would call predacious on bacteria, and small, unicellular prokaryotic - I'm sorry - eukaryotic organisms, the protists, that would also be predacious and grazing on the bacteria. FLATOW: Dr. McDonald, do you think there is something in common in these both extreme places - you in Antarctica and Dr. Cary in those thermal vents - something about the life-forms that keep them so robust? Dr. MCDONALD: Yeah. I mean, absolutely. The organisms that are living in the Dry Valleys and at these vents are both really struggling at the extremes and at the limits of their existence. So, they're really struggling very hard to find food to grow on and conditions in which they are able to grow. FLATOW: How - what kind of conditions are there in the Dry Valleys? Dr. MCDONALD: At the moment, it's about minus 20 degrees Centigrade and there's obviously no available water at the moment because it's all frozen. And there're probably only a couple of months in a year in the Dry Valleys when there's water available for these organisms, as we are learned to understand that water is essential for life. So, there's only a very short window when they can actually grow. FLATOW: Ian McDonald. And what are we talking about there under - in those hot vents? Dr. CARY: Oh, the vents we have - it's a little bit almost the antithesis of the valleys. We have geothermal energy that is producing and providing a lot of chemical energy that these bacteria can harness. But on the other hand, we have a very dynamic thermal system, so we've got very, very hot water - I mean, water that will emit at the orifice of a vent at 360 degrees being injected into very, very cold deep ocean water that's probably around two degrees Celsius. So, you get this massive thermal gradient and the bacteria, as Ian has just said, are struggling to find within that gradient, and within the confines of the toxicity of those gradients, to make a home. FLATOW: Now, you're headed to Antarctica. After the hot thermal vents, you're going to these cold places. What do you seek to learn by being in these two places at once or actually, different times? Dr. CARY: Well, I mean, I think it all boils down to trying to understand what drives the biodiversity in these systems, what environmental conditions and parameters are actually enabling the organisms to live there. And then in turn, from a genetic standpoint, how they're able to adapt to these ecosystems and - I mean, the bacteria in the Dry Valleys are struggling with a whole other set of rules that obviously don't pertain to the vents and the vents obviously to the - but together, the adaptations are created in such a way that, you know, there's a massive evolutionary thrust to adapt to these systems. And so what we're trying to do is just really understand how they adapt and what the mechanisms are for adaptation. FLATOW: And you're about to go down in the Alvin. Dr. CARY: Yeah, we're about a day and a half away from the Gulf of California, which is very different from where we (unintelligible). The Gulf of California has a high temperature hydrothermal vent system that is covered in mud. So, this is a very soft-bottom system, as opposed to the Nine North, where we just came from, which is a hard-bottom system. And so, we're actually running a sort of a comparison in terms of the viruses and the protists. We're running a comparison between these two very different geothermal systems. FLATOW: And Dr. McDonald, you're finding life in the Dry Valleys to be much more diverse than we once thought. Dr. MCDONALD: Yeah, absolutely. The early studies that were looking at the microorganisms down here believed that there were not very many and the diversity was very limited. But now that we're using molecular biology techniques to look at bacterial diversity, we're finding that there's a pretty huge diversity. The only question that we're trying to answer at the moment is, what part of that diversity is actually showing any activity here. And that's a couple of questions we're trying to answer over the next couple of years. (Soundbite of static) FLATOW: Whoops. I want to thank you both very much for taking time to be with us. Ian McDonald, microbiologist, University of Waikato in New Zealand. He was in the Dry Valleys of Antarctica.

Fifteen seconds later, a massive second explosion rocks the ship again. Within 18 minutes, Lusitania plunges 300 feet to the bottom of the sea. Nearly 1,200 passengers and crew perished. The ship went down and left a mystery behind. What was the cause of that second blast? For nearly a century of investigation, argument and intrigue, the question is still unanswered. Independent producer Anne Goodwin Sides recently followed a dive team to the wreck for the first forensic expedition, and what they've brought up may already be changing history. ANNE GOODWIN SIDES: The Holly Jo's engine purrs like a sleeping cat as we motor through the swells toward the wreck of the Lusitania. Along the gauzy smudge of Irish coastline 12 miles north of us, we can just make out a faint spike: the lighthouse at the Old Head of Kinsale. Colin Barnes, a transplanted Englishman, sits at the helm of this 36-foot catamaran, rolling a cigarette. After weeks of drenching rain, sunlight is glinting off the sea, and the sky looks as if it's been scrubbed clean. Mr. COLIN BARNES (Fisherman and Dive Boat Captain): Very good conditions, especially for a submarine to spot an approaching ship. SIDES: Barnes has had a long career as a fisherman and dive boat captain in County Cork. He's sailed over the wreck of the Lusitania at least 50 times. He often reflects on what it must have been like during the disaster - more than a thousand people in freezing water, wreckage strewn about. Mr. BARNES: Everyone who survived said how awful it was listening to all these people crying for help. Just hundreds of people were about to perish in the cold water and just yelling for help. SIDES: Barnes shudders, imagining the wildly tilting lifeboats spilling passengers 60 feet headlong into the sea and a tiny periscope disappearing beneath the waves. His voice quavers slightly as he recounts the unfathomable actions of the British Royal Navy. The Navy had dispatched a cruiser from nearby Queenstown to undertake a rescue, then mysteriously recalled it just as it steamed into view of the survivors. The stricken masses were left frantically waving in disbelief. As if on cue, a ghostly form appears in Barnes' scanner. Directly below us, 303 feet down, the Lusitania slumbers in cold, dark water crowded with plankton. Mr. BARNES: She's lying on her starboard side, and all the masts and rigging and everything just fell down on the starboard side, and the port side is still amazingly clean. You can still see all the portholes, and she's still a big, proud structure in the seabed, but she's losing height year by year. She is collapsing. SIDES: Eventually, the port side will meet the sea floor, and everything will be entombed. Barnes consults his GPS and feathers the engine to steer us to the exact spot where highly trained divers will drop a shot line and descend into the murk. Mr. BARNES: Just a little way back from the bell, there's a cargo area. So I'm aiming this shot right at the gunner adjacent to the cargo area on the port side, with the main point of interest being all these bullets that were observed there. SIDES: Two years ago, a diver spotted a hodgepodge of bullets strewn about the ship's magazine moments before he had to surface, but he wasn't sure exactly where he was amid all the rubble on the enormous ship. (Soundbite of men talking) SIDES: On the deck of the Holly Jo, divers Owen McGarry(ph) and Stewart Andrews are suiting up. There's a ruckus of hissing hoses, clanking tanks and suctioning buoyancy bladders. Mr. BARNES: We're all going to go fairly close together. Unidentified Man: Yeah. Mr. BARNES: OK. Unidentified Man: Yeah. SIDES: Beneath their fins, the frigid Celtic Sea heaves in a steady, hypnotic rhythm. As McGarrry and Andrews descend down the shot line, a small submersible robot - or ROV, from remotely operated vehicle - follows them down to the wreck. Minutes later, we cluster around the TV monitor and watch as Andrews scoops something up in his gloved hand - a small cache of metal. His masked face is beaming in the astringent light. In his hands lie pieces of history - seven gleaming rounds of . 303 ammunition, probably made by Remington in America and intended for the British Army - ammunition that for decades, British and American officials said didn't exist. Yet all around Andrews are mountains of jumbled rifle cartridges that glint like pirates' treasure in the robot's light. The crew sends up a cheer. This is the first real breakthrough in a patient effort to solve the last lingering riddles behind the Lusitania's sinking. Mr. GREGG BEMIS (Venture Capitalist): The German's claim from the beginning was that it was carrying war materiel. Shell cases would be war materiel. Fuses would be war materiel. So you could say, well, the Germans had every right to torpedo it. SIDES: Gregg Bemis is the American venture capitalist who planned and paid for this expedition. If they're lucky, he says, his dive team could find as many as 4 million bullets. Mr. BEMIS: Four million rounds of . 303 is not some private hunter's cache. The British can't deny anymore that there was no ammunition on board. And that raises the question of what else was on board that shouldn't have been there. SIDES: Bemis is a sport diver who's been down to the Lusitania himself -with good reason. He owns it. Bemis and a partner bought the wreck in 1969. In 1982, after Bemis became the sole owner, he mounted a salvage operation that hauled up three propellers, watches, cutlery and other artifacts that were given to museums or sold at auction. But the enigma of the Lusitania's precipitous sinking remained unsolved. Mr. BEMIS: It's almost impossible to sink a ship 790 feet long in 18 minutes, almost impossible. SIDES: With its historical intrigue and forensic cul-de-sacs, the Lusitania is a magnet for a colorful cast of obsessives who've gone broke, gotten bent, turned to drink, landed in mental institutions, even committed suicide. For his part, Bemis says he's been crazy enough to spend a small fortune, doggedly defending his title as salvor-in-possession, which still only entitles him to the ship itself and anything that was Cunard's property. Mr. BEMIS: This is a major piece of history, and it really needs to be resolved. SIDES: The sooner the better. Bemis is 80 years old now. Ninety-three years of pressure, tides, corrosion, microbial digestion and target practice have made the Lusitania as fragile as lace. For Bemis and his beautiful, rotting ship, time is running out. For NPR News, I'm Anne Goodwin Sides. SIMON: And that story was produced in conjunction with an article from Men's Vogue. It's available on newsstands today.  SCOTT SIMON, host:  May 7, 1915: The RMS Lusitania is on a New York-to-Liverpool run when it's attacked by a German U-boat 12 miles off the coast of Ireland; 2:10 p. m. , a torpedo plows into the ship and explodes. Fifteen seconds later, a massive second explosion rocks the ship again. Within 18 minutes, Lusitania plunges 300 feet to the bottom of the sea. Nearly 1,200 passengers and crew perished.  The ship went down and left a mystery behind. What was the cause of that second blast? For nearly a century of investigation, argument and intrigue, the question is still unanswered. Independent producer Anne Goodwin Sides recently followed a dive team to the wreck for the first forensic expedition, and what they've brought up may already be changing history.  ANNE GOODWIN SIDES: The Holly Jo's engine purrs like a sleeping cat as we motor through the swells toward the wreck of the Lusitania. Along the gauzy smudge of Irish coastline 12 miles north of us, we can just make out a faint spike: the lighthouse at the Old Head of Kinsale. Colin Barnes, a transplanted Englishman, sits at the helm of this 36-foot catamaran, rolling a cigarette. After weeks of drenching rain, sunlight is glinting off the sea, and the sky looks as if it's been scrubbed clean.

I'm Melissa Block. MICHELE NORRIS, host: And I'm Michele Norris. The publishing world is still trying to absorb this week's bad news. Several publishing houses announced layoffs or salary freezes, and two major players in the business were left without jobs after a major reorganization at Random House. As NPR's Lynn Neary reports, all this comes at an anxious time for booksellers. LYNN NEARY: No one ever thought that publishing would be spared from the current economic turmoil, but when the fallout from the Random House reorganization was announced on the same day that Simon & Schuster and the Christian publishing company Thomas Nelson announced layoffs, it stunned the book world, says Publishers Weekly editor-in-chief, Sara Nelson. Ms. SARA NELSON (Editor-in-Chief, Publishers Weekly): It's a microcosm of what's been going on in the real world, as it were, I mean, in the larger world. But I think, while many of these things were not unexpected, the kind of volume of them was just shocking and really sobering. NEARY: Even as the bad economic news had been bearing down, most people in the book business were trying to be optimistic. Books, they said, are recession-proof because they're cheap. But Larry Robin, who's been in the bookselling business since 1960, doesn't buy that conventional wisdom. Mr. LARRY ROBIN (Owner, Robin's Bookstore, Philadelphia): In today's world, it isn't cheap entertainment anymore. With the computer and with iPods and Netflix, I mean, you can get all sorts of other entertainment. NEARY: Robin's Bookstore has been a fixture in downtown Philadelphia since 1936. But now, Robin is getting out of the business of selling new books and will sell used books instead. Mr. ROBIN: If it was a matter of hanging on for a year, I could do that, but I don't see it changing. I don't see the economy getting better for a long time. I don't see that economic model of a retail store coming back. NEARY: Independent bookstores have been struggling to survive ever since the advent of the chain stores. But now, even the chains are under threat, with competition from big-box stores like Costco and, more significantly, from the online bookselling behemoth, Amazon. Barnes & Noble, Borders and Books-A-Million all reported a decline in sales in the third quarter, and there's some concern that Borders may not survive. Bookstores around the country reported mixed sales over the Thanksgiving weekend. But there was good news for some, like Becky Anderson of Anderson's Bookshop in suburban Chicago. She says so far, business is better than she expected. It's next year she's worried about. She expects to pull back on everything, including book orders. Ms. BECKY ANDERSON (Owner, Anderson's Bookshop, Chicago): There may be some of those books that might have been a smaller buy that maybe we won't - we're going to let go for now. And if it's something that we're hearing some buzz on after the fact, then we'll definitely pick it up. But there are some things that we, you know, we may not be buying as much of, or maybe skipping. NEARY: The prospect of fewer book orders and tightening credit already led one publishing house to make a decision that set off alarm bells throughout the book industry. Just before Thanksgiving, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, a newly merged company, announced it was putting a temporary halt on the acquisition of new books. Ellen Geiger, an agent with the Frances Goldin Literary Agency, says the move made people nervous. Ms. ELLEN GEIGER (Senior Agent, Frances Goldin Literary Agency): Because acquisitions are really the lifeblood of our business - it's the pipeline, it's the food chain - and if one company is halting their acquisitions, it's really a cause of great concern. NEARY: Like other industries caught in the economic downturn, publishing is being forced to take a hard look at how it does business. Jonathan Burnham is CEO, vice president and publisher of Harper, an imprint of HarperCollins. Mr. JONATHAN BURNHAM (Chief Executive Officer, Harper): We were already facing certain big challenges before the recession came along, and those challenges were connected to the traditional mechanisms of the book business. NEARY: Burnham says the economic downturn means publishers may be forced to find an alternative to the system of returns, which allows stores to return unsold books to warehouses, resulting in books being shipped back and forth across the country at great cost. Beyond that, Burnham says, the industry must now truly grapple with digital advances, like electronic readers, that are already leading to dramatic changes. Mr. BURNHAM: It's making us focus even more intently on how to make sense of a digital future and how quickly we should move towards it, given that publishing digitally will liberate publishers, and indeed, readers, from the costs and the problems of producing physical books. NEARY: Burnham says book lovers will always be able to buy beautifully produced copies of books, but there could be fewer of them, as booksellers and book publishers search for a new way to do business in the new economy.

I'm Ira Flatow.  A bit later in the hour, Physics 101 for President-elect Obama.  But first, gray murky flood water sacked Venice earlier this week.  The water rose higher than they have in nearly a generation.  The city floods several times a year when tides and southern winds pushed lagoon waters into the sinking city.  But experts say Venice could be the first to go if and when a hotter planet brings rising sea levels.  And that's not the worst of the climate forecast this week, now comes news that climate change to be much worse than the latest IPCC estimates.   So, what are we going to do about it?  Thousands of delegates from all over the world are now gathered in Poland for the U. N. climate talks to figure that out.  At this meeting, they need to lay the ground work for the real haggling which is going to happen in Copenhagen next year.  It's inconvenient timing for the U. S. with President Bush packing boxes and President-elect Obama furiously assembling his White House staff and Congress is in recess.   So what if anything might we expect from the talks?  Did U. S. sign any agreement following its failure to do so in Kyoto?  And will these decisions be bold enough to halt scenarios of distant climate catastrophes like rising seas?  My next guest is here to talk about some of those questions.  Elliot Diringer is the vice president for international studies at the Pew Center on Global Climate Change in Arlington Virginia.  Welcome back to Science Friday. Mr. ELLIOT DIRINGER (Vice President for International Strategies, Pew Center for Global Climate Change):  Thanks Ira.  Good to be with you. FLATOW:  Give us a little road map here of how this Poland Summit fits in with Kyoto, and Copenhagen and all the others Mr. DIRINGER:  Well, the Poland meeting really is the midpoint in a two year process.  Last year in Bali, governments adopted the Bali action plan which kicked off a new round of negotiations to try to come up with another agreement beyond Kyoto.  And they set themselves a deadline of next year in Copenhagen, December 2009 in Copenhagen to wrap up that agreement.  So, this post then is a chance really for the governments to take a look back and assess how far they've gotten this year and fine tune their work program for the next year.  There are not really any major substantive decisions on the agenda.  And I think really it's more a final round of positioning by governments before they head into what everyone's hoping will be a very intense period of negotiation.  Up 'till know, it's really been enough more of a pre-negotiation mode. FLATOW:  Is everyone still looking toward the United States to play a leadership role here? Mr. DIRINGER:  Absolutely, number one.  I think this whole process has pretty much been in a holding pattern waiting for the United States.  And there are very high expectations that with President-elect Obama taking office, that the U. S. is back at the table and ready to deal.  And I think that's true but I am hoping that the expectations can be tempered somewhat because I think it will take a little while for the U. S. to be able to actually cut that deal. FLATOW:  But won't the counter arguments still be the same - being that even if the U. S. comes on board this time, we're still thinking that the greatest threats to pollution or green house gases come from China and India? Mr. DIRINGER:  Well, I don't think that you would see the U. S. enter into a new climate agreement unless it included some kind of reasonable commitments by countries like China and India.  And that's been really the political reality in this country for some time, which is why Kyoto was never sent up to the Senate for ratification.  So, I mean I think we're at a stage with the United States is prepared to move forward domestically with mandatory limits on emissions here at home.  I think we've seen that consensus emerge and that's a top priority for President-elect Obama and the Democratic leadership in Congress, getting that cap-and-trade bill enacted.  But whether the U. S. would then go the next step and take on a binding international commitment - that will depend on what other countries are prepared to do it as well. FLATOW:  Isn't the U. S. in a position of almost catch-up now? Where the other countries are going to move a step forward, we haven't gotten to where they've been yet? Mr. DIRINGER:  Well, unfortunately not too many countries have really taken vigorous steps forward.  The European Union has shown some real strong political leadership putting in place the kinds of regulations and mechanisms you need to start reducing emissions and has had some success at that so far, and really they've stood out as the leaders internationally on the issue.  But by in large, most of the other developed counties have not really begun to put in place any significant measures. FLATOW:  What kinds of levels would we all be aiming out there?  We meaning the county's present at the Copenhagen meeting. Mr. DIRINGER:  Well, I mean just to give you a sense of how the numbers appear to be lining up at the moment, the EU having adopted that leadership role, they've said already that they are prepared to reduced their emissions 20 percent below 1990 levels in the year 2020, and that's something they'll do with or without an agreement and they're prepared to go even deeper with an agreement.  And they think that all developed countries should agree to reduce 25 to 40 percent below 1990 levels, really significant cuts.  But if you look at the debate here in Washington, the kinds of numbers that have been in bills brought before Congress, the number that President Obama articulated just a couple of weeks ago, President-elect Obama, excuse me.  Those numbers are all lining up at about 1990 levels in 2020, so a pretty significant gap between where the EU would like us to be and what appears to be politically plausible here in the U. S. FLATOW:  The IPCC estimates relied on older data and we keep hearing new estimates coming out from scientists who were saying that the climate change is happening a lot faster than we even predicted back then. Mr. DIRINGER:  I hear the same reports and I think the bottom line message here is the absolute urgency with getting on with the job, doing as much as we possibly can as quickly as we possibly can. FLATOW:  Do you any idea who might be heading a team that would go to Copenhagen for the U. S. ? Mr. DIRINGER:  You know, I have actually not heard any speculation and rephrase that, I won't bother sharing what little I've had heard.  That's not clear at this point.  I mean typically the head of delegation from the U. S. is the Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs.  And I have not heard names in that regard. FLATOW:  But whoever is chosen might signal the kind of seriousness. Mr. DIRINGER:  Oh, I expect that this administration will definitely express some seriousness, and they already have.  I mean, the President-elect issued an statement on climate changes a couple of weeks ago, where he indicated they're probably wouldn't be anybody from the incoming administration going to Poland then but he said that cap-and-trade is the priority for this administration and included in that number 1990 by 2020, which I think was a very important signal. FLATOW:  So if we don't see anything dramatic coming out of Poland, that as you say, this is just an exploratory meeting or a get to know you for Copenhagen. Mr. DIRINGER:  Well, no.  They know each other pretty well at this point.  But it's to be, countries are laying down their position and sizing up the positions of others.  They're setting their expectations for an agreement in Copenhagen, what they want to see in it.  I mean, I think at this stage those expectations are rather widely divergent and to actually get to an agreement is going to be a real challenge.  And we wouldn't actually expect to see a full and final agreement in Copenhagen.  There isn't the time and to some degree this process is going to hinge on how quickly legislation can move here in our Congress.  And it may move.  We hopefully will see the legislations start moving.  But I don't think it's likely that we'll see cap-and-trade legislation enacted by the time of Copenhagen, which will make it very difficult for the administration to be agreeing to a specific target level.  And if the U. S. isn't ready, other countries won't be ready either. FLATOW:  But you think the U. S. will move independently on things like cap-and-trade, no matter what comes out of Copenhagen? Mr. DIRINGER:  I think we're at that stage.  I think that the movement will happen even before Copenhagen.  It may not be finalized before Copenhagen, but everything is lining up in that direction.  I think in the longer term, our ability to sustain an ambitious program will depend, in part, on what we see in other countries.  And that's why an international agreement is so important.  Once the U. S. is committed to action, it needs to leverage that action into action by others. FLATOW:  So, we're going - as you say, we're going to see some sort of intermediary agreement probably. Mr. DIRINGER:  Well, that would be - that would be our assessment of a realistic outcome or the best plausible outcome in Copenhagen.  You could hopefully get agreement on the basic architecture of this new international framework, but probably not on the specific commitment levels that different countries would be taking.  And just an agreement on architecture, we think, would be a huge step forward and would make Copenhagen a success, but it would still fall short of what many hope to see, which is a full final agreement that can be signed by countries and taken home and ratified. FLATOW:  No one will really think that the Kyoto agreements were very terribly successful, I mean, as you say, many of the EU countries couldn't live up to, even though they wanted to, couldn't live up - live up to the terms of those themselves.   Mr. DIRINGER:  So, I mean, Kyoto's had a positive effect.  I mean, we would not have in place in Europe right now, the kind of regulatory system they've established, the emissions trading scheme were it not for the drive of Kyoto.  And Kyoto symbolically, I think has had an important effect even here in the United States.  You know, if you're a multinational business operating around the world, you're beginning to feel the effects of Kyoto, and you understand that there's an inevitability for carbon restrictions here in the United States as well.  So, I mean, in terms of actual impact on global emissions, very, very limited. FLATOW:  You write it yourself in your own column online, the world can ill afford a replay of Kyoto with Europe demanding more than can be delivered, and the U. S. ultimately walking away.  We need realism, not brinksmanship. Mr. DIRINGER:  Yeah.  Well, we've head down - headed down that road once before, and we are at the stage where we need an agreement among countries so we can get moving with what really is going to be very challenging transformation.  And it's important that we narrow the gap first between developed countries, the Europe and the United States on our level of efforts, so that we can then show that to developing countries and get them to come to the table with significant level of effort as well. FLATOW:  Do you think that the fact that there is a change in the administration is going to make the - may loosen the gears a bit on the other countries? Mr. DIRINGER:  Oh, absolutely.  And I think, you know, the biggest thing that's been that's been holding up process is demonstration of real action by the world's largest historic emitter.  You know, China has recently surpassed the U. S. as the largest annual emitter of greenhouse gases, but you know, really what matters to the atmosphere and what matters to the rest of the world is how much countries have emitted over time.  Those gases stay up there a long time.  And the warming we feel today is the result of a century of more emissions.  And the U. S. is responsible for the lion's share of those emissions. FLATOW:  And so we might not say - China might not say we're to jump in and be the world leader, but they might want to see first what the U. S. does. Mr. DIRINGER:  Absolutely.   FLATOW:  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I want to thank you very much for taking time to talk with us.  And I'm sure you'll be following it and maybe we'll get back to you for a summary for us. Mr. DIRINGER:  OK.  Always a pleasure. FLATOW:  Have a good holiday. Mr. DIRINGER:  Thank you.  You too. FLATOW:  Elliot Diringer is the vice president for international strategies at the Pew Center on Global Climate Change in Arlington, Virginia.  We're going to take a short break.  Change gears so we're going to come back and talk about Antarctica and the Arctic - the Arctic regions both spanning the globe in search of moving glaciers.  Nice fact, so stay with us.  We'll be right back after the short break. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW:  I'm Ira Flatow.  This is Talk of the Nation Science Friday from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW:  You're listening to Talk of the Nation: Science Friday.  I'm Ira Flatow.  We've been talking this hour about climate change, and now, we're going to shift gears a bit and talk about some basic research that may give climatologists better tools to predict the effects of global warming. My next guest has traveled to opposite poles over the earth to do their research. One journeyed to a strip of land wedged between the Greenland ice sheet and flows of heavy packed ice from the Arctic Ocean, and he may have solved the mystery of some poorly understood greenhouse gas emissions up there in the tundra.  He's going to tell us more about that.   My other guest is down in the Antarctica where she is doing some slew thing with ice penetrating radars to map mountains and lakes hidden under the ice.  Remember, Antarctica is covered with ice sheets up to two miles deep.  So, there's a lot of stuff under there, and the measurements may give us more clues as to how these giant ice sheets glide over the continent.  Let me introduce my guests, Torben Christensen is a professor at the GeoBiosphere Science Centre at Lund University in Sweden.  He joins us on the phone from Sweden about the Science Friday. Professor TORBEN CHRISTENSEN (GeoBiosphere Science Center, Lund University, Sweden):  Hi there. FLATOW:  Thanks for staying up late with us this evening. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. CHRISTENSEN:  Thank you. FLATOW:  Robin Bell is a senior research scientist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, that's of Columbia University here in Palisades, New York.  And she's on the phone from Antarctica's McMurdo Station.  Welcome to the show, Dr. Bell. Dr. ROBIN BELL (Senior Scientist, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory):  Oh, thank you very much for having me. FLATOW:  Oh, thank you for staying up late or the next day with us for being there.   Dr. BELL:  That's morning here. FLATOW:  Yeah. Are you heading out to - from the base station, where are you going?  What are you working on? Dr. BELL:  We're part of an international (unintelligible) project involving six nations, who are heading to the middle of the East Antarctica ice sheet, just the biggest ice sheet on our planet, trying to understand simply how big it is, explore the hidden mountain range underneath it. FLATOW:  When I was there at McMurdo 30 years ago, we went out and visited scientists on the western, the smaller ice sheet, because that seemed to be the one that was most endanger of collapsing first if there was a global warming.  Why - now you're trying to learn as much as you can about the Eastern sheet? Dr. BELL:  The Eastern ice sheet is seems compared to the U. S. , if we drop it on top of the U. S. would cover the entire 48 - lower 48, and be nothing but a couple of peaks, maybe Mt. Rainer sticking out, little else.  It's the birth place of all the ice sheets on the earth and we even, at this point, don't know how much ice is there.  And what we're trying to understand is again births of mountains, which is sort of the birth place of the ice sheet. We can't make good ice sheet models because we don't how much ice is there and what's at the bottom.  It's kind of like we don't know what's greasing the bottom of the ice sheets until we can know what's underneath them. FLATOW:  Now we've heard - that's interesting that you put it that way, because we've heard research recently from Greenland, which is in the North - the North Pole area.  Their ice sheets are being greased by huge flows of water that seep out from underneath the ice sheets.  Do you know if that is happening in the Antarctica also? Dr. BELL:  Well, there are two different ways you can get water to the bottom of ice sheets.  One is melt the top and then kind of crack it and deliver the water into the water in to the - water to the bottom that way.  The other way is if you have a bottom of an ice sheet, you actually - it's thick enough that you melt the bottom, and East Antarctica is thick enough that there's melting over much of the bottom of it, and you make big lakes, lakes the size of New Jersey or Lake Ontario.  And it looks like these lakes can make the ice sheet flow faster.  That's one of the questions we're looking at is how water in this lake can make the ice sheet flow faster. FLATOW:  Do we know what effects that global warming maybe having on that flow? Dr. BELL:  Global warming probably is playing a big part of the changes we're seeing in Greenland, that process where you melt the top of the ice sheet and deliver that solarly-warmed water down to the bottom.  In the Antarctica, the ice is so thick.  It doesn't even know that the last Ice Age ended, so global warming isn't changing these processes much. FLATOW:  Dr. Christensen, let's talk about the wetlands in the tundra that you're studying.  How did the wetlands like the tundra contribute to grown - greenhouse gas emissions compare to man-made emissions?  We hear a lot about man-made emissions, but not about the tundra. Prof. CHRISTENSEN:  Well, I think the - that they have.  They are contributing in the sense that in the margin of the Arctic, there are thermafrost areas that are melting as a consequence of climate change.  And in these areas, we have quite solid documentation now for that the emissions of green house gases, like me saying, are increasing both in salt lakes in Siberia and in areas where the thermafrost is disappearing and leaving behind very wet conditions that are leading to more methane formation in the ground as the accumulated organic material is being decomposed without any oxygen present.  So, we are getting more methane coming out of the Arctic in the margins of the Arctic.  That's not what, I guess, the story that we have now from the high Arctic really is about.  It's more about the redistribution of the emissions from the summer to a very unexpected part of the year. FLATOW:  Yeah. Are you saying that you're finding emissions happening in the autumn and in the winter time, where you did - do you would think that the cold would not allowed for those emission? Mr. CHRISTENSE:  Yeah.  That's what the real big surprises for us in our ground-based observations that we reported in nature just yesterday.  That's the emissions that happen right as the whole system is freezing in and we are believing or we have been believing before that this is when the system goes asleep and it stops, so to say, being active in terms of exchanges of greenhouse gases with the atmosphere.  As it turns out as it goes into this, so to say, seemingly sleepy mode, that's where a lot of things happens, and you get this massive emission of a very powerful greenhouse gas.  And this is an observation that to us from the ground-based measurements point of view where extremely surprising. FLATOW:  Why would we have an increase in the cold time?  I know we could understand maybe in our minds the spring, but why in the cold weather? Prof. CHRISTENSEN:  Well, in the cold we think that what's happening is that the wind you have in a permafrost environment, you have a kind of very solid bottom on the soil and the processes that are happening in the soil. And as the soil starts freezing from top, you get a pressure that builds up towards this frozen bottom, which is not really to be moved anywhere. And as you, sort of say, push this top freezing layer down towards the frozen bottom, you get - you simply pressurize the area in between and that's where you have a lot of gases as bubbles.  And these are then kind of like pushed out or squeezed out through whatever cracks and whatever (unintelligible) that may still be there in the system that can act as conduits, and can act as kind of chimneys for the squeezing out of the gas.   That's what we believe just now, but we're not sure of the mechanism, and this is where, you know, we hope that a lot, you know, new studies and many other people will start looking into this question because it is a basic research finding that, I think, has huge implications for how we understand the natural impact on the climate and the atmospheric dynamics.   FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number, talking with Torben Christensen and Robin Bell.  Torben, when you say this has a great impact, are you saying that we need to put this into our equation and to the balance of the carbon balance that has been missing before, that there might be more release of these greenhouse gases than we thought? Prof. CHRISTENSEN:  No.  I mean, the, so to say, the extra emissions that we have measured during this freezing period is well within the uncertainty of the global the estimates for emission from this region, if you like, also that the certain pole north as a whole.  So, it's not like we're adding a major new source, but what we're doing is that we are redistributing it through the year, and as it turns out it does actually help some of the understanding of how the atmospheric dynamics are in terms of how atmospheric methane at high northern latitudes are varying over the year. FLATOW:  Let me go - let me get back to Robin Bell in McMurdo station in the Antarctica. This week, the European Space Agency, Dr. Bell, reported new rips in the Wilkins Ice Shelf.  Please describe where that is and what that means. Dr. BELL: Well, the Wilkins Ice Shelf is one of the large ice shelves around the edge of Antarctica.  And what that means is that more of these big pieces of floating ice that rim the continent are beginning to fracture.  And the importance of this isn't that there's more ice going in the ocean because this ice is already in the ocean.  It's floating.  But - and so what it probably reflects is warmer temperatures in the ocean kind of like if you had some ice cubes in your cup and there's warm water in the bottom, they'd start to melt and maybe crack.  What the importance is that we start to lose more and more of these large ice shelves that we made eventually see acceleration of the flow of the inland ice into the global oceans.  And that's what will cause global sea level to rise at a faster rate. FLATOW:  And how fast is the melting occurring in the Western ice sheets compared to the Eastern, or don't you know yet and that's what you're trying to find out? Dr. BELL:  Let's see.  The ice sheets that we know are changing quickly are Greenland and West Antarctica.  East Antarctica is still - it's so difficult to study and so remote that we actually don't know what it signal is.  It looks like it might be imbalanced.  There still tremendous disagreement.  So. . . FLATOW:  And it's so huge.  I mean you said you could drop it on the top of the whole U. S. and cover the whole continental U. S.  It's like saying where would you start in the United States to look? Dr. BELL:  Right, and that's why it's such a challenge to study it, and why it's taking six nations really just to be able to try and characterize the simple size and the nature of the topography.  It's kind of like we're trying to figure out what the Rocky Mountains are and how the ice started to grow on the Rocky Mountains. FLATOW:  Mmhmm. Dr. BELL:  But - so we just at this point don't know how East Antarctica is changing and what the mechanisms are to have changed in the past. FLATOW:  What kind of effort? What's the size of the team like that's studying this? Dr. BELL:  So, it's six nations.  There'll be 30 scientists on the ground operating three science aircraft covering the size about the area twice the California.  These mountain ranges are - that were - or after are bigger than the Alps or about the same size of the Alps.  But the logistics to get into this place are tremendous, it's two tractors traversed trains, one from the Chinese and one from the U. S. , with the Australians building a camp and the British providing planes.  So it's a real international pull your effort that wouldn't be possible without the cooperation of all these nations. FLATOW:  So are you - do you have one central base or you've scattered about the ice sheet there? Dr. BELL:  We have two bases.  We have one that - it looks like just the weather has broken on the Australian side of the continent and they're about to get it in.  The U. S. has been delivering fuel for us to work with.  And then so another about 400 miles away to the south is the base we'll work out of, sort of run the other side of the peak of the ice sheet, and we have two big bases to work from. FLATOW:  Talking about the research in the Arctic's, Antarctica and Arctic regions this hour, Talk of the Nation Science Friday from NPR News.  Question for you, Torben from a viewer in Second Life Cannes Luming(ph) says is there evidence of past plant life at the bottom of the sheet? Prof. CHRISTENSEN:  Wow, that's a question that may really be more put towards the hour of the guest speaker here.  But I do know that there are in areas of northern Greenland, where there's been advances of glaciers, that there are really very important tools for understanding how the freezing conditions were from actually fossil plants that has been so to say covered by the expanding ice sheets.  And from looking at how they grew just before the ice sheet came in and sort to say lay down on top of them that you can actually see how the climate conditions were just before the advance of the ice sheet.  But this is kind of beyond what the study areas that I guess representing here is.  So maybe we should put the question down to the Antarctic. FLATOW:  Well Dr. Bell, how old is that ice at the bottom of the ice sheet? Dr. BELL:  Well the ice sheet itself started 35 million years ago.  But one of the other things we're after us to see if we can find the oldest ice on the planet.  Something that's older than a million years so we can get a climate record that goes past the 800,000 record that we have.  Some place we can really get the atmospheric gasses.   FLATOW:  How deeply you have to drill for that? Dr. BELL:  Close to four kilometers. FLATOW:  That'll get you that - back about a million years? Dr. BELL:  Yeah that will get it - and what you have to is a find a place where the conditions are just right to preserve that ice. FLATOW:  And where would that be? Dr. BELL:  Well it would be on the flanks of the Gambertus(ph) Mountains is where we're looking.  The Chinese hoped to drill right on top of Belmay which is the absolute highest point in the East Antarctic ice sheet but we're going to be looking to see whether or not that's the best place and whether or not their other sites would all by surround.   FLATOW:  How is deep is the deepest ice there? Dr. BELL:  It's a little more than two miles depending on what unit you'd like.  And that's where you start to see the large lakes before ice gets very thick.   FLATOW:  Is one of the problems with drilling that deep that the ice is moving, to stop the drill through? Dr. BELL:  No, the ice in East Antarctica's mostly fairly stagnant.  It's you know - it's frozen to the bed.  It's - and moving relatively slowly until you get to these big rivers of ice where it moves.  It goes from moving one to two meters a year to moving a hundreds of meters a year, half to a kilometer a year.   FLATOW:  So what is it. . . Dr. BELL:  Not the. . . FLATOW:  I'm sorry.  I was just trying to figure out what the limitation of how deep you can drill is? Dr. BELL:  Oh, you can get to the bottom of the ice sheet it just - if you're trying to preserve the core so you can make geochemical measurements on it, it takes a long time to drill, pull off all of those pieces of ice and drill again.  It's just a very slow process.  And in these places where it's so cold, your window of opportunity at work it's really narrow.  You can get into these places when the temperatures get above minus 50 and leaves you sort of at most a couple of months a year to work in. FLATOW:  Well we wish you and Dr. Christensen a very good luck.  Thank you for taking time to be with us up early and then good luck on your research.  Robin Bell, senior research scientist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia.  And Torben Christensen is a professor at GeoBiosphere Science Centre at Lund University in Sweden.  We're going to take a short break and change gears, and we're going to come back and talk about - what would - what does President-elect Obama need to know about science and physics.  What does the president need to know?  See what you guess on what he needs to know.  So stay with us, we'll be right back after this break. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW:  I'm Ira Flatow.  This is Talk of the Nation Science Friday from NPR News.  IRA FLATOW, host:  This is Talk of the Nation: Science Friday.  I'm Ira Flatow.  A bit later in the hour, Physics 101 for President-elect Obama.  But first, gray murky flood water sacked Venice earlier this week.  The water rose higher than they have in nearly a generation.  The city floods several times a year when tides and southern winds pushed lagoon waters into the sinking city.  But experts say Venice could be the first to go if and when a hotter planet brings rising sea levels.  And that's not the worst of the climate forecast this week, now comes news that climate change to be much worse than the latest IPCC estimates.    So, what are we going to do about it?  Thousands of delegates from all over the world are now gathered in Poland for the U. N. climate talks to figure that out.  At this meeting, they need to lay the ground work for the real haggling which is going to happen in Copenhagen next year.  It's inconvenient timing for the U. S. with President Bush packing boxes and President-elect Obama furiously assembling his White House staff and Congress is in recess.    So what if anything might we expect from the talks?  Did U. S. sign any agreement following its failure to do so in Kyoto?  And will these decisions be bold enough to halt scenarios of distant climate catastrophes like rising seas?  My next guest is here to talk about some of those questions.  Elliot Diringer is the vice president for international studies at the Pew Center on Global Climate Change in Arlington Virginia.  Welcome back to Science Friday.  Mr. ELLIOT DIRINGER (Vice President for International Strategies, Pew Center for Global Climate Change):  Thanks Ira.  Good to be with you.  FLATOW:  Give us a little road map here of how this Poland Summit fits in with Kyoto, and Copenhagen and all the others  Mr. DIRINGER:  Well, the Poland meeting really is the midpoint in a two year process.  Last year in Bali, governments adopted the Bali action plan which kicked off a new round of negotiations to try to come up with another agreement beyond Kyoto.  And they set themselves a deadline of next year in Copenhagen, December 2009 in Copenhagen to wrap up that agreement.  So, this post then is a chance really for the governments to take a look back and assess how far they've gotten this year and fine tune their work program for the next year.  There are not really any major substantive decisions on the agenda.  And I think really it's more a final round of positioning by governments before they head into what everyone's hoping will be a very intense period of negotiation.  Up 'till know, it's really been enough more of a pre-negotiation mode.  FLATOW:  Is everyone still looking toward the United States to play a leadership role here?  Mr. DIRINGER:  Absolutely, number one.  I think this whole process has pretty much been in a holding pattern waiting for the United States.  And there are very high expectations that with President-elect Obama taking office, that the U. S. is back at the table and ready to deal.  And I think that's true but I am hoping that the expectations can be tempered somewhat because I think it will take a little while for the U. S. to be able to actually cut that deal.  FLATOW:  But won't the counter arguments still be the same - being that even if the U. S. comes on board this time, we're still thinking that the greatest threats to pollution or green house gases come from China and India?  Mr. DIRINGER:  Well, I don't think that you would see the U. S. enter into a new climate agreement unless it included some kind of reasonable commitments by countries like China and India.  And that's been really the political reality in this country for some time, which is why Kyoto was never sent up to the Senate for ratification.  So, I mean I think we're at a stage with the United States is prepared to move forward domestically with mandatory limits on emissions here at home.  I think we've seen that consensus emerge and that's a top priority for President-elect Obama and the Democratic leadership in Congress, getting that cap-and-trade bill enacted.  But whether the U. S. would then go the next step and take on a binding international commitment - that will depend on what other countries are prepared to do it as well.  FLATOW:  Isn't the U. S. in a position of almost catch-up now? Where the other countries are going to move a step forward, we haven't gotten to where they've been yet?  Mr. DIRINGER:  Well, unfortunately not too many countries have really taken vigorous steps forward.  The European Union has shown some real strong political leadership putting in place the kinds of regulations and mechanisms you need to start reducing emissions and has had some success at that so far, and really they've stood out as the leaders internationally on the issue.  But by in large, most of the other developed counties have not really begun to put in place any significant measures.  FLATOW:  What kinds of levels would we all be aiming out there?  We meaning the county's present at the Copenhagen meeting.  Mr. DIRINGER:  Well, I mean just to give you a sense of how the numbers appear to be lining up at the moment, the EU having adopted that leadership role, they've said already that they are prepared to reduced their emissions 20 percent below 1990 levels in the year 2020, and that's something they'll do with or without an agreement and they're prepared to go even deeper with an agreement.  And they think that all developed countries should agree to reduce 25 to 40 percent below 1990 levels, really significant cuts.  But if you look at the debate here in Washington, the kinds of numbers that have been in bills brought before Congress, the number that President Obama articulated just a couple of weeks ago, President-elect Obama, excuse me.  Those numbers are all lining up at about 1990 levels in 2020, so a pretty significant gap between where the EU would like us to be and what appears to be politically plausible here in the U. S.  FLATOW:  The IPCC estimates relied on older data and we keep hearing new estimates coming out from scientists who were saying that the climate change is happening a lot faster than we even predicted back then.  Mr. DIRINGER:  I hear the same reports and I think the bottom line message here is the absolute urgency with getting on with the job, doing as much as we possibly can as quickly as we possibly can.  FLATOW:  Do you any idea who might be heading a team that would go to Copenhagen for the U. S. ?  Mr. DIRINGER:  You know, I have actually not heard any speculation and rephrase that, I won't bother sharing what little I've had heard.  That's not clear at this point.  I mean typically the head of delegation from the U. S. is the Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs.  And I have not heard names in that regard.  FLATOW:  But whoever is chosen might signal the kind of seriousness.  Mr. DIRINGER:  Oh, I expect that this administration will definitely express some seriousness, and they already have.  I mean, the President-elect issued an statement on climate changes a couple of weeks ago, where he indicated they're probably wouldn't be anybody from the incoming administration going to Poland then but he said that cap-and-trade is the priority for this administration and included in that number 1990 by 2020, which I think was a very important signal.  FLATOW:  So if we don't see anything dramatic coming out of Poland, that as you say, this is just an exploratory meeting or a get to know you for Copenhagen.  Mr. DIRINGER:  Well, no.  They know each other pretty well at this point.  But it's to be, countries are laying down their position and sizing up the positions of others.  They're setting their expectations for an agreement in Copenhagen, what they want to see in it.  I mean, I think at this stage those expectations are rather widely divergent and to actually get to an agreement is going to be a real challenge.  And we wouldn't actually expect to see a full and final agreement in Copenhagen.  There isn't the time and to some degree this process is going to hinge on how quickly legislation can move here in our Congress.  And it may move.  We hopefully will see the legislations start moving.  But I don't think it's likely that we'll see cap-and-trade legislation enacted by the time of Copenhagen, which will make it very difficult for the administration to be agreeing to a specific target level.  And if the U. S. isn't ready, other countries won't be ready either.  FLATOW:  But you think the U. S. will move independently on things like cap-and-trade, no matter what comes out of Copenhagen?  Mr. DIRINGER:  I think we're at that stage.  I think that the movement will happen even before Copenhagen.  It may not be finalized before Copenhagen, but everything is lining up in that direction.  I think in the longer term, our ability to sustain an ambitious program will depend, in part, on what we see in other countries.  And that's why an international agreement is so important.  Once the U. S. is committed to action, it needs to leverage that action into action by others.  FLATOW:  So, we're going - as you say, we're going to see some sort of intermediary agreement probably.  Mr. DIRINGER:  Well, that would be - that would be our assessment of a realistic outcome or the best plausible outcome in Copenhagen.  You could hopefully get agreement on the basic architecture of this new international framework, but probably not on the specific commitment levels that different countries would be taking.  And just an agreement on architecture, we think, would be a huge step forward and would make Copenhagen a success, but it would still fall short of what many hope to see, which is a full final agreement that can be signed by countries and taken home and ratified.  FLATOW:  No one will really think that the Kyoto agreements were very terribly successful, I mean, as you say, many of the EU countries couldn't live up to, even though they wanted to, couldn't live up - live up to the terms of those themselves.    Mr. DIRINGER:  So, I mean, Kyoto's had a positive effect.  I mean, we would not have in place in Europe right now, the kind of regulatory system they've established, the emissions trading scheme were it not for the drive of Kyoto.  And Kyoto symbolically, I think has had an important effect even here in the United States.  You know, if you're a multinational business operating around the world, you're beginning to feel the effects of Kyoto, and you understand that there's an inevitability for carbon restrictions here in the United States as well.  So, I mean, in terms of actual impact on global emissions, very, very limited.  FLATOW:  You write it yourself in your own column online, the world can ill afford a replay of Kyoto with Europe demanding more than can be delivered, and the U. S. ultimately walking away.  We need realism, not brinksmanship.  Mr. DIRINGER:  Yeah.  Well, we've head down - headed down that road once before, and we are at the stage where we need an agreement among countries so we can get moving with what really is going to be very challenging transformation.  And it's important that we narrow the gap first between developed countries, the Europe and the United States on our level of efforts, so that we can then show that to developing countries and get them to come to the table with significant level of effort as well.  FLATOW:  Do you think that the fact that there is a change in the administration is going to make the - may loosen the gears a bit on the other countries?  Mr. DIRINGER:  Oh, absolutely.  And I think, you know, the biggest thing that's been that's been holding up process is demonstration of real action by the world's largest historic emitter.  You know, China has recently surpassed the U. S. as the largest annual emitter of greenhouse gases, but you know, really what matters to the atmosphere and what matters to the rest of the world is how much countries have emitted over time.  Those gases stay up there a long time.  And the warming we feel today is the result of a century of more emissions.  And the U. S. is responsible for the lion's share of those emissions.  FLATOW:  And so we might not say - China might not say we're to jump in and be the world leader, but they might want to see first what the U. S. does.  Mr. DIRINGER:  Absolutely.    FLATOW:  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I want to thank you very much for taking time to talk with us.  And I'm sure you'll be following it and maybe we'll get back to you for a summary for us.  Mr. DIRINGER:  OK.  Always a pleasure.  FLATOW:  Have a good holiday.  Mr. DIRINGER:  Thank you.  You too.  FLATOW:  Elliot Diringer is the vice president for international strategies at the Pew Center on Global Climate Change in Arlington, Virginia.  We're going to take a short break.  Change gears so we're going to come back and talk about Antarctica and the Arctic - the Arctic regions both spanning the globe in search of moving glaciers.  Nice fact, so stay with us.  We'll be right back after the short break.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW:  I'm Ira Flatow.  This is Talk of the Nation Science Friday from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW:  You're listening to Talk of the Nation: Science Friday.  I'm Ira Flatow.  We've been talking this hour about climate change, and now, we're going to shift gears a bit and talk about some basic research that may give climatologists better tools to predict the effects of global warming. My next guest has traveled to opposite poles over the earth to do their research. One journeyed to a strip of land wedged between the Greenland ice sheet and flows of heavy packed ice from the Arctic Ocean, and he may have solved the mystery of some poorly understood greenhouse gas emissions up there in the tundra.  He's going to tell us more about that.    My other guest is down in the Antarctica where she is doing some slew thing with ice penetrating radars to map mountains and lakes hidden under the ice.  Remember, Antarctica is covered with ice sheets up to two miles deep.  So, there's a lot of stuff under there, and the measurements may give us more clues as to how these giant ice sheets glide over the continent.  Let me introduce my guests, Torben Christensen is a professor at the GeoBiosphere Science Centre at Lund University in Sweden.  He joins us on the phone from Sweden about the Science Friday.  Professor TORBEN CHRISTENSEN (GeoBiosphere Science Center, Lund University, Sweden):  Hi there.  FLATOW:  Thanks for staying up late with us this evening.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Prof. CHRISTENSEN:  Thank you.  FLATOW:  Robin Bell is a senior research scientist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, that's of Columbia University here in Palisades, New York.  And she's on the phone from Antarctica's McMurdo Station.  Welcome to the show, Dr. Bell.  Dr. ROBIN BELL (Senior Scientist, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory):  Oh, thank you very much for having me.  FLATOW:  Oh, thank you for staying up late or the next day with us for being there.    Dr. BELL:  That's morning here.  FLATOW:  Yeah. Are you heading out to - from the base station, where are you going?  What are you working on?  Dr. BELL:  We're part of an international (unintelligible) project involving six nations, who are heading to the middle of the East Antarctica ice sheet, just the biggest ice sheet on our planet, trying to understand simply how big it is, explore the hidden mountain range underneath it.  FLATOW:  When I was there at McMurdo 30 years ago, we went out and visited scientists on the western, the smaller ice sheet, because that seemed to be the one that was most endanger of collapsing first if there was a global warming.  Why - now you're trying to learn as much as you can about the Eastern sheet?  Dr. BELL:  The Eastern ice sheet is seems compared to the U. S. , if we drop it on top of the U. S. would cover the entire 48 - lower 48, and be nothing but a couple of peaks, maybe Mt. Rainer sticking out, little else.  It's the birth place of all the ice sheets on the earth and we even, at this point, don't know how much ice is there.  And what we're trying to understand is again births of mountains, which is sort of the birth place of the ice sheet. We can't make good ice sheet models because we don't how much ice is there and what's at the bottom.  It's kind of like we don't know what's greasing the bottom of the ice sheets until we can know what's underneath them.  FLATOW:  Now we've heard - that's interesting that you put it that way, because we've heard research recently from Greenland, which is in the North - the North Pole area.  Their ice sheets are being greased by huge flows of water that seep out from underneath the ice sheets.  Do you know if that is happening in the Antarctica also?  Dr. BELL:  Well, there are two different ways you can get water to the bottom of ice sheets.  One is melt the top and then kind of crack it and deliver the water into the water in to the - water to the bottom that way.  The other way is if you have a bottom of an ice sheet, you actually - it's thick enough that you melt the bottom, and East Antarctica is thick enough that there's melting over much of the bottom of it, and you make big lakes, lakes the size of New Jersey or Lake Ontario.  And it looks like these lakes can make the ice sheet flow faster.  That's one of the questions we're looking at is how water in this lake can make the ice sheet flow faster.  FLATOW:  Do we know what effects that global warming maybe having on that flow?  Dr. BELL:  Global warming probably is playing a big part of the changes we're seeing in Greenland, that process where you melt the top of the ice sheet and deliver that solarly-warmed water down to the bottom.  In the Antarctica, the ice is so thick.  It doesn't even know that the last Ice Age ended, so global warming isn't changing these processes much.  FLATOW:  Dr. Christensen, let's talk about the wetlands in the tundra that you're studying.  How did the wetlands like the tundra contribute to grown - greenhouse gas emissions compare to man-made emissions?  We hear a lot about man-made emissions, but not about the tundra.  Prof. CHRISTENSEN:  Well, I think the - that they have.  They are contributing in the sense that in the margin of the Arctic, there are thermafrost areas that are melting as a consequence of climate change.  And in these areas, we have quite solid documentation now for that the emissions of green house gases, like me saying, are increasing both in salt lakes in Siberia and in areas where the thermafrost is disappearing and leaving behind very wet conditions that are leading to more methane formation in the ground as the accumulated organic material is being decomposed without any oxygen present.  So, we are getting more methane coming out of the Arctic in the margins of the Arctic.  That's not what, I guess, the story that we have now from the high Arctic really is about.  It's more about the redistribution of the emissions from the summer to a very unexpected part of the year.  FLATOW:  Yeah. Are you saying that you're finding emissions happening in the autumn and in the winter time, where you did - do you would think that the cold would not allowed for those emission?  Mr. CHRISTENSE:  Yeah.  That's what the real big surprises for us in our ground-based observations that we reported in nature just yesterday.  That's the emissions that happen right as the whole system is freezing in and we are believing or we have been believing before that this is when the system goes asleep and it stops, so to say, being active in terms of exchanges of greenhouse gases with the atmosphere.  As it turns out as it goes into this, so to say, seemingly sleepy mode, that's where a lot of things happens, and you get this massive emission of a very powerful greenhouse gas.  And this is an observation that to us from the ground-based measurements point of view where extremely surprising.  FLATOW:  Why would we have an increase in the cold time?  I know we could understand maybe in our minds the spring, but why in the cold weather?  Prof. CHRISTENSEN:  Well, in the cold we think that what's happening is that the wind you have in a permafrost environment, you have a kind of very solid bottom on the soil and the processes that are happening in the soil. And as the soil starts freezing from top, you get a pressure that builds up towards this frozen bottom, which is not really to be moved anywhere. And as you, sort of say, push this top freezing layer down towards the frozen bottom, you get - you simply pressurize the area in between and that's where you have a lot of gases as bubbles.  And these are then kind of like pushed out or squeezed out through whatever cracks and whatever (unintelligible) that may still be there in the system that can act as conduits, and can act as kind of chimneys for the squeezing out of the gas.    That's what we believe just now, but we're not sure of the mechanism, and this is where, you know, we hope that a lot, you know, new studies and many other people will start looking into this question because it is a basic research finding that, I think, has huge implications for how we understand the natural impact on the climate and the atmospheric dynamics.    FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number, talking with Torben Christensen and Robin Bell.  Torben, when you say this has a great impact, are you saying that we need to put this into our equation and to the balance of the carbon balance that has been missing before, that there might be more release of these greenhouse gases than we thought?  Prof. CHRISTENSEN:  No.  I mean, the, so to say, the extra emissions that we have measured during this freezing period is well within the uncertainty of the global the estimates for emission from this region, if you like, also that the certain pole north as a whole.  So, it's not like we're adding a major new source, but what we're doing is that we are redistributing it through the year, and as it turns out it does actually help some of the understanding of how the atmospheric dynamics are in terms of how atmospheric methane at high northern latitudes are varying over the year.  FLATOW:  Let me go - let me get back to Robin Bell in McMurdo station in the Antarctica. This week, the European Space Agency, Dr. Bell, reported new rips in the Wilkins Ice Shelf.  Please describe where that is and what that means.  Dr. BELL: Well, the Wilkins Ice Shelf is one of the large ice shelves around the edge of Antarctica.  And what that means is that more of these big pieces of floating ice that rim the continent are beginning to fracture.  And the importance of this isn't that there's more ice going in the ocean because this ice is already in the ocean.  It's floating.  But - and so what it probably reflects is warmer temperatures in the ocean kind of like if you had some ice cubes in your cup and there's warm water in the bottom, they'd start to melt and maybe crack.  What the importance is that we start to lose more and more of these large ice shelves that we made eventually see acceleration of the flow of the inland ice into the global oceans.  And that's what will cause global sea level to rise at a faster rate.  FLATOW:  And how fast is the melting occurring in the Western ice sheets compared to the Eastern, or don't you know yet and that's what you're trying to find out?  Dr. BELL:  Let's see.  The ice sheets that we know are changing quickly are Greenland and West Antarctica.  East Antarctica is still - it's so difficult to study and so remote that we actually don't know what it signal is.  It looks like it might be imbalanced.  There still tremendous disagreement.  So. . .  FLATOW:  And it's so huge.  I mean you said you could drop it on the top of the whole U. S. and cover the whole continental U. S.  It's like saying where would you start in the United States to look?  Dr. BELL:  Right, and that's why it's such a challenge to study it, and why it's taking six nations really just to be able to try and characterize the simple size and the nature of the topography.  It's kind of like we're trying to figure out what the Rocky Mountains are and how the ice started to grow on the Rocky Mountains.  FLATOW:  Mmhmm.  Dr. BELL:  But - so we just at this point don't know how East Antarctica is changing and what the mechanisms are to have changed in the past.  FLATOW:  What kind of effort? What's the size of the team like that's studying this?  Dr. BELL:  So, it's six nations.  There'll be 30 scientists on the ground operating three science aircraft covering the size about the area twice the California.  These mountain ranges are - that were - or after are bigger than the Alps or about the same size of the Alps.  But the logistics to get into this place are tremendous, it's two tractors traversed trains, one from the Chinese and one from the U. S. , with the Australians building a camp and the British providing planes.  So it's a real international pull your effort that wouldn't be possible without the cooperation of all these nations.  FLATOW:  So are you - do you have one central base or you've scattered about the ice sheet there?  Dr. BELL:  We have two bases.  We have one that - it looks like just the weather has broken on the Australian side of the continent and they're about to get it in.  The U. S. has been delivering fuel for us to work with.  And then so another about 400 miles away to the south is the base we'll work out of, sort of run the other side of the peak of the ice sheet, and we have two big bases to work from.  FLATOW:  Talking about the research in the Arctic's, Antarctica and Arctic regions this hour, Talk of the Nation Science Friday from NPR News.  Question for you, Torben from a viewer in Second Life Cannes Luming(ph) says is there evidence of past plant life at the bottom of the sheet?  Prof. CHRISTENSEN:  Wow, that's a question that may really be more put towards the hour of the guest speaker here.  But I do know that there are in areas of northern Greenland, where there's been advances of glaciers, that there are really very important tools for understanding how the freezing conditions were from actually fossil plants that has been so to say covered by the expanding ice sheets.  And from looking at how they grew just before the ice sheet came in and sort to say lay down on top of them that you can actually see how the climate conditions were just before the advance of the ice sheet.  But this is kind of beyond what the study areas that I guess representing here is.  So maybe we should put the question down to the Antarctic.  FLATOW:  Well Dr. Bell, how old is that ice at the bottom of the ice sheet?  Dr. BELL:  Well the ice sheet itself started 35 million years ago.  But one of the other things we're after us to see if we can find the oldest ice on the planet.  Something that's older than a million years so we can get a climate record that goes past the 800,000 record that we have.  Some place we can really get the atmospheric gasses.    FLATOW:  How deeply you have to drill for that?  Dr. BELL:  Close to four kilometers.  FLATOW:  That'll get you that - back about a million years?  Dr. BELL:  Yeah that will get it - and what you have to is a find a place where the conditions are just right to preserve that ice.  FLATOW:  And where would that be?  Dr. BELL:  Well it would be on the flanks of the Gambertus(ph) Mountains is where we're looking.  The Chinese hoped to drill right on top of Belmay which is the absolute highest point in the East Antarctic ice sheet but we're going to be looking to see whether or not that's the best place and whether or not their other sites would all by surround.    FLATOW:  How is deep is the deepest ice there?  Dr. BELL:  It's a little more than two miles depending on what unit you'd like.  And that's where you start to see the large lakes before ice gets very thick.    FLATOW:  Is one of the problems with drilling that deep that the ice is moving, to stop the drill through?  Dr. BELL:  No, the ice in East Antarctica's mostly fairly stagnant.  It's you know - it's frozen to the bed.  It's - and moving relatively slowly until you get to these big rivers of ice where it moves.  It goes from moving one to two meters a year to moving a hundreds of meters a year, half to a kilometer a year.    FLATOW:  So what is it. . .  Dr. BELL:  Not the. . .  FLATOW:  I'm sorry.  I was just trying to figure out what the limitation of how deep you can drill is?  Dr. BELL:  Oh, you can get to the bottom of the ice sheet it just - if you're trying to preserve the core so you can make geochemical measurements on it, it takes a long time to drill, pull off all of those pieces of ice and drill again.  It's just a very slow process.  And in these places where it's so cold, your window of opportunity at work it's really narrow.  You can get into these places when the temperatures get above minus 50 and leaves you sort of at most a couple of months a year to work in.  FLATOW:  Well we wish you and Dr. Christensen a very good luck.  Thank you for taking time to be with us up early and then good luck on your research.  Robin Bell, senior research scientist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia.  And Torben Christensen is a professor at GeoBiosphere Science Centre at Lund University in Sweden.  We're going to take a short break and change gears, and we're going to come back and talk about - what would - what does President-elect Obama need to know about science and physics.  What does the president need to know?  See what you guess on what he needs to know.  So stay with us, we'll be right back after this break.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW:  I'm Ira Flatow.

Black Americans are nearly 40 percent more likely to have asthma than white Americans. But new research throws an interesting curveball to that statistic. A study lead by researchers at Tufts University found that black Americans born in the States are three times more likely to have asthma than their black neighbors who were born abroad. Joining us now to talk about the study is Doug Brugge, associate professor of public health and family medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine. Welcome. Professor DOUG BRUGGE (Public Health and Family Medicine, Tufts University School of Medicine): Good to be here. CHIDEYA: So this study focus on Dorchester, Massachusetts, and asthma, I understand, is very high there. Why was this - why else was this a good community to look at when you were looking at black Americans native-born and born abroad for asthma? Professor BRUGGE: Yes. This actually started from a community-based organization, the Boston Urban Asthma Coalition, that was concerned about exactly what you were saying, the high levels of asthma and the severity of asthma in the community. And they approached me, and working with some of my students, we did a community-based for respiratory research survey in Dorchester in the community. And our original goals were really not to look at native and foreign-born, it was really to provide some data and some statistics that the community organization could use to further their ends. And it was after we had collected the data that, because of work I had been doing in Boston, Chinatown and showing that foreign-born children were much less likely to have asthma that we thought we would analyze this data for that as well, and look particularly at the black respondents to the survey. And that's when this finding came out, and that eventually lead to the publication that we're talking about. CHIDEYA: Well, what does is it really mean to say that African-Americans or black Americans born abroad have such a significantly different rate? I mean, what conclusions, if any, can you draw from there? Professor BRUGGE: Well, you know, this is a very - this is a first step. And we don't know exactly what's causing this. Actually, we don't - we really don't know what's causing this difference at all.  But, we know that there's a difference. We've seen this now in Mexican immigrant children, we see that in Chinese immigrant children, and this study looking at black adults and children seeing that the foreign-born individuals were much less likely to have asthma. So, there's something going on here, and what I think it points to is a need for more research to figure out what that is. I have a preferred hypothesis for what I think is the most likely thing, and that is that the infectious disease that people encounter in other countries that may be endemic there and is not very common in the United States, and this is a little bit counterintuitive, but that those infections, parasites, bacteria, viruses, actually cause people's immune system to develop differently in a way that it somewhat protective against developing asthma or other allergic diseases and maybe that's what's going on. But what we need is research to look - not just to do a community-based survey, but to look at blood markers and much more detail about where people came from or whether they actually had these infections diseases or not. CHIDEYA: So, if I understand you right, being subject to disease could actually help when it comes to preventing asthma. Professor BRUGGE: That's correct. And this is something that is being looked at particularly with allergic diseases, but also with autoimmune diseases where it may be that as human beings our immune systems are, you know, through eons of time are used to having these infectious disease, and in their absence, the immune system develops in a way that it leads to reactions to autoimmunity in terms of in our own bodies or to things like pollen or cockroach or dust mite antigen that normally should not be a concern for the immune system. CHIDEYA: How big of a problem is asthma for black Americans in general? Professor BRUGGE: Yeah. Actually it's - there's a higher prevalence of asthma in the black community. But, more importantly the individuals in the black community who have asthma tend to have more severe asthma, many more emergency room visits, hospitalizations and even death. So this is a significant problem. And what we were looking at was really why people might develop asthma in the first place. That's this issue of how many people have asthma. The other issue is, how severe is people's asthma once they have it. And if I just could - what we know a lot about is people who already have asthma, what triggers their asthma, what causes them to have an asthma attack, end up in the hospital, things like that including, as I mentioned before, many of these allergens. What we know very little about is why people develop asthma in the first place. And that's why, I think, this research we're doing, even though it was a community-based study, it was a participatory study, it was a survey, is providing some information to get us started on thinking about why would one person develop asthma and another person wouldn't. And unless we do that, we have no way of doing anything about people developing asthma in the first place, and that would be some kind of primary prevention program that might mean that less children develop asthma than is currently happening in the United States. CHIDEYA: Well, finally, what advice would you give to parents in particular who have children who either have asthma or they think might be developing asthma? Professor BRUGGE: Well, I think the first thing is if they're not sure whether a child has asthma, then they really should see their physician, their pediatrician and they should have them evaluated. Diagnosing asthma, I'm not a physician, I'm a PhD kind of scientist but diagnosing asthma is something that can't be done with just a simple test. It's really a synthesis of information over a period of time, and I think there are many children who have asthma and are not diagnosed and their physicians and their parents don't realize it. So that's one thing. For children who already have asthma, I think there are two elements that should be considered. One is proper clinical management, which means that their physicians should be prescribing the state-of-the-art medications for controlling their asthma, which would depend on how severe their asthma is. And the other is addressing environmental factors that are likely to trigger or exacerbate their asthma, and if they're allergic to dust mites, then trying to control dust mites exposure. If they're allergic to pollen, as I am, then you can't actually eliminate the pollen in the air, but you can at least be aware of the seasonal patterns and use your meds more thoroughly at a time when the air is laden with pollen. CHIDEYA: Well, great. Doug, thank you. Professor BRUGGE: Thank you. It's a pleasure being on. CHIDEYA: Thanks. That was Doug Brugge, associate professor of public health and family medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine.  FARAI CHIDEYA, host:  I'm Farai Chideya, and this is News and Notes. Black Americans are nearly 40 percent more likely to have asthma than white Americans. But new research throws an interesting curveball to that statistic. A study lead by researchers at Tufts University found that black Americans born in the States are three times more likely to have asthma than their black neighbors who were born abroad. Joining us now to talk about the study is Doug Brugge, associate professor of public health and family medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine. Welcome.  Professor DOUG BRUGGE (Public Health and Family Medicine, Tufts University School of Medicine): Good to be here.  CHIDEYA: So this study focus on Dorchester, Massachusetts, and asthma, I understand, is very high there. Why was this - why else was this a good community to look at when you were looking at black Americans native-born and born abroad for asthma?  Professor BRUGGE: Yes. This actually started from a community-based organization, the Boston Urban Asthma Coalition, that was concerned about exactly what you were saying, the high levels of asthma and the severity of asthma in the community. And they approached me, and working with some of my students, we did a community-based for respiratory research survey in Dorchester in the community. And our original goals were really not to look at native and foreign-born, it was really to provide some data and some statistics that the community organization could use to further their ends. And it was after we had collected the data that, because of work I had been doing in Boston, Chinatown and showing that foreign-born children were much less likely to have asthma that we thought we would analyze this data for that as well, and look particularly at the black respondents to the survey. And that's when this finding came out, and that eventually lead to the publication that we're talking about.  CHIDEYA: Well, what does is it really mean to say that African-Americans or black Americans born abroad have such a significantly different rate? I mean, what conclusions, if any, can you draw from there?  Professor BRUGGE: Well, you know, this is a very - this is a first step. And we don't know exactly what's causing this. Actually, we don't - we really don't know what's causing this difference at all.  But, we know that there's a difference. We've seen this now in Mexican immigrant children, we see that in Chinese immigrant children, and this study looking at black adults and children seeing that the foreign-born individuals were much less likely to have asthma. So, there's something going on here, and what I think it points to is a need for more research to figure out what that is. I have a preferred hypothesis for what I think is the most likely thing, and that is that the infectious disease that people encounter in other countries that may be endemic there and is not very common in the United States, and this is a little bit counterintuitive, but that those infections, parasites, bacteria, viruses, actually cause people's immune system to develop differently in a way that it somewhat protective against developing asthma or other allergic diseases and maybe that's what's going on. But what we need is research to look - not just to do a community-based survey, but to look at blood markers and much more detail about where people came from or whether they actually had these infections diseases or not.  CHIDEYA: So, if I understand you right, being subject to disease could actually help when it comes to preventing asthma.  Professor BRUGGE: That's correct. And this is something that is being looked at particularly with allergic diseases, but also with autoimmune diseases where it may be that as human beings our immune systems are, you know, through eons of time are used to having these infectious disease, and in their absence, the immune system develops in a way that it leads to reactions to autoimmunity in terms of in our own bodies or to things like pollen or cockroach or dust mite antigen that normally should not be a concern for the immune system.  CHIDEYA: How big of a problem is asthma for black Americans in general?  Professor BRUGGE: Yeah. Actually it's - there's a higher prevalence of asthma in the black community. But, more importantly the individuals in the black community who have asthma tend to have more severe asthma, many more emergency room visits, hospitalizations and even death. So this is a significant problem. And what we were looking at was really why people might develop asthma in the first place. That's this issue of how many people have asthma. The other issue is, how severe is people's asthma once they have it. And if I just could - what we know a lot about is people who already have asthma, what triggers their asthma, what causes them to have an asthma attack, end up in the hospital, things like that including, as I mentioned before, many of these allergens.

Henry Gustav Molaison died earlier this month at the age of 82. But the scientific world knew him and, in fact, the world in general knew him only as HM because, when he was a kid, he was hit by a car, and as a result, he suffered from severe seizures, and at the age of 27, he underwent experimental brain surgery to try and control these seizures. Now, the surgery was a success, but it left him with this very unusual problem. He could not form new long-term memories, and he became a research subject. And it's typical in research subjects that you don't identify them by them to protect their identity. So, the world knew him as HM. But it turns out that HM's misfortune was a boon to brain researchers, who spent years studying him. The result was a far better understanding of how our brains makes new memories, and researchers were able to tease out the differences between short-term and long-term memory creation. Now, as I said, HM lost the ability to form new long-term memories, but he could still form short-term memories, very short, though. Here he is being interviewed by neuroscientist Suzanne Corkin. (Soundbite of interview) Dr. SUZANNE CORKIN (Behavioral Neuroscience, Massachusetts Institute of Technology): Do you know what you did yesterday? Mr. HENRY MOLAISON (Famous Memory-Impaired Patient): No, I don't. Dr. CORKIN: How about this morning? Mr. MOLAISON: I don't even remember that. Dr. CORKIN: Could you tell me what you had for lunch today? Mr. MOLAISON: I don't know, to tell you the truth. PALCA: But the thing is that you could get him to say, you know, pick up a coin, put it down and say, what did you just do? And he said, well, I just picked up a coin. But there was a period for about 30 seconds or maybe a little longer that he could retain something in his memory and then it was gone. Amazing. Well, there's another chapter about to start in his life. HM and his guardians agreed - after his life, I should say - HM and his guardians agreed that on his death the brain would - his brain would be donated to scientists for future study. The process of preserving his brain has already begun, and joining me now to talk more about that is my guest, Jacopo Annese. He's the director of the Brain Observatory at the University of California-San Diego. Thank you for being with me today, Dr. Annese. Dr. JACOPO ANNESE (Director, The Brain Observatory, University of California, San Diego): Hello, good afternoon. PALCA: Good afternoon. Now, this is really interesting. You've known that this brain was coming your way for some time now, haven't you? Dr. ANNESE: For quite a few years. Dr. Corkin followed - well, followed my career for a few years, and then followed the progress of my laboratory, especially since I settled at UCSD. PALCA: And where is the brain now? Dr. ANNESE: The brain now is still at Massachusetts General Hospital. It was removed the morning after Mr. Molaison's death. And it's presently being fixed in formalin. It was too delicate to be moved while it was still fresh. PALCA: I see. And what are you going to do with - after it's fixed by the formalin, you'll move it to California. What are you going to do with it there? Dr. ANNESE: So, yes, as you said, you know that we had quite some time to plan. It was quite an exceptional project setup in advance, and to this we need to give credit to Dr. Corkin for thinking pretty much about everything, every possible detail about this project. And things are organized as such that when the brain is ready to be move here, the first step is a second round of MRI scans. The great thing about MRI is that it gives you an image of the brain - of the whole brain before it is, quote, \"destroyed,\" by the histological techniques. So, we. . . PALCA: And histological - I'm just going to interrupt. So, histological techniques are this business of making slices of the brain so you can actually study the tissue. Dr. ANNESE: Exactly. So, MRI has this wonderful feature of being able to give you a volume representing an entire brain. The problem with MRI is resolution. So, still, the only way to be able to image structures or processes that are at the cellular level in a brain, we need to cut it into slices that are thin enough to be looked at under a microscope, pretty much. So, actually when I was flying to MGH the night that HM died, to be there for the autopsy, my colleagues were already running a scan of HM as if he were alive, get a final picture of the brain. PALCA: MGH, we don't have to keep anonymous. We can tell people that stand. . . Dr. ANNESE: Yes, it's the acronym for the General. PALCA: Exactly. So, why is it important to get this kind of precise - are you trying - I mean, obviously people have been able to study Mr. Molaison and his behavioral deficit and his learning deficit, his memory deficit. But what could you learn from seeing the fine sections of his brain? Dr. ANNESE: We - exactly because he was studied so extensively. So, we wanted to make sure that we understand what structures were removed, and by that infer what structures are important for the different aspects of memory, that the study of HM help to tease out. And this, of course, you know, if done at microscopic resolution, would give the information that we need to know exactly which - as these cognitive abilities have been teased out to see if there is a neural substrate for each of these different capabilities. PALCA: So, in other words, you may be able to identify particular - I mean, we know that there was some damage during this surgical procedure that Mr. Molaison had, but - and we know in sort of a gross sense of where in the brain it is. But this is going to get you down to the level of almost - well, not exactly individual connections, but certainly very small sections of the brain. Dr. ANNESE: Well, certainly individuals cells so. . . PALCA: Really? Dr. ANNESE: We'll be able to count the number of cells in the area that is around the lesion. But you know, when you take a - when you take out a piece, a structure, out of a brain, not only you create a deficit in a particular area, but you also affect the circuits that include that area. So, that's why we also wanted to have different approach. We wanted to slice the entire brain into giant histological sections so that we can navigate the brain in different areas and see what happened also to structures that we know are normally functionally connected to the medial temporal lobe, which is the area that suffered the lesion during the surgery. PALCA: How big are these slices that you're making? Dr. ANNESE: The slices will be five-by-seven inches. It's a size of the - one of the picture frame, which is enough to accommodate the entire slice. PALCA: We're talking with - I'm sorry, we're talking with Dr. Jacopo Annese about the work that's going to be done on the brain of HM, a famous amnesiac patient who died last week, and his brain is going to be, well, not dissected but inspected, we'll say. . . Dr. ANNESE: Inspected. PALCA: Inspected to be - to see exactly what the nature of his deficit was and hope to understand how that affected his memory. I'm Joe Palca, and this is Talk of the Nation from NPR News. One of the things about this project that I think is so fascinating is you're planning to do this, you know, almost under the public eye. Anybody who wants to see this process can go to your Web site and watch it unfold. Dr. ANNESE: Yes. We actually create also a dedicated Web site for HM. I wanted to make sure that initially as we set protocol up to start the work, we will give the opportunity to experts and other investigators to make suggestions and to eventually also add to the protocol. And also, people that have in-person studied HM have very important suggestions on which way to go. Because, you know, unfortunately, one cannot do everything on one particular specimen. There are compromises that need to be made, priorities that need to be set, which, you know, determine which kind of stains one uses, depending on what we want see in that brain. So, I thought that producing the first step, a blog or a forum of experts to discuss the coming project, and then also, as you mentioned, have actually a completely open environment to the public so that every procedure that we are beginning and, you know, we are running can actually be looked at. I think it would be a good occasion for the public, given that there is this enormous interest in this case generally, really an interest in the brain in generally, I think it will be a very close, hands-on, you know - how do you say it? - approach to the study. It won't be done in closed doors and then the results will come out. So, literally we plan to have webcasts of every procedure. PALCA: It'll be very interesting, and I hope what we can do is have you back when some of the results begin to come out of this study. But I'm afraid we're out of time, so we'll do that the next time. Thanks so much for joining us. Dr. ANNESE: Thank you very much.

I'm Melissa Block. MICHELE NORRIS, host: And I'm Michele Norris. Today surgeons at the Cleveland Clinic described the country's first face transplant. It was performed about two weeks ago on a woman who was severely disfigured in an accident. NPR's Patti Neighmond reports. PATTI NEIGHMOND: The patient suffered severe trauma and had extensive reconstructive surgery over a number of years, but most of that was unsuccessful. The patient was missing her right eye, her nose, and upper jaw. She couldn't smell or taste, had trouble speaking, and according to doctors, children would shriek and run away from her when they saw her in public. Plastic surgeon Frank Papay was part of the 12-member surgery team and describes how the transplant proceeded. Dr. FRANK PAPAY (Chief of Dermatology and Plastic Surgery, Cleveland Clinic): We transferred not only the skin, we transferred the skin, all the facial muscles in the upper face, in mid-face, the upper lip, all of the nose, most of the sinuses around the nose, the upper jaw, including some teeth, the facial nerve. And the facial nerve is important in the sense that that's what gives us - once it's connected - the ability to smile and to blink our eyes. So our hopes are that once it is connected and the new facial nerve grows through that she will be able to smile again. NEIGHMOND: The new face will not look just like the dead donor's face, say doctors. It will be sort of a third face, a combination of the patient's own muscle and bone structure along with the overlay of the donor face. The transplant was performed about two weeks ago at the Cleveland Clinic. Microsurgeon Dr. Maria Siemionow headed the surgery team. Dr. MARIA SIEMIONOW (Director of Plastic Surgery Research and Head of Microsurgery Training, Cleveland Clinic): The surgery took 22 hours. The preparation to the surgery took over 20 years of work in the field of composite tissue transplantation. NEIGHMOND: This is not the first face transplant. Three years ago, a transplant was performed on a French woman who had been mauled by her dog. Similar transplants were done in China on a farmer who had been attacked by a bear and elsewhere in Europe on a man who was disfigured by a genetic condition. At the request of the patient's family, officials are not releasing any details on her identity or how she was injured, but doctors say the Cleveland Clinic transplant is the most complete, a \"near total\" face transplant, they say. The hospital's ethics committee approved facial transplantation three years ago, and since then Siemionow and her team have searched for an appropriate candidate. Dr. SIEMIONOW: Only patients who are the most disfigured and exhausted already all existing procedures, which are conventional procedures, will be the potential candidates. NEIGHMOND: Siemionow says the patient's quality of life was indeed grim enough to warrant the risky transplant along with the also risky anti-rejection drugs that must be taken for the rest of the patient's life. And while these procedures can be incredibly life-enhancing, medical ethicists worry patients must completely understand they are putting themselves at great risk for surgery that is not life saving. Ethicist Karen Maschke with the Hastings Center. Dr. KAREN MASCHKE (Ethicist, Hastings Center): In a context where a transplant does not involve a bargain to stay alive, but is to improve the quality of life that I would have without the transplant, then the risks of the surgery and the risks of the lifetime drugs become more magnified. And that's where we start to look at more carefully, are those risks justifiable in a context that's not life-threatening?  NEIGHMOND: According to doctors at the Cleveland Clinic, this patient and her family were absolutely certain they wanted to take those risks. Doctors say it will be at least six months before the patient gains back a sense of smell and taste and normalcy. For now, they say, she is extremely happy just to be able to take her hands and feel her nose and the sides of her face. Patti Neighmond, NPR News.  MELISSA BLOCK, host:  From NPR News, this is All Things Considered. I'm Melissa Block.  MICHELE NORRIS, host:  And I'm Michele Norris. Today surgeons at the Cleveland Clinic described the country's first face transplant. It was performed about two weeks ago on a woman who was severely disfigured in an accident. NPR's Patti Neighmond reports.  PATTI NEIGHMOND: The patient suffered severe trauma and had extensive reconstructive surgery over a number of years, but most of that was unsuccessful. The patient was missing her right eye, her nose, and upper jaw. She couldn't smell or taste, had trouble speaking, and according to doctors, children would shriek and run away from her when they saw her in public. Plastic surgeon Frank Papay was part of the 12-member surgery team and describes how the transplant proceeded.  Dr. FRANK PAPAY (Chief of Dermatology and Plastic Surgery, Cleveland Clinic): We transferred not only the skin, we transferred the skin, all the facial muscles in the upper face, in mid-face, the upper lip, all of the nose, most of the sinuses around the nose, the upper jaw, including some teeth, the facial nerve. And the facial nerve is important in the sense that that's what gives us - once it's connected - the ability to smile and to blink our eyes. So our hopes are that once it is connected and the new facial nerve grows through that she will be able to smile again.  NEIGHMOND: The new face will not look just like the dead donor's face, say doctors. It will be sort of a third face, a combination of the patient's own muscle and bone structure along with the overlay of the donor face. The transplant was performed about two weeks ago at the Cleveland Clinic. Microsurgeon Dr. Maria Siemionow headed the surgery team.  Dr. MARIA SIEMIONOW (Director of Plastic Surgery Research and Head of Microsurgery Training, Cleveland Clinic): The surgery took 22 hours. The preparation to the surgery took over 20 years of work in the field of composite tissue transplantation.  NEIGHMOND: This is not the first face transplant. Three years ago, a transplant was performed on a French woman who had been mauled by her dog. Similar transplants were done in China on a farmer who had been attacked by a bear and elsewhere in Europe on a man who was disfigured by a genetic condition. At the request of the patient's family, officials are not releasing any details on her identity or how she was injured, but doctors say the Cleveland Clinic transplant is the most complete, a \"near total\" face transplant, they say. The hospital's ethics committee approved facial transplantation three years ago, and since then Siemionow and her team have searched for an appropriate candidate.  Dr. SIEMIONOW: Only patients who are the most disfigured and exhausted already all existing procedures, which are conventional procedures, will be the potential candidates.  NEIGHMOND: Siemionow says the patient's quality of life was indeed grim enough to warrant the risky transplant along with the also risky anti-rejection drugs that must be taken for the rest of the patient's life. And while these procedures can be incredibly life-enhancing, medical ethicists worry patients must completely understand they are putting themselves at great risk for surgery that is not life saving. Ethicist Karen Maschke with the Hastings Center.  Dr. KAREN MASCHKE (Ethicist, Hastings Center): In a context where a transplant does not involve a bargain to stay alive, but is to improve the quality of life that I would have without the transplant, then the risks of the surgery and the risks of the lifetime drugs become more magnified. And that's where we start to look at more carefully, are those risks justifiable in a context that's not life-threatening?   NEIGHMOND: According to doctors at the Cleveland Clinic, this patient and her family were absolutely certain they wanted to take those risks. Doctors say it will be at least six months before the patient gains back a sense of smell and taste and normalcy. For now, they say, she is extremely happy just to be able to take her hands and feel her nose and the sides of her face. Patti Neighmond, NPR News.

Scientists say that they have evidence that among some dinosaurs, the stay-at-home parent was the father. You might wonder how anybody figured that out from a bunch of fossils dating back tens of millions of years, and so did NPR's Christopher Joyce. Here's what he found out. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: This parenting puzzle started with the discovery, about 140 years ago, of fossilized dinosaur eggs. Since then, dino eggs have turned up around the world, often in groups or clutches. Among the scientists fascinated with these eggs is David Varricchio from Montana State University. Dr. DAVID J. VARRICCHIO (Paleontology, Montana State University): We kind of have been puzzling over the size of these clutches for some time. JOYCE: The eggs are big, picture melons, but also they're often are lots of them in a single clutch. And sometimes next to these egg clutches, scientists have found the skeletons of adult dinosaurs. Occasionally, the skeleton has been on top of the eggs. Scientists studied everything they could about the eggs and the adult skeletons, such as, how much egg material was there compared to the size of the adult? And they noticed something unusual. Dr. VARRICCHIO: When you compare the clutch size to the adult size, the clutches is rather large relative to the body size. JOYCE: In other words, a lot of egg for one female to produce. So, Varricchio and a team of experts decided to see if they were modern animals that had especially big egg clutches, compared to the adults' body size. There were: birds, but only certain kinds of birds. Dr. VARRICCHIO: The group that stands out are those birds with male-only care, and our dinosaurs basically align with that group. JOYCE: That group includes ostriches, emus and kiwi birds, where the female lays the eggs, but then the male takes over. Sure enough, the dinosaur-egg-clutch-to-adult-size ratio was very close to that in ostriches, emus and kiwis. Now, that's not direct evidence of dinosaur Mr. Moms, but there was another clue: Inside the bones of the nesting dinosaurs, there was no medullary bone; that's a kind of bone that female egg-laying animals create for making eggshells. No medullary bone suggests that these nesting adults were males. Writing in this week's issue of the journal Science, Varricchio speculates that among these kinds of dinosaurs - Oviraptor, Troodons and Citipati - laying all these eggs took a lot of time and energy. So, the male had to take over while the female went off to feed. Well, however it evolved, this male caretaking links the behavior of some modern birds to gigantic animals that once ruled the planet. That's what intrigues Richard Prum, an ornithologist at Yale University. Dr. RICHARD O. PRUM (Ornithology, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Yale University): Well, you know, what I really love about it is the fact that, that these are representatives of the most ferocious and terrifying lineage of animals that ever was. And so, it's really ironic to me, to think that these macho, bipedal meat eaters were good dads. JOYCE: In fact, the very name Oviraptor might need changing now. Prum points out that Oviraptor means egg-seizer, a name chosen by the man who discovered the first Oviraptor in 1924. It was found on top of an egg clutch. That, scientists said the dinosaur was, quote, \"in the very act of robbing a dinosaur egg nest. \" But now, well, maybe it was just doting dad keeping the chicks warm. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

One of the way scientists measure success, as you know, is publications. Publish or perish; you've heard of that. But it's not just how many publications you churn out and in what journals. The actual measure of success of a paper is if other scientists find it interesting and useful and they search for and find it and use it - useful enough to base further work upon it. So, every paper cites work that it's based on or expanded on or it needs. And joining me now is David Pendlebury. He is a citation analyst with the scientific business of Thomson-Reuters. The company keeps track of who's signing whom and how often. Welcome to the program. Mr. DAVID PENDLEBURY (Citation Analyst, Thomson-Reuters): Thank you very much, Ira. FLATOW: Let's start about explaining what a citation is. Mr. PENDLEBURY: Well, that can be confusing. Some people refer to it as an entry on their curriculum vitae, but we use it to mean one of those footnotes or references that appears at the bottom of their research papers. And as you just mentioned, that is acknowledgment of an intellectual debt to someone else, sometimes to themselves of the previous paper. FLATOW: And what - if we look at citations now at the end of this year and we look back and see which papers and subjects were cited the most, let's talk about what you have found. Mr. PENDLEBURY: Well, I did look at papers published in 2008 and which ones were most cited. I went field by field, because different fields have different average rates of citation. Neurosciences, molecular biology and genetics have very high average rates of citations, but mathematics and pharmacology have lower rates of citations. So, you have to do it on a field-by-field basis. Then you also have to consider that papers that were published earlier in the year have had more time to be cited than those published later in the year. FLATOW: Right. Mr. PENDLEBURY: So, adjusting to certain things, I did look through some main fields - biology, medicine, physics and chemistry - and I tried to pick up on highly cited papers published in 2008. Now, the main or key discoveries may not have been made in 2008; they may have been made in the previous few years, but the indication of the high citations is a signal. FLATOW: And what did you find? Biology, for example. Mr. PENDLEBURY: Well, this field called cellular autophagy - for those of us who forgot our Greek or Latin, it means self-digestion; it's also-called autophagic cytosis - and this is a reaction at the cellular level that actually takes the trash out when things degrade. It was formally thought that this especially happens when organisms are in to great stress and there is decay. But in 2006, some Japanese researchers found that this is a normal process that is actually essential to development and homeostasis or general health. So, this has really ignited great interest in this field. There was some recent work in yeast, but it has moved in to eukaryotic cells, and now, there's even a journal, a journal called Autophagy, that is in its fourth volume. So, that's another marker of a field that is expanding and is important as a specialty when a journal is founded on that field. But I looked at the field in general back a few years;, there were about 200 papers published in this field in 2004, 300 in 2005, 500 in 2006, 700 in 2007 and almost 1,000 in 2008. So, it's an exponential growth. FLATOW: What about medicine? What did you find there? Mr. PENDLEBURY: In medicine, I chose induced pluripotent stem cells as the highest cited field, and there were certainly a number of papers that were from late 2007 and early 2008. After I sent you my list by email yesterday, I noticed that Science Magazine named this area the breakthrough area of 2008, and I thought that that was quite interesting that we both came to the same conclusion but by different methods. They surveyed their journalists who cover science day in and day out; they talked to their editorial boards and other people. So, that was a form of a peer review where the experts are giving their judgments. FLATOW: And just to clarify, this is a field that shows ways to generate stem cells with the characteristics similar to embryonic stem cells but without the ethical issues. Mr. PENDLEBURY: That's correct. They're generally matter from what's known as somatic or adult cells. FLATOW: Let's move on to physics. What have you got in physics. Mr. PENDLEBURY: Well, you could call this physics, or you could call it chemistry, but it's Graphine. Graphine is carbon molecules and a sort of honeycomb pattern that is one atom thick. It's the thinnest material known. The key papers were from a group at the University of Manchester in 2004 and 2005. But this field has really, again, exploded in terms of the number of papers published and the numbers of citations to those papers. FLATOW: This is Talk of the Nation: Science Friday from NPR News. Talking about citations with David Pendlebury. So, that would indicate this is the hot field of research. Mr. PENDLEBURY: Very hot. FLATOW: One molecular layer of thick sheets of graphite. Mr. PENDLEBURY: Correct. FLATOW: Would that be nanoparticles, things like that? Mr. PENDLEBURY: Yeah, certainly. I mean, if you imagine a sheet of graphine rolled into a tube, that's a nanotube. FLATOW: So, it's like chicken wire rolled up. Mr. PENDLEBURY: That's correct. And just yesterday, IBM announced the fastest super transistor yet made out of graphine materials. FLATOW: Wow. So, we'll even see more citations. Mr. PENDLEBURY: Absolutely. FLATOW: Next year. Let's move on to chemistry. Mr. PENDLEBURY: Well, again you might call this chemistry and then you might call it physics. But there were papers published in 2008. This is a true 2008 discovery; there are iron-based super conductors and this is very unusual (unintelligible) with us for the last 20 years or so. People have been exploring super conductors with copper materials, copper super conductors. So, this gives researchers an entirely new family of super conducting compounds, and there's just a great interest in the different properties of these particular new super conductors. FLATOW: Any way to predict what's going to paper of next year? Mr. PENDLEBURY: Well, that's hard. We do some prediction in terms of who might win the Nobel Prize in the following years, but that's based on our view of what has been done in research and what has been cited. FLATOW: How accurate have you been on then? Mr. PENDLEBURY: Been fairly accurate recently. Fortunately of the four prizes that we surveyed in the science field, we don't do literature and we don't do peace. We got at least one person in three of the four prizes last year. FLATOW: Wow. So, can you tell us what would be hot next year or you think it's going to be hot next? Mr. PENDLEBURY: I wish I could. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. PENDLEBURY: I wish I could. FLATOW: Is there a modern classic of what, if you looked back 10 years, you'd find the most citations? Mr. PENDLEBURY: Yeah. It's interesting to note that most papers are cited moderately or very little. This is the 80/20 rule where in the population; 20 percent of the population gets 80 percent of the citations. So, papers that are cited 500, 1,000, 3,000 times are extremely rare exotic papers. One that really stands out is the work on R&A interference by Mellow and Fire, and they in fact, received the Nobel Prize in 2006 for their work. So, there's a strong correlation between citations in the literature and the authors of those papers, the highly cited papers and who may win a Nobel Prize. FLATOW: So, you can do your own little office pool. Mr. PENDLEBURY: We can. I haven't started one yet. Maybe I should. (Soundbite of laugher) FLATOW: You get all those 10-year peep papers together and you know, and make the grid. Mr. PENDLEBURY: Yeah. FLATOW: And figure out who's going to get next year's Nobel Prizes about this time. Mr. PENDLEBURY: Writing on CAA, right. FLATOW: Exactly. And you get to choose that little box. Mr. PENDLEBURY: Yup. FLATOW: And I - why leave it to sports? Why not have fun with science, too? Mr. PENDLEBURY: Well, in fact, the bookies lab brokes(ph) in England takes bets on the Nobel Prize, but only in literature and piece so far. They haven't moved into science yet. FLATOW: Uh huh. We have to get into that popular Kelsters. . . Mr. PENDLEBURY: If they do, I'll be there. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: But people take this very seriously though, too, don't they? The citations? Mr. PENDLEBURY: Yes. Absolutely because citing in the sociology of science is really a very serious practice. It is actually malpractice if you do not cite relevant work regarding the paper that you're publishing and it's the job of reviewers of scientific papers and editors to make sure that you have indeed cited the relevant literature before it is - science moves like law moves based on president and it's very important to acknowledge that president and to pay your intellectual depths. FLATOW: There you have it. It could not have summed it up any better, David. Thank you very much for taking time to be with us today. Mr. PENDLEBURY: Thank you so much. FLATOW: Happy Holiday to you. Mr. PENDLEBURY: You, too. FLATOW: David Pendlebury is a citation analyst with the scientific business of Thompson-Reuters, a very big publishing company. That's about all the time we have for today.

I'm Ira Flatow. In just a few weeks, President-elect Barack Obama will take the keys to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and he'll be accompanied by some world-class scientists. He's already appointed Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu as Energy secretary. Physicist John Holdren, an energy and climate-change expert who favors cutting greenhouse-gas emissions, is expected to join Obama as science advisor. Jane Lubchenco, one of the nation's top marine biologists, is expected to head the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. So, it's a heady time for science in Washington, D. C. And this hour, we'll be talking about these choices with an AU-gust - au-GUST? - au-GUST panel of distinguished science journalists who will, I hope, also weigh in with their opinions about the top stories of 2008, or I might not be able to stop them from weighing in with their opinions about this if I'd like to. There were some great discoveries. Let's talk about a few of them. And there were experiments that fizzled out. There was the wooly-mammoth genome, the cancer genome, the synthetic genome. There was a drug that seemed to mimic the effects of exercise, for mice, at least, and a controversial study about cholesterol drugs. It was the first exoplanet spied in a snapshot and the Phoenix lander stuffing soil into its ovens on the northern plains of Mars. In 2008, cheap genetic tests hit the market, and Washington enacted the Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act. Polar bears were finally listed as threatened, and a chemical in plastic frightened water-bottle owners everywhere. And on the unlucky side of science this year, part of the Hubble telescope's 20-year-old computer crashed and the Large Hadron Collider had a - how shall we call it? - a premature hiccup? - and stopped working just a few weeks after firing up. There's also science in the arts world - a lot of science in the arts things that were going on this year. We had plays about Philo Farnsworth. There was a play and a movie in production about Hedy Lamarr. \"Doctor Atomic\" opened at the MET, a play about the atom bomb. So, there's a lot to talk about this hour about what was going on in science this year. Our number, 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK, if you'd like to join us. And if you want more information about our topic, you can surf over to our Web site at sciencefriday. com. And if you're on Twitter, you can follow us @scifri. That's - write to us with the @ sign followed by scifri. And we'll see if we can get a question in there, too, from you on Twitter. And in Second Life there's a gang of folks that are listening to us. You're welcome to ask questions that way, too. Let me introduce my guests. Sharon Begley is a science columnist from Newsweek. She joins us here in our studios in New York. Welcome back, Sharon. Ms. SHARON BEGLEY (Senior Editor, Newsweek): Thank you, Ira. FLATOW: You're welcome. Steve Mirsky is a staff editor and writer for Scientific American magazine and host of \"Science Talk\" podcast. He's also with us here. Good to see you again, Steve. Mr. STEVE MIRSKY (Editor and Columnist, Scientific American): Thanks. That's Hedley Lamar. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Hedley to you. Paul Raeburn is a journalist and author of \"Acquainted with the Night: A Parent's Quest to Understand Depression and Bipolar Disorder in His Children. \" He also writes the About Fathers blog for Psychology Today. And he joins us here in New York. Good to see you again. Mr. PAUL RAEBURN (Science Journalist and Author, \"Acquainted with the Night: A Parent's Quest to Understand Depression and Bipolar Disorder in His Children\"): Nice to be here, Ira. FLATOW: K. C. Cole is the only one in the outer hinlands(ph) out there and she's the author of \"The Universe and the Teacup: The Mathematics of Truth and Beauty\" and she's also a professor in the Annenberg School of Journalism at UCLA - USC -Professor K. C. COLE (Author, \"The Universe and the Teacup: The Mathematics of Truth and Beauty\", Professor, Annenberg School of Journalism, USC): No, no, no. FLATOW: No, no. University of Southern California, Los Angeles. I wanted to see if you're listening, K. C. University of Southern California in Los Angeles. She joins us from the studios of Marketplace Productions in L. A. Nice to have you back on Science Friday, K. C. Prof. COLE: Nice to be here. FLATOW: Let's get in to the Washington politics that's going on here. Let me go around the table and out to K. C. What do we think about, Steve, about all these appointments? Science is taking center stage again. Mr. MIRSKY: Well, let's contrast with the campaign what's going on now. In the campaign, John McCain said that Sarah Palin knew more about energy than pretty much anybody else in the country. And here we have now the energy secretary's going to be an actual Nobel Laureate in physics and I'm pretty sure he knows that a joule is not a diamond, an erg is not, a real hankering to do something and a BTU is not a sandwich you get at a diner. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. MIRSKY: You know, so, I'm pretty optimistic. I mean, look, just because he's a Nobel Laureate, doesn't mean he's going to be terrific in this political setting. He does have big administrative experience running the national laboratory out there. But you just have to be optimistic at this point about what these appointments mean. FLATOW: Let's go out there. K. C. , what's the reaction out in California? Prof. COLE: Well, you know, I think everybody is very excited when you contrast this to what was happening beforehand, where you had tens of thousands of scientists protesting that science is being distorted. It continues for political reasons and decisions are being made not on the scientific basis but again, you know, for political reasons. We now have a President-elect who actually respects and believes in science and every single appointment he's made has been right on. So, I think it's really good news for everybody, including the space community - just everybody. FLATOW: Mm hmm. Also mentioned is the fact that Lisa P. Jackson in going to be the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency - the second administrator from New Jersey, Sharon. Ms. BEGLEY: Which gives her an excellent pedigree, since New Jersey is no stranger to pollution problems. (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. BEGLEY: But Jackson. . . Mr. MIRSKY: There go about 2,000 listeners. Ms. BEGLEY: Hey, I'm a New Jersey girl, born and bred. But Jackson has not only her administrative experience with Governor John Corzine, but she was also in EPA as a regional administrator for a number of years. So, she knows the agency, she knows its issues, and it looks like she's going to have the ear of the incoming president. Mr. MIRSKY: When you contrast this, again, with the last EPA administrator from New Jersey, Governor Whitman, who left the office because she really felt like she couldn't get anything accomplished. FLATOW: Yeah. She left fairly early on, didn't she? She could see that handwriting on the wall or the memos being changed, actually. Mr. MIRSKY: Right. FLATOW: And we also have - Carol Browner is back as - in the form of a - well, she's been calling - being called the \"Climate Czarina. \" Ms. BEGLEY: Which is going to be interesting, because she's going to - she's tasked, as we now say, with coordinating all of the other voices who have something to say about climate policy. And that's going to include DOE Secretary Chu, it's going to include the EPA administrator. And she's sort of the environment or the climate equivalent of the, you know, national security advisor. She's going to have to butt heads together. She's going to have to make some sense out of the cacophony of advice that's rising up through the ranks. FLATOW: It does look like all the appointees sort of have a climate bend to them, don't they? Mr. RAEBURN: Yeah, I looked at John Holdren, who will be science advisor, responsible for all kinds of things. He published a paper in Science this year, \"Science and Technology for Sustainable Wellbeing. \" You know, there's an environmentalist buzzword if there ever was one. Another one was called \"Climate Change: The Sky is Falling. \" And I think it's important to emphasize here that this isn't a change of politics. We're not going from sort of corporate people to environmental people. We're going from ideologically-based decisions to factually-based decisions. I don't have any problem myself with somebody saying, you know, I represent the coal industry and I don't think we should worry about carbon. We want to burn coal. I think that's a perfectly reasonable point of view, we can debate that. But when somebody has that kind of position and tries to couch it in environmental terms, you know, clean coal, it's the hypocrisy that gets my reporter's instincts up, I have to say. FLATOW: I've seen that commercial. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. MIRSKY: No, really. Don't hand me a bowl of some brown substance and tell me, not only that it's ice cream, but that it's vanilla ice cream FLATOR: Yeah. Of course, this one has not been confirmed yet, this is a proposed\u2026 Ms. BEGLEY: Supposedly coming tomorrow in Obama's radio address. But Holdren is an interesting character because although, as Paul says, he's been, you know, quite visible on the climate issue, he's not a bomb thrower. You know, as a reporter, if you need the incendiary quote about how the world, you know, is going to heck in a handbasket due to climate change, Holdren is not the first one you call. He's very empirically-based. He's very - sort of a quiet, behind-the-scenes kind of operator. And one story I love about him, he - when he was younger - wrote a lot of papers with Paul Ehrlich, the eminent Stanford biologist, who is a bomb thrower, best known for \"The Population Bomb. \" So, a friend ran into Holdren one day and asked him, you know, you and Ehrlich are getting all these criticisms from business, from the Republican right, whatever, saying that you're crazy, you're out to undermine capitalism, you know. Does that bother you? And Holdren said, you know what? They're attacking Ehrlich and \"that other guy,\" so as long as I'm just \"that other guy,\" it's OK. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. MIRSKY: I was at a session that Holdren spoke at, at the American Association for the Advancement of Science conference in February, and he did have caustic remarks for Michael Crichton, who at the time was still alive. I believe he used the phrase \"colossal arrogance\" for Crichton to take upon himself the role of advising the president and members of Congress on global warming. FLATOW: It'll be\u2026 Prof. COLE: I think\u2026 FLATOW: Go ahead, K. C. Prof. COLE: No, I was just going to say, I think, in terms of NASA policy in space, too, it's going to be interesting because a lot of the Earth-observing satellites that are at the end of their lives are not being replaced. And I think that's really going to change now, that we're going to have more of an emphasis - you may remember that, actually, Earth observing was taken out - I believe it was this year - of the NASA mission statement, so I think that's very optimistic in terms of climate, that we'll actually be able to look at ourselves again. FLATOW: Are we going to have any money left to do any of these things is the question, especially, you know, in space. Mr. MIRSKY: It's an investment. It's not overhead, it's an investment. Mr. RAEBURN: Yeah, I mean, there are different things and space maybe a tougher sell than climate and energy, which is wrapped up with the economy, as are a lot of health issues, which could save us money, could cost us money. But some of the basic sciences may be in more trouble - cosmology and space science and so forth - we'll just have to see how it goes. Prof. COLE: Yeah, they certainly have been. FLATOW: Go ahead, K. C. Prof. COLE: No, I was going to say, they certainly have been with the moon to Mars program, which was not something that the vast majority of astronomers and physicists were behind. In fact, it led to the pushing back of several really important missions like the - LISA, the Laser - how do you say it - laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory, which, you know, was going to allow us to - I mean, it will - to see actually back to the big bang itself perhaps - the gravitational waves from that. And a lot of that stuff got just pushed off and postponed. I would say, money wasted. So, it's possible now that we can go back to doing more real science in space. Mr. RAEBURN: The comforting thing, of course, is that the space station is still up there, still going strong, still costing us billions of dollars while we can't do all these other interesting things. We've got to borrow a car to get there. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Details, details, details. Prof. COLE: But we're not speaking with the people who have the car, so we can't use the right kind of car. Mr. RAEBURN: K. C. , you have such a pessimistic look at it. FLATOW: We'll get a zip car. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: All right, we have to take a break. We'll come back and talk lots more about the year in science with Sharon Begley, K. C. Cole, Paul Raeburn and Steve Mirsky and your calls. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Also in Second Life and you can twitter us @scifri, that's @ s-c-i-f-r-i. Don't go away, we'll be right back. (Soundbite of Talk of the Nation theme) (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to Talk of the Nation: Science Friday. I'm Ira Flatow. We're looking back on the year 2008, talking about stuff that has been, might have been or shouldn't have been - we could throw that in - which should not have been with my guests, Sharon Begley, science columnist for Newsweek; Steve Mirsky is editor and writer for Scientific American magazine and host of Scientific American's \"Science Talk\" podcast; Paul Raeburn is a journalist and author of \"Acquainted with the Night: A Parent's Quest to Understand Depression and Bipolar Disorder in His Children,\" he also writes the About Fathers blog for Psychology Today; K. C. Cole, author of \"The Universe and the Teacup: The Mathematics of Truth and Beauty,\" and she's also a professor in the Annenberg School of Journalism at USC in Los Angeles. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Let's talk about where I left off in the introduction about science and culture. There were lot of science and cultural events and I think one of those things that we talk about as a part of being science and culture - we like to throw that in - is science fiction in culture. And Steve Mirsky, you were saying you saw a remake of a classic movie. Mr. MIRSKY: We'll call it a re-imagining of \"The Day the Earth Stood Still. \" I went to a screening in preparation for interviewing the director, and it's not a good movie. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: No details necessary. Mr. MIRSKY: But when it comes around to cable or NetFlix, you know, I think it's kind of worth watching as a reflection of what we now take for granted, culturally, about science. For example, what I found really interesting was, in this version - you know, Keanu Reeves is Klaatu. And in this version, when you first see Reeves, he's an Earth person, a regular old human, back in the 1920s and he's clearly - a sample of his skin is clearly taken by the aliens somehow and the Klaatu that we see later is a clone of him. And that's not explained because you don't need to explain that to a mass audience anymore. They see a scar on the back of your hand and then a reproduction of this individual and they understand it's a clone. FLATOW: Interesting, interesting. But the first - the original - the trailers I have seen are so violent, you know. The original movie was so understated and now I see - this is what you must be implying - that they just hammed it up. Go ahead, K. C. , have you seen it? Prof. COLE: No, but something really exciting has happened and I can't remember the name of it now, but the National Academy of Sciences has just started a collaboration with Hollywood, headed by Jennifer Ouellette, who writes Twisted Physics blog and Cocktail Party Physics. And - but this is partly modeled on a successful program at the Annenberg School, actually, where the Lear Center started to give good medical information to shows like \"E. R. \" and they found that it actually had an effect on people, so that what they're trying to do now is say, OK, we're going to have all these shows - \"The Big Bang Theory\" and these movies - why not make the science accurate? It will be better because science is always stranger than fiction anyway. So, I think that's really exciting. FLATOW: It's only taken 30 years to do this. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. MIRSKY: Right. FLATOW: You know, Leon Lederman has been going out to see Norman Lear himself ever since it was, you know, \"All in the Family\" days\u2026 Mr. MIRSKY: \"Maude\" was on. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Exactly - trying to talk them into - and actually to create - if you can do a show about a newsroom, like \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show,\" why can't you do one about a laboratory, you know, and have wacky things go on there? But it's at least in the laboratory. Maybe now, the National Academy's had more success with this, but\u2026 Prof. COLE: Well, I think so. I mean, you know, in trying to catch up on the year in science, the things that I came across were just so bizarre. FLATOW: Let's get into them. Go ahead. Start out with your most bizarre - top of the list. Prof. COLE: OK. Here is the one I love, just because of the way it was phrased, in terms of seeing the most distant water - 11 billion light years away or ago, either way you want to put it - but this water is in the form of giant water masers. In other words, the water molecules are behaving like lasers and these things are huge and they're saying now they're even more common than they were before. And I'm thinking, yeah, giant water maser. I mean, that sounds like some kind of science fiction invention. Mr. MIRSKY: Sounds like a Six Flags ride. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. COLE: Doesn't it? So, I thought that - that was my favorite. FLATOW: Because it does sound like a Six Flags ride, it does bring into this discussion of popular culture, which is where it should be. You know, people'll talk about this \"sounds like a Six Flags ride\" around the dinner table. Mr. MIRSKY: When you go to a party, people love to talk about this stuff - you know, civilians love to talk about this stuff. Prof. COLE: The other thing that amazed me was the technology, you know, seeing the most distant gamma ray burst or - also this year. It wasn't, I don't know, 15, 20 years ago - it can't be that old - five years ago, when I was first covering this for the - I lied, but anyway - for the Los Angeles Times, I remember talking to an astronomer at CalTech who said, we have no idea what this things are. They could be Klingon warships, for all we know. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. COLE: Well, now you have a telescope up there that sights them and immediately other telescopes go and look at it and then you get ground-based telescopes and now these things are very well understood and we're seeing them almost back to the beginning of time. Mr. RAEBURN: You know, you can - there's some terrific - a story that really was an underreported science story - well, it's been going on for some years - is the Cassini mission to Jupiter and its moons. And the Cassini took a pass about 30 miles - now, you can imagine - K. C. can remind me how far Jupiter is from here, but it's far away. And the satellite passed within 30 miles of the surface of - I think I'm going to pronounce this right - Enceladus, one of the moons. Mr. MIRSKY: I think you're talking about Saturn. Mr. RAEBURN: I'm sorry, Saturn. Did I say Jupiter? Mr. MIRSKY: I think so. FLATOW: No. Well, yeah, sure. Mr. RAEBURN: So, that's even farther, right? (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. BEGLEY: They all look alike. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. MIRSKY: Yeah, they all look alike, yeah. FLATOW: I had a senior moment there (unintelligible) Saturn. Mr. RAEBURN: In any case, the pictures for this thing - this is a must-Web trip, to go to the Cassini homepage - and the pictures are spectacular, you know, - geysers and close-up views of the surface of these places and Titan and, I mean, it's just incredible. So, I recommend that everybody. . . FLATOW: And Cassini is - K. C. , am I not correct - that's from the old school of robots, right? Wasn't that the last big one before they went\u2026 Prof. COLE: Yeah, it was enormous and it dropped that little probe in there. FLATOW: Not the smaller, faster, cheaper kind. It was they used to go other way. Prof. COLE: No. No, that would be Phoenix. That would be the one that rose from the ashes and was made out leftover junk and, you know, managed to just produce these absolutely spectacular results. Mr. MIRSKY: Well, it kind of had to be old school because it was launched, what, 10, 11 years ago. FLATOW: Yeah, it was - I think it was the last one from the old school or whatever. Big probe. Prof. COLE: I think another thing, in terms of technology, that really struck me was just how common gravitational lensing is as a tool, you know, - the bending of - warping of light by the curvature of space-time. When Einstein predicted this, he said that he never thought anybody would even be able to see it. Now it's routine in the discovery of almost everything. It's just another way of looking into space. FLATOW: Sharon, let's talk about the Large Hadron Collider. What happened? Ms. BEGLEY: Very disappointing. They turned it on in the fall after years and years of construction and testing and uncounted millions of Euros. This machine, of course, is at CERN, outside Geneva, and it was meant to duplicate or replicate the conditions that existed just a few fractions of a second after the big bang, maybe turn up evidence of supersymmetric particles, maybe even some vague confirmation of string theory. And instead, they had a big \"oops\" moment. Basically, the coolant leaked and - although they were always going to shut down for maintenance and figuring out how the test run went, instead, they're shut down at least till close to the middle of '09 and there are a lot of red faces over there. Mr. MIRSKY: You know, one of the reasons - go ahead, K. C. Prof. COLE: No, I was just going to say, I think with a machine this big and this complicated, it's the kind of thing that you expect to happen from time - I mean, it's the biggest, most complicated scientific instrument ever built, so I think the people working on it are really not that surprised. Mr. RAEBURN: It's actually, I think - it's a telling thing about the way physics works. If I can go back as far as my physics lab in college, you know, I spent a whole semester building a little gadget to make an electron beam. FLATOW: You and Tom Edison, I think. (Soundbite of laugther) Mr. RAEBURN: Yeah, that's right, yeah. Just about, yeah. Thanks, Ira. You know, at the end of the semester, the darn thing didn't work, you know, after all that effort. And that's actually the way physics often works. People are trying to measure things and test things at the absolute limits of what's possible and they don't work and they don't work and they don't work and then, they work and, you know, something cool comes out of it. Mr. MIRSKY: An interesting thing about the collider is, one of the reasons it's shut down in the winter is, you can either run the collider or heat the city of Vienna. Prof. COLE: Right. Mr. MIRSKY: Because it takes so much energy to run it. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Well, collider? Vienna? Collider? Vienna? We actually have a great Large Hadron Collider rap as a video on our Web site at sciencefriday. com. Prof. COLE: Yes. FLATOW: If you want to see it, it's a great, great - they put it together themselves and we put it on our Web site, if you want to see that. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's get a phone call or two in here. Sarah from Maryland. Hi, Sarah. SARAH (Caller): Hi. How are you all? FLATOW: Hi. Mr. RAEBURN: Hi. SARAH: I saw the L. A. Times quoted Holdren as saying that climate change is like being in a car with bad brakes driving towards a cliff in the fog. And my question to the panel is, is this comment in conflict with Obama's softer stance on climate change? This is a much darker outlook than Obama led us to believe. So, will Holdren retreat or will Obama meet the bar that Holdren set? Mr. RAEBURN: Well, I would say that - what I hope Holdren will do and I think he will do - you're focusing on something he said, you know, a metaphor. I think what he will do is stick to the science and the facts. And that's what we ought to press him to do, if he doesn't do that, as citizens. So, you know, the really crucial stuff in climate change is not those kinds of comments, whether they're \"fer it or agin it\" but what the data shows and what the facts are and making policy based on those facts. FLATOW: Will science come back to the White House? Mr. RAEBURN: Right. FLATOW: Yeah. Prof. COLE: Yes. FLATOW: It's a good point. Sarah, what do you think? SARAH: Well, it's questionable. I think climate change is a serious problem and I think that it's a lot more imminent than we might be giving it credence for. FLATOW: Well, he has surrounded himself with all these people who are in agreement on the, you know, I don't think - well, it'll be interesting to see if the agriculture secretary, you know - listen to Michael Polland talking about food is really climate.  SARAH: Mm hmm. FLATOW: You know, whether he jumps on a bandwagon. . . Mr. MIRSKY: You know, that also might be Obama's style. He just seems to be - play everything very cool and he might not want to seem alarmist about this issue even if he feels that way. FLATOW: Thanks for calling, Sarah. SARAH: Thank you. Have a good one. Mr. MIRSKY: You, too. FLATOW: Have a happy holiday. Bye. SARAH: You, too. FLATOW: Well, let's talk about energy a little bit more. You know, it started out with everybody - 2008 did - with everybody talking about ethanol, alcohol as the future and we don't hear anything, Steve. No one is really talking about corn - growing corn anymore. People just said, well, we made the wrong choice or the lobbyists are taking over or what? Mr. MIRSKY: Yeah, corn ethanol just seemed to be a loser the more people looked at it. You know, there's - the reason, I think - and I was talking to Tom Friedman for the SciAm podcast and he confirmed it for me - the reason corn ethanol's on the table at all is because Iowa has the first caucus. And so it's big lobbying to get corn as your source of ethanol. I did a column about what if the - if every other state had the first caucus or primary, what they could pitch and we just had a caller from Maryland and they would be pitching references to Johns Hopkins as John Hopkins, Johns Hopkin or John Hopkin. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: And I've always said - and it'll be interesting to see what Jane Lubchenco says about this - that if Washington were in Florida, we'd have more research on hurricanes and if it was in San Francisco, we'd have more research on earthquakes. Mr. MIRSKY: And in Florida, they'd be looking for sugar ethanol. FLATOW: They'd be looking for - we're talking about top stories of 2008 this hour on Talk of the Nation: Science Friday from NPR News. Go ahead, K. C. Did you want to say something? Prof. COLE: I was just going to say, that's true of, you know, everything. I remember when I was actually working for the design group of the superconducting super collider, which we lost because of politics. We would know all the answers to the questions the LHC is going to ask, maybe. But I remember that it was very important that it be sold in every single state and that that opportunity before they chose taxes was milked to the maximum. And now, even if you look at some of the space programs that are dubious and things, you'll find that it's because parts are being manufactured in a certain state. So, that's a very big factor. FLATOW: Well, we - that started out with putting the space center in Houston with Lyndon Johnson, so it has a long pedigree. Prof. COLE: Exactly. FLATOW: Yeah. Prof. COLE: And the Chinese - I think their rocket is called - correct me if I'm wrong - the Long March II. FLATOW: You got us all on that one. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. MIRSKY: Long march to where? (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: But let's talk about - well, you\u2026 Mr. RAEBURN: The long march to dot, dot, dot. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: You brought up an interesting subject. Are we going to see China and India take over the lead in space exploration? What do you think, K. C. ? How serious are they? Prof. COLE: I think it's extremely exciting and a real wakeup call for the U. S. in terms of - what they've done is not on a par with what we're doing, but it's pretty cool. I mean, one of these Indian launchers went up and I think it let 10 satellites go in a period of 20 minutes or something, just one after another, just dropped them - a couple big ones and a bunch of babies. And, yes, a lot of this is about posturing. That's why we went to the moon, after all, in the beginning. But now that we don't have a way to get to the space station - and the U. S. is a bit crippled on this - it's a great opportunity for these countries to take over. FLATOW: I thought what was most amazing about the Indian launch was how little coverage it got in this country. No one here, virtually, saw anything or heard anything about it except a little mention maybe on CNN or something like that. It's just like. . . Prof. COLE: Yeah. FLATOW: You know, it's - and they did something really monumental for them, you know? Prof. COLE: Right. Well, you know, this is a little bit more technology but the tragedy in Mumbai - when a lot of the reporting came out of Twitter - people don't realize - Obama is going to do something about this - that we don't have a very good Web network here, Internet. We're, I think, about number 15 or something in developed countries. So, you know, that was really a case where you saw that they were quite advanced technologically. FLATOW: Do we all - what do we think about all these new social communities? You think they got a future or are they just a flash in the pan? Or are we too old to make that. . . Prof. COLE: I'm on Second Life, Ira, (unintelligible). (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. RAEBURN: You know, I have to say - I'm too old to be in the demographic here, but I've been playing with these things and fiddling around and logging on to everything I can log on to and abandoning any thoughts of any personal privacy forever again and I'm having a great time. I'm having a lot of fun looking around. I think there's a huge future for these things, particularly, you know, talk about CNN coverage of the Indian launch, you know, we'll never see it again because CNN has laid off its space correspondent, so\u2026 FLATOW: Miles O'Brien. Mr. RAEBURN: Yeah, that's right. So. . . FLATOW: And a whole crew that was. . . Mr. RAEBURN: Yeah. I mean, newspapers are going under by the day. It's just - I don't think it's a question of, you know, are you interested in the online stuff or not. It's all that's - that's all that there will be in a very short time, I think. So, we're all going to have to be interested. Prof. COLE: Yeah. You know, if I may talk about the competition, I actually just came from doing the BBC World year wrap-up, just an hour an a half ago, and I was amazed to find out they have a very substantial science pod of 15 or 20 people who are just dedicated to that. That's pretty impressive, I thought. FLATOW: Well, we don't know. We're - you know, obviously everybody is keeping their fingers and everything - even NPR and us, we're trying to keep our fingers - we're doing Twitter during the show, we're doing Second Life. Ms. COLE: Yup. FLATOW: It's hard, you know, we don't get many people in Second Life because the technology isn't there. We max out the system with just a few hundred people. And considering we have over a million - at one point three million listeners, a few hundred people in Second Life is not very much of an audience, but who knows where any of these things are headed. We're going to talk - we'll prognosticate a bit more after we take a break. Talking with K. C. Cole, Paul Raeburn, Steve Mirsky and Sharon Begley. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. If you'd like to join in, as I say, you can Twitter us, @scifri - s-c-i-f-r-i - and in Second Life, have your avatar get a free t-shirt and ask a question. We'll be right back after this break. Stay with us. (Soundbite of Talk of the Nation: Science Friday theme) (Soundbite of ad) (Soundbite of Talk of the Nation: Science Friday preview) (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to Talk of the Nation: Science Friday. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about the past year in science. What do we know that we didn't know back in 2007 or what we overlooked or your favorite science stories of the year. Give us a call, 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK. You can also write us on Twitter by writing the \"at\" sign followed by s-c-i-f-r-i, that's scifri. My guests are Paul Raeburn, journalist and author of \"Acquainted with the Night: A Parent's Quest to Understand Depression and Bipolar Disorder in his Children,\" he also writes the About Fathers blog for Science Today; Steve Mirsky, staff editor, writer for Scientific American magazine, host of Scientific American's very popular \"Science Talk\" podcast; Sharon Begley, science columnist of Newsweek and K. C. Cole, author of the university - the university - \"The Universe and the Teacup: The Mathematics of Truth and Beauty. \" Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Paul, what's on your list of interesting stories? Mr. RAEBURN: Well, one of the interesting ones was a fairly recent one about the study that showed that statins, the cholesterol lowering drugs, ought to be given to - maybe ought to be given to a lot of people with normal cholesterol. And there were some wrinkles there. It turns out, these are people who have something called an elevated C-reactive protein and so forth, so not quite everybody but many more people than take them now. I thought, if I could step back a bit and say something about the reporting, I'd like to think if I had written this for the AP, I would've begun by saying, an industry funded study has found, although that was in the end of a lot of the news stories I read. It was AstraZeneca who funded it, which doesn't mean it's wrong, but we just ought to highlight that point. They sell the drug - the particular statin here. The other thing was, a lot of the reporting - there were, depending on how you cut the numbers, you know, with a 40 percent, 50 percent drop in strokes or heart attacks or whatever it was but big, you know, big drops. However, the actual numbers were, you know, things like if you did not take the drug - if you did take the drug, you had a one point - there were 1. 6 percent who had an event. If you didn't take the drug, it was 2. 8 percent. So, that 40 or 50 percent drop, which sounds very dramatic, is actually about 1 more person out of a 100 avoiding an event. Now, maybe it's worth giving them the drugs for that. That's a policy that Obama and his people are going to have to figure out. FLATOW: Right. Mr. RAEBURN: But certainly the reporting was questionable. FLATOW: Well, and you could tell a sample size must not have been that big if - such a small difference. Mr. RAEBURN: Well, it, you know, it's this thing that we try to be aware of as reporters - the relative risks versus the absolute risks, you know? And if you go from two percent to one percent, that's a, you know, that's a 50 percent drop, but in terms of actual people and what it means, it doesn't mean so much. FLATOW: Mm hmm. 1-800 - anybody want to jump in and comment? Feel free to do that. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's go to the phones because we have Bruce in Richmond, Virginia. Hi, Bruce. BRUCE (Caller): Hi there. Thank you for taking the call. FLATOW: Hi. Go ahead. BRUCE: Within the last month or two, Professor Steven Hawkins, whom I hold in high regard, made a couple of predictions. One of which was a discovery of a new source of energy within the next 20, 40 years. Seems I remember hearing on NPR sometime between 18 months and two years ago that Norelco had done a controlled bleed between matter and anti-matter and had a violent but highly successful reaction. I would love to hear your guests speak to that. Mr. MIRSKY: Yes, you get the closest shave ever. (Soundbite of laughter) BRUCE: \u2026resources that will be out there lying in wait. The only question is, when are we going to find it? I'll take my answer off the air. Thank you. FLATOW: OK. Thanks for calling. And Steve, you were. . . Mr. MIRSKY: The anti-matter shaver. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: This holiday season, get one. Mr. MIRSKY: It's got no blades. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. RAEBURN: Three blades, four blades, no blades. FLATOW: What was it - what was he talking about in general? Ms. COLE: I have no idea. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. RAEBURN: But I have an energy story. I don't know that one either but I have an energy story. I wrote a piece for the Columbia Journalism Review blog, called the Observatory, about a week ago. I was at the gym minding my own business on the treadmill and I saw a story on CNN about this company, BlackLight Power\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Mr. RAEBURN: \u2026in New Jersey. FLATOW: Right. Mr. RAEBURN: \u2026claims to produce energy made from water, a form of salt and a few other common materials unspecified. And it's - whatever this means, it's supposed to be 200 times more powerful than gasoline. There was only one problem, as the correspondent said, there's only one problem - this would violate the laws of quantum physics. And she went right on cheerily recounting the rest of the story and how, you know, as if she'd said, you know, there's only one problem - it gets dirt on the bottom of your shoes. FLATOW: Right. Right. Mr. RAEBURN: You know, something, so\u2026 FLATOW: Small detail. Mr. RAEBURN: Yes, small detail. So, anyway, that was from CNN, which has disbanded its science and environmental unit. Do I sound like I'm on a bit of a rant here? (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Well, you know, when we went through cold fusion and all these other energies years ago, you always heard the one - what is the one test for anything in this world on those things and including this is. . . Mr. MIRSKY: Right. It's the second law. FLATOW: Well, no. It's actually even cruder than that - is if you're so smart, why ain't you rich? Mr. RAEBURN: Yeah, right. Exactly. Yeah. (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. BEGLEY: Well, but BlackLight has actually been attracting a lot of money. I think they're up to the, at least tens of millions, I've read. Mr. RAEBURN: Well, they claim to have raised about $60 million and Robert Park, who you may know as a physicist at the University of Maryland who's very - who follows these kinds of things, said the company - here's the quote - \"is dependent on investors with deep pockets and shallow brains. \" FLATOW: I actually was approached - I was handed a spec sheet by the BlackLight people also. I haven't looked at it yet, but I was a little, you know. And I gave them the question about the rich part and they weren't answering it. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. MIRSKY: But they drive hydrogen electrons into a lower-than-ground state configuration. Is that right? Mr. RAEBURN: Lower-than-ground state, yes. Hence, the - they misnamed ground state because this is the underground state of hydrogen. Mr. MIRSKY: Must take a lot of energy to do that. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. RAEBURN: There you go. Prof. COLE: If we want to talk about, you know, faith-based science and wasted money and bad reporting, I think one of the things highest on the list would be the sort of straight-face reportage of the conflict over putting missile defense sites in Eastern Europe when you don't even hear anymore the fact that the physics community - I mean, it's pretty clear that this stuff does not work. And this was all exposed 20 years ago. I heard - we had a visitor at Annenberg who was referring to this forgetting of reporters to mention this as \"newsheimers,\" but, you know, it almost never is mentioned. FLATOW: Well, I think that that there's a dearth of science reporters. Science reporters just are a dying breed and people who know how to ask the follow-up question. That's the most important thing - the follow-up question, and it just doesn't get asked very much. Mr. MIRSKY: Well, you make me think - speaking of movies, I had the misfortune of sitting through Ben Stein's \"Expelled\" twice last - this year. And it brings up - you know, I think, reporters when they ask, it's become popular to ask presidential candidates, do you believe in evolution or do you believe in intelligent design? I would like to see them ask do you know what evolution is? Do you know what it means? Do you know what intelligent design purports to be? And see if they really understand what they're about to try to enact legislation on. FLATOW: Yeah, we had people diagnosing Terri Schiavo from you know\u2026 Mr. MIRSKY: Right. FLATOW: \u2026far away places. Mr. MIRSKY: And he was a Harvard Medical School graduate who derailed his presidential bid with that. FLATOW: Yeah. 1-800-989-8255. Let's change gears a little bit. Sharon, do you think the Cancer Genome Atlas is going to be helpful to medicine? Ms. BEGLEY: You know, if it is, more power to it. But the problem with the myriad of things that go wrong in malignant cells is that there are a myriad of them and the Cancer - the Human Cancer Genome Atlas tries to find every single one of those things - every single genetic mutation in liver cancer and kidney cancer and every other kind of cancer that there is. And the question that they're going to be facing is which of these changes are causal? I mean, one of the hallmarks of malignant cells is that their chromosomes are hugely unstable and once one thing starts to go wrong so does everything else. But only a few of those things actually cause the cell to become malignant, to be a cancer. So, it's going to be a huge challenge for bioinformatics and I have to say, you know, it really harks back or is reminiscent of the Human Genome Project, which we're all happy it took place. But, you know, does anyone else think that the salesmanship was a little bit ahead of the reality? I mean, it was great for things like anthropology, but not so much for medicine. FLATOW: Yeah. Any comments (unintelligible)? Mr. RAEBURN: Well, it's interesting - I think that's exactly right. It is interesting, though, that this year there was a report that a continuing downturn in cancer deaths and increase in diagnoses and number of new cases declining is now about a 15-year trend. So, this is the kind of thing that may, you know, affect that trend line 15 or 20 years in the future. FLATOW: Well, that will be interesting to see if at least any life expectancy changes. Mr. RAEBURN: That's right. Yeah. That's right. FLATOW: I mean, the downturn in cases diagnosis, but will anybody live any longer? Mr. RAEBURN: Yeah, yeah. That's right. But it's reasonable to think some effects are coming out to some of this. Go ahead, Sharon. Ms. BEGLEY: No, I mean, you know, the problem with the war on cancer is that we've been fighting it for - I mean, when did Nixon do his thing? - almost 40 years now. And when you measure success by five-year survival or 10-year survival, you know, one of the concerns is just as Ira said. Are these people actually living longer or is simply the clock starting earlier? Are we diagnosing them earlier? And as you're saying, yeah, for a few cancers, people are indeed living longer and some of them are living until they die of something else, which is exactly where we want cancer to go. But honestly, it's been an awfully lot of decades with very little show for it. FLATOW: Let me ask you something, Paul. I know you study this - follow it closely - the Mental Health Parity Bill that passed\u2026 Mr. RAEBURN: Yes. FLATOW: \u2026as part of the bailout. Tell us about that. Mr. RAEBURN: Yeah. That was - the bailout of the nation's mentally ill\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. RAEBURN: \u2026which you didn't read about. It was actually - we can argue about the, you know, financial and auto bailouts forever. Mr. MIRSKY: That was the financial bailout. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. RAEBURN: Yeah, that's right. You know, the one good thing that came out of that bailout bill, with no qualification, was a measure that it had been hanging around for 10 years or longer\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah, a long time. Mr. RAEBURN: \u2026to treat mental illnesses the same way for insurance purposes as other illnesses, so same number of hospital days allowed, same caps on expenditures and so forth. This would seem to me to be sort of a trivially obvious thing. Sick is sick and whether it's the brain or the gut, it's sick. But the politics was very complicated and\u2026 FLATOW: Was it attached to something else? Mr. RAEBURN: It was a - it was part of the\u2026 FLATOW: We had - William Moyers was on talking about this\u2026. Mr. RAEBURN: Yeah, it was part of the financial bailout bill - the big bill, the $700 billion bill. FLATOW: Yeah. Mr. RAEBURN: And there it was on page 28 or something. And so, it's a huge thing for people and families with mental illness. FLATOW: And it allows you to get - give us some detail - compensation equal to other kinds of illness. Mr. RAEBURN: Right. In the past, in many, many insurance plans - I think there's something like a hundred million people who have had this problem and will get a better shake because of this legislation - many plans you got, you know, let's say 100 - up to 100 hospital days a year or whatever it was, you know, that you were allowed and so many doctor's visits and so forth, but all those limits were smaller for mental illnesses. And the only explanation that I can come up with really is that somehow people were thinking these weren't real illnesses or something. But, you know, have a family member with bipolar disorder, as I do, and you lose that notion very quickly. FLATOW: I have time for one more question before I go to our Science Friday Pick of the Week and let me remind everybody that this is Talk of the Nation: Science Friday from NPR News. And that comes from a Twitter from Power Tripoli (ph), who wants to know, could you elaborate on the earlier conversation about string theory and could the Hadron Collider help prove it? Could it help prove it? K. C. , you have any way. . . Prof. COLE: Yeah. Oh, absolutely. I'm glad you mentioned that because we were talking about the Large Hadron Collider but we never talked about what it was going to do. One of the really exciting things that could happen that - well, there are a couple in terms of string theory. One is that it's possible that we could see energy disappearing, which might be going into another dimension. So, that might be the first evidence for that. The other thing would be a supersymmetric particle, which is part of string theory. What does that mean? It just means that, you know, the more we look at nature, the more things that seem to be different are actually the same. So, it's possible that every particle has a partner, which have all been given funny names that we haven't found yet. Well, if we find the lightest one of these at LHC, that might be an explanation, or one explanation, of dark matter. And that's really important because that makes up most of the matter in the universe. FLATOW: All right. Mr. MIRSKY: I think - you can have supersymmetry without string theory though, can't you? Prof. COLE: Yes. Yes, you can. Yes, you can. But it would be a confirmation along the way, yeah. FLATOW: All right. We have to end it here. We all had a good time today, I hope. K. C. Cole, author of \"The Universe and the Teacup: The Mathematics of Truth and Beauty;\" Paul Raeburn, author of \"Acquainted with the Night: A Parent's Quest to Understand Depression and Bipolar Disorder in His Children,\" he also writes the About Fathers blog for Psychology Today; Steve Mirsky, staff editor and writer for Scientific American magazine and host of the Scientific American \"Science Talk\" podcast; Sharon Begley, science columnist for Newsweek. Have a great holiday. Good to see you all again. We'll meet back here a year from now, OK? Mr. RAEBURN: Same time, same place. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. COLE: Thank you. Take care.  IRA FLATOW, host:  This is Talk of the Nation: Science Friday. I'm Ira Flatow. In just a few weeks, President-elect Barack Obama will take the keys to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and he'll be accompanied by some world-class scientists. He's already appointed Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu as Energy secretary. Physicist John Holdren, an energy and climate-change expert who favors cutting greenhouse-gas emissions, is expected to join Obama as science advisor. Jane Lubchenco, one of the nation's top marine biologists, is expected to head the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. So, it's a heady time for science in Washington, D. C. And this hour, we'll be talking about these choices with an AU-gust - au-GUST? - au-GUST panel of distinguished science journalists who will, I hope, also weigh in with their opinions about the top stories of 2008, or I might not be able to stop them from weighing in with their opinions about this if I'd like to.  There were some great discoveries. Let's talk about a few of them. And there were experiments that fizzled out. There was the wooly-mammoth genome, the cancer genome, the synthetic genome. There was a drug that seemed to mimic the effects of exercise, for mice, at least, and a controversial study about cholesterol drugs. It was the first exoplanet spied in a snapshot and the Phoenix lander stuffing soil into its ovens on the northern plains of Mars. In 2008, cheap genetic tests hit the market, and Washington enacted the Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act. Polar bears were finally listed as threatened, and a chemical in plastic frightened water-bottle owners everywhere.  And on the unlucky side of science this year, part of the Hubble telescope's 20-year-old computer crashed and the Large Hadron Collider had a - how shall we call it? - a premature hiccup? - and stopped working just a few weeks after firing up. There's also science in the arts world - a lot of science in the arts things that were going on this year. We had plays about Philo Farnsworth. There was a play and a movie in production about Hedy Lamarr. \"Doctor Atomic\" opened at the MET, a play about the atom bomb. So, there's a lot to talk about this hour about what was going on in science this year.  Our number, 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK, if you'd like to join us. And if you want more information about our topic, you can surf over to our Web site at sciencefriday. com. And if you're on Twitter, you can follow us @scifri. That's - write to us with the @ sign followed by scifri. And we'll see if we can get a question in there, too, from you on Twitter. And in Second Life there's a gang of folks that are listening to us. You're welcome to ask questions that way, too. Let me introduce my guests. Sharon Begley is a science columnist from Newsweek. She joins us here in our studios in New York. Welcome back, Sharon.  Ms. SHARON BEGLEY (Senior Editor, Newsweek): Thank you, Ira.  FLATOW: You're welcome. Steve Mirsky is a staff editor and writer for Scientific American magazine and host of \"Science Talk\" podcast. He's also with us here. Good to see you again, Steve.  Mr. STEVE MIRSKY (Editor and Columnist, Scientific American): Thanks. That's Hedley Lamar.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Hedley to you. Paul Raeburn is a journalist and author of \"Acquainted with the Night: A Parent's Quest to Understand Depression and Bipolar Disorder in His Children. \" He also writes the About Fathers blog for Psychology Today. And he joins us here in New York. Good to see you again.  Mr. PAUL RAEBURN (Science Journalist and Author, \"Acquainted with the Night: A Parent's Quest to Understand Depression and Bipolar Disorder in His Children\"): Nice to be here, Ira.  FLATOW: K. C. Cole is the only one in the outer hinlands(ph) out there and she's the author of \"The Universe and the Teacup: The Mathematics of Truth and Beauty\" and she's also a professor in the Annenberg School of Journalism at UCLA - USC - Professor K. C. COLE (Author, \"The Universe and the Teacup: The Mathematics of Truth and Beauty\", Professor, Annenberg School of Journalism, USC): No, no, no.  FLATOW: No, no. University of Southern California, Los Angeles. I wanted to see if you're listening, K. C. University of Southern California in Los Angeles. She joins us from the studios of Marketplace Productions in L. A. Nice to have you back on Science Friday, K. C.  Prof. COLE: Nice to be here.  FLATOW: Let's get in to the Washington politics that's going on here. Let me go around the table and out to K. C. What do we think about, Steve, about all these appointments? Science is taking center stage again.  Mr. MIRSKY: Well, let's contrast with the campaign what's going on now. In the campaign, John McCain said that Sarah Palin knew more about energy than pretty much anybody else in the country. And here we have now the energy secretary's going to be an actual Nobel Laureate in physics and I'm pretty sure he knows that a joule is not a diamond, an erg is not, a real hankering to do something and a BTU is not a sandwich you get at a diner.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. MIRSKY: You know, so, I'm pretty optimistic. I mean, look, just because he's a Nobel Laureate, doesn't mean he's going to be terrific in this political setting. He does have big administrative experience running the national laboratory out there. But you just have to be optimistic at this point about what these appointments mean.  FLATOW: Let's go out there. K. C. , what's the reaction out in California?  Prof. COLE: Well, you know, I think everybody is very excited when you contrast this to what was happening beforehand, where you had tens of thousands of scientists protesting that science is being distorted. It continues for political reasons and decisions are being made not on the scientific basis but again, you know, for political reasons. We now have a President-elect who actually respects and believes in science and every single appointment he's made has been right on. So, I think it's really good news for everybody, including the space community - just everybody.  FLATOW: Mm hmm. Also mentioned is the fact that Lisa P. Jackson in going to be the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency - the second administrator from New Jersey, Sharon.  Ms. BEGLEY: Which gives her an excellent pedigree, since New Jersey is no stranger to pollution problems.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. BEGLEY: But Jackson. . .  Mr. MIRSKY: There go about 2,000 listeners.  Ms. BEGLEY: Hey, I'm a New Jersey girl, born and bred. But Jackson has not only her administrative experience with Governor John Corzine, but she was also in EPA as a regional administrator for a number of years. So, she knows the agency, she knows its issues, and it looks like she's going to have the ear of the incoming president.  Mr. MIRSKY: When you contrast this, again, with the last EPA administrator from New Jersey, Governor Whitman, who left the office because she really felt like she couldn't get anything accomplished.  FLATOW: Yeah. She left fairly early on, didn't she? She could see that handwriting on the wall or the memos being changed, actually.  Mr. MIRSKY: Right.  FLATOW: And we also have - Carol Browner is back as - in the form of a - well, she's been calling - being called the \"Climate Czarina. \"  Ms. BEGLEY: Which is going to be interesting, because she's going to - she's tasked, as we now say, with coordinating all of the other voices who have something to say about climate policy. And that's going to include DOE Secretary Chu, it's going to include the EPA administrator. And she's sort of the environment or the climate equivalent of the, you know, national security advisor. She's going to have to butt heads together. She's going to have to make some sense out of the cacophony of advice that's rising up through the ranks.  FLATOW: It does look like all the appointees sort of have a climate bend to them, don't they?  Mr. RAEBURN: Yeah, I looked at John Holdren, who will be science advisor, responsible for all kinds of things. He published a paper in Science this year, \"Science and Technology for Sustainable Wellbeing. \" You know, there's an environmentalist buzzword if there ever was one. Another one was called \"Climate Change: The Sky is Falling. \" And I think it's important to emphasize here that this isn't a change of politics. We're not going from sort of corporate people to environmental people. We're going from ideologically-based decisions to factually-based decisions. I don't have any problem myself with somebody saying, you know, I represent the coal industry and I don't think we should worry about carbon. We want to burn coal. I think that's a perfectly reasonable point of view, we can debate that. But when somebody has that kind of position and tries to couch it in environmental terms, you know, clean coal, it's the hypocrisy that gets my reporter's instincts up, I have to say.  FLATOW: I've seen that commercial.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. MIRSKY: No, really. Don't hand me a bowl of some brown substance and tell me, not only that it's ice cream, but that it's vanilla ice cream  FLATOR: Yeah. Of course, this one has not been confirmed yet, this is a proposed\u2026  Ms. BEGLEY: Supposedly coming tomorrow in Obama's radio address. But Holdren is an interesting character because although, as Paul says, he's been, you know, quite visible on the climate issue, he's not a bomb thrower. You know, as a reporter, if you need the incendiary quote about how the world, you know, is going to heck in a handbasket due to climate change, Holdren is not the first one you call. He's very empirically-based. He's very - sort of a quiet, behind-the-scenes kind of operator. And one story I love about him, he - when he was younger - wrote a lot of papers with Paul Ehrlich, the eminent Stanford biologist, who is a bomb thrower, best known for \"The Population Bomb. \" So, a friend ran into Holdren one day and asked him, you know, you and Ehrlich are getting all these criticisms from business, from the Republican right, whatever, saying that you're crazy, you're out to undermine capitalism, you know. Does that bother you? And Holdren said, you know what? They're attacking Ehrlich and \"that other guy,\" so as long as I'm just \"that other guy,\" it's OK.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. MIRSKY: I was at a session that Holdren spoke at, at the American Association for the Advancement of Science conference in February, and he did have caustic remarks for Michael Crichton, who at the time was still alive. I believe he used the phrase \"colossal arrogance\" for Crichton to take upon himself the role of advising the president and members of Congress on global warming.  FLATOW: It'll be\u2026  Prof. COLE: I think\u2026  FLATOW: Go ahead, K. C.  Prof. COLE: No, I was just going to say, I think, in terms of NASA policy in space, too, it's going to be interesting because a lot of the Earth-observing satellites that are at the end of their lives are not being replaced. And I think that's really going to change now, that we're going to have more of an emphasis - you may remember that, actually, Earth observing was taken out - I believe it was this year - of the NASA mission statement, so I think that's very optimistic in terms of climate, that we'll actually be able to look at ourselves again.  FLATOW: Are we going to have any money left to do any of these things is the question, especially, you know, in space.  Mr. MIRSKY: It's an investment. It's not overhead, it's an investment.  Mr. RAEBURN: Yeah, I mean, there are different things and space maybe a tougher sell than climate and energy, which is wrapped up with the economy, as are a lot of health issues, which could save us money, could cost us money. But some of the basic sciences may be in more trouble - cosmology and space science and so forth - we'll just have to see how it goes.  Prof. COLE: Yeah, they certainly have been.  FLATOW: Go ahead, K. C.  Prof. COLE: No, I was going to say, they certainly have been with the moon to Mars program, which was not something that the vast majority of astronomers and physicists were behind. In fact, it led to the pushing back of several really important missions like the - LISA, the Laser - how do you say it - laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory, which, you know, was going to allow us to - I mean, it will - to see actually back to the big bang itself perhaps - the gravitational waves from that. And a lot of that stuff got just pushed off and postponed. I would say, money wasted. So, it's possible now that we can go back to doing more real science in space.  Mr. RAEBURN: The comforting thing, of course, is that the space station is still up there, still going strong, still costing us billions of dollars while we can't do all these other interesting things. We've got to borrow a car to get there.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Details, details, details.  Prof. COLE: But we're not speaking with the people who have the car, so we can't use the right kind of car.  Mr. RAEBURN: K. C. , you have such a pessimistic look at it.  FLATOW: We'll get a zip car.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: All right, we have to take a break. We'll come back and talk lots more about the year in science with Sharon Begley, K. C. Cole, Paul Raeburn and Steve Mirsky and your calls. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Also in Second Life and you can twitter us @scifri, that's @ s-c-i-f-r-i. Don't go away, we'll be right back.  (Soundbite of Talk of the Nation theme)  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to Talk of the Nation: Science Friday. I'm Ira Flatow. We're looking back on the year 2008, talking about stuff that has been, might have been or shouldn't have been - we could throw that in - which should not have been with my guests, Sharon Begley, science columnist for Newsweek; Steve Mirsky is editor and writer for Scientific American magazine and host of Scientific American's \"Science Talk\" podcast; Paul Raeburn is a journalist and author of \"Acquainted with the Night: A Parent's Quest to Understand Depression and Bipolar Disorder in His Children,\" he also writes the About Fathers blog for Psychology Today; K. C. Cole, author of \"The Universe and the Teacup: The Mathematics of Truth and Beauty,\" and she's also a professor in the Annenberg School of Journalism at USC in Los Angeles. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Let's talk about where I left off in the introduction about science and culture. There were lot of science and cultural events and I think one of those things that we talk about as a part of being science and culture - we like to throw that in - is science fiction in culture. And Steve Mirsky, you were saying you saw a remake of a classic movie.  Mr. MIRSKY: We'll call it a re-imagining of \"The Day the Earth Stood Still. \" I went to a screening in preparation for interviewing the director, and it's not a good movie.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: No details necessary.  Mr. MIRSKY: But when it comes around to cable or NetFlix, you know, I think it's kind of worth watching as a reflection of what we now take for granted, culturally, about science. For example, what I found really interesting was, in this version - you know, Keanu Reeves is Klaatu. And in this version, when you first see Reeves, he's an Earth person, a regular old human, back in the 1920s and he's clearly - a sample of his skin is clearly taken by the aliens somehow and the Klaatu that we see later is a clone of him. And that's not explained because you don't need to explain that to a mass audience anymore. They see a scar on the back of your hand and then a reproduction of this individual and they understand it's a clone.  FLATOW: Interesting, interesting. But the first - the original - the trailers I have seen are so violent, you know. The original movie was so understated and now I see - this is what you must be implying - that they just hammed it up. Go ahead, K. C. , have you seen it?  Prof. COLE: No, but something really exciting has happened and I can't remember the name of it now, but the National Academy of Sciences has just started a collaboration with Hollywood, headed by Jennifer Ouellette, who writes Twisted Physics blog and Cocktail Party Physics. And - but this is partly modeled on a successful program at the Annenberg School, actually, where the Lear Center started to give good medical information to shows like \"E. R. \" and they found that it actually had an effect on people, so that what they're trying to do now is say, OK, we're going to have all these shows - \"The Big Bang Theory\" and these movies - why not make the science accurate? It will be better because science is always stranger than fiction anyway. So, I think that's really exciting.  FLATOW: It's only taken 30 years to do this.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. MIRSKY: Right.  FLATOW: You know, Leon Lederman has been going out to see Norman Lear himself ever since it was, you know, \"All in the Family\" days\u2026  Mr. MIRSKY: \"Maude\" was on.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Exactly - trying to talk them into - and actually to create - if you can do a show about a newsroom, like \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show,\" why can't you do one about a laboratory, you know, and have wacky things go on there? But it's at least in the laboratory. Maybe now, the National Academy's had more success with this, but\u2026  Prof. COLE: Well, I think so. I mean, you know, in trying to catch up on the year in science, the things that I came across were just so bizarre.  FLATOW: Let's get into them. Go ahead. Start out with your most bizarre - top of the list.  Prof. COLE: OK. Here is the one I love, just because of the way it was phrased, in terms of seeing the most distant water - 11 billion light years away or ago, either way you want to put it - but this water is in the form of giant water masers. In other words, the water molecules are behaving like lasers and these things are huge and they're saying now they're even more common than they were before. And I'm thinking, yeah, giant water maser. I mean, that sounds like some kind of science fiction invention.  Mr. MIRSKY: Sounds like a Six Flags ride.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Prof. COLE: Doesn't it? So, I thought that - that was my favorite.  FLATOW: Because it does sound like a Six Flags ride, it does bring into this discussion of popular culture, which is where it should be. You know, people'll talk about this \"sounds like a Six Flags ride\" around the dinner table.  Mr. MIRSKY: When you go to a party, people love to talk about this stuff - you know, civilians love to talk about this stuff.  Prof. COLE: The other thing that amazed me was the technology, you know, seeing the most distant gamma ray burst or - also this year. It wasn't, I don't know, 15, 20 years ago - it can't be that old - five years ago, when I was first covering this for the - I lied, but anyway - for the Los Angeles Times, I remember talking to an astronomer at CalTech who said, we have no idea what this things are. They could be Klingon warships, for all we know.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Prof. COLE: Well, now you have a telescope up there that sights them and immediately other telescopes go and look at it and then you get ground-based telescopes and now these things are very well understood and we're seeing them almost back to the beginning of time.  Mr. RAEBURN: You know, you can - there's some terrific - a story that really was an underreported science story - well, it's been going on for some years - is the Cassini mission to Jupiter and its moons. And the Cassini took a pass about 30 miles - now, you can imagine - K. C. can remind me how far Jupiter is from here, but it's far away. And the satellite passed within 30 miles of the surface of - I think I'm going to pronounce this right - Enceladus, one of the moons.  Mr. MIRSKY: I think you're talking about Saturn.  Mr. RAEBURN: I'm sorry, Saturn. Did I say Jupiter?  Mr. MIRSKY: I think so.  FLATOW: No. Well, yeah, sure.  Mr. RAEBURN: So, that's even farther, right?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. BEGLEY: They all look alike.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. MIRSKY: Yeah, they all look alike, yeah.  FLATOW: I had a senior moment there (unintelligible) Saturn.  Mr. RAEBURN: In any case, the pictures for this thing - this is a must-Web trip, to go to the Cassini homepage - and the pictures are spectacular, you know, - geysers and close-up views of the surface of these places and Titan and, I mean, it's just incredible. So, I recommend that everybody. . .  FLATOW: And Cassini is - K. C. , am I not correct - that's from the old school of robots, right? Wasn't that the last big one before they went\u2026  Prof. COLE: Yeah, it was enormous and it dropped that little probe in there.  FLATOW: Not the smaller, faster, cheaper kind. It was they used to go other way.  Prof. COLE: No. No, that would be Phoenix. That would be the one that rose from the ashes and was made out leftover junk and, you know, managed to just produce these absolutely spectacular results.  Mr. MIRSKY: Well, it kind of had to be old school because it was launched, what, 10, 11 years ago.  FLATOW: Yeah, it was - I think it was the last one from the old school or whatever. Big probe.  Prof. COLE: I think another thing, in terms of technology, that really struck me was just how common gravitational lensing is as a tool, you know, - the bending of - warping of light by the curvature of space-time. When Einstein predicted this, he said that he never thought anybody would even be able to see it. Now it's routine in the discovery of almost everything. It's just another way of looking into space.  FLATOW: Sharon, let's talk about the Large Hadron Collider. What happened?  Ms. BEGLEY: Very disappointing. They turned it on in the fall after years and years of construction and testing and uncounted millions of Euros. This machine, of course, is at CERN, outside Geneva, and it was meant to duplicate or replicate the conditions that existed just a few fractions of a second after the big bang, maybe turn up evidence of supersymmetric particles, maybe even some vague confirmation of string theory. And instead, they had a big \"oops\" moment. Basically, the coolant leaked and - although they were always going to shut down for maintenance and figuring out how the test run went, instead, they're shut down at least till close to the middle of '09 and there are a lot of red faces over there.  Mr. MIRSKY: You know, one of the reasons - go ahead, K. C.  Prof. COLE: No, I was just going to say, I think with a machine this big and this complicated, it's the kind of thing that you expect to happen from time - I mean, it's the biggest, most complicated scientific instrument ever built, so I think the people working on it are really not that surprised.  Mr. RAEBURN: It's actually, I think - it's a telling thing about the way physics works. If I can go back as far as my physics lab in college, you know, I spent a whole semester building a little gadget to make an electron beam.  FLATOW: You and Tom Edison, I think.  (Soundbite of laugther)  Mr. RAEBURN: Yeah, that's right, yeah. Just about, yeah. Thanks, Ira. You know, at the end of the semester, the darn thing didn't work, you know, after all that effort. And that's actually the way physics often works. People are trying to measure things and test things at the absolute limits of what's possible and they don't work and they don't work and they don't work and then, they work and, you know, something cool comes out of it.  Mr. MIRSKY: An interesting thing about the collider is, one of the reasons it's shut down in the winter is, you can either run the collider or heat the city of Vienna.  Prof. COLE: Right.  Mr. MIRSKY: Because it takes so much energy to run it.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Well, collider? Vienna? Collider? Vienna? We actually have a great Large Hadron Collider rap as a video on our Web site at sciencefriday. com.  Prof. COLE: Yes.  FLATOW: If you want to see it, it's a great, great - they put it together themselves and we put it on our Web site, if you want to see that. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's get a phone call or two in here. Sarah from Maryland. Hi, Sarah.  SARAH (Caller): Hi. How are you all?  FLATOW: Hi.  Mr. RAEBURN: Hi.  SARAH: I saw the L. A. Times quoted Holdren as saying that climate change is like being in a car with bad brakes driving towards a cliff in the fog. And my question to the panel is, is this comment in conflict with Obama's softer stance on climate change? This is a much darker outlook than Obama led us to believe. So, will Holdren retreat or will Obama meet the bar that Holdren set?  Mr. RAEBURN: Well, I would say that - what I hope Holdren will do and I think he will do - you're focusing on something he said, you know, a metaphor. I think what he will do is stick to the science and the facts. And that's what we ought to press him to do, if he doesn't do that, as citizens. So, you know, the really crucial stuff in climate change is not those kinds of comments, whether they're \"fer it or agin it\" but what the data shows and what the facts are and making policy based on those facts.  FLATOW: Will science come back to the White House?  Mr. RAEBURN: Right.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Prof. COLE: Yes.  FLATOW: It's a good point. Sarah, what do you think?  SARAH: Well, it's questionable. I think climate change is a serious problem and I think that it's a lot more imminent than we might be giving it credence for.  FLATOW: Well, he has surrounded himself with all these people who are in agreement on the, you know, I don't think - well, it'll be interesting to see if the agriculture secretary, you know - listen to Michael Polland talking about food is really climate.   SARAH: Mm hmm.  FLATOW: You know, whether he jumps on a bandwagon. . .  Mr. MIRSKY: You know, that also might be Obama's style. He just seems to be - play everything very cool and he might not want to seem alarmist about this issue even if he feels that way.  FLATOW: Thanks for calling, Sarah.  SARAH: Thank you. Have a good one.  Mr. MIRSKY: You, too.  FLATOW: Have a happy holiday. Bye.  SARAH: You, too.  FLATOW: Well, let's talk about energy a little bit more. You know, it started out with everybody - 2008 did - with everybody talking about ethanol, alcohol as the future and we don't hear anything, Steve. No one is really talking about corn - growing corn anymore. People just said, well, we made the wrong choice or the lobbyists are taking over or what?  Mr. MIRSKY: Yeah, corn ethanol just seemed to be a loser the more people looked at it. You know, there's - the reason, I think - and I was talking to Tom Friedman for the SciAm podcast and he confirmed it for me - the reason corn ethanol's on the table at all is because Iowa has the first caucus. And so it's big lobbying to get corn as your source of ethanol. I did a column about what if the - if every other state had the first caucus or primary, what they could pitch and we just had a caller from Maryland and they would be pitching references to Johns Hopkins as John Hopkins, Johns Hopkin or John Hopkin.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: And I've always said - and it'll be interesting to see what Jane Lubchenco says about this - that if Washington were in Florida, we'd have more research on hurricanes and if it was in San Francisco, we'd have more research on earthquakes.  Mr. MIRSKY: And in Florida, they'd be looking for sugar ethanol.  FLATOW: They'd be looking for - we're talking about top stories of 2008 this hour on Talk of the Nation: Science Friday from NPR News. Go ahead, K. C. Did you want to say something?  Prof. COLE: I was just going to say, that's true of, you know, everything. I remember when I was actually working for the design group of the superconducting super collider, which we lost because of politics. We would know all the answers to the questions the LHC is going to ask, maybe. But I remember that it was very important that it be sold in every single state and that that opportunity before they chose taxes was milked to the maximum. And now, even if you look at some of the space programs that are dubious and things, you'll find that it's because parts are being manufactured in a certain state. So, that's a very big factor.  FLATOW: Well, we - that started out with putting the space center in Houston with Lyndon Johnson, so it has a long pedigree.  Prof. COLE: Exactly.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Prof. COLE: And the Chinese - I think their rocket is called - correct me if I'm wrong - the Long March II.  FLATOW: You got us all on that one.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. MIRSKY: Long march to where?  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: But let's talk about - well, you\u2026  Mr. RAEBURN: The long march to dot, dot, dot.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: You brought up an interesting subject. Are we going to see China and India take over the lead in space exploration? What do you think, K. C. ? How serious are they?  Prof. COLE: I think it's extremely exciting and a real wakeup call for the U. S. in terms of - what they've done is not on a par with what we're doing, but it's pretty cool. I mean, one of these Indian launchers went up and I think it let 10 satellites go in a period of 20 minutes or something, just one after another, just dropped them - a couple big ones and a bunch of babies. And, yes, a lot of this is about posturing. That's why we went to the moon, after all, in the beginning. But now that we don't have a way to get to the space station - and the U. S. is a bit crippled on this - it's a great opportunity for these countries to take over.  FLATOW: I thought what was most amazing about the Indian launch was how little coverage it got in this country. No one here, virtually, saw anything or heard anything about it except a little mention maybe on CNN or something like that. It's just like. . .  Prof. COLE: Yeah.  FLATOW: You know, it's - and they did something really monumental for them, you know?  Prof. COLE: Right. Well, you know, this is a little bit more technology but the tragedy in Mumbai - when a lot of the reporting came out of Twitter - people don't realize - Obama is going to do something about this - that we don't have a very good Web network here, Internet. We're, I think, about number 15 or something in developed countries. So, you know, that was really a case where you saw that they were quite advanced technologically.  FLATOW: Do we all - what do we think about all these new social communities? You think they got a future or are they just a flash in the pan? Or are we too old to make that. . .  Prof. COLE: I'm on Second Life, Ira, (unintelligible).  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. RAEBURN: You know, I have to say - I'm too old to be in the demographic here, but I've been playing with these things and fiddling around and logging on to everything I can log on to and abandoning any thoughts of any personal privacy forever again and I'm having a great time. I'm having a lot of fun looking around. I think there's a huge future for these things, particularly, you know, talk about CNN coverage of the Indian launch, you know, we'll never see it again because CNN has laid off its space correspondent, so\u2026  FLATOW: Miles O'Brien.  Mr. RAEBURN: Yeah, that's right. So. . .  FLATOW: And a whole crew that was. . .  Mr. RAEBURN: Yeah. I mean, newspapers are going under by the day. It's just - I don't think it's a question of, you know, are you interested in the online stuff or not. It's all that's - that's all that there will be in a very short time, I think. So, we're all going to have to be interested.  Prof. COLE: Yeah. You know, if I may talk about the competition, I actually just came from doing the BBC World year wrap-up, just an hour an a half ago, and I was amazed to find out they have a very substantial science pod of 15 or 20 people who are just dedicated to that. That's pretty impressive, I thought.  FLATOW: Well, we don't know. We're - you know, obviously everybody is keeping their fingers and everything - even NPR and us, we're trying to keep our fingers - we're doing Twitter during the show, we're doing Second Life.  Ms. COLE: Yup.  FLATOW: It's hard, you know, we don't get many people in Second Life because the technology isn't there. We max out the system with just a few hundred people. And considering we have over a million - at one point three million listeners, a few hundred people in Second Life is not very much of an audience, but who knows where any of these things are headed. We're going to talk - we'll prognosticate a bit more after we take a break. Talking with K. C. Cole, Paul Raeburn, Steve Mirsky and Sharon Begley. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. If you'd like to join in, as I say, you can Twitter us, @scifri - s-c-i-f-r-i - and in Second Life, have your avatar get a free t-shirt and ask a question. We'll be right back after this break. Stay with us.  (Soundbite of Talk of the Nation: Science Friday theme)  (Soundbite of ad)  (Soundbite of Talk of the Nation: Science Friday preview)  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to Talk of the Nation: Science Friday. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about the past year in science. What do we know that we didn't know back in 2007 or what we overlooked or your favorite science stories of the year. Give us a call, 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK. You can also write us on Twitter by writing the \"at\" sign followed by s-c-i-f-r-i, that's scifri.  My guests are Paul Raeburn, journalist and author of \"Acquainted with the Night: A Parent's Quest to Understand Depression and Bipolar Disorder in his Children,\" he also writes the About Fathers blog for Science Today; Steve Mirsky, staff editor, writer for Scientific American magazine, host of Scientific American's very popular \"Science Talk\" podcast; Sharon Begley, science columnist of Newsweek and K. C. Cole, author of the university - the university - \"The Universe and the Teacup: The Mathematics of Truth and Beauty. \" Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Paul, what's on your list of interesting stories?  Mr. RAEBURN: Well, one of the interesting ones was a fairly recent one about the study that showed that statins, the cholesterol lowering drugs, ought to be given to - maybe ought to be given to a lot of people with normal cholesterol. And there were some wrinkles there. It turns out, these are people who have something called an elevated C-reactive protein and so forth, so not quite everybody but many more people than take them now. I thought, if I could step back a bit and say something about the reporting, I'd like to think if I had written this for the AP, I would've begun by saying, an industry funded study has found, although that was in the end of a lot of the news stories I read. It was AstraZeneca who funded it, which doesn't mean it's wrong, but we just ought to highlight that point. They sell the drug - the particular statin here.  The other thing was, a lot of the reporting - there were, depending on how you cut the numbers, you know, with a 40 percent, 50 percent drop in strokes or heart attacks or whatever it was but big, you know, big drops. However, the actual numbers were, you know, things like if you did not take the drug - if you did take the drug, you had a one point - there were 1. 6 percent who had an event. If you didn't take the drug, it was 2. 8 percent. So, that 40 or 50 percent drop, which sounds very dramatic, is actually about 1 more person out of a 100 avoiding an event. Now, maybe it's worth giving them the drugs for that. That's a policy that Obama and his people are going to have to figure out.  FLATOW: Right.  Mr. RAEBURN: But certainly the reporting was questionable.  FLATOW: Well, and you could tell a sample size must not have been that big if - such a small difference.  Mr. RAEBURN: Well, it, you know, it's this thing that we try to be aware of as reporters - the relative risks versus the absolute risks, you know? And if you go from two percent to one percent, that's a, you know, that's a 50 percent drop, but in terms of actual people and what it means, it doesn't mean so much.  FLATOW: Mm hmm. 1-800 - anybody want to jump in and comment? Feel free to do that. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's go to the phones because we have Bruce in Richmond, Virginia. Hi, Bruce.  BRUCE (Caller): Hi there. Thank you for taking the call.  FLATOW: Hi. Go ahead.  BRUCE: Within the last month or two, Professor Steven Hawkins, whom I hold in high regard, made a couple of predictions. One of which was a discovery of a new source of energy within the next 20, 40 years. Seems I remember hearing on NPR sometime between 18 months and two years ago that Norelco had done a controlled bleed between matter and anti-matter and had a violent but highly successful reaction. I would love to hear your guests speak to that.  Mr. MIRSKY: Yes, you get the closest shave ever.  (Soundbite of laughter)  BRUCE: \u2026resources that will be out there lying in wait. The only question is, when are we going to find it? I'll take my answer off the air. Thank you.  FLATOW: OK. Thanks for calling. And Steve, you were. . .  Mr. MIRSKY: The anti-matter shaver.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: This holiday season, get one.  Mr. MIRSKY: It's got no blades.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. RAEBURN: Three blades, four blades, no blades.  FLATOW: What was it - what was he talking about in general?  Ms. COLE: I have no idea.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. RAEBURN: But I have an energy story. I don't know that one either but I have an energy story. I wrote a piece for the Columbia Journalism Review blog, called the Observatory, about a week ago. I was at the gym minding my own business on the treadmill and I saw a story on CNN about this company, BlackLight Power\u2026  FLATOW: Right.  Mr. RAEBURN: \u2026in New Jersey.  FLATOW: Right.  Mr. RAEBURN: \u2026claims to produce energy made from water, a form of salt and a few other common materials unspecified. And it's - whatever this means, it's supposed to be 200 times more powerful than gasoline. There was only one problem, as the correspondent said, there's only one problem - this would violate the laws of quantum physics. And she went right on cheerily recounting the rest of the story and how, you know, as if she'd said, you know, there's only one problem - it gets dirt on the bottom of your shoes.  FLATOW: Right. Right.  Mr. RAEBURN: You know, something, so\u2026  FLATOW: Small detail.  Mr. RAEBURN: Yes, small detail. So, anyway, that was from CNN, which has disbanded its science and environmental unit. Do I sound like I'm on a bit of a rant here?  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Well, you know, when we went through cold fusion and all these other energies years ago, you always heard the one - what is the one test for anything in this world on those things and including this is. . .  Mr. MIRSKY: Right. It's the second law.  FLATOW: Well, no. It's actually even cruder than that - is if you're so smart, why ain't you rich?  Mr. RAEBURN: Yeah, right. Exactly. Yeah.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. BEGLEY: Well, but BlackLight has actually been attracting a lot of money. I think they're up to the, at least tens of millions, I've read.  Mr. RAEBURN: Well, they claim to have raised about $60 million and Robert Park, who you may know as a physicist at the University of Maryland who's very - who follows these kinds of things, said the company - here's the quote - \"is dependent on investors with deep pockets and shallow brains. \"  FLATOW: I actually was approached - I was handed a spec sheet by the BlackLight people also. I haven't looked at it yet, but I was a little, you know. And I gave them the question about the rich part and they weren't answering it.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. MIRSKY: But they drive hydrogen electrons into a lower-than-ground state configuration. Is that right?  Mr. RAEBURN: Lower-than-ground state, yes. Hence, the - they misnamed ground state because this is the underground state of hydrogen.  Mr. MIRSKY: Must take a lot of energy to do that.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. RAEBURN: There you go.  Prof. COLE: If we want to talk about, you know, faith-based science and wasted money and bad reporting, I think one of the things highest on the list would be the sort of straight-face reportage of the conflict over putting missile defense sites in Eastern Europe when you don't even hear anymore the fact that the physics community - I mean, it's pretty clear that this stuff does not work. And this was all exposed 20 years ago. I heard - we had a visitor at Annenberg who was referring to this forgetting of reporters to mention this as \"newsheimers,\" but, you know, it almost never is mentioned.  FLATOW: Well, I think that that there's a dearth of science reporters. Science reporters just are a dying breed and people who know how to ask the follow-up question. That's the most important thing - the follow-up question, and it just doesn't get asked very much.  Mr. MIRSKY: Well, you make me think - speaking of movies, I had the misfortune of sitting through Ben Stein's \"Expelled\" twice last - this year. And it brings up - you know, I think, reporters when they ask, it's become popular to ask presidential candidates, do you believe in evolution or do you believe in intelligent design? I would like to see them ask do you know what evolution is? Do you know what it means? Do you know what intelligent design purports to be? And see if they really understand what they're about to try to enact legislation on.  FLATOW: Yeah, we had people diagnosing Terri Schiavo from you know\u2026  Mr. MIRSKY: Right.  FLATOW: \u2026far away places.  Mr. MIRSKY: And he was a Harvard Medical School graduate who derailed his presidential bid with that.  FLATOW: Yeah. 1-800-989-8255. Let's change gears a little bit. Sharon, do you think the Cancer Genome Atlas is going to be helpful to medicine?  Ms. BEGLEY: You know, if it is, more power to it. But the problem with the myriad of things that go wrong in malignant cells is that there are a myriad of them and the Cancer - the Human Cancer Genome Atlas tries to find every single one of those things - every single genetic mutation in liver cancer and kidney cancer and every other kind of cancer that there is. And the question that they're going to be facing is which of these changes are causal? I mean, one of the hallmarks of malignant cells is that their chromosomes are hugely unstable and once one thing starts to go wrong so does everything else. But only a few of those things actually cause the cell to become malignant, to be a cancer. So, it's going to be a huge challenge for bioinformatics and I have to say, you know, it really harks back or is reminiscent of the Human Genome Project, which we're all happy it took place. But, you know, does anyone else think that the salesmanship was a little bit ahead of the reality? I mean, it was great for things like anthropology, but not so much for medicine.  FLATOW: Yeah. Any comments (unintelligible)?  Mr. RAEBURN: Well, it's interesting - I think that's exactly right. It is interesting, though, that this year there was a report that a continuing downturn in cancer deaths and increase in diagnoses and number of new cases declining is now about a 15-year trend. So, this is the kind of thing that may, you know, affect that trend line 15 or 20 years in the future.  FLATOW: Well, that will be interesting to see if at least any life expectancy changes.  Mr. RAEBURN: That's right. Yeah. That's right.  FLATOW: I mean, the downturn in cases diagnosis, but will anybody live any longer?  Mr. RAEBURN: Yeah, yeah. That's right. But it's reasonable to think some effects are coming out to some of this. Go ahead, Sharon.  Ms. BEGLEY: No, I mean, you know, the problem with the war on cancer is that we've been fighting it for - I mean, when did Nixon do his thing? - almost 40 years now. And when you measure success by five-year survival or 10-year survival, you know, one of the concerns is just as Ira said. Are these people actually living longer or is simply the clock starting earlier? Are we diagnosing them earlier? And as you're saying, yeah, for a few cancers, people are indeed living longer and some of them are living until they die of something else, which is exactly where we want cancer to go. But honestly, it's been an awfully lot of decades with very little show for it.  FLATOW: Let me ask you something, Paul. I know you study this - follow it closely - the Mental Health Parity Bill that passed\u2026  Mr. RAEBURN: Yes.  FLATOW: \u2026as part of the bailout. Tell us about that.  Mr. RAEBURN: Yeah. That was - the bailout of the nation's mentally ill\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. RAEBURN: \u2026which you didn't read about. It was actually - we can argue about the, you know, financial and auto bailouts forever.  Mr. MIRSKY: That was the financial bailout.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. RAEBURN: Yeah, that's right. You know, the one good thing that came out of that bailout bill, with no qualification, was a measure that it had been hanging around for 10 years or longer\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah, a long time.  Mr. RAEBURN: \u2026to treat mental illnesses the same way for insurance purposes as other illnesses, so same number of hospital days allowed, same caps on expenditures and so forth. This would seem to me to be sort of a trivially obvious thing. Sick is sick and whether it's the brain or the gut, it's sick. But the politics was very complicated and\u2026  FLATOW: Was it attached to something else?  Mr. RAEBURN: It was a - it was part of the\u2026  FLATOW: We had - William Moyers was on talking about this\u2026.  Mr. RAEBURN: Yeah, it was part of the financial bailout bill - the big bill, the $700 billion bill.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Mr. RAEBURN: And there it was on page 28 or something. And so, it's a huge thing for people and families with mental illness.  FLATOW: And it allows you to get - give us some detail - compensation equal to other kinds of illness.  Mr. RAEBURN: Right. In the past, in many, many insurance plans - I think there's something like a hundred million people who have had this problem and will get a better shake because of this legislation - many plans you got, you know, let's say 100 - up to 100 hospital days a year or whatever it was, you know, that you were allowed and so many doctor's visits and so forth, but all those limits were smaller for mental illnesses. And the only explanation that I can come up with really is that somehow people were thinking these weren't real illnesses or something. But, you know, have a family member with bipolar disorder, as I do, and you lose that notion very quickly.  FLATOW: I have time for one more question before I go to our Science Friday Pick of the Week and let me remind everybody that this is Talk of the Nation: Science Friday from NPR News. And that comes from a Twitter from Power Tripoli (ph), who wants to know, could you elaborate on the earlier conversation about string theory and could the Hadron Collider help prove it? Could it help prove it? K. C. , you have any way. . .  Prof. COLE: Yeah. Oh, absolutely. I'm glad you mentioned that because we were talking about the Large Hadron Collider but we never talked about what it was going to do. One of the really exciting things that could happen that - well, there are a couple in terms of string theory. One is that it's possible that we could see energy disappearing, which might be going into another dimension. So, that might be the first evidence for that. The other thing would be a supersymmetric particle, which is part of string theory. What does that mean? It just means that, you know, the more we look at nature, the more things that seem to be different are actually the same. So, it's possible that every particle has a partner, which have all been given funny names that we haven't found yet. Well, if we find the lightest one of these at LHC, that might be an explanation, or one explanation, of dark matter. And that's really important because that makes up most of the matter in the universe.  FLATOW: All right.  Mr. MIRSKY: I think - you can have supersymmetry without string theory though, can't you?  Prof. COLE: Yes. Yes, you can. Yes, you can. But it would be a confirmation along the way, yeah.  FLATOW: All right. We have to end it here. We all had a good time today, I hope. K. C. Cole, author of \"The Universe and the Teacup: The Mathematics of Truth and Beauty;\" Paul Raeburn, author of \"Acquainted with the Night: A Parent's Quest to Understand Depression and Bipolar Disorder in His Children,\" he also writes the About Fathers blog for Psychology Today; Steve Mirsky, staff editor and writer for Scientific American magazine and host of the Scientific American \"Science Talk\" podcast; Sharon Begley, science columnist for Newsweek. Have a great holiday. Good to see you all again. We'll meet back here a year from now, OK?  Mr. RAEBURN: Same time, same place.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Prof. COLE: Thank you. Take care.

And I'm Renee Montagne, and welcome Linda. LINDA WERTHEIMER, host: Thank you very much.  I'm Linda Wertheimer.  The FBI is preparing to close its case against army scientist Bruce Ivans.  The bureau says Ivans was behind the 2001 anthrax killings.  That case highlighted the sometimes tense relationship between the FBI and the scientific community.  Ivans killed himself; Some of his colleges blamed the FBI for hounding him. The FBI says it needs the help of the scientific community, so the bureau worked with the Federation of American Scientists recently to survey scientists and share the results with NPR.  The survey is the first of its kind. It found the FBI is facing an uphill battle.  David Kestenbaum has our report. DAVID KESTENBAUM:  Imagine you're a scientist working with your test tubes or whatever when a black SUV pulls up.  Men wearing suits with guns on their belts get out, and they want to talk to you.   MICHAEL STEBBINS (Biologist, Federation of American Scientists):  Naturally, when - if you're a scientist and an FBI agent shows up at your door your first response is, of course, going to be - you know, shock and fear. KESTENBAUM:  Michael Stebbins is a biologist with the Federation of American Scientists. He helped plan the survey.  And even though he knows that's probably people's first reaction, he was surprised at the answers some scientists gave in the survey.  Just so you know, the survey was conducted while the anthrax investigation was still going on.   One question asked scientists how they would feel about discussing their research with, say, the general public? No problem, 87 percent said yes. But with law enforcement only about 35 percent said yes, from 87 percent down to 35 percent.  STEBBINS:  So that means that they would rather talk to a total strange from the general public than an FBI agent about their research. KESTENBAUM:  Surprising, given that the FBI agents are supposed to be the good guys. STEBBINS:  To see that so many of them didn't trust the FBI on a fundamental level really showed that there is an uphill battle that the FBI has to face every time they walk in, that the person that they're going to be talking to might not want to talk to them. KESTENBAUM:  The survey tried to find out why scientists felt that way.  Stebbins says the answers indicate a big gulf.  Scientists don't really have a good idea what the FBI actually does. STEBBINS:  There was an unhealthy level of paranoia in the scientific community, where some people in the scientific community felt that the FBI would inhibit their ability to do their work, or would be interested in classifying their research, or would want to read their personal emails. KESTENBAUM:  Which the FBI say it is is not interested in doing.  The survey doesn't show that the FBI is necessarily doing anything wrong.  Stebbins applauds the FBI for doing the survey and agreeing to make the results public. STEBBINS:  And they deserve a tremendous amount of credit. That's an unusual thing to do for a federal agency. KESTENBAUM:  The FBI did want to talk about the results, and when you go to FBI headquarters you can see why first-time visitors might be a little nervous.  The guards at the front desk sit behind super thick bullet-proof glass.  Then you walk through turnstiles that look like Star Trek teleporters, but inside are offices with normal-looking cubicles. Daniel Cloyd is Assistant Director for Counterintelligence at the FBI.  He had so many points he wanted to make he'd written them down and put them in a binder to read.  I think the take-home message to scientists with reservations is, get to know us. We need your help, and we're not what you think. Mr. DANIEL CLOYD (Assistant Director, FBI Counterintelligence):  Public perceptions of the FBI too often constitute only a pale reflection of reality. KESTENBAUM:  Do you actually feel misunderstood a lot of the time? Mr. CLOYD:  If you watch television, or if you see too many movies, in movies we either are supermen and women who can do no wrong, or else we're seen as stumbling and bumbling fools and as people who can do nothing right. KESTENBAUM:  If scientists are maybe overly critical of the FBI, it's also true that the FBI makes mistakes.  In the anthrax investigation, it initially focused on bio-weapons expert Steven Hatfill.  Hatfill later sued saying the security had ruined his life and won a $5. 8 million settlement. So it may be incidents like that that make some scientists nervous.  Vahid Majidi is the Assistant Director of Weapons of Mass Destruction at the FBI, but he used to be a chemistry professor.  He says the survey results, in some respects, are not a surprise. Polls of the general public show similar results. Mr. VAHID MAJIDI (Assistant Director, Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate, FBI):  What was a little bit frustrating for me is that the survey went out to roughly about 11,000 people, and only about 10 percent of the individuals that received the survey responded back. KESTENBAUM:  The FBI is working on ways to reach out to scientists, but there may always be some tension.  In the anthrax case, scientists helped the FBI trace the spores.  They were collaborators, but they were also, of course, possible suspects.  David Kestenbaum.  NPR News.  RENEE MONTAGNE, host:  This is Morning Edition from NPR News.
