The companies that make products such as Campbell's Soup, Gillette razors, Crest toothpaste and Dove soap are going through major corporate changes, restructuring and hiring new CEOs. NPR's Alina Selyukh reports these mainstream brands are facing the challenge of adjusting to new shopping habits. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: Think about the last time you went to the supermarket. You probably spent no more than a few seconds choosing from all the different brands of toothpaste or frozen peas or oatmeal. In retail, this is called, dramatically, the first moment of truth. For brands, these few seconds used to be their Holy grail, but in the past decade, shoppers started saying they'd go by other things. JULIET MCFADDEN: Usually by what's cheapest. Like, I'm not a brand person. SELYUKH: That's Juliet McFadden. She's an office manager in Boston, and she's 23. She's just starting to build her finances and lifelong shopping habits. This makes her a huge target for companies like Procter & Gamble, Kraft Heinz or General Mills, but she is not easy to win over. MCFADDEN: I'm not a cereal person. I just usually don't eat breakfast. I don't really drink soda ever. I don't like the yogurts with a ton of sugar in them that are super sweet. Paper towels are expensive. Stuff like that adds up. We have reusable, like, rags that we use and then wash. SELYUKH: McFadden's generation often gets the blame here, the tired trope about millennials killing breakfast cereals or napkins or canned tuna. But really, most Americans could make a similar list. Maybe you choose the store brand of toilet paper, buy a fancier condiment instead of Hellmann's mayo, order eco-friendly diapers on the Internet. Here's David Luttenberger of market research firm Mintel. DAVID LUTTENBERGER: Rather than just relying on brand familiarity, consumers buy today what performs for them. They are much less brand loyal, and they are more driven by performance, by convenience, by price. SELYUKH: At least two major things have changed us as shoppers. During the last recession, Americans warmed up to cheaper off-brand products like generic or store brands, and then they kept buying them even as the economy improved. And, of course, the Internet has completely shaken up our shopping. Think about how people used to learn about new brands.

(SOUNDBITE OF AD)UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: (Singing) 'Cause if I were an Oscar Meyer wiener, everyone would be in love with me. SELYUKH: And so the boomer generation of shoppers grew up reaching for classic American brands. Now, Campbell's Soup, that symbol of the postwar era of processed foods, is restructuring as Americans are demanding fresher foods with pronounceable ingredients. Kraft Heinz got rid of artificial preservatives and dyes from its mac and cheese. Procter & Gamble lowered the price of Gillette razors for the first time in years to compete with the online startups like Dollar Shave Club. Unilever bought that startup, Dollar Shave Club. The mainstream brands are being squeezed by rivals that are both cheaper and more personalized. AMERICUS REED: They're in a bit of a pickle. SELYUKH: Americus Reed is a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. He says legacy brands have to both stay true for the older, loyal customers but also attract new shoppers. REED: It is a big challenge to reinvent yourself over and over again, right? You look at just, like, in the music industry, very few artists can continue being successful in the sophomore and junior album. You know, you have iconic artists like Madonna who can just reinvent herself every single time and speak to new audiences. SELYUKH: But it is extremely hard to do when you're not Madonna, you're Campbell's Soup. Alina Selyukh, NPR News.

Around Los Angeles, where about 50,000 men and women live on the streets, some residents struggle to maintain their empathy. Anna Scott from member station KCRW has the story. ANNA SCOTT, BYLINE: For the past few years, a man has been living in the carport of Shannon Peace's building near West Hollywood. SHANNON PEACE: I would pull in, and he would be laying, like, right there. . . SCOTT: She was a little uncomfortable at first, but eventually thought of him as an unofficial neighbor. Until one morning, she came downstairs. . . PEACE: And his eyes were glazed over, and he was muttering to himself. And that was the point at which I went, OK, this is somebody who potentially has mental illness, potentially has a substance abuse problem. SCOTT: She called the cops, but the man still sleeps in front of Peace's car on and off. She says the experience has made her more wary of homeless people in general. PEACE: And it's not that I don't have empathy anymore. But when it comes to your own feelings of safety, need for boundaries, suddenly, it influences the way you view the entire issue. And unfortunately, it can influence the way you view individuals. SCOTT: Two years ago, LA voters overwhelmingly passed Measure HHH, a city bond to fund homeless housing, which it's doing, but tens of thousands of men and women still sleep on the streets which means residents confront the crisis constantly. In some parts of the region, anger over perceived danger has led to explosive town halls, hateful social media posts and even one citizen patrol to monitor encampments. Other times, there's a quieter-but-still-uneasy coexistence like at this park in West LA. FILIPE CALDERON: I haven't showered in about a month, so I don't feel good. SCOTT: Filipe Calderon is one of about a half-dozen homeless men here today, and he's spread his belongings across a picnic table. He used to have a carpentry business, but he lost it to drinking. CALDERON: Once you lose the job, you lose everything - the wife, even the kids. SCOTT: He still drinks but wants to stop. CALDERON: I'm going to try this year, you know. This is one of my goals. If I stop, I'm going to get back on my feet again. SCOTT: It's easy to feel for the financial victim or the person who ended up homeless after a health crisis, harder to feel for someone you think is doing something wrong like the guy hiding a beer cooler near a busy playground. ANN ENGLISH: That isn't the entire story of that person. SCOTT: Ann English works at the nonprofit Corporation for Supportive Housing. She directs a program training formerly homeless men and women to share their stories at community events. She says it's about getting the public to see people who need help, rather than people to avoid. ENGLISH: If they recognize someone who is having difficulties as someone that could be them, they are going to connect with that. And that is what moves people to action. ERIC GARCETTI: Because a very complex problem didn't go away overnight doesn't mean that things aren't happening. ENGLISH: LA Mayor Eric Garcetti says the city is housing more people than ever before, but it's not enough to keep up with all the people falling into homelessness. So the situation on the streets hasn't changed much. Still, Garcetti says, he does not see an empathy gap among LA residents. GARCETTI: Every time I go to a volunteer event, there's more and more people. They still need a lot of help in their neighborhoods, but they're feeling that what they voted for is starting to come to fruition.

Economists don't expect to see long-lasting fallout so long as the shutdown ends soon, but the U. S. was already facing an economic slowdown, as NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Two Sisters Deli in downtown Washington ordinarily does a brisk business selling breakfast muffins and deli sandwiches to workers from the nearby federal agencies but not this week. HEEJIN KIM: Empty, empty. HORSLEY: Manager Heejin Kim got more bad news today when the Smithsonian's popular Air and Space Museum shuttered its doors a block away. KIM: Oh, my God, not even half business, not even half a sale because there's no tourists, either. HORSLEY: Even though there's little traffic, Kim's reluctant to cut back on staff. She knows her workers have their own bills to pay. Museums will reopen when the shutdown ends, and federal workers will be back on the job. But they aren't likely to make up for all the meals and Metro rides they missed during the shutdown. Some of that money is gone for good, but it's not enough to derail a $20 trillion economy. NARIMAN BEHRAVESH: This is tiny. HORSLEY: Nariman Behravesh is chief economist for the forecasting firm IHS Markit. BEHRAVESH: The economic impact is going to be fairly small. Now, obviously there's a big political to-do about this having to do with a wall and so forth. But the economic impacts will be barely noticeable. HORSLEY: But even before the shutdown, economists had noticed a slowdown in U. S. economic growth from an annual rate of more than 4 percent in the second quarter of last year to somewhere around 3 percent in the quarter that just ended. Behravesh expects that gradual slowdown will continue in 2019 and beyond as the effects of the GOP tax cut and increased government spending wear off. BEHRAVESH: We think the potency, if you will, of the stimulus is beginning to fade a little bit, but we still expect decent growth. By 2020, we've got growth all the way back down, a trend of around 2 percent, maybe even a little lower because the stimulus is gone at that point. HORSLEY: Many private economists share that cautious view. Goldman Sachs just revised its forecast for economic growth in the coming year down to 2 percent or less. The Trump administration's forecast is a good deal rosier. White House economist Kevin Hassett expects growth to hold steady at around 3 percent in the coming year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KEVIN HASSETT: All the anecdotal information we're getting is that the fundamentals remain extremely sound, that Christmas sales are through the roof. GDP in the fourth quarter is looking like it's going to be very close to, if not above three again. HORSLEY: Unemployment is low, and wages are rising, but consumer confidence took a hit last month as the stock market wrapped up its worst year in a decade. Administration officials boast the U. S. is still outperforming much of the rest of the world, but David Dollar of the Brookings Institution warns ripple effects from slower growth overseas could eventually wash ashore in this country. DAVID DOLLAR: We're living in a world where if China seriously slows down, that's going to have a big effect on literally more than a hundred different economies. And then of course that affects the whole world. HORSLEY: Growth in China is slowing partly as a result of deliberate policies in Beijing but also as a result of the U. S. trade war. The administration is threatening to impose even-bigger tariffs on Chinese imports if no agreement's reached in the next couple of months. Dollar says the fallout is hard to predict. DOLLAR: That's where a lot of the market uncertainty comes from. You could imagine an escalating trade war, or you could imagine a big announced deal between the U. S. and China that would be good for global growth and that would be calming for markets. HORSLEY: The U. S. trade deficit has been rising despite Trump's tariffs, but the magnitude is not clear.

Minimum wage increased in 20 states and 21 cities. And while that sounds like good news, it may still not be enough. In most cases, a huge gap still exists between the amount of money that minimum wage workers make and what they need to live. To discuss this is David Cooper. He's a senior analyst at the Economic Policy Institute. Welcome to the studio. DAVID COOPER: Thanks for having me, Audie. CORNISH: So can you give us more detail on these minimum wage changes? What's happening where? COOPER: Sure. So these are increases - anything from a 5-cent increase in Alaska to a $2 an hour increase in New York City. And these raises are going to lift the wages of about 5. 3 million workers across the country. CORNISH: You mentioned a range there in terms of the states. Some of the states just had a cost of living adjustment, right? COOPER: That's right. There's about eight states where the minimum wage went up simply because there's automatic adjustment built into the law. So each year, however much prices have gone up over the preceding year, the minimum wage is automatically adjusted to account for that increase in prices. In the other states, we had about six where the minimum wage - the new minimum wage was set by the state legislature, or legislation was passed that established this new minimum wage. And then in the final six, those were the results of ballot increases. So in other words, voters directly at the ballot box chose to raise their state minimum wage to this new level. CORNISH: So some research originally found that increasing the minimum wage could lead to job loss - right? - business owners saying, we can't afford to pay this. COOPER: Yeah. CORNISH: We're going to let some people go. New research appears to be saying the opposite. What's the conventional wisdom at this point? COOPER: So at this point, economists generally think that the minimum wage's impact on jobs is fairly small to the point where it's probably going to be economically not that meaningful on the grand scheme of things. The second piece that's important to recognize is that economics research on the minimum wage has gotten a lot more sophisticated about asking, what's the impact on the welfare of low-wage workers, because it may be that a minimum wage increase leads to a reduction in job growth. But for a low-wage worker who only works a portion of the year, that may still mean that at the end of the year, they're on net just as well off as they were before because for the weeks or the hours that they're working, they're earning a significantly higher wage than they would have otherwise. CORNISH: So you talk about the idea that economists' thinking has changed in some ways. There still is a lot of resistance to raising the minimum wage. COOPER: Yes. CORNISH: What's driving it? COOPER: There's a certain group of folks who think that the government simply shouldn't have a say in what businesses choose to pay their workers - that it's purely a libertarian argument that government shouldn't set standards around wages. Then there's another component of folks who are genuinely concerned about the increase in labor costs that would come from a higher minimum wage because that money does need to come from somewhere, and it is possible that, in some cases, businesses will adjust by having to reduce profits. And business owners don't want to have to do that. But, you know, to those folks, I would say that in some ways, a minimum wage increase is the most advantageous way that you can raise your wages for your low-wage workers because at the same time that you're doing it, all of your competitors are facing those additional labor costs as well. CORNISH: What does it mean, at this point, to be making a living wage? COOPER: Yeah. CORNISH: Are there places where the minimum wage is actually a so-called living wage? COOPER: Yeah. So when the minimum wage was first established back in the 1930s, it was intended to be a living wage. The problem is that over the years, we've raised the federal minimum wage so infrequently and so inadequately that the gap between where it is today and where it would need to be to be a living wage is enormous. CORNISH: Is there a sense of what it would need to be to close that gap, in general? COOPER: We have a tool at the Economic Policy Institute called the Family Budget Calculator. And that will actually tell you what it takes to have what we would consider a modest but adequate standard of living in pretty much any jurisdiction in the country. And if you look at that tool, what you find is that even someone working full-time full year is probably going to need more than even $15 an hour basically anywhere in the country over the next few years. CORNISH: In the meantime, there is new leadership in Congress - in the House, especially. Do you expect to see new efforts to raise the federal minimum wage, right? As you said, it's been at 7. 25 for the past decade. COOPER: I think we can expect that a federal minimum wage bill is likely to be one of the first pieces of legislation that the House Democrats introduce. It could be one of the first ones they try to have a vote on because the minimum wage is so popular nationally. CORNISH: David Cooper is senior analyst at the Economic Policy Institute. Thanks for coming in. COOPER: Yeah. My pleasure. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:   Millions of American workers celebrated the new year with a pay raise. Minimum wage increased in 20 states and 21 cities.

To discuss this is David Cooper. He's a senior analyst at the Economic Policy Institute. Welcome to the studio. DAVID COOPER: Thanks for having me, Audie. CORNISH: So can you give us more detail on these minimum wage changes? What's happening where? COOPER: Sure. So these are increases - anything from a 5-cent increase in Alaska to a $2 an hour increase in New York City. And these raises are going to lift the wages of about 5. 3 million workers across the country. CORNISH: You mentioned a range there in terms of the states. Some of the states just had a cost of living adjustment, right? COOPER: That's right. There's about eight states where the minimum wage went up simply because there's automatic adjustment built into the law. So each year, however much prices have gone up over the preceding year, the minimum wage is automatically adjusted to account for that increase in prices. In the other states, we had about six where the minimum wage - the new minimum wage was set by the state legislature, or legislation was passed that established this new minimum wage. And then in the final six, those were the results of ballot increases. So in other words, voters directly at the ballot box chose to raise their state minimum wage to this new level. CORNISH: So some research originally found that increasing the minimum wage could lead to job loss - right? - business owners saying, we can't afford to pay this. COOPER: Yeah. CORNISH: We're going to let some people go. New research appears to be saying the opposite. What's the conventional wisdom at this point? COOPER: So at this point, economists generally think that the minimum wage's impact on jobs is fairly small to the point where it's probably going to be economically not that meaningful on the grand scheme of things. The second piece that's important to recognize is that economics research on the minimum wage has gotten a lot more sophisticated about asking, what's the impact on the welfare of low-wage workers, because it may be that a minimum wage increase leads to a reduction in job growth. But for a low-wage worker who only works a portion of the year, that may still mean that at the end of the year, they're on net just as well off as they were before because for the weeks or the hours that they're working, they're earning a significantly higher wage than they would have otherwise. CORNISH: So you talk about the idea that economists' thinking has changed in some ways. There still is a lot of resistance to raising the minimum wage. COOPER: Yes. CORNISH: What's driving it? COOPER: There's a certain group of folks who think that the government simply shouldn't have a say in what businesses choose to pay their workers - that it's purely a libertarian argument that government shouldn't set standards around wages. Then there's another component of folks who are genuinely concerned about the increase in labor costs that would come from a higher minimum wage because that money does need to come from somewhere, and it is possible that, in some cases, businesses will adjust by having to reduce profits. And business owners don't want to have to do that. But, you know, to those folks, I would say that in some ways, a minimum wage increase is the most advantageous way that you can raise your wages for your low-wage workers because at the same time that you're doing it, all of your competitors are facing those additional labor costs as well. CORNISH: What does it mean, at this point, to be making a living wage? COOPER: Yeah. CORNISH: Are there places where the minimum wage is actually a so-called living wage? COOPER: Yeah. So when the minimum wage was first established back in the 1930s, it was intended to be a living wage. The problem is that over the years, we've raised the federal minimum wage so infrequently and so inadequately that the gap between where it is today and where it would need to be to be a living wage is enormous. CORNISH: Is there a sense of what it would need to be to close that gap, in general? COOPER: We have a tool at the Economic Policy Institute called the Family Budget Calculator. And that will actually tell you what it takes to have what we would consider a modest but adequate standard of living in pretty much any jurisdiction in the country. And if you look at that tool, what you find is that even someone working full-time full year is probably going to need more than even $15 an hour basically anywhere in the country over the next few years. CORNISH: In the meantime, there is new leadership in Congress - in the House, especially. Do you expect to see new efforts to raise the federal minimum wage, right? As you said, it's been at 7. 25 for the past decade. COOPER: I think we can expect that a federal minimum wage bill is likely to be one of the first pieces of legislation that the House Democrats introduce. It could be one of the first ones they try to have a vote on because the minimum wage is so popular nationally. CORNISH: David Cooper is senior analyst at the Economic Policy Institute.

The Freelancers Hub is what it's called. It offers classes and shared office space, along with tax and legal advice for free - skills that freelancers say they don't get from a traditional education. Here's NPR's Yuki Noguchi. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Nicholas Mc Millian (ph) was a successful firefighter with a secure job in Trinidad and Tobago, but his passion was moviemaking. So he left it behind to study film production in New York City. Then when he started freelancing three years ago, Mc Millian found his education left lots of practical gaps. NICHOLAS MC MILLIAN: They don't really prepare you for a career. They don't really say, all right, this is how you go out there and make money and support yourself. NOGUCHI: Film school didn't teach Mc Millian how to create websites, set prices or write and negotiate contracts. Therein lies a growing disconnect between today's education system and the training freelancers actually need. The labor market is rapidly changing, thanks in part to growth in apps that make gig work easy to find. But workers on contract also don't have employer-provided benefits or on-the-job training. And this is of particular concern to New York City, which estimates freelancers make up nearly 40 percent of its workforce. Julie Menin is New York City Commissioner for Media and Entertainment. JULIE MENIN: That's a number that's going to continue to rise with the growth and advent of on-demand apps and other structural changes in the economy. NOGUCHI: To address this training shortfall, in October, the city partnered with the Freelancers Union to open the Freelancers Hub. It's targeted primarily at those in creative fields, where work is especially competitive - design, film, photography and writing. The hub is located in Brooklyn, alongside the Independent Filmmaker Project. About two-dozen workers sit at rows of desks, couches and small tables. Members can also access a small theater and classrooms. Its classes explain benefits, or stress management, its most popular. All of it, free of charge. Caitlin Pearce is executive director of the Freelancers Union. She says freelancers need to know how to do it all - budget for taxes and health insurance, and manage workflow and attract clients. And that's not all. CAITLIN PEARCE: How do I brand myself? What business structure should look like. How do I actually plan for success? How much income do I need to earn? NOGUCHI: Since it opened in October, 4,000 people have joined the hub. Its regulars include software engineer Lupe Canaviri Maydana, a Bolivian native who hopes to start freelancing next month. Maydana has sought advice on work visas, legal contracts and business cards. More critically, she says the hub has helped combat her fears of working solo. She's made contacts with other freelancers, from artists to musicians and fashion models. LUPE CANAVIRI MAYDANA: Getting to know that kind of people and the way they do their freelancing. So it's kind of a new world. NOGUCHI: Pearce says the Freelancers Union wants to make its lectures available online, but it also wants the physical space to foster networking and friendship among freelancers. PEARCE: Because the concept is really about finding the expertise and the resources that exist within the community already, and really tapping into it and bringing it into one central place. NOGUCHI: All of the training classes, for example, are taught by other freelancers. That includes Brian Lee, who taught a digital marketing workshop one recent evening. BRIAN LEE: Both of them, they used to be freelancers. One. . . NOGUCHI: The room is packed with people from a huge demographic range. Lee begins by telling them, start thinking of yourself as a business. LEE: Freelancers don't want to spend money, even if it's software or tech that can help them grow their business. I think that's a fundamental shift that we have to make because businesses grow by investing. NOGUCHI: New York is not alone in identifying the need for workforce training targeted at freelancers and gig workers. The city of San Francisco offers online training courses for freelancers. Several companies, including General Assembly, LinkedIn and Skillshare, offer similar courses for far cheaper than a conventional college course. But members say the main benefits of the Freelancers Hub have been social. Wendy Zhao, a film producer, says being around other freelancers helps her navigate the stress of lean times when paid work isn't available. WENDY ZHAO: I could do so much during this time instead of just being sad and lonely and desperate and depressed. Like, I can learn more things. I can write. I can practice. NOGUCHI: And that, she says, will hopefully lead to more work. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, New York.

S. border is still a long way from reality and may never become one. If it were built, it would be a project of enormous scale and a boon to the American steel industry. President Trump is a fan of Big Steel, and his trade policies have benefited some of the largest steel producers. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: President Trump says one of the advantages of building his border wall would be its impact on U. S. companies that manufacture steel. Here he was Friday at the White House. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And here's the other good thing. I'll have it done by the United States Steel Corporation, by companies in our country that are now powerful, great companies again. And they've become powerful over the last two years because of me and because of our trade policies. ZARROLI: Trump has spoken for years about the importance of a strong domestic steel industry. He has said that without one, you don't have a country. He has talked about unfair trade practices by other steel-producing countries. Dan Ikenson, director of trade policy studies at the Cato Institute, says Trump often goes to bat for the American steel industry. DAN IKENSON: His administration is loaded with former steel executives and former steel trade attorneys. And that was a priority of his to impose duties on steel to help them be able to raise the prices and produce more. ZARROLI: Trump has sometimes claimed that as a result of his trade policies, seven new steel mills are being built in the United States. That's not true, but there is at least one new plant being built, and some others are being upgraded. There is little question that because of the tariffs on steel imports that Trump imposed last year, Big Steel companies like Nucor and U. S. Steel have seen their profits rise. Scott Paul heads the Alliance for American Manufacturing. SCOTT PAUL: No matter which metric you look at, the steel industry is unquestionably doing better than it has been for the past couple of years. ZARROLI: Because of the tariffs, imported steel is more expensive, and domestic suppliers no longer face much pressure to keep their prices low. But higher prices have also hurt a lot of manufacturers of numerous other products, including many in major industries like autos and housing. Again, Dan Ikenson. IKENSON: The problem, of course, is that as you lend a hand to particular producers - producers of upstream products like steel - you raise the costs of production for steel-consuming industries and steel-consuming firms. ZARROLI: Companies can ask for an exemption from the tariffs, but the Commerce Department has been slow to grant them. Meanwhile, prices continue to creep up. Steel industry officials acknowledge that some manufacturers are being hurt by price increases, but they say the increases for most are insignificant. Here was U. S. Steel CEO David Burritt in an interview on Fox Business channel last month. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DAVID BURRITT: If you look at the total increase in that price, it's really not substantial. For an automobile, for example, the average cost of car - $30,000. The steel in that is around a thousand dollars. It's not a big number. ZARROLI: But President Trump has repeatedly said that steel is at the heart of a robust American economy. It's a view that's not widely shared by economists. They say the benefits of tariffs to steel companies aren't worth the price being paid by other manufacturers. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York.

There are federal workers who are furloughed, not being paid. There are federal workers who must work and are also not being paid. They may get back pay eventually once a deal is reached, but then there are contract workers who have little chance to collect back pay for the work they're missing. NPR's David Welna has the story. DAVID WELNA, BYLINE: Sixty-two-year-old Greg Seymour is an archaeologist who works in the Great Basin National Park that spreads across the Nevada-Utah border. He's employed by a company that's a contractor with the National Park Service, but he's not working. GREG SEYMOUR: It's been a couple of weeks now. I actually feel stabbed in the back. It's kind of depressing, actually. WELNA: And because he's not billing any hours, Seymour does not expect to get any back pay whenever the shutdown ends. SEYMOUR: I was going to buy a truck - a brand new truck. That is on, possibly, permanent hold now because I don't feel like I can trust the economy - my economy, especially. So I'm just going to live with what I have. WELNA: Seymour did not apply for unemployment insurance when he was first furloughed. He considered it a pittance, but he intends to do so today. SEYMOUR: And I'm not really sure it's worthwhile. I've never done that before, so that would be a new experience for me. And frankly, I really don't want to collect unemployment. But if I have to, I will. WELNA: And so, too, are many other federal contract employees. New York University's Paul Light is a leading expert on the federal workforce. He says there's been scant public awareness of the contract workers' plight during shutdowns. That's because unlike federal employees, there is no systematic tracking of those contract workers. What is known is there is a lot of them. PAUL LIGHT: I estimate that we have about 4. 1 million contract employees - full-time equivalent. So we've got a very large federal workforce with a majority of employees who are not on Uncle Sam's direct payroll. They are part of the indirect workforce. WELNA: And yet, they've been directly affected. JOE PINNETTI: I did not think the national politics would be affecting my role as an IT specialist at United States Fish and Wildlife. WELNA: That's 33-year-old Joe Pinnetti. Normally, he gets $22 an hour working for a company in Western Massachusetts that contracts with the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. But he has not worked at all since the shutdown began and does not expect to recover his lost income. PINNETTI: When you're a contractor, it's understand that there's a certain amount of risk taken with your job. So I don't think that the federal government will see it as something that they need to compensate us for. WELNA: Pinnetti lives alone, and he's already begun collecting unemployment insurance. Hopes of finishing a college degree have been put on hold by the shutdown. PINNETTI: It's going to be rough. I'm digging deep into my savings right now. I would remain solvent for about two more months. The problem is I'm already having to sacrifice things to do so. I mean, this showdown has costs. So I might have to take a semester off from school to rebuild my savings. WELNA: Pinnetti expects to still have a job whenever the shutdown ends, but NYU's Light says it's a different matter for those employed by smaller contractors. LIGHT: And that's where you would expect to see some pretty significant impacts of even a two-week shutdown - even a week shutdown because the smaller the business, the more likely it is to lay off workers at the first sign that there might be a delay in payment. WELNA: Take, for example, Celeste Voigt. CELESTE VOIGT: I have four people who, besides myself, are out of work. WELNA: Voigt, who's legally blind, has a vending concession to sell hot meals at two federal workplaces in South Dakota. She and all four of her employees have been idled by the shutdown. And she fears they'll be forced to find work elsewhere. Congress, she says, should do something about that. VOIGT: I think they should reimburse me as a business so that I can pay my employees because I cannot buy insurance, like anybody else, if - this is not a natural disaster. It isn't because I am not responsible enough to run a business or I've done something wrong. It's like I'm getting punished because I'm working, trying to help provide for the government workers that are in the building. WELNA: According to President Trump, people like Celeste Voigt, who've been idled by the shutdown, may be getting something else - a wall along the Mexican border. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Many of those workers have said to me and communicated stay out until you get the funding for the wall. These federal workers want the wall. VOIGT: I don't know who he's talking to (laughter). So what am I going to say about that? WELNA: Again, small federal contractor Celeste Voigt. VOIGT: Apparently he doesn't understand anytime there's a government shutdown, whatever the reason, it's not appropriate. I guess we're holding ourselves hostage. That's how I feel (laughter). WELNA: By we, Voigt says she means the entire nation. But she and the thousands of other furloughed federal contractors may be paying the greatest price as this shutdown continues. David Welna, NPR News, Washington. (SOUNDBITE OF ABE'S \"ASGARD\") STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Several kinds of people are directly affected by the partial government shutdown.

WELNA: That's 33-year-old Joe Pinnetti. Normally, he gets $22 an hour working for a company in Western Massachusetts that contracts with the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. But he has not worked at all since the shutdown began and does not expect to recover his lost income. PINNETTI: When you're a contractor, it's understand that there's a certain amount of risk taken with your job. So I don't think that the federal government will see it as something that they need to compensate us for. WELNA: Pinnetti lives alone, and he's already begun collecting unemployment insurance. Hopes of finishing a college degree have been put on hold by the shutdown. PINNETTI: It's going to be rough. I'm digging deep into my savings right now. I would remain solvent for about two more months. The problem is I'm already having to sacrifice things to do so. I mean, this showdown has costs. So I might have to take a semester off from school to rebuild my savings. WELNA: Pinnetti expects to still have a job whenever the shutdown ends, but NYU's Light says it's a different matter for those employed by smaller contractors. LIGHT: And that's where you would expect to see some pretty significant impacts of even a two-week shutdown - even a week shutdown because the smaller the business, the more likely it is to lay off workers at the first sign that there might be a delay in payment. WELNA: Take, for example, Celeste Voigt. CELESTE VOIGT: I have four people who, besides myself, are out of work. WELNA: Voigt, who's legally blind, has a vending concession to sell hot meals at two federal workplaces in South Dakota. She and all four of her employees have been idled by the shutdown. And she fears they'll be forced to find work elsewhere. Congress, she says, should do something about that. VOIGT: I think they should reimburse me as a business so that I can pay my employees because I cannot buy insurance, like anybody else, if - this is not a natural disaster. It isn't because I am not responsible enough to run a business or I've done something wrong. It's like I'm getting punished because I'm working, trying to help provide for the government workers that are in the building. WELNA: According to President Trump, people like Celeste Voigt, who've been idled by the shutdown, may be getting something else - a wall along the Mexican border. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Many of those workers have said to me and communicated stay out until you get the funding for the wall. These federal workers want the wall. VOIGT: I don't know who he's talking to (laughter). So what am I going to say about that? WELNA: Again, small federal contractor Celeste Voigt. VOIGT: Apparently he doesn't understand anytime there's a government shutdown, whatever the reason, it's not appropriate. I guess we're holding ourselves hostage. That's how I feel (laughter). WELNA: By we, Voigt says she means the entire nation. But she and the thousands of other furloughed federal contractors may be paying the greatest price as this shutdown continues.

Well, it soon might be the partial government shutdown that is disrupting travel. New planes are not being certified to fly. Security screeners and air traffic controllers are working unpaid. Here's more from NPR's David Schaper in Chicago. DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: I'm here at Chicago's O'Hare Airport standing next to one of the large CT-80 scanners. It's essentially a CT scanner for your checked luggage. And the TSA officers who operate this machine, they're here at work lifting the heavy and sometimes odd shaped and overstuffed bags onto the conveyor belt to go through the machine even though come this Friday, if the shutdown continues, they won't get paid. And that presents a severe financial hardship for many of these officers. CHRISTINE VITEL: I've been here 16 years plus. I am a single mom. SCHAPER: Christine Vitel is a security screener at O'Hare with a son in college, and she's trying to figure out how she'll pay his tuition. And. . . VITEL: I just bought a house. I'm not going to be able to pay my mortgage. JANIS CASEY: A lot of the officers, they live paycheck to paycheck. SCHAPER: Janis Casey is president of the Union Local representing TSA employees in Chicago. And she notes that they are among the lowest paid federal employees. Some average $36,000 to $43,000 a year, but start only in the mid-20s. And for some TSA workers and their families, the situation could get dire rather quickly. JACINDA: If there's no check on the 26, I have no idea what we're going to do. SCHAPER: Thirty-six-year-old Jacinda's husband is a TSA officer in Portland. We're not using her last name because she fears he could be fired. They have two kids, a 6-month-old girl and a boy turning 4 at the end of this month. Jacinda says they were planning to buy a few presents and decorations to celebrate, but now they can't. JACINDA: Our rent is due. The electric bill is due. Our cellphones are now past due. SCHAPER: Jacinda says her husband's hiring by the TSA three years ago helped lift the family out of poverty. Now she fears the shutdown will set them back. JACINDA: I'm scared. And I'm trying to be OK because I can't be sad every day for my kids and I can't be stressed out because it effects how I parent. You know, my husband's stressed out too, and he has to go to work and deal with it at work. And, you know, he knows he's working for free, which is ridiculous. SCHAPER: Even more ridiculous, Jacinda says, is that he came home the other day with instructions on how to file for unemployment while he's still working 40 hours a week. And the situation is not much better for higher paid essential government workers like air traffic controllers. MICK DEVINE: It's a very high-stress job, and you need to be on your game at all times. SCHAPER: Mick Devine is with the National Air Traffic Controllers Association in Boston. And he says the shutdown is forcing controllers to make tough financial decisions, and it weighs on them heavily. DEVINE: There is a concern that as this goes on that the human factors aspect of this shutdown will take a toll on the psyche and the concentration level of our members. And they do the best job that they can each and every day. SCHAPER: Nearly 20 percent of the FAA's 10,000 air traffic controllers are eligible to retire, and union leaders say some might do that rather than continue to work during the shutdown. There are also concerns that many of the nation's 51,000 TSA employees will quit and find work elsewhere rather than continue to work without pay. Already, a greater number than usual have been calling in sick, and only some FAA safety inspectors are working right now. DENNIS TAJER: We're starting to see the beginning tremors of a situation that will only get worse over time. SCHAPER: Captain Dennis Tajer is a pilot for American Airlines and a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association. He says many planes are not being inspected, and pilot training is not being certified. TAJER: We are able to maintain a margin of safety and security, but every day, another player is pulled off the field. And there comes some point where the game cannot be played properly. SCHAPER: Back at O'Hare, air travelers are expressing concerns, too. Here's Ericka Westgard (ph) of Indialantic, Fla. ERICKA WESTGARD: If TSA is affected and lines do get longer, work could get sloppier. They might not be checking things as well, and that's always a concern for safety. SCHAPER: But Ray Ortiz, who just arrived on a business trip from New York, says he hasn't seen any ill effects from the shutdown yet. RAY ORTIZ: I flew out of JFK today. Like, I actually showed up early because I thought the wait times might be very long, but it was actually really short today. SCHAPER: Nonetheless, Ortiz and other air travelers and industry insiders worry that as the shutdown continues, there could be a tipping point where safety and security could be compromised or operations could slow in a commercial aviation system already plagued by delays.

Here's one example. Some furloughed workers can't refinance their mortgages or buy homes because lenders can't verify their income right now. And as NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports, even those who aren't federal employees are getting stuck in limbo. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Libby Anderson's (ph) divorce finalized this week. She'd hoped her ex-husband would finally move out of their Des Moines home, where they'd been living separate lives under one roof. LIBBY ANDERSON: It was going to be, you know, as soon as today. I mean, we were really going to take care of it today, the day after it was final. And then he would be out. NOGUCHI: But, no. Her ex is a furloughed air traffic controller. The shutdown means he can't split his assets with her, including his government retirement account. She needs those funds to refinance the house under her name. Also, he can't qualify for his own mortgage because he hasn't been paid for three weeks. The government stalemate also means they haven't explained the pending change to their young son. ANDERSON: In a 4-year-old's head, you can't say, you know, Mom and Dad are going to be living in different places, and then you say, well, when, where? And we don't have those answers yet. NOGUCHI: As the shutdown drags on, more people will find themselves facing similar roadblocks. Refinance applications are booming as mortgage rates fell nearly half a percentage point in recent weeks. But furloughed workers can't lock those rates in. Anyone looking to buy or refinance may have a harder time getting through to federal agencies to verify income taxes or get some loan information from the Federal Housing Administration, which remains closed. Rural home loans guaranteed through the Department of Agriculture are on hold, too. Margie Hofberg is president of the Residential Mortgage Center. She says her Rockville, Md. , business will likely see a ripple effect. MARGIE HOFBERG: This is going to be a house of cards because if I can't close and buy your house then guess what? You can't buy the house that you were buying, even though you don't work for the federal government. NOGUCHI: Two deals nearly fell through this week, but Hofberg persuaded the lenders to waive certain paperwork. She says banks' strict requirements of borrowers create many potential snags. HOFBERG: My hope would be that the lenders start becoming a little bit more flexible because it's not in their best interest to not do loans, either. NOGUCHI: There's some precedent for these problems. During the 2013 shutdown, 2 percent of home loans never closed, according to the National Association of Realtors. But that one lasted only 16 days. LAWRENCE YUN: The headache, really, is related to delays. NOGUCHI: Lawrence Yun is the group's chief economist. He says 17 percent of home loans closed late due to backlogs. Most deals get done, but Yun says he worries more about possible impact on homebuyer psychology. YUN: Along with a shutdown, it causes greater uncertainty about the economic direction, which means that even the private sector employees may be less willing to purchase homes over time. NOGUCHI: Gregg Busch agrees. GREGG BUSCH: What furloughed employees are going to go out and buy a house right now when there's no definitive date of a compromise? NOGUCHI: Busch is vice president of First Savings Mortgage, a big player in the Washington, D. C. , area. He notes the impact on contractors, who make up the largest segment of the federal workforce. BUSCH: There's a lot of contractors here that aren't getting paid. People who own those companies, they're not going to buy, be able to refinance, and they're going to start laying people off. And those people, I think, will be most affected. NOGUCHI: For Libby Anderson, the new divorcee, the shutdown cannot end soon enough. While her breakup with her ex has been amicable, sharing space is taxing. ANDERSON: It just feels like you're at the finish line, and the finish line keeps getting moved. But you're exhausted. There's not much you can do about it. You can't move the finish line closer 'cause it's totally out of our control. NOGUCHI: The latest he expected to move out was April 1. But now Anderson worries the shutdown could outlast that. ANDERSON: Obviously, I wouldn't kick him out into the street. But we really both need to move on and have some physical distance from each other. NOGUCHI: Until then they will continue to retreat to separate corners of their house. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington. MARTIN: And we're following a developing story this morning. Authorities say they have located 13-year-old Jayme Closs. She's been missing since October, when police discovered her parents dead in their home in Barron, Wis. Investigators got thousands of tips. There were massive search parties to try to follow up on those tips. Last night the Barron County Sheriff's Department announced that Closs has been found alive about an hour north of Barron. CBS affiliate WCCO spoke with Closs's aunt, Sue Nyberg Allard (ph), last night. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SUE NYBERG ALLARD: There was rumors earlier today. And I prayed and prayed they were true, and they've come to not be true. And I just shut myself totally down 'cause I thought today was going to be the day. Then to find out two hours later that she was found - I just cannot believe this. MARTIN: The sheriff's department says shortly after Closs was located, a suspect was taken into custody. The department didn't provide any further information but plans to hold a press conference later this morning. We'll continue to monitor this story and bring you any developments.

This one has now gone on longer - a lot longer. It's now at record length. So trying to calculate its effect on the economy is more complicated, though even the Trump administration is now acknowledging the shutdown will eat into economic growth. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett has sometimes downplayed the impact of the shutdown on the economy. But yesterday he seemed to have a different take. He said the impact would be twice as much as previous estimates. Here he was in an interview on Fox Business Network. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KEVIN HASSETT: The government workers that aren't getting pay are feeling the pain, and it's going to really affect the economy as well. ZARROLI: The White House says every week that the shutdown drags on, it will shave another 0. 13 percent off of economic growth. That's pretty small, but it adds up over time. Some 800,000 federal workers are not being paid now, and that doesn't include the 4 million contract workers, many of whom are also going without pay. That's already beginning to affect the spending behavior of federal employees. There are people like Sophia Bogat, who works at NASA on a Mars exploration project. SOPHIA BOGAT: I mean, it's a dream job. I would just love to be able to do it right now. ZARROLI: Bogat works on contract, which means she's mostly not getting paid. And unlike civil servants, she won't be made whole later. So she's given up dinners out and exercise classes and even sold her car to raise cash. BOGAT: It's changed the way that I grocery shop. I've been subsisting essentially on rice, beans and vegetables. You know, I stopped buying pretty much any meat just because it's expensive. ZARROLI: And that kind of pullback on spending can lead to slower growth as a whole, especially in places with a lot of federal employees. Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, says there are cities, such as Ogden, Utah, site of a large IRS facility. JOSEPH BRUSUELAS: These are highly-paid professionals with educations who aren't receiving income who are going to see at least - at this point, at least two paychecks missed by these individuals. That's an entire month of pay. ZARROLI: And that's only the initial impact of the shutdown. Macroeconomic Advisers founder Joel Prakken says sooner or later, the suspension of so many government services begins to affect the broader economy. Federal workers process housing loans, pay tax refunds and approve food labels. The fact that they're not doing that now keeps businesses from operating. JOEL PRAKKEN: And then what about disruptions because public transportation is delayed, courts are closed, inspections are not being done, all of that? ZARROLI: This shutdown comes at a time when the U. S. economy has been doing pretty well. Unemployment has been low. But Joseph Brusuelas says the longer the shutdown lasts, the more likely it is that the job market will suffer. In fact, more jobs could be lost than created for the first time since 2010. And he notes this comes at a time of ongoing trade tensions between the U. S. and China as well as an economic slowdown in Europe and Asia. BRUSUELAS: You got what I would refer to as a growing uncertainty tax, which will show up in less hiring and less business investment. ZARROLI: Once the slowdown ends, Congress is expected to pay federal employees back for the time they've lost, but the huge disruption to the economy could leave other problems in its wake. Previous shutdowns have hurt business confidence and left people a lot less certain that the government can address the problems it faces. And that could leave a residue of uncertainty that's a lot harder to eliminate. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  Previous government shutdowns usually ended after a few days. This one has now gone on longer - a lot longer. It's now at record length. So trying to calculate its effect on the economy is more complicated, though even the Trump administration is now acknowledging the shutdown will eat into economic growth. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett has sometimes downplayed the impact of the shutdown on the economy. But yesterday he seemed to have a different take. He said the impact would be twice as much as previous estimates. Here he was in an interview on Fox Business Network. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KEVIN HASSETT: The government workers that aren't getting pay are feeling the pain, and it's going to really affect the economy as well. ZARROLI: The White House says every week that the shutdown drags on, it will shave another 0. 13 percent off of economic growth. That's pretty small, but it adds up over time. Some 800,000 federal workers are not being paid now, and that doesn't include the 4 million contract workers, many of whom are also going without pay. That's already beginning to affect the spending behavior of federal employees. There are people like Sophia Bogat, who works at NASA on a Mars exploration project. SOPHIA BOGAT: I mean, it's a dream job. I would just love to be able to do it right now. ZARROLI: Bogat works on contract, which means she's mostly not getting paid.

BRADY: When he's not on furlough, Kirk administers contracts for the hundreds of millions of dollars the Forest Service spends on fighting wildfires. A local store owner saw that TV story and offered Kirk a temporary job. KIRK: What I do is basically throw freight around, load boxes, unload boxes, stock shelves and work a cash register. BRADY: Kirk says it's quite a change from his Forest Service job. And even though he's earning less than a quarter of his federal salary, he's thankful for the work and for his new employer's flexibility. KIRK: As soon as the government shutdown ends, I have to drop whatever I'm doing and go back to work. BRADY: In Florida, Dorothy Dearborn also administers contracts for the government but for the space agency NASA. DOROTHY DEARBORN: I'm a single mom of three. I live paycheck to paycheck. BRADY: Dearborn says she's using no-interest and low-interest credit cards to get by. And her family has offered help. Finding a temporary job has been difficult. She did apply to a restaurant. DEARBORN: The first question they asked me - they said, you work for NASA? I said yes. They said, you're in furlough? I said yes. And they said, are you planning on going back? I said yes. They said, oh, we're not interested in - it's not going to work for us right now. We are only looking for people who are going to stay. BRADY: That's a common problem federal workers say they're encountering. Still, a few have found creative ways around this problem. FRANK RUOPOLI: My name is Frank Ruopoli. I work at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. And I live in Charleston, S. C. BRADY: Ruopoli is a graphic designer and illustrator. He's worked at NOAA for nearly 20 years, where he takes scientific data and puts it in forms the rest of us can understand. He says a 2013 furlough, which lasted 16 days, was hard on his family. After that, he developed a plan to be prepared for the next partial government shutdown. RUOPOLI: What I decided to do is go and get my EMT certificate. BRADY: Ruopoli says when he's working at NOAA, he volunteers as an emergency medical technician with a local rescue squad. Now that he's on furlough, he landed a part-time EMT job. RUOPOLI: It's a lot of a medical transport. And what I mean by that is a lot of transporting patients from hospital to hospital. They are a backup for the 911 systems. BRADY: Ruopoli says the new job helped ease the financial burden of this shutdown. Still, he's disappointed the country is in this position. RUOPOLI: I feel a little betrayed by our politicians. You know, they take an oath of office to serve our country. And I do the same. I got into this many years ago. And I chose to, in a way, serve my country. And I expect the same out of my politicians. BRADY: Ruopoli and the others interviewed for this story are careful to say their views are their own, not their agencies. Most also said they were uncomfortable speaking publicly, but given that this is now the longest partial shutdown in U.

NPR's Wade Goodwyn reports now on the shutdown's trickle-down effect on Texas. WADE GOODWYN, BYLINE: It's probably not the first thing that pops into one's mind when asked to name a couple of the biggest impacts the shutdown has on the economy. You might think airline travel or the national park system. But one of the biggest economic effects has to do with information, research that the federal government produces monthly or quarterly. PATRICK JANKOWSKI: My biggest concern right now is that with the - so many federal agencies shut down, we're not getting the data we need to understand what's going on with the economy. GOODWYN: Patrick Jankowski is the senior vice president of research at the Greater Houston Partnership and the chief economist for the fourth largest city in the country. JANKOWSKI: If you're trying to make hiring decisions and you want to find out whether the economy is expanding, contracting or what rate it is expanding, you need the regular reports to understand that. GOODWYN: The impact of the shutdown on the economy radiates out from the absence of federal employees. For example, more than $200 billion a year in trade moves through Texas seaports. But without the review of important paperwork by the Coast Guard - for example, the required certificates of financial responsibility - that ship's not coming into U. S. waters. Switch gears. Texas has a hundred billion-dollar-a-year agriculture sector. Right now is the time when farmers decide what crops and how much of each crop to plant. Luis Ribera is a professor and agricultural economist at Texas A&M University. LUIS RIBERA: The different agencies in USDA - they collect a lot if information, which - we use it to analyze and forecast. They're very reliable. They're unbiased. GOODWYN: Ribera says it says if farmers are now playing poker blindfolded. They're going to have to make their bets, but they have to guess what cards they're holding. Take soybeans, for example. Texas is the largest producer, and soybean farmers want and need to know how much China's been buying or not buying. RIBERA: Usually, the Foreign Agricultural Service data comes about two months behind, so we should've gotten information by the first week in January. Well, we didn't. So we really don't know. By October, we were down by quite a bit. But now, we have a truce, and we wanted to see how much more soybeans we're sending. And, of course, that's going to impact the price of the products, not only soybeans, all different products. GOODWYN: The oil and gas industry in Texas remains sound. Projects under review have been slowed. But, with the cost of a barrel of oil in the low 50s, producers are making money. With both American and Southwest Airlines based in Dallas-Fort Worth, the state is host to two powerhouse carriers. And analysts agree the industry's weak point in relation to the shutdown is TSA airport security. It's one of the lowest-paying federal agencies, and a second missed paycheck is certain. Joseph DeNardi is the airline's analyst for Stifel Financial. JOSEPH DENARDI: Yeah. I'm sure, at some point, you can't expect people to show up for work if they're not being paid. That would be the biggest risk, that, at some point, you have staffing challenges at some of the agencies that directly affect customers' ability to fly. I don't think we're seeing any of that yet.

The Trump administration's trade policy has led to tensions and tariffs with U. S. trade partners, and the record-long partial government shutdown is also complicating the economic outlook now. We're joined by David Wessel. He's director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution, a contributor to The Wall Street Journal and also a frequent guest on our program. Good morning, David. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning, David. GREENE: So let me just start with the basics. Are we enjoying one of the best economies in the history of the United States? WESSEL: Yeah. Actually, the president has a point. Unemployment is nearly at a 50-year low. Inflation is roughly at the Fed's target of 2 percent. Wages are starting to climb. The Federal Reserve said last week that factory production ended the year pretty strong. In fact, if the economy keeps growing through July, this will be the longest we've gone without a recession since we started keeping track in the mid-1800s. But you know, that's not the whole story, as you said. The housing market's looking shaky. The federal budget deficit is soaring. Consumer confidence has fallen to the lowest levels of the Trump presidency. GREENE: And I guess the partial government shutdown - we're talking about 800,000 or so workers it's affecting. I mean, does that shutdown really affect the overall economic data for the country? WESSEL: Absolutely. I mean, first of all, it depresses the economic growth in the first quarter. The president didn't mention that. And it's kind of ironic that he's talking about the GDP numbers, the gross domestic product, because unless the shutdown ends soon, the Commerce Department, which isn't funded, isn't going to be able to put out those new numbers. GREENE: Which is an interesting side effect of having a government shutdown. You mentioned the housing market looking shaky, the deficit soaring. Like, is there a way to understand, if we put all those pieces together, what the outlook actually is for the coming months and years? WESSEL: Yeah. It's kind of an interesting tension. On one hand, the president is right. The incoming data has looked very strong. But there are all sorts of signals and warnings that the near future isn't going to look as good as the recent past. In fact, that's why the Federal Reserve has backed off its plans to raise interest rates in the next few months. You know, Duke University's business school does a survey of chief financial officers. And last month, they found half of them believe we're going to have a recession before the end of this year, and more than 80 percent think we'll have a recession before the end of next year. GREENE: Soon. WESSEL: Today we learned that the Chinese growth is slower than people thought. That's going to hurt our economy. And so there's a lot more talk about recession. I don't think it's necessarily baked in the cake. But the outlook is looking much worse than the recent past. GREENE: Let me ask you about one other thing the president said in that tweet. He refers to great new trade deals. And you know, he said something he often says, that companies are coming back to the United States in big numbers. Is that a fair assessment? WESSEL: Yeah. I kind of enjoyed that. He's signed two trade agreements so far, one with South Korea and the relatively modest changes to the deal we have with Canada and Mexico. He has not cut a deal with Europe yet, and he certainly hasn't cut a deal with China. In fact, the fear is that he's going to - every time there's good news out of the China talks, the stock market goes up. Jobs coming back? Yes, there is what the president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing calls a trickle of jobs coming back from companies that might've produced overseas. But the bottom line, probably some of that - it's called onshoring - but not a lot relative to the size of the workforce in our country. GREENE: All right. David, thanks as always. We appreciate it. WESSEL: You're welcome. GREENE: David Wessel is director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution, a contributor to The Wall Street Journal, and you hear him here on our program.

S. There's also a new company knocking on the door, Rivian, which wants to be the first to sell an all-electric pickup truck. Ryan Denham of member station WGLT reports. RYAN DENHAM, BYLINE: I'm riding in a golf cart around the massive auto plant in Normal, Ill. , a hundred miles southwest of Chicago. My tour guide is Wade Jensen. He worked here three decades ago when Mitsubishi and Chrysler built cars here, cranking out hundreds of thousands every year. But three years ago, Mitsubishi shut it down and moved production to Japan. Jensen and 1,200 others lost their jobs. Now he's back as the engineering manager for electric automaker Rivian's first assembly line. The startup plans to hire a thousand workers here in the next four years. WADE JENSEN: When you've done it for 28 years, it's your passion. I mean, it's - it's what's in you. It's what's in your heart. It's your desire, and to have the opportunity to see this plant producing cars and putting them out the back door again, I was all in. DENHAM: The man who's recycling this plant is Rivian founder and CEO R. J. Scaringe, a 36-year-old car geek with a Ph. D. from M. I. T. in mechanical engineering. He started work on a gas-powered, eco-sports car 10 years ago, about the time when another ambitious entrepreneur, Elon Musk and Tesla, started bringing electric cars into the mainstream. Here's Scaringe on the sidelines of the recent LA Auto Show. RJ SCARINGE: They took the untruth that electric cars are boring and slow and flipped that and showed the world electric cars can be exciting and certainly very quick. DENHAM: Musk is known for his bombast, tweets that move stock prices and promotions like shooting a car into space. Scaringe spent the past few years doing the opposite, staying quiet, hiring auto-industry veterans and raising a half billion dollars from Saudi and Japanese conglomerates. At the LA Auto Show, Rivian finally revealed its electric pickup and SUV with a charging range of 400 miles. He beat Detroit to the punch. SCARINGE: That's the opportunity we have is to show the world that this is a space that actually badly needs electrification, and electrification can make those products better than what their gasoline diesel counterparts had been in the past. DENHAM: Rivian has only 600 employees so far. Design and engineering are done outside Detroit and in the U. K. , batteries and tech in California. And about 70 people are getting the plant in Illinois up and running. Starting a car company from scratch isn't easy. Just ask Tesla. It's hemorrhaged money, missed deadlines and freaked out investors. And it's considered a success. Other EV startups haven't even made it to market, one reason electric vehicles here still represent a tiny part of the market, 1 percent of sales. While they may be the future, low gas prices are a challenge to electric vehicles, especially for legacy automakers. If that changes in a few years and Ford finally puts an electric version of its bestselling F-150 on the market, Rivian would be facing stiff competition. Industry watcher Chelsea Sexton was at the LA Auto Show for Rivian's debut. CHELSEA SEXTON: We root for all the startups, but a lot happens between concept and showroom. And it's most vulnerable for the startups. DENHAM: Rivian's high price tag - trucks starting around $70,000 didn't - scare off Ariel Fernandez from Florida. He was among the first to plop down a thousand bucks to preorder a Rivian SUV. ARIEL FERNANDEZ: I'm willing to invest in this company and basically put my trust in them that they're gonna produce the vehicle and make me happy when - when I pick it up. DENHAM: Fernandez's SUV'll be made here in Illinois. But that may not be it. Rivian also plans a side business, selling its battery technology to other companies. So if electric trucks don't take off, maybe battery-powered tractors and Jet Skis will. For NPR News, I'm Ryan Denham in Normal, Ill.

NPR's Jasmine Garsd reports from Queensbridge. JASMINE GARSD, BYLINE: The Queensbridge public houses are just two subway stops away from bustling Manhattan. But Queensbridge feels like a completely different world. Chris Hanway is the executive director of the Jacob A. Riis Neighborhood Settlement, a nonprofit which provides services to the community. CHRIS HANWAY: Queensbridge has always been literally and psychologically isolated. It's got the river on one side, the bridge on another and then sort of light manufacturing buildings around it. GARSD: In his seminal 1994 album \"Illmatic,\" New York rapper Nas, who is from Queensbridge, penned an ode to the neighborhood. . .

GARSD: It didn't take long for big companies to notice how close the neighborhood is to Manhattan. In the last decade or so, Ralph Lauren opened an office nearby, and so did JetBlue. But activists say, for many Queensbridge residents, it's like it never happened. Hanway says unemployment here is high. And that's why when Amazon announced it's setting up shop just a few blocks away. . . HANWAY: People literally shrugged their shoulders and said, well, we've been down this road before. It's not really going to affect us in any way - because they've lived this experience. GARSD: Amazon, which is an NPR sponsor, declined to comment. But the company has promised to fund infrastructure, a school and a tech incubator. It also says it will host job fairs for locals. Chris Hanway has met with Amazon officials and made it clear he wants more concrete promises than that. HANWAY: What are our goals? How many local residents are we going to hire - into what kind of jobs? How will we get those residents ready for these jobs? And there have to be benchmarks, and Amazon has to be held accountable for that. GARSD: On a chilly weeknight, I head over to an area near the Queensbridge Houses. It's a lot of warehouses and storage units. But inside one building, I find a software developer training class. UNIDENTIFIED LECTURER: In other words, you're able to take your data from your app and. . . GARSD: The students listening intently to the lecture are mostly Latino, African-American, and there's plenty of women - faces that are scarce in Silicon Valley. The class is part of a nonprofit called Pursuit, which trains low-income adults for tech jobs. Pursuit is also the designated community partner, co-developer and part owner of the new Amazon headquarters. Here's CEO and founder Jukay Hsu. JUKAY HSU: I think we have a unique opportunity here and for New York to be a place where the technology community can thrive but also be inclusive. GARSD: Hsu, who was once a classmate of Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard University, says he saw how his school friends revolutionized technology. But then he'd come home to his native Queens and wonder about those left behind. He wants to make sure Amazon's new headquarters relies heavily on local talent. HSU: Amazon, when it's here, can be embedded in Queens. Amazon's coming to Queens, but we want to bring Queens to Amazon. GARSD: In a lounge area outside the Pursuit lecture room, I meet a 26-year-old new coding student, Ivy Strickland. She's from Harlem. She tells me she's excited about Amazon coming to Queens. IVY STRICKLAND: I'm the youngest of three children of a single mom. My mom had us when she was a teenager. So imagine me, someone who now makes, like, under $20,000 a year, able to get a job that could pay me enough that I would be able to do certain things, like pay my mom's mortgage or help her out. GARSD: Although she only recently started coding, she loves it. She says she sees it as a metaphor of how, piece by piece, you can build something amazing. STRICKLAND: To see the way that you can take something so small and grow, I guess for me personally, to know where I've come from, it's like the same thing. I can see myself growing. GARSD: Whether or not this city and this neighborhood will be able to grow and build something good with Amazon remains to be seen.

EMILY SULLIVAN, BYLINE: Kris was a good lifeguard - so good in fact that after a year of working at a waterpark in Cincinnati, his bosses promoted him to head lifeguard and promised him a raise. His new duties were more than just keeping an eye on the water. KRIS: I did the daily schedule and rotation for all lifeguards, and I tested the water slides and the chemical levels in the water as well. SULLIVAN: But six months into his new position, his paycheck remained the same - eight bucks an hour instead of the 10 he was promised. KRIS: Week after week, I would ask about it, and management would keep making excuses. SULLIVAN: Then an announcement - Kris' manager said they would cut all employees' pay by 10 percent due to financial difficulties. So he decided. . . KRIS: If they really don't care about me and they don't value me and what I do for the waterpark, then maybe I'll just stop doing it. SULLIVAN: He ghosted. On a busy summer day, he didn't show up to open the park. He ignored his manager's calls. KRIS: I ultimately caused, like, the shutdown of the water park for that Friday. SULLIVAN: Kris estimates he cost the park between 15 and $20,000 in lost sales. Now, he's working at a Fortune 500 company. While he doesn't regret ghosting, he doesn't want his current bosses to know about it. That was a few years back. And now Kris' exit strategy is increasingly common - even the Fed has noticed. In a report last month, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago noted that more employees are ghosting. The Fed says ghosting is a situation where someone stops coming to work without notice and then becomes impossible to reach. Raquel Anaya, a recruiter in Florida, says she's seen a spike in no-shows in interviews and first days on the job. RAQUEL ANAYA: I think most of the time it's that people interview in more than one place concurrently, and we get edged out on offers. So instead of just saying, I got a better offer, they just stop. SULLIVAN: She says she understands but that if an applicant who disappeared reapplied to her firm, she'll remember that they ghosted, and that doesn't look good. Anaya blames the influx of ghosting on a hot labor market with lots of opportunity. So does Andy Challenger, of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a job placement firm. ANDY CHALLENGER: I think a lot of the stories that we hear from companies is people ghosting in industries where jobs are the most plentiful and good employees are the most scarce. SULLIVAN: Industries like tech and engineering. And he says ghosting is a learned behavior. Employers ghost applicants all the time and can fire workers without two weeks' notice. So in response, employees or applicants might say. . . CHALLENGER: I'm just going to ghost them. I'm not going to respond to the calls and texts and voicemails that they leave me because, in some ways, it feels like revenge. SULLIVAN: Challenger doesn't recommend ghosting, no matter how bad a boss is. CHALLENGER: People leave without notice are missing out on one of the most satisfying parts of the human experience, which is quitting a job that you hate, right? Even if you do it politely, that can be cathartic. SULLIVAN: But Kris, the former lifeguard, cites one big reason for not telling off his bosses. He wanted to hit them where it hurt - financially. KRIS: I feel like I made a bigger dent than I would have if I had just said, OK, I'm done. SULLIVAN: But he says he'd never ghost on an employer that treated him with respect. Emily Sullivan, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE RJDR'S \"GHOSTWRITER (REMIX)\") MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   If you've spent time in the dating world, you might be familiar with ghosting - when someone you're seeing suddenly vanishes and stops answering your calls. Well, with low unemployment rates and a solid job market, ghosting is now affecting employers. NPR's Emily Sullivan reports. EMILY SULLIVAN, BYLINE: Kris was a good lifeguard - so good in fact that after a year of working at a waterpark in Cincinnati, his bosses promoted him to head lifeguard and promised him a raise. His new duties were more than just keeping an eye on the water. KRIS: I did the daily schedule and rotation for all lifeguards, and I tested the water slides and the chemical levels in the water as well. SULLIVAN: But six months into his new position, his paycheck remained the same - eight bucks an hour instead of the 10 he was promised. KRIS: Week after week, I would ask about it, and management would keep making excuses. SULLIVAN: Then an announcement - Kris' manager said they would cut all employees' pay by 10 percent due to financial difficulties. So he decided. . . KRIS: If they really don't care about me and they don't value me and what I do for the waterpark, then maybe I'll just stop doing it. SULLIVAN: He ghosted. On a busy summer day, he didn't show up to open the park. He ignored his manager's calls. KRIS: I ultimately caused, like, the shutdown of the water park for that Friday. SULLIVAN: Kris estimates he cost the park between 15 and $20,000 in lost sales. Now, he's working at a Fortune 500 company.

They could be out of work again in a few weeks if the president and Congress can't come up with a deal. NPR's Brakkton Booker reports. BRAKKTON BOOKER, BYLINE: Just a few blocks away from the White House, a food bank is set up for furloughed federal employees. UNIDENTIFIED FOOD BANK WORKER: Hey, how are you? UNIDENTIFIED FOOD BANK RECIPIENT #1: Good. How are you? UNIDENTIFIED FOOD BANK WORKER: Welcome. Welcome. BOOKER: All that's required to come in is a federal work badge. Yesterday's offerings included chicken torta and winter vegetable panzanella. UNIDENTIFIED FOOD BANK WORKER: Check your IDs inside. UNIDENTIFIED FOOD BANK RECIPIENT #2: That sounds good. UNIDENTIFIED FOOD BANK WORKER: Enjoy lunch. UNIDENTIFIED FOOD BANK RECIPIENT #2: Thank you so much for doing this. UNIDENTIFIED FOOD BANK WORKER: Hello. You check IDs inside. BOOKER: Here at World Central Kitchen, I meet Terri, a federal worker. She asked that we not use her last name because she's afraid her boss won't be happy with her when she shows back up at work. Can you tell me what you got in the bag? TERRI: I've got some fruit and some vegetables, and I've got my lunch (laughter). BOOKER: Terri works as a janitor at the Smithsonian here in Washington. Like many other federal employees, she's missed two paychecks as a result of the 35-day shutdown. She says two things got her through. TERRI: For me, it has been prayer and my family. If I had not been able to depend on my family, I probably would not have gotten through the past couple of weeks. BOOKER: She says the shutdown has been painful. Terri's not sure politicians though have any empathy for her or anyone else in the federal workforce. TERRI: My thing is I don't - I don't like being used. And that's what we feel like. We're being the ones pulled apart and plucked apart and left out to dry when these people that are making these decisions don't have the financial worries that we have. BOOKER: Terri wasn't getting paid, but she also didn't have to go into work. Duane Wilson did have to show up. He's a federal police officer at the Department of Homeland Security. He expects back pay soon. And another thing he expects - the government to be shut down again in a few weeks. DUANE WILSON: I personally feel like we're gonna be there. I think you have to - at this point, you have to assume the worst. BOOKER: The deal reached by Congress and the White House only keeps the government open for three weeks. It included none of the $5. 7 billion for President Trump's U. S. -Mexico border wall. And when Trump announced the agreement from the Rose Garden, he showcased his willingness to shutter the government once again. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If we don't get a fair deal from Congress, the government will either shut down on February 15 again. BOOKER: Or, the president says, he will declare a national emergency to get his border wall - a move that will almost certainly be challenged in the courts. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)ERIC INGRAM: Hello. BOOKER: Hi. It's Brakkton from NPR. INGRAM: All right, great. I'll send my wife to come let you in real quick. BOOKER: OK, great. Eric Ingram and his wife Andrea Jensen live in Alexandria, Va. Both are federal workers. Ingram works for the Federal Aviation Administration and took the shutdown saga in stride. INGRAM: I guess it's cool to be a part of history. That's nice. BOOKER: If it sounds like he's laid back, it's because his wife, who works for the Department of Energy, has been on the job and has been getting paid. Jensen says the shutdown made her realize something important. Maybe it's not wise for both of them to work for the federal government. ANDREA JENSEN: It seems like there's more job security in not working for the same agency or having one person in private industry and one person in the government. BOOKER: Her husband says that is something he's considering. But today he's heading back to work where he's got a ton of projects to get up and running before the next possible shutdown.

Its economy is tied to Ohio's steel industry. It's name-checked in an old Bob Dylan song; I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco and Ashtabula. And it's the hometown of U. S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer, who was President Trump's chief negotiator in talks with China. In that city, NPR's Jim Zarroli found the backstory of a hard-line trade negotiator. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: A bitter wind is whipping off Lake Erie on an overcast day in Ashtabula. Nearby sits an enormous ramp that's used to load coal onto freighters. Ray Gruber has lived in the area all his life. RAY GRUBER: When I was a kid - 1960s, OK? - this was a pretty booming operation down here. You had all your steel mills in Pittsburgh, and this would be the port of entry for all these ore boats. I mean, this is where all the activities happened. ZARROLI: Before he retired, Gruber worked as a machinist. The company where he started out is no longer around. GRUBER: When that recession in the '70s happened, a lot of places moved out and a lot of companies moved out. We became the Rust Belt. You know, a lot of stores became empty. ZARROLI: These days, the waterfront is home to coffee bars and brew pubs. The harbor attracts tourists from Cleveland and Pittsburgh. Much less freight comes through the port. Among those old enough to remember the way the port used to be is trade representative Robert Lighthizer who grew up in town. Lighthizer is a longtime critic of global trade. In a 2017 speech, he said unfair practices by China and other countries have devastated American manufacturers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ROBERT LIGHTHIZER: There has been a growing feeling that the system that has developed in recent years is not quite fair to American workers in manufacturing and that we need to change. ZARROLI: Those who know him say Lighthizer's views on trade were shaped in part by watching steel's decline in Ashtabula and the financial hardship that followed. Today Lighthizer is the man charged with carrying out Trump's ambitious trade agenda. Among other things, the administration has imposed steep import tariffs, which are a kind of tax on goods brought into the United States. For his hometown, those changes are bringing uncertainty but also some hope. Over the years, Ashtabula County has worked hard to rebuild its economy. Manufacturers here today tend to be smaller and tied to global trade. There are companies such as Welded Tubes which makes auto parts. DAVID JENKINS: We are a supplier to Honda, Toyota, Nissan, Subaru. ZARROLI: David Jenkins is Welded Tubes' vice president of operations. The company makes metal backing for car seat headrests. The parts are sent to seat manufacturers in Canada and Mexico. Then those seats are brought back to the U. S. and installed in cars. The new trade agreement replacing NAFTA requires cars to use more parts made in North America, and Jenkins says that could mean more orders. JENKINS: Now that all the auto manufacturers are looking at onshoring additional manufacturing and assembly plants, it's very good for Welded Tubes. ZARROLI: In fact, a big problem Jenkins faces today is finding workers. He wants to expand. But these policies being carried out by Lighthizer have had a downside. Welded Tubes makes parts made of steel, and steel prices have jumped. JENKINS: We're looking at a $300- to $20,000-a-month increase in the operating cost. ZARROLI: And that's because of steel. JENKINS: That's because of steel. ZARROLI: In many ways, tariffs have complicated life for manufacturers here. Grand River Rubber and Plastics makes belts that get shipped to China and used in vacuum cleaners. President Donald Chaplin says the vacuum cleaner business has slowed since tariffs took effect. He's also having to pay more for a polymer he uses in production. Still, Chaplin shares a view often expressed by Lighthizer. He hopes the troubles will be temporary, and he is cautiously optimistic about trade. Over the years, many of his customers have fled to low-wage countries and no longer buy from him. But, he says, when his company tries to export to other countries, it often faces unfair barriers. Chaplin says Trump is trying to ensure a level playing field for manufacturers like him. DONALD CHAPLIN: I don't agree with all that he's done and definitely some of the - some of his methods sometimes. I think if you take him at his word, I think he does have the American worker at heart. I think he is concerned about America. ZARROLI: Like many people in Ashtabula, Chaplin hopes Trump can encourage companies that have fled abroad to come back. If he and Lighthizer succeed in restoring some of the luster to American manufacturing, they say, it will be worth the pain those policies are causing. Jim Zarroli, NPR News.

Interest rates have steadily gone up over the past four years, one reason why mortgages have gotten more expensive. The Fed's apparent turnaround comes as economic growth is slowing in the U. S. and overseas. This news sent stock prices sharply higher. We're joined by NPR's Jim Zarroli now. Hi, Jim. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Hi. SHAPIRO: Explain what the Fed did today. ZARROLI: Well, the first thing it did was it decided not to raise interest rates. Now, that was totally expected. That's no surprise. But what was a surprise, what really jolted the financial markets was not what the Fed did but what Fed officials said both in the statement they released after the meeting and in Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference which took place shortly afterward. And that indicated a much softer tone on interest rates. Last year, the Fed raised interest rates four times, and this is something that has an effect on borrowing interest rates or interest rates for borrowing, whether you're talking about mortgage rates or auto loans. And in fact, this has had some effect on the housing market and on the auto market because consumers end up paying more. So what the Fed said today is just a sea change from what it was saying even just six weeks ago. SHAPIRO: Well, can you explain what it is they said that indicates this is not just a one-off decision not to raise interest rates but actually a shift in approach? ZARROLI: Well, it was partly what they didn't say. I mean, a month ago, the Fed was talking about gradual rate increases, which is something it does when the economy is going strong and there's a worry about inflation rising and the Fed wants to sort of nip it in the bud. This time around, they took out any reference to further rate increases and said it would exercise patience. That was the word that everyone sort of seized on, patience. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said there's a lot of evidence that economic growth is solid, but he said the case for raising interest rates is weakening. So it appears this current round of interest rate increases is over for now. Powell made clear he can reverse course again, but rate hikes appear to be over. SHAPIRO: What's happening in the economy right now that would make the Fed decide to change course like this? ZARROLI: Well, you know, the case for higher rates is sort of not as strong as it was. That's really at the bottom of it. The U. S. economy has been growing at a good clip, especially last year. Unemployment rate is way down. The Fed has been worried about this, worried that it will lead to inflation, but now conditions have changed somewhat on this. The statement today issued by the Fed referred to muted inflation pressures and also readings on financial and international developments. In other words, the global economy is slowing. That's clear. And that has a way of affecting growth in the United States. So just in general, the economy is in a different place now, and the Fed believes it can sort of just stand back and watch for a while. SHAPIRO: President Trump often attacks the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Do those attacks have anything to do with the decision that he made today? ZARROLI: Yeah. Trump has - you know, all presidents like to keep - like the Fed to keep rates low. Trump is unusual in that he talks about it publicly. He's - you know, he's sometimes even suggested that he would like to dismiss Fed Chairman Powell. He's used words like loco to describe Fed policy. You know, the Fed is supposed to be insulated from political pressure. It's not supposed to - it's not used to dealing with direct criticism this way, and Powell was asked today at the press conference whether Trump's comments have had an impact on the Fed, whether it's affected the turnaround. What he said was - he sort of dodged the question. He said, my only motivation is to do the right thing for the American people. Whatever the reasons, it sent the stock market way up. SHAPIRO: NPR's Jim Zarroli, thank you. ZARROLI: You're welcome. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  Today the Federal Reserve sent a strong signal that it will stop raising interest rates for a while. Interest rates have steadily gone up over the past four years, one reason why mortgages have gotten more expensive. The Fed's apparent turnaround comes as economic growth is slowing in the U. S. and overseas. This news sent stock prices sharply higher. We're joined by NPR's Jim Zarroli now. Hi, Jim. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Hi. SHAPIRO: Explain what the Fed did today. ZARROLI: Well, the first thing it did was it decided not to raise interest rates. Now, that was totally expected. That's no surprise. But what was a surprise, what really jolted the financial markets was not what the Fed did but what Fed officials said both in the statement they released after the meeting and in Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference which took place shortly afterward. And that indicated a much softer tone on interest rates. Last year, the Fed raised interest rates four times, and this is something that has an effect on borrowing interest rates or interest rates for borrowing, whether you're talking about mortgage rates or auto loans. And in fact, this has had some effect on the housing market and on the auto market because consumers end up paying more. So what the Fed said today is just a sea change from what it was saying even just six weeks ago. SHAPIRO: Well, can you explain what it is they said that indicates this is not just a one-off decision not to raise interest rates but actually a shift in approach? ZARROLI: Well, it was partly what they didn't say. I mean, a month ago, the Fed was talking about gradual rate increases, which is something it does when the economy is going strong and there's a worry about inflation rising and the Fed wants to sort of nip it in the bud. This time around, they took out any reference to further rate increases and said it would exercise patience. That was the word that everyone sort of seized on, patience. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said there's a lot of evidence that economic growth is solid, but he said the case for raising interest rates is weakening. So it appears this current round of interest rate increases is over for now. Powell made clear he can reverse course again, but rate hikes appear to be over. SHAPIRO: What's happening in the economy right now that would make the Fed decide to change course like this? ZARROLI: Well, you know, the case for higher rates is sort of not as strong as it was. That's really at the bottom of it. The U. S. economy has been growing at a good clip, especially last year. Unemployment rate is way down. The Fed has been worried about this, worried that it will lead to inflation, but now conditions have changed somewhat on this. The statement today issued by the Fed referred to muted inflation pressures and also readings on financial and international developments. In other words, the global economy is slowing. That's clear. And that has a way of affecting growth in the United States. So just in general, the economy is in a different place now, and the Fed believes it can sort of just stand back and watch for a while.

It stands at $1 1/2 trillion dollars. The Federal Reserve says that debt is making it harder for people in their 20s and 30s to buy homes. The question is when, or if, things will get better. NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: As a child, Michael McHale pictured a suburban picket-fenced home he eventually wanted to own. MICHAEL MCHALE: I can remember wanting that since I was, you know, 6, 7 or 8. NOGUCHI: But at age 31, McHale isn't living that dream. Instead, he and his wife rent in Danbury, Conn. , an hour's drive from the elementary school where he teaches. He says not owning a home makes him feel he's made a mistake that's kept him short of a key milestone and his piece of the American dream. Renting, he says, means he isn't free to plan his own life, even as their first child, a boy, is on the way. MCHALE: Decorating his room - right? - we can't really make any actual changes. We can't really paint too much. NOGUCHI: McHale says he feels entrapped by the $1,200 monthly student loan bills, which prevent them from saving enough for a down payment. MCHALE: It seems like there's, like, a debt spiral or something. When you get into a little bit of it, it just feeds back in on itself. And for us, that started with student loans. That was our first debt. NOGUCHI: It feels especially bad, McHale says, when he compares himself to his dad's generation. Neither his father, nor his uncles were burdened by student loans. MCHALE: They all owned a house and had their full-time jobs by the time they were, like, 21. NOGUCHI: Home ownership rates among younger people aged 24 to 32 has declined dramatically - about 9 percentage points over a decade. In a January report, the Federal Reserve estimates 20 percent of that decline is due to ballooning student debt. The broader economic question is, will those younger buyers eventually catch up? Odeta Kushi thinks so. Kushi is deputy chief economist at First American, a real estate research firm. ODETA KUSHI: It's not that they're not going to buy homes, it's just that they'll purchase these homes later in life. NOGUCHI: She says baby boomers were 25, on average, when they purchased their first homes. Millennials, by comparison, are waiting almost a decade longer. Kushi says there are many factors contributing to that. People are staying in school longer, delaying marriage and having children later. But this generation is just starting to buy, and she expects to see a wave of young buyers in coming years. KUSHI: This generation will still yield the wealth benefits from becoming a homeowner, which I think is the key point. NOGUCHI: This might already be starting to happen. Jonathan Spader is a researcher at Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies. He says in the last two years, home ownership rates have increased, largely because of young buyers who are benefiting from the good economy. JONATHAN SPADER: Student loan debt is still a headwind, but they're, at least, being buoyed by stronger incomes and employment. NOGUCHI: People with degrees have higher incomes, which offsets the debt burden. But it's also true that people are taking longer to get their degrees, and many don't finish school. Laurie Goodman is co-director of the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute. LAURIE GOODMAN: Approximately 40 percent of those who start college do not finish within six years. I mean, think about it - 40 percent. That's a huge number. NOGUCHI: And for those people, it's the worst of all worlds. They have the debt without the higher wages to show for it. Christina Ward did finish her schooling, but her chosen profession, social work, doesn't pay enough for her to overcome her debt. CHRISTINA WARD: I thought that I would be able to at least make enough money to make the payments, which wasn't true at all. NOGUCHI: Ward racked up nearly $200,000 in loans from college and graduate school. Then she was laid off in December. At 36, she moved back into her parents' apartment in Newark, N. J. , with her mom's dog, Penny. (SOUNDBITE OF DOG BARKING)NOGUCHI: Ward says she and her girlfriend have had to postpone not just buying a house; her girlfriend is also putting off her graduate education. WARD: We definitely wanted to get married. That's probably going to end up taking priority over the house because you can't afford both. NOGUCHI: But she says there's no target date for getting married either. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington.

The Department of Labor reports this morning that employers in this country added 304,000 jobs last month. NPR's Yuki Noguchi is in the studio for more. Hi, Yuki. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: What do these numbers show? NOGUCHI: Well, as you mentioned, hiring was, surprisingly, very strong - 304,000. That's way beyond what analysts were expecting. And a lot of the hiring was in restaurants and hotels, construction and health care. But the unemployment rate was 4 percent, which was a small hike from the 3. 9 percent level in December. MARTIN: So explain how it seems to indicate that the government shutdown, which affected 800,000 federal workers, that had virtually no effect on the job market. NOGUCHI: Yeah, it's a little confusing. It didn't affect the numbers because of some technicalities of who the government considered unemployed in January. So there are two separate surveys. And they classified furloughed workers differently. One of them is the payroll survey, which measures hiring. And that one counted furloughed workers as employed, even if they were sitting at home and not collecting a paycheck. But since Congress agreed to pay these workers retroactively, they were employed. But in the other survey, which measures the jobless rate, a lot of these same workers were counted as unemployed. MARTIN: So what kind of impact did that have on the jobless rate in January? NOGUCHI: It did have an effect but a small one. You saw the unemployment rate go to 4 percent. That's an uptick of 1/10 of a percentage point. But that effect is likely temporary. MARTIN: So does that mean the job market, basically, escaped largely unscathed because of the shutdown last month? NOGUCHI: Not entirely - the Congressional Budget Office this week said the shutdown reduced federal spending and cut into economic growth. Now, that would definitely hit federal contractors, who make up the biggest segment of those that do government work. They don't get paid back after the furlough ended. And some of them were laid off. That might help explain why we saw a spike earlier this week in initial claims for unemployment insurance. And the number of people working part time but looking for more work increased a lot last month. Probably, those are government workers and contractors looking to bridge that period with temporary work. But then, you know, Rachel, the overall context is that unemployment is still very low. MARTIN: Right. NOGUCHI: Private sector can't fill jobs. And so we'll have to wait to see more data. But the government shutdown caused, you know, some delays in other economic reports. So we'll have to wait to see what those say. MARTIN: So January - clearly, a big month for hiring. How does that fit into the overall employment trajectory? NOGUCHI: You're right. The longer term trend is what matters. And this latest data doesn't actually change the monthly average very much. January marks the 100th straight month of job growth. That's a very long run of growth. The unemployment rate is so low at this point that there are just fewer people who don't already have jobs. And that's great news for workers because that lack of available workforce means that employers have to pay more. And last month, you saw average hourly earnings increase by an annual rate of 3. 2 percent. That's considered pretty strong. So we may start to see hiring level off but wages continue to increase. MARTIN: All right. NPR's Yuki Noguchi for us this morning with those new jobs numbers. Thanks so much, Yuki. NOGUCHI: Thank you, Rachel.

Conservative economist David Malpass is now a top official at the Treasury Department. His nomination is already generating controversy, but the Bank's board is expected to approve it. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: David Malpass was chosen after a long search process overseen by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and the president's daughter Ivanka. With Malpass, they ended up choosing somebody already well-known to Trump. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He's been with me for a long time. He's been a supporter for a long time, a supporter in a financial sense. Even before I ran, he liked the job I did. I like those people somehow. ZARROLI: The two men have known each other since their days in New York. Malpass was chief economist at Bear Stearns, the investment bank that crashed and burned during the financial crisis. He later started an economic forecasting firm. Before that, he served in the Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations. Malpass has long been a vocal critic of the World Bank. The Bank has 189 member countries with a mission to reduce poverty in developing nations. It lends out tens of billions of dollars a year for things such as power plants and factories. The loans are guaranteed by the U. S. and other member countries, and Malpass has complained that much of the money goes to places that don't need it, like China. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DAVID MALPASS: And it doesn't make sense to have money borrowed in the U. S. using the U. S. government guarantee going into lending in China for a country that's got other resources and access to capital markets. ZARROLI: Malpass has promised to bring what the administration calls pro-growth reform to the World Bank. His nomination was immediately criticized by those who see him as hostile to the Bank's mission. Tony Fratto, who served in the George W. Bush administration, says Malpass' nomination is toxic. TONY FRATTO: You can scour David Malpass' background for any interests in, you know, alleviating poverty and working on development strategies, and you won't find anything. ZARROLI: Whether the critics can do anything about the appointment is unclear. Malpass' nomination has to be approved by the World Bank's board, which can in theory appoint someone else. But Charles Kenny, a former World Bank employee now with the Center for Global Development, says the board has always deferred to the United States on who gets named president. CHARLES KENNY: The rest of the world and the United States are finding lots to disagree on at the moment. I guess in the grand scheme of things, who gets to run the World Bank isn't, you know, top of the list of issues to add to that growing list (laughter). ZARROLI: One World Bank official who didn't want to be named noted that in the Treasury Department, Malpass had overseen a big injection of money to the World Bank last year.

That indicates he may not be as hostile to the Bank as his past rhetoric suggests. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York.

In a minute, we're going to hear what former Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz thinks of this plan. But first, a closer look at the details - while the chances for this plan in Congress are slight, the Green New Deal could reshape the climate change debate. Here's NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: The first thing to know about the Green New Deal, it's ambitious - really, really ambitious. Ocasio-Cortez told NPR that's because it needs to be. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ: Even the solutions that we have considered big and bold are nowhere near the scale of the actual problem that climate change presents to us, to our country and to the world. And so while carbon taxes are nice - while things like cap and trade are nice, it's not what's going to save the planet. KURTZLEBEN: The new legislation calls for a variety of measures to drastically cut carbon emissions. In the process, the goal is to not just massively create jobs but transform the economy. Ocasio-Cortez says the aim is to get to net-zero carbon emissions in 10 years. To do that, the legislation lays out some lofty goals - for example, upgrade all buildings in the U. S. for greater energy efficiency - not only that but it includes a wish list of progressive economic policies - for example, guaranteed jobs, all of them with family and medical leave and paid vacation. Importantly, it's a non-binding resolution. It wouldn't create any programs. Rather, it's a plan for future bills that will fall under the Green New Deal heading. OCASIO-CORTEZ: Any legislation that wants to call itself part of a Green New Deal, a Green New Deal project or Green New Deal legislation has to meet this scope. KURTZLEBEN: Now with the resolution out there, the critiques of the plan have begun. For example, the goal of net-zero emissions in 10 years may not be reachable. Here's Jesse Jenkins, a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School. JESSE JENKINS: Where we need to be targeting, really, is a net-zero carbon economy by about 2050, which itself is an enormous challenge. 2030 might be a little bit early. KURTZLEBEN: There is virtually zero chance it will pass this Congress. House Democratic leadership seems lukewarm on the plan. Speaker Nancy Pelosi said this today. NANCY PELOSI: Quite frankly, I haven't seen it, but I do know that it's enthusiastic. And we welcome all the enthusiasms that are out there. KURTZLEBEN: In addition, the potential for massive spending is a non-starter with Republicans who control the Senate. Francis Rooney, Republican congressman from Florida and co-chair of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, believes the bill could be a good place to start a conversation on climate change - even if he doesn't like many of the particulars. FRANCIS ROONEY: I think a lot more analysis would need to be used to figure out how to go from these concepts to something that can practically be accomplished and not destroy the economy and the job growth and all that. KURTZLEBEN: Beyond Congress, the Green New Deal is already part of the debate in the 2020 presidential campaign. Here's an Iowa voter pressing Democratic candidate Kamala Harris at a CNN town hall. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CAMERON VAN KOOTEN LAUGHEAD: Will you fully endorse the Green New Deal tonight? KAMALA HARRIS: I support a Green New Deal, and I will tell you why. Climate change is an existential threat. KURTZLEBEN: In addition, some proponents are hopeful that Green New Deal-style policies could take root at the state and local level. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, for example, recently put out his own version. For Markey and Ocasio-Cortez, the bill does one other important thing - help them dictate the terms of the climate change conversation. OCASIO-CORTEZ: We started seeing a lot of other folks saying - oh, well I have a Green New Deal and call lots of things a Green New Deal. And so the first step that we need to do is define what Green New Deal legislation is.

Frank Morris of our member station KCUR has the first of two stories. UNIDENTIFIED INSTRUCTOR: John, we just need you to back this truck up in a straight line. And remember. . . FRANK MORRIS, BYLINE: On a parking lot in Springfield, Mo. , marked with orange traffic cones, John Bounds is changing career lanes, learning to drive a semi truck. A mouse click at home in Georgia landed Bounds behind the wheel of this big rig. JOHN BOUNDS: I clicked on Wil-Tran (ph). And it wasn't a couple days later they called me back, got in touch with me, you know, made it really easy for me to choose this company. MORRIS: Wil-Trans courted Bounds, 43-year-old meat cutter with zero trucking experience, like a star athlete for a job that starts above $40,000 a year because as fellow students like Jessy Dager, 21-year-old in Philadelphia, know, this industry is desperate for drivers. JESSY DAGER: I like this company a lot, so I'm not going to say I'm not going to be here. But if I wanted to go somewhere else, there's a plethora of places I could go and get a job almost anywhere in the country. MORRIS: The trucking industry's been short of drivers for decades, but the problem keeps getting worse. A big run-up in shipping demand, baby boomer retirements and a staggering turnover rate have left trucking companies unable to fill some 60,000 jobs. T. J. O'Connor, president of YRC Freight, says that's forcing them to turn down lucrative business. TJ O'CONNOR: Well, I think as an industry, we need to be more creative and resourceful to attract and retain top-notch people that are very safety-focused, that have an interest and understand what they're getting into. MORRIS: Of course, money is part of the solution. Some companies are offering signing bonuses, referral bonuses, longevity bonuses, paid time off, retirement plans and health care. Last year, average trucker income spiked to around $60,000. LORI FURNELL: Pay has gone up tremendously. And in some cases, you know, you're talking 10, 11 percent. MORRIS: Lori Furnell is director of talent acquisition for Walmart's huge trucking fleet. They've got 900 openings. FURNELL: Our first-year drivers with Walmart will average about 87. 5 this year. MORRIS: Eighty-seven thousand, five hundred dollars with good benefits. And like some other trucking firms, Walmart's also offering drivers nearly free online college tuition. But Walmart only hires experienced drivers with sterling safety records. Todd Spencer, president of the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, says average driver income slumped for decades before last year's boost. TODD SPENCER: The only real shortage is - it's a pay shortage (laughter), so that's the shortage. Even the crappiest job will attract workers and keep them if they pay enough. MORRIS: Most long-haul truckers don't get a salary or even an hourly wage. They get paid by the mile. It's been that way since the 1930s, partly as an incentive for drivers hauling unrefrigerated food to move it as fast as possible. Drivers liked it. They made more that way. Now the government enforces strict limits on the amount of time drivers can spend behind the wheel. Many face long delays in traffic and hold-ups loading and unloading that can eat up much of their driving time, all without pay. SPENCER: You put in a whole lot of hours for the money you get. MORRIS: The driver shortage in tight freight markets are making it more expensive for shippers to waste drivers' time. Companies are trying to structure routes to give drivers more predictable pay and schedules. But all that isn't enough to fix the driver shortage.

But in the United Kingdom, the risk of crashing out of the European Union next month has cast a shadow over the industry. Many shops fear their lifeline to flower supplies in Europe could be severely disrupted. NPR's Frank Langfitt reports from the English town of Witney. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Rosa Ashby's wrapping up a bouquet of roses and lilies at her shop, Rosa Flowers, in Oxfordshire. They're part of a wide selection of flowers she offers, most of which come from the same place. ROSA ASHBY: These all come from Holland. The lilies come from Holland, and the spray chrysanths (ph) come from Holland. LANGFITT: Up until now, the flowers have flowed seamlessly across the border because the U. K. is part of the massive EU single market. But the United Kingdom is scheduled to leave the EU late next month, and there is still no deal on how to keep trade flowing. ASHBY: We're very worried. We don't know what's going to happen on the 29. Government don't know. Nobody knows. And our worry is, when will we get the flowers? What price will they be if tariffs go on? LANGFITT: The government insists the majority of EU plants and flowers will continue to enter the U. K. without health checks. But businesses of all sorts are worried about a no-deal Brexit. Some have been filling up warehouses across the country with everything from auto parts to ice cream in case trade slows dramatically. Ashby's industry doesn't have that luxury. ASHBY: We can't have a contingency plan. We can't stockpile our goods because they're fresh flowers. We're only a small business. Coming up to our 22nd Valentine's, it's so sad. BRIAN WILLS-POPE: I'm Brian Wills-Pope, and I chair the British Florist Association here in the United Kingdom. LANGFITT: Wills-Pope, who spoke over Skype, says Ashby's plight is typical. WILLS-POPE: Eighty percent of our flowers actually come from Holland, so they come via the Eurotunnel or ferry. LANGFITT: And Wills-Pope says that dependency, developed over decades while the U. K. has been inside the EU, now poses a threat to flower sellers here. WILLS-POPE: We are looking at something which is unprecedented in the 40 years that we've been part of that single market because as time's evolved, the English growers have sewed up and their nurseries have been built on. And more and more, production's been gone to Holland. BARRY SNAPPER: Snapdragons, 10? ASHBY: No. SNAPPER: No? No phlox? I can do small amounts. ASHBY: No, no. SNAPPER: Stalks? ASHBY: Finito, finito. . . SNAPPER: Veronica? ASHBY: . . . Finito. LANGFITT: Back in Witney, one of Rosa Ashby's suppliers has arrived from Holland. His name's Barry Snapper, and he's just come through the Channel Tunnel with his refrigerated semi packed with flowers. Ashby and Snapper haggle as they have every Wednesday for at least the past six years. I ask Snapper what he fears most from a no-deal Brexit. SNAPPER: All the extra duties probably - the import duties, charges, waiting at the Eurotunnel to come across. LANGFITT: Snapper says that would force people like him to raise prices, which he thinks shops here will have a hard time passing on. SNAPPER: A lot of people will struggle to sell flowers to the public. People - well, they're still going to buy food and everything, but they can skip the flowers. LANGFITT: How important is the U. K. to your business? SNAPPER: I only supply to the U. K. at the moment. People say to me, do you want to export to another country? But I've been coming over for over 20 years to Britain. And yeah, it's too difficult, I think, to go to another country now. LANGFITT: Some of Snapper's clients say Valentine's Day orders are down, which they attribute to Brexit uncertainty. Snapper has been trying to calm their fears. SNAPPER: I always say the same. It's 14 of February. It's men, and they come in last minute. And it's the same story every year. It's always on the day itself or the day after even (laughter). LANGFITT: British flower shops are planning ahead. They're ordering early for Mother's Day, which in the U.

Now it's mostly crickets, at least from the officials who have control over the federal budget. So what's changed? We're going to ask Jason Furman. He was a top White House economist in the Obama administration. He's now at the Harvard Kennedy School. Welcome to the program. JASON FURMAN: Thanks for having me. CORNISH: So you've written about the debt. And you hear that $22 trillion figure, and you argue that it's not so scary. How come? FURMAN: I've been paying attention to fiscal policy, debts and deficits, for decades now. And we're at a point where something I never thought would happen has happened. We have a really high level of debt. But one of the main reasons you worry about debt is that it drives up interest rates, and interest rates today are really low. I think that's telling us that something's changed about the economy. And we need to change the way we think about debt and deficits along with that change in the economy. CORNISH: To you, what has changed? What's different? FURMAN: What deficits are is a drain on savings. But right now, there's a lot of savings coming from all over the world. Businesses aren't investing as much as they used to because a lot more businesses are digital. And as a result, interest rates are a lot lower, and the problems that deficits cause for interest rates are much less serious than they were a couple decades ago. CORNISH: But as you're talking about, I mean, the economy is good. Unemployment is low. If there was ever a time when we should be shrinking the national deficit, shouldn't this be it? I mean, is this the time for some dramatic moves? FURMAN: Yeah. Look. I don't think there's a very big economic cost in deficit. That being said, to use money in a wasteful manner that doesn't help is a mistake, as well. It's much better to be reducing the deficit or preparing for the future than something like the tax cuts, which I didn't think were a particularly well-designed way to help the economy. CORNISH: Right. The Trump administration argued it would generate enough economic growth to offset revenue lost over the next decade. The new tax law has been in effect for a little over a year now. Are we actually moving in that direction? FURMAN: No, not at all. We did get extra economic growth in 2018. Most economists think that was a temporary fiscal stimulus and that we're not going to continue to get more growth in the future. But what's notable is even with that extra growth, the deficit went up a lot. And it is in a place right now that we've never seen in peacetime. Absent a large recession, we haven't seen deficits like that. So we are in an unprecedented place. You know, what I advocate is that we at least, for now, have a principle of do no harm. You know, we don't need to panic. We don't need to go into a massive fiscal negotiation to dramatically cut the debt. But we shouldn't do the opposite either. We shouldn't be piling on more and more and making the situation even worse. CORNISH: If the national debt is an indicator of long-term economic health, then why wouldn't we be worried? FURMAN: I think the most important indicator of our economic health is our economy. You know, how much is our GDP growing? How many of our people are employed? Do people have health insurance? And so if part of why we had debt was because we were dealing effectively with those issues, it wouldn't concern me very much. I am concerned that we are adding to our debt in ways that isn't helping those other problems. But I think you want to keep your eyes on the goal of fiscal policy, which is really to solve our problems, not, you know, green eyeshades. CORNISH: Jason Furman chaired the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama. He now teaches economics at Harvard's Kennedy School. Thank you for speaking with us.

And deficit hawks aren't really screeching? To talk about how we got here, what it might mean, is Bob Bryan. He's a senior policy reporter at Business Insider. Mr. Bryan, thanks so much for being with us. BOB BRYAN: Thanks for having me. SIMON: President Trump campaigned on a pledge to not just reduce the national debt but eliminate it. So how did we get to the biggest national debt ever? BRYAN: There's a long history, and there's a short history. The long of it is for the last 30 years, we haven't been taxing as much as we've spent. That's the simple way to put it. If you're looking in the short term, a lot of it is we're spending a lot of money on an aging population. In just the last few years, we've seen the Republican tax reform laws actually slash taxes, which has brought down the revenue coming into the country into the Treasury. And at the same time, Congress agreed to this two-year spending bill, which really raises the amount of money that we're spending on various programs. SIMON: Now, the whole logic, though, of cutting taxes, of course, was to increase public spending and thereby that bank shot would increase tax revenues, ultimately. BRYAN: Yeah, that's the idea. We've definitely seen corporate tax revenues drop off. Last year, we saw corporate tax revenues, after their tax rate was cut, fell off a cliff significantly. We haven't seen that on the personal side yet, but the idea is that even if you cut taxes and lower revenue in the short run, that the economy grows so much faster that your revenue is going to overall in aggregate get higher. At the same time, you know, our spending has been going up. So it's unclear whether or not that's really happened. SIMON: Now, years ago, I covered the bankruptcy of a great American city. And I know one of the problems that they had to confront was paying the debt service. They had to pay that off before anybody else got paid. BRYAN: Yeah. Debt service is a significant portion of the amount of debt that we're paying. In fact, there are reports that the debt service that we pay is going to grow larger than some of these major programs like Medicaid and Social Security in coming years. As interest rates go up as well, it becomes more expensive to pay it down. So not only the debt that we've accumulated is going up but also the amount that we are having to pay to pay off that debt also goes up. SIMON: Well, let me try and get hold of that statistic. You mean, it's possible that because the deficit is so large we might be paying more to service that debt than we're paying out to take care of people under Medicare or Social Security. BRYAN: Yeah. So as interest rates rise, too, it's going to get more expensive to pay it. So the amount we're going to have to put towards debt service is going to get significantly larger - at least projections say so. SIMON: Why do so few people no longer consider this a crisis? BRYAN: Politically, I think a lot of it is because doing the things that would be necessary to handle the debt are unpopular - cutting back Social Security, cutting back Medicare. It's tough to cut those because a lot of people depend on them, a lot of people like them. From an economist perspective, there actually is a growing school of thought that the debt isn't as big of a deal as we've made it out to be. There is a growing economic theory called Modern Monetary Theory that surmises that the number, this $22 trillion number, actually isn't the important part about the debt. It doesn't matter what the number really is. It's how it's affecting the economy. And so right now, we're still seeing a strong growth economy. The inflation is still low. SIMON: Do you see this deficit becoming politicized into an argument that entitlement programs like the ones you just mentioned should be slashed? BRYAN: So for years, politicians, especially in the Republican Party, have been saying that to get the debt under control, we need to address the big, long-term drivers of the debt. Those are Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. But actually getting around to cutting those programs is pretty difficult because it is so politically unpopular. SIMON: Now, I noticed President Trump at his press conference on Friday seemed to think that there were billions to be saved by coming back home from foreign wars, foreign deployments, which, we should remind ourselves, that used to be a Democratic principle. BRYAN: Right. And that is very much kind of, as Democrats have been saying for a long time, why do we need to cut these programs that Americans rely on when we're spending so much money in Iraq, Afghanistan and that sort of thing? And I certainly think that those are a large driver, but they don't take up as big of a slice as a lot of the programs, the entitlement programs and the stuff that we do back home.

Farmers and manufacturers have been affected for months. This latest round of talks puts more at stake for more people. Grant Gerlock of NET News in Nebraska reports. GRANT GERLOCK, BYLINE: In September, the Trump administration launched its biggest round of tariffs yet - a 10 percent tax on thousands of Chinese products, including a lot of everyday stuff. At this dollar store, I found a pair of pliers, some wall screws, eyeliner, a bath mat - all on the tariff list. But that doesn't mean the price on the tag is 10 percent higher. UCHE JARRETT: I can't stress to you how much companies care about maintaining that stability. GERLOCK: That's Uche Jarrett, who teaches international economics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. JARRETT: It drives their profit margins. It drives their estimates for the future. Whenever there is a change, there's a lot of uncertainty that follows. GERLOCK: Jarrett says so far, suppliers and retailers are shielding consumers from price hikes. They'd rather ding profits than lose customers. But soon consumers might have to pay up. The administration's tariffs are aimed at narrowing the trade deficit with China. If there's no deal by March 1, that 10 percent tariff will jump to 25 percent. Irv Blumkin is CEO of the home furnishings chain Nebraska Furniture Mart. He says a 25 percent tariff would lead to higher prices at his store for everything from carpet to patio furniture. IRV BLUMKIN: At 10 percent, you can come to a very minimal change. At 25 percent, it becomes a different deal. GERLOCK: Blumkin is concerned a higher tariff will scare away his shoppers. BLUMKIN: You know, they hear the news every day. And they see some of the uncertainties that are going on. And I think that impacts how people think. GERLOCK: Irv Blumkin says some manufacturers are moving their production to countries like Vietnam, Malaysia or Mexico. While importers are scrambling, you might think that American manufacturers are benefiting from the tariffs. But maybe not. Take Bison, a company in Lincoln, Neb. , that makes sports hardware. I met CEO Nick Cusick at a local YMCA, where some office workers were playing a round of pickup basketball. The rims, the backboards and the wall pads were all made by Bison. Almost all the parts and pieces were manufactured in the U. S. , too. NICK CUSICK: Since we do compete against a fair number of companies who buy offshore, you would think generally speaking that we would benefit from. . . GERLOCK: Yeah, aren't you supposed to be the winners in this thing? CUSICK: We're supposed to be the winners. GERLOCK: But Cusick says there's a problem. When the U. S. raised taxes on imported steel, the price for American steel skyrocketed by as much as 50 percent. Bison had to raise its prices this year to cover costs. CUSICK: But the end users - the schools, the consumers on our residential basketball side of our business - they're the ones that are getting hit. So it's kind of counterproductive. GERLOCK: Unless the U. S. reaches a deal with China in the next few weeks, more businesses will be raising prices. And that's when more consumers will begin to realize that trade wars come with a cost that they'll be feeling in their wallets. For NPR News, I'm Grant Gerlock.

Unemployment is low at 4 percent, and we learned this week of a record number of job openings. But this week, we also got some data on car loans. The number of Americans seriously delinquent on them reached a new high. So let's turn to NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben for what that all means. Hey, Danielle. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. Let's do the numbers. KURTZLEBEN: All right. So the data that we're talking about is from the New York Federal Reserve. And that data showed that a record 7 million people are seriously delinquent on their car loans. And by seriously delinquent I mean 90 days or more. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Wow. KURTZLEBEN: Yes. That's the highest level in the 19 years that the New York Fed has even been tracking that. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Why is that? KURTZLEBEN: Well, we have a few hints in the data. We don't know for sure. But delinquencies among people under 30, among young adults, have really climbed. As to what's behind that, it could be student debt. That has climbed in a huge way in recent years. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Indeed. KURTZLEBEN: Aside from that, we're seeing really high delinquencies among people with low credit scores. There is some indication that people are getting subprime auto loans, and they're falling delinquent on those. But the bottom line, as the New York Fed pointed out in its report on this, is that this may mean that, even while you have those really good headline numbers of unemployment, that the strong economy isn't benefiting everybody equally. GARCIA-NAVARRO: The economy, though, is strong. So if there's one bad indicator in the middle of that, how much weight should we give it? KURTZLEBEN: You're absolutely right, like you said at the top here, that the job market is looking really, really great. And amid all that, yeah. This is just one yellow flag. But that said, this is one yellow flag among several that have been popping up lately. For example, this week, we saw that retail sales fell in December by the largest amount since 2009. Aside from that, jobless claims, people coming forward and saying, hey, I need unemployment insurance - that also went up this week. So, no, this doesn't mean recession is coming this week, this month, even this year. But it does seem to show that amid this seemingly pretty strong economy, there are some soft spots. And that is worrying. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And you looked into what tools the government has to fight the next recession. What kind of tools do policymakers actually have? KURTZLEBEN: Long story short, they have fewer tools or maybe weaker tools than they did before the last recession. I mean, let's look at the Federal Reserve. A very simple way to think about it is the Fed uses interest rates like an accelerator pedal. It lowers those down when it wants to speed up the economy, right? Except right now that accelerator pedal is pretty close to the floor. Interest rates are already pretty low. The Fed has been raising them very, very slowly since the last recession. We kind of have a hangover there. Then, you go across Washington to Congress. OK. Congress controls the purse strings, except when you look fiscally, we have higher debt than we had before the last recession for a whole bunch of reasons. Now, economists do differ on how bad debt is for the economy. But either way, it appears there's less room there. And by the way, look at how much Congress is accomplishing these days. It's hard to imagine them easily coming to an agreement on what to do if we did have a downturn. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Downturns are inevitable because, as we've seen in economic history, things go up, things go down. KURTZLEBEN: Most definitely, yeah. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That is just the nature of the economic system. KURTZLEBEN: Yeah. GARCIA-NAVARRO: President Trump likes to talk about how strong the economy is right now. So if there's a downturn, does he get the blame? KURTZLEBEN: No. I mean, presidents can push policies that can boost the economy. They can potentially flub things that could hurt the economy. But in general, presidents can't steer it. So you can't give them full credit or full blame for big economic swings. Aside from that, you have a lot of these Democratic presidential candidates pushing really progressive policies aimed at helping Americans who are hurting economically, so promising better wages, better benefits. You even have some candidates talking about guaranteed jobs. And that's, you know, a very, very big, sweeping change. So I'm interested in - if we do have a downturn, could that affect how voters feel about those policies? Could that push some voters more progressive? GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben with many good questions. We'll be watching. Danielle, thanks so much. KURTZLEBEN: Thanks, Lulu. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:  The economy is rocking right along. Unemployment is low at 4 percent, and we learned this week of a record number of job openings. But this week, we also got some data on car loans. The number of Americans seriously delinquent on them reached a new high. So let's turn to NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben for what that all means. Hey, Danielle. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. Let's do the numbers. KURTZLEBEN: All right. So the data that we're talking about is from the New York Federal Reserve. And that data showed that a record 7 million people are seriously delinquent on their car loans. And by seriously delinquent I mean 90 days or more. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Wow. KURTZLEBEN: Yes. That's the highest level in the 19 years that the New York Fed has even been tracking that. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Why is that? KURTZLEBEN: Well, we have a few hints in the data. We don't know for sure. But delinquencies among people under 30, among young adults, have really climbed. As to what's behind that, it could be student debt. That has climbed in a huge way in recent years. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Indeed. KURTZLEBEN: Aside from that, we're seeing really high delinquencies among people with low credit scores. There is some indication that people are getting subprime auto loans, and they're falling delinquent on those. But the bottom line, as the New York Fed pointed out in its report on this, is that this may mean that, even while you have those really good headline numbers of unemployment, that the strong economy isn't benefiting everybody equally. GARCIA-NAVARRO: The economy, though, is strong. So if there's one bad indicator in the middle of that, how much weight should we give it? KURTZLEBEN: You're absolutely right, like you said at the top here, that the job market is looking really, really great. And amid all that, yeah. This is just one yellow flag. But that said, this is one yellow flag among several that have been popping up lately. For example, this week, we saw that retail sales fell in December by the largest amount since 2009. Aside from that, jobless claims, people coming forward and saying, hey, I need unemployment insurance - that also went up this week. So, no, this doesn't mean recession is coming this week, this month, even this year. But it does seem to show that amid this seemingly pretty strong economy, there are some soft spots. And that is worrying. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And you looked into what tools the government has to fight the next recession. What kind of tools do policymakers actually have? KURTZLEBEN: Long story short, they have fewer tools or maybe weaker tools than they did before the last recession. I mean, let's look at the Federal Reserve. A very simple way to think about it is the Fed uses interest rates like an accelerator pedal. It lowers those down when it wants to speed up the economy, right? Except right now that accelerator pedal is pretty close to the floor. Interest rates are already pretty low. The Fed has been raising them very, very slowly since the last recession. We kind of have a hangover there. Then, you go across Washington to Congress. OK. Congress controls the purse strings, except when you look fiscally, we have higher debt than we had before the last recession for a whole bunch of reasons. Now, economists do differ on how bad debt is for the economy. But either way, it appears there's less room there. And by the way, look at how much Congress is accomplishing these days. It's hard to imagine them easily coming to an agreement on what to do if we did have a downturn. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Downturns are inevitable because, as we've seen in economic history, things go up, things go down. KURTZLEBEN: Most definitely, yeah. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That is just the nature of the economic system. KURTZLEBEN: Yeah. GARCIA-NAVARRO: President Trump likes to talk about how strong the economy is right now. So if there's a downturn, does he get the blame? KURTZLEBEN: No. I mean, presidents can push policies that can boost the economy. They can potentially flub things that could hurt the economy. But in general, presidents can't steer it. So you can't give them full credit or full blame for big economic swings. Aside from that, you have a lot of these Democratic presidential candidates pushing really progressive policies aimed at helping Americans who are hurting economically, so promising better wages, better benefits. You even have some candidates talking about guaranteed jobs. And that's, you know, a very, very big, sweeping change. So I'm interested in - if we do have a downturn, could that affect how voters feel about those policies? Could that push some voters more progressive? GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben with many good questions. We'll be watching. Danielle, thanks so much.

Harvard economist Ken Rogoff does not want to get rid of cash, but he does see problems with it. So we called him to ask why and ask what getting rid of cash would mean to our society. Professor Rogoff, hey there. KEN ROGOFF: Greetings. KELLY: Greetings to you. So as we just heard from that 70 percent figure, a lot of us still like cash. You can touch it. It's easy. You don't like cash. Why not? ROGOFF: Well, what I object to is people buying apartments in Trump Tower with suitcases of cash, buying $50,000 cars, engaged, of course, in drug transactions, human trafficking, whatever. A lot of people have perfectly healthy, good uses for cash. I have no moral objections to it. And I think for small transactions, it's still a big deal. KELLY: Yeah. You can't tip your housekeeper at a hotel if you don't have, you know, five bucks on hand or 20 bucks or whatever. You can't do it with a debit card. ROGOFF: Not in our country, anyway - in Sweden, maybe you can. But yes. But the question is, most of our cash is in $100 bills. And I don't know about you and your friends, but most of mine do not have $1,000 worth of $100 bills in their family of four. And that's really, I think, where a rethinking is needed. KELLY: How much should we be worried about some Americans being left behind in a cashless society? ROGOFF: If we literally go cashless, then obviously, it would be a problem. But I don't think anyone, even the Swedes, are talking about that. It's really reducing the amount of cash. By the way, something a number of countries have already done - and we should do - is give people free debit accounts. You could save a lot of money because most of the low-income people who'd be getting free debit accounts, the government's transferring money to anyway. And it's kind of expensive to process the checks. KELLY: You mentioned Sweden. They are way farther along this path towards a cashless society than the U. S. is. We had a story out of Sweden recently on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, where there were mixed views - some Swedes feeling like this is maybe going too far, too fast; others feeling like, what's the problem? - especially the younger generation. Do you think Sweden is where the U. S. is headed? Is that our future? ROGOFF: We are already where Sweden was, say, five or seven years ago. And in another five or seven years, we will be where Sweden is today. KELLY: Meaning what? How will our daily lives look different, do you think? ROGOFF: Well, I already stand in line at Starbucks in Harvard Square. And when I get to the front of the line, I'm the only one using cash. I'm old. I still use it. KELLY: (Laughter). ROGOFF: I think it'll look more and more like that in many places. KELLY: What should we be doing, as a society, to get ready for this other than - I don't know - charging up our Apple apps and our debit cards? ROGOFF: Most people will be able to adjust at the pace that they want to. There are these new technologies that I can't even keep up with even though I work on the topic. KELLY: Do you have a Venmo account, may I ask? ROGOFF: My children do. I don't. Otherwise, they'd want me to Venmo them money all the time. KELLY: (Laughter). ROGOFF: I think we have to, say, coordinate state regulation. KELLY: OK. ROGOFF: There has to be views about how big cash transactions should be. The U. S. is really trailing a lot of the rest of the world in getting around to this. KELLY: Yeah. ROGOFF: But by and large, technology will play out and will adjust. It won't be as fast as people think. And by the way, I don't believe it'll be cryptocurrencies. I think it'll be simpler digital mechanisms. There are some vulnerabilities we need to cover - like cybersecurity. We're there already on having to worry about that. But I think we are headed to a less-cash society whether people want to recognize it or not.

S. , Europe, China and Japan have lots of differences but one common problem - their populations are aging. Each faces a future with a shortage of young workers, but the United States has one big advantage - immigrants. And we wanted to talk about this with David Wessel. He directs the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and is a contributor to The Wall Street Journal. Hi there, David. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning. GREENE: All right. So the oldest baby boomers are in their early 70s now. And you know, we hear so much about the graying of America. But how does our country compare to other big countries? WESSEL: Well, we're all getting older - that is, the share of the population over age 65 is growing - both because each woman in these societies is having fewer kids and because life expectancies are rising. We're simply living longer. But this phenomenon is more rapid outside the United States. So if you look at projections - the Population Research Bureau has some - and you look ahead to 2050 - that's 30 years from now - about 22 percent of the people in the U. S. will be over 65. But it'll be 26 percent and China, 31 percent and Germany and 36 percent in Japan. GREENE: All right. So I mentioned, though, that the United States has a real advantage. Describe it for me. WESSEL: Right. The reason we say it's an advantage is because economics of this are straightforward. The more working-age people you have to support each retiree, the easier it will be for working-age people to both care for old folks and enjoy rising living standards themselves. So what we have in the U. S. is, simply, even though fertility is down here over time - fewer kids per woman than it used to be - we're still significantly more fertile than the rest of the world - or at least more than Germany, Italy, Japan and China. And second, we have, as you said earlier, a lot more immigrants. If you can't grow your own, you can import them. And the immigrants are usually younger than the people already here, more likely to be workers than retirees. And immigrant women tend to have more kids than their native counterparts. So if you look ahead to 2050, the Pew Research Center says if we had no immigrants at all, the U. S. population would stop growing. The number of people dying would equal the number of births. GREENE: OK. So a larger population - if we talk about economics, does faster-growing population also mean a faster-growing economy? WESSEL: Yes. I mean, the more people, the more workers, the more consumers, the bigger the economy. But what really matters is not the top line GDP growth; it's how big the economy is per person. So if you think of Nigeria - Nigeria's population is growing at 2. 6 percent a year. That means, in order to give the same amount of stuff to people, its economy has to grow by 2. 6 percent a year. But in the U. S. , our population is growing much more slowly despite immigration, less than 1 percent a year. So we can deliver more stuff per person with a much slower economic growth rate. But I think the important thing is, it's not only the number of people that matters; it's their age. The more working people, the easier it is to care for the large and growing number of retirees - the more people paying taxes for Social Security, Medicare and so forth - and the more workers available to care for the growing number of elderly. And that's where immigration plays a really important role. GREENE: So can we say definitively that immigrants are a plus for the overall economy, or is it complicated? WESSEL: Well, it's really hard to talk emotionally about immigration. I'm the son of immigrants. But if you just look at government budgets, the National Academy of Sciences panel found that it's a plus for federal government and it's a minus for many state and local governments because they have to pay for schools for so many of the immigrants' kids.

That's according to federal statistics. People charged with or convicted of even minor offenses can face consequences long after they have paid their debts to society. A criminal record can be a barrier to finding a job, a home or getting a loan. In the past two years, though, many states and cities have been passing or expanding laws to help restore rights. NPR's Eric Westervelt has been looking into this and joins us now. Hey, Eric. ERIC WESTERVELT, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: Can you just remind us of what the extent of the barriers are? WESTERVELT: Yeah. Lawyers who work in this area say, look, you can't underestimate, you know, how much a conviction, even for a misdemeanor - and the vast majority of convictions in America are for misdemeanors - can have this ripple effect and relegate someone with a record to a kind of permanent second-class status as they try to get their life back in order. I mean, take the case of Jay Jordan. Jay served seven years in prison for felony robbery when he was young. He's been out for nearly eight years. He's completed his probation. He has no offenses, not even a traffic ticket. And he told me he still faces almost daily hurdles as he tries to get his life back to normal. JAY JORDAN: You know, I tried to adopt - right? - was turned down, tried to volunteer at school, was turned down, tried to sell insurance, was turned down, tried to sell used cars, was turned down. So, you know, every single step of the way when I try to better myself and, you know, be able to take care of myself and my family, there are these massive barriers, right? And I'm not alone. WESTERVELT: He now works for a nonprofit, Rachel, that advocates for the rights of the formerly incarcerated. And really, the question his group is asking is how long should these convictions be on somebody's record, especially when people have done their time and want to move on and become good citizens. MARTIN: So there are a lot of states that are trying to change this, right? I mean, my understanding, more than 20 states have passed some kind of laws or made changes to lower these barriers. Why is it happening now? WESTERVELT: I think two things, Rachel, are driving this. More people on the right and the left agree that mass incarceration and the drug war has just clogged the courts and prisons, you know, and has hurt society and the economy. One study shows that unemployment among formerly incarcerated is 27 percent and even higher for African-Americans, over 30 percent. Number two, I think the legalization of marijuana is a key driver here. Again, there's, you know, this bipartisan sense that it doesn't make sense that people are still paying a big price for something that's now either legal or decriminalized in many states. And one of the most progressive laws that was passed is in Indiana, a solidly Republican state. Barbara Brosher is a reporter with our member station WFIU in Bloomington. She's part of NPR's criminal justice collaborative, a new reporting partnership with some of our member stations. And Barbara looked into how Indianapolis is helping people who want a second chance. Let's take a listen to her story. BARBARA BROSHER, BYLINE: When Indianapolis residents with a criminal record want to turn their lives around, many of them end up in the subbasement of the downtown city county building. The long, gray corridor has concrete walls and almost resembles a jail, but people come to this underground room to escape their criminal pasts. Through one of the only open doors is a large, quiet room. Bold black letters on the back wall say, don't look back. You're not going that way. A young volunteer is helping a man fill out some paperwork. UNIDENTIFIED VOLUNTEER: And if you don't mind signing right there, right there. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Awesome. UNIDENTIFIED VOLUNTEER: Are you turning it in today or tomorrow? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Yes, if I can. BROSHER: This is the Neighborhood Christian Legal Clinic's Expungement Help Desk. They help people file petitions to expunge their records under Indiana's Second Chance law, which legislators passed a few years ago. While it's called expungement, it doesn't actually erase arrests or charges. It just hides them from public view so they won't pop up during a background check. That's what kept happening to Latosha Poston before she came here for help. LATOSHA POSTON: Sometime we get stuck on our past and let our past guide us. BROSHER: She's 44 now but ran into trouble shortly after she had her first daughter as a teen. She racked up a lot of arrests over the next two decades for everything from public intoxication to receiving stolen property. But long after she changed, Poston says the charges dogged her. POSTON: I was asked to move from a low-income apartment because every year they do your re-certification. And I had, like, three theft charges and receiving stolen property, which in low income you can't have that. BROSHER: Poston says getting her records expunged helped her land a much better job in a hospital after working in home health care for nearly 20 years. She's among thousands of people filing petitions under the Second Chance law. The process appears pretty simple. You file a petition with the court. And for more minor offenses, it must grant the request to seal the record if it meets requirements laid out in the law. A judge has discretion with more serious felonies, and victims can give input. The prosecutor's office reviews petitions and can object to sealing records. It helps that Marion County prosecutor Terry Curry advocated for the expungement law. TERRY CURRY: If our goal is to have individuals not reoffend, then in our mind it's appropriate to limit or remove obstacles that are going to inhibit their ability to become productive members of our community. BROSHER: The process is time-consuming and costly. There are filing fees for every petition, and there are still plenty of people who don't even know expungement is an option. That's why Poston tries to tell everyone she knows about the help desk. It took her a couple of trips down here and 47 days of waiting before the state sealed her records. POSTON: It felt like something was lifted off because now I feel like - kind of feel like a human. MARTIN: Interesting to hear what a difference these so-called second chance laws can make in people's lives. If there is, as you say, Eric, a lot of bipartisan support for these kinds of changes, why isn't it everywhere? WESTERVELT: Well, I spoke with an attorney who's worked on this issue for nearly 30 years, Margaret Love. She heads the Collateral Consequences Resource Center. And as she put it, state legislatures are all reinventing the wheel here and not talking to each other. They're not sort of sharing best practices or studying what programs have the best outcome. And defender offices that help people clear their records, they're often, you know, overworked, understaffed and underfunded. MARTIN: NPR's Eric Westervelt. We also heard a report from Barbara Brosher of WFIU in Bloomington. She's with NPR's criminal justice reporting collaborative. Eric, thanks so much for bringing this to us. WESTERVELT: You're welcome. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Here's a startling figure - almost 1 in 4 American adults has a criminal record. That's according to federal statistics.

JAY JORDAN: You know, I tried to adopt - right? - was turned down, tried to volunteer at school, was turned down, tried to sell insurance, was turned down, tried to sell used cars, was turned down. So, you know, every single step of the way when I try to better myself and, you know, be able to take care of myself and my family, there are these massive barriers, right? And I'm not alone. WESTERVELT: He now works for a nonprofit, Rachel, that advocates for the rights of the formerly incarcerated. And really, the question his group is asking is how long should these convictions be on somebody's record, especially when people have done their time and want to move on and become good citizens. MARTIN: So there are a lot of states that are trying to change this, right? I mean, my understanding, more than 20 states have passed some kind of laws or made changes to lower these barriers. Why is it happening now? WESTERVELT: I think two things, Rachel, are driving this. More people on the right and the left agree that mass incarceration and the drug war has just clogged the courts and prisons, you know, and has hurt society and the economy. One study shows that unemployment among formerly incarcerated is 27 percent and even higher for African-Americans, over 30 percent. Number two, I think the legalization of marijuana is a key driver here. Again, there's, you know, this bipartisan sense that it doesn't make sense that people are still paying a big price for something that's now either legal or decriminalized in many states. And one of the most progressive laws that was passed is in Indiana, a solidly Republican state. Barbara Brosher is a reporter with our member station WFIU in Bloomington. She's part of NPR's criminal justice collaborative, a new reporting partnership with some of our member stations. And Barbara looked into how Indianapolis is helping people who want a second chance. Let's take a listen to her story. BARBARA BROSHER, BYLINE: When Indianapolis residents with a criminal record want to turn their lives around, many of them end up in the subbasement of the downtown city county building. The long, gray corridor has concrete walls and almost resembles a jail, but people come to this underground room to escape their criminal pasts. Through one of the only open doors is a large, quiet room. Bold black letters on the back wall say, don't look back. You're not going that way. A young volunteer is helping a man fill out some paperwork. UNIDENTIFIED VOLUNTEER: And if you don't mind signing right there, right there. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Awesome. UNIDENTIFIED VOLUNTEER: Are you turning it in today or tomorrow? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Yes, if I can. BROSHER: This is the Neighborhood Christian Legal Clinic's Expungement Help Desk. They help people file petitions to expunge their records under Indiana's Second Chance law, which legislators passed a few years ago. While it's called expungement, it doesn't actually erase arrests or charges. It just hides them from public view so they won't pop up during a background check. That's what kept happening to Latosha Poston before she came here for help. LATOSHA POSTON: Sometime we get stuck on our past and let our past guide us. BROSHER: She's 44 now but ran into trouble shortly after she had her first daughter as a teen. She racked up a lot of arrests over the next two decades for everything from public intoxication to receiving stolen property. But long after she changed, Poston says the charges dogged her. POSTON: I was asked to move from a low-income apartment because every year they do your re-certification. And I had, like, three theft charges and receiving stolen property, which in low income you can't have that. BROSHER: Poston says getting her records expunged helped her land a much better job in a hospital after working in home health care for nearly 20 years. She's among thousands of people filing petitions under the Second Chance law. The process appears pretty simple. You file a petition with the court. And for more minor offenses, it must grant the request to seal the record if it meets requirements laid out in the law. A judge has discretion with more serious felonies, and victims can give input. The prosecutor's office reviews petitions and can object to sealing records. It helps that Marion County prosecutor Terry Curry advocated for the expungement law. TERRY CURRY: If our goal is to have individuals not reoffend, then in our mind it's appropriate to limit or remove obstacles that are going to inhibit their ability to become productive members of our community. BROSHER: The process is time-consuming and costly. There are filing fees for every petition, and there are still plenty of people who don't even know expungement is an option. That's why Poston tries to tell everyone she knows about the help desk. It took her a couple of trips down here and 47 days of waiting before the state sealed her records. POSTON: It felt like something was lifted off because now I feel like - kind of feel like a human. MARTIN: Interesting to hear what a difference these so-called second chance laws can make in people's lives. If there is, as you say, Eric, a lot of bipartisan support for these kinds of changes, why isn't it everywhere? WESTERVELT: Well, I spoke with an attorney who's worked on this issue for nearly 30 years, Margaret Love. She heads the Collateral Consequences Resource Center. And as she put it, state legislatures are all reinventing the wheel here and not talking to each other. They're not sort of sharing best practices or studying what programs have the best outcome. And defender offices that help people clear their records, they're often, you know, overworked, understaffed and underfunded. MARTIN: NPR's Eric Westervelt. We also heard a report from Barbara Brosher of WFIU in Bloomington. She's with NPR's criminal justice reporting collaborative. Eric, thanks so much for bringing this to us.

I'm in Gilroy, south of San Francisco, at the Christopher Ranch, the largest garlic producer in the country. Ken Christopher, executive vice president, tells me it didn't always look this busy. In the 1990s, he says, the industry was hit hard by cheap Chinese garlic imports. KEN CHRISTOPHER: U. S. garlic was trading around $40 dollars a box in the 1990s. Chinese garlic flooded the market, and at $10 dollars a box. And it severely undercut a lot of U. S. growers. GARSD: Only a few garlic farms survived. Christopher Ranch was the biggest. Christopher says about 6 percent of its garlic is bought from China. The rest is home-grown. CHRISTOPHER: It was really hard. You know, we're talking reduction in workforce. We're talking reduction in work hours. We had furlough days, just simply, just to get through the year. GARSD: The struggle went on for years. Then in 2016, Donald Trump was elected president, and his stance on Chinese imports was pretty clear - tax them.

GARSD: Christopher flew out to Washington last year to testify in favor of tariffs on Chinese garlic. That would mean Chinese garlic at your supermarket would be way more expensive than American-grown. When he talks about tariffs, Christopher's face lights up. He says his dream tax on Chinese garlic is over 400 percent. In the end, the Trump administration went for a 10 percent tariff. He remembers when it was announced. CHRISTOPHER: My co-workers and I, sort of texting each other, email sort of flying back and forth. A co-worker of mine actually got me the flag that was flying above the U. S. Capitol the day they got enacted. GARSD: The ranch says their garlic sales are up by about 20 percent since last year. They've even had to pull garlic from storage to meet increased demand. But like most American agriculture, a lot of this town's labor force is immigrant. And the Trump administration's crackdown on undocumented labor has hit many California farmers hard. Christopher says he thinks about this all the time. CHRISTOPHER: If the Republican Party is pro-business, if they want to support industries across the country, they need to realize that immigration is a critical function of that. GARSD: Driving through downtown Gilroy, it's clear this town has close ties to Mexico. The streets are lined with taquerias, discotecas, and there are sites in the outskirts that house migrant workers.

Leading the U. S. delegation is U. S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer. Lighthizer is a lawyer with more than four decades of experience in Washington trade battles. He grew up in a steel port town on Lake Erie. And it is that experience that helped turn him into a major skeptic of free trade. NPR's Jim Zarroli has this profile. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Last October, President Trump unveiled a trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. It had taken months to negotiate. And as he did, he turned to shake hands with a tall, unassuming man who stood behind him holding a folder filled with papers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No matter when you called him, he was in the office or he was in somebody else's office doing the same thing. Bob Lighthizer's great. I've heard it for years. I said, if I ever do this, I want to get Lighthizer to represent us because he felt the way I did. ZARROLI: With Robert Lighthizer, Trump has a trade representative who very much shares his hardball views on trade, if not his pugnacious style. Take China, for instance. Way back in the '90s, Lighthizer was warning that China was no ordinary market economy. It didn't play by the rules. If American markets were open to Chinese imports, he said, no U. S. factory job would be safe. And Lighthizer's views on China haven't changed over the years. Here's a speech from 2017. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ROBERT LIGHTHIZER: The sheer scale of their coordinated efforts to develop their economy, to subsidize, to create national champions and to distort markets is a threat to the world trading system that is unprecedented. ZARROLI: And Lighthizer has been a big critic of trade deals like NAFTA. He warned that they would devastate American manufacturing. In Washington, where one administration after another preached the gospel of free trade, Lighthizer's views placed him outside the mainstream for a long time, says Edward Alden of the Council on Foreign Relations. EDWARD ALDEN: The view in Washington has been that opening up trade is good for the United States and good for the other countries involved. Lighthizer is a professed economic nationalist. He's very much about what's in it for the United States. ZARROLI: But Lighthizer is well-respected, even by those he's clashed with such as former U. S. trade representative Mickey Kantor, who helped negotiate NAFTA for the Clinton administration. Kantor says he's often been at odds with Lighthizer. But he concedes that Lighthizer has a deep understanding of trade law. MICKEY KANTOR: Well, he's bright. He's experienced. He's confident. He is - certainly understands these issues backwards and forwards. ZARROLI: But Lighthizer also has fans in some even more unusual places. He's well-respected by unions and by people on the left, such as Lori Wallach, a leading opponent of trade deals. LORI WALLACH: Bob Lighthizer's kind of like the unicorn USTR. It's like a mythical beast who, actually, by merits of his past work, has relationships with Democrats in Congress and with unions and has relationships with businesses and with Republicans. ZARROLI: Wallach, founder of Global Trade Watch, remembers listening to Lighthizer speak out against NAFTA in the '90s. She was surprised at her own reaction. WALLACH: Which was, that's kind of scary. That right-wing Reagan administration Republican trade guy is saying things that I 70 percent agree with. ZARROLI: Since then, they've often worked together in trade battles. And they talk regularly. Lighthizer's skepticism about free trade was shaped, in part, by his background. He grew up in relative comfort in the Ohio city of Ashtabula. Mark Plagakis (ph) worked with him at a summer job in a grocery store. MARK PLAGAKIS: He was a good kid, handsome, well-spoken. His dad was a doctor, which, in Ashtabula at that time, was, you know, elite social status. ZARROLI: The Ashtabula of Lighthizer's childhood was a thriving port town. It shipped in iron ore for steel mills and shipped out coal from Kentucky and West Virginia. But much of that is gone today. Former union official Ray Gruber (ph) drove me around town on a cold, overcast day, past empty storefronts and faded frame houses. These days, much less freight comes through Ashtabula's port. And many of its manufacturers have fled. RAY GRUBER: The big plants have all moved out. And that happened late '70s, early '80s. I think there was a lot of shock and awe because now all of a sudden, you've got a thousand people who are looking for work. ZARROLI: Those who know him say Lighthizer brings up Ashtabula's decline in conversation and that it's affected his views on trade. Leo Gerard is president of the United Steelworkers. LEO GERARD: He grew up in a working-class town. And he knows how people have suffered by losing jobs. And I suspect that that's part of why he went into the - that part of the legal profession. ZARROLI: As a lawyer, Lighthizer represented the steel industry in Washington. He also worked on trade policy in the Reagan administration. At the time, his target was Japan, which was seen as a big threat to American manufacturing jobs. Lighthizer helped push Tokyo to accept limits on how much it exported to the U. S. , says Edward Alden. ALDEN: I think the Japan experience told him the only way you make progress is through threats that you're prepared to carry out to restrict access to the world's largest market, which is the United States. ZARROLI: Now Lighthizer is trying to make the same threats against China. He sees China as an even more formidable adversary than Japan. Its markets remain largely closed to outsiders, he says. Intellectual property theft is a huge problem. Here's what Lighthizer said in 2017. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LIGHTHIZER: Expect change. Expect new approaches. And expect action. ZARROLI: Now as the country's chief negotiator on trade, Lighthizer is in a position to do something about it. And those who know him say Lighthizer, at 71, used this as his last best chance to reverse the decline of cities such as Ashtabula, the town he grew up in. Jim Zarroli, NPR News.

And the big question here is, will there be progress on ending a trade war between the world's two biggest economies? Trade talks have been going on ahead of a March 1 deadline. If there's no deal by then, U. S. tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise from 10 percent to 25 percent. Stephen Moore is with us. He's an economist at the Heritage Foundation and has been an informal economic adviser to President Trump. Welcome back. STEPHEN MOORE: Hi, David. GREENE: So how close have you been to these discussions? MOORE: Well, I've been following them pretty closely, as everyone has. And I've been in touch with the people who are doing the negotiating for the Trump team. This has been a rather tedious process. It's gone on now for the last year and a half or so. Now we're - we've got D-Day coming up March 1, which is only a week away. GREENE: It's getting close. MOORE: (Laughter) And a - look. The latest signs are pretty positive. But, you know. . . GREENE: What do you mean? What's positive? MOORE: Well, Donald Trump tweeted out that he felt progress was in the right direction. That's a very important thing because, like, this comes down to two people, David. It comes down to Donald Trump. And it comes down to President Xi and China and Beijing, whether they want to get this deal done. Look. I think the implications of not getting the deal done are disastrous for China. And they will hurt the United States as well. Trump will move forward with that 25 percent tariff threat if he feels that the negotiations haven't reached the point he wants. But the latest indication is that Trump wants to get a deal done. We believe that Beijing wants to get it done. And if that happens, by the way, I think the implications for the economy of both countries will be very positive. You know, if it doesn't - if the deal doesn't get done, you know, I think it could have severe negative effects for both countries. So this is a really important moment (laughter), you know, we're arriving at. GREENE: Well, can I ask you about the policy and the substance here? - because, I mean. . . MOORE: Yeah. GREENE: . . . That - there have been key issues for the U. S. , like allowing. . . MOORE: Yeah. GREENE: . . . American products into Chinese markets on a level. . . MOORE: Yeah. GREENE: . . . Playing field and respecting. . . MOORE: Yup. GREENE: . . . Intellectual property rights. . . MOORE: Yup. GREENE: . . . For American firms. I mean, have there been concessions from China here? MOORE: Well, certainly on the issue of China buying more products. What's on the table right now is that China will buy about $30 billion a year more of our agricultural products - our soybeans, our wheat, our cotton. That's important for American farmers. It would reduce our trade, you know, imbalance with China, so that would be a positive thing. Trump also wants the Chinese to buy more of our manufactured goods - more of our petroleum products and so on. So that seems to be moving on a good course. GREENE: But beyond buying more stuff, I mean, some of these really tough things, like China respecting intellectual property. . . MOORE: Yes. GREENE: I mean, are they sending signals that they would concede on that? MOORE: Yes. But here's the problem, David. And I - this is where I've talked to the trade negotiators on our side. And they're saying, look. It's been like pulling wisdom teeth trying to get the Chinese to make real concessions. And here's the point that the Trump team has made, which is it's one thing for China to agree on paper to do something. It's quite another for them to actually do what they promised that they're going to do. And so, you know, Trump has said many times it's almost like the old Reagan maxim when he was negotiating with the Soviets on, you know, arms issues. It's trust, but verify. And Trump is going to require that China not only make, you know, a deal but also that there are metrics that they have to meet. In other words, if they don't make those metrics, then he's going to use that club of the tariffs. . . GREENE: So we might not know if this is a success. Even if they celebrate some sort of success, we might not know for some time. MOORE: Yeah. This is just a deal to make a deal at this point (laughter). GREENE: OK. Stephen Moore, an economist with the Heritage Foundation, informal adviser to President Trump, always appreciate having you on the program. Thanks. MOORE: Thank you, David. DAVID GREENE, HOST:   Today China's vice premier will be at the White House, likely meeting with President Trump. And the big question here is, will there be progress on ending a trade war between the world's two biggest economies? Trade talks have been going on ahead of a March 1 deadline. If there's no deal by then, U. S. tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise from 10 percent to 25 percent. Stephen Moore is with us. He's an economist at the Heritage Foundation and has been an informal economic adviser to President Trump. Welcome back. STEPHEN MOORE: Hi, David. GREENE: So how close have you been to these discussions? MOORE: Well, I've been following them pretty closely, as everyone has. And I've been in touch with the people who are doing the negotiating for the Trump team. This has been a rather tedious process. It's gone on now for the last year and a half or so. Now we're - we've got D-Day coming up March 1, which is only a week away. GREENE: It's getting close. MOORE: (Laughter) And a - look. The latest signs are pretty positive. But, you know. . . GREENE: What do you mean? What's positive? MOORE: Well, Donald Trump tweeted out that he felt progress was in the right direction. That's a very important thing because, like, this comes down to two people, David. It comes down to Donald Trump. And it comes down to President Xi and China and Beijing, whether they want to get this deal done. Look. I think the implications of not getting the deal done are disastrous for China. And they will hurt the United States as well. Trump will move forward with that 25 percent tariff threat if he feels that the negotiations haven't reached the point he wants. But the latest indication is that Trump wants to get a deal done. We believe that Beijing wants to get it done. And if that happens, by the way, I think the implications for the economy of both countries will be very positive. You know, if it doesn't - if the deal doesn't get done, you know, I think it could have severe negative effects for both countries. So this is a really important moment (laughter), you know, we're arriving at. GREENE: Well, can I ask you about the policy and the substance here? - because, I mean. . . MOORE: Yeah. GREENE: . . . That - there have been key issues for the U. S. , like allowing. . . MOORE: Yeah. GREENE: . . . American products into Chinese markets on a level. . . MOORE: Yeah. GREENE: . . . Playing field and respecting. . . MOORE: Yup. GREENE: . . . Intellectual property rights. . . MOORE: Yup. GREENE: . . . For American firms. I mean, have there been concessions from China here? MOORE: Well, certainly on the issue of China buying more products. What's on the table right now is that China will buy about $30 billion a year more of our agricultural products - our soybeans, our wheat, our cotton. That's important for American farmers. It would reduce our trade, you know, imbalance with China, so that would be a positive thing. Trump also wants the Chinese to buy more of our manufactured goods - more of our petroleum products and so on. So that seems to be moving on a good course. GREENE: But beyond buying more stuff, I mean, some of these really tough things, like China respecting intellectual property. . . MOORE: Yes.

JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Economic forecasters began to get pretty gloomy late last year. Stocks were plummeting, and there were signs the economies of China and Europe were slowing. Today the Commerce Department said the U. S. economy grew by a very respectable 2. 6 percent during the last quarter of the year. Jared Bernstein is a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. JARED BERNSTEIN: I think we should be encouraged in the sense that if you were thinking a recession is right around the corner, it just doesn't seem to be the case. ZARROLI: Throughout the quarter, businesses remained confident. They spent money on new equipment and software. The U. S. exported more. The growth rate for the year as a whole turned out to be around 3 percent, which was what the White House had projected. But the report also suggested the U. S. economy was losing steam as the year went on. During the first half of last year, the economy was enjoying the effects of the 2017 tax cut, as well as a big government spending bill. Both helped juice the economy, and growth peaked in the second quarter, Bernstein says. BERNSTEIN: We enjoyed what will probably, ultimately, be a year and a half of above-trend growth because of stimulus from the tax cuts and government spending, both deficit finance. ZARROLI: As 2018 dragged on, growth fell from 4. 2 percent to 3. 4 percent to 2. 6 percent. BERNSTEIN: That's important because it belies this claim that the tax cuts have permanently put us on a faster growth path. ZARROLI: Now many economists expect growth to slow even further to 2 percent or less as the impact of the tax cut wanes. Ben Herzon is executive director at IHS Markit. BEN HERZON: It does go a long way to explaining some of the strength in 2018. But that boost to growth that we're seeing is - that we had seen from that is probably going to fade.

It hasn't been tried before in the United States, at least. Greg Rosalsky from our Planet Money team reports it has been tried in Europe, and it didn't go well. GREG ROSALSKY, BYLINE: A wealth tax is like a property tax. But instead of just real estate, it covers all forms of wealth - cash, stocks, diamonds, horses, super yachts, basically, everything. Senator Warren's proposal would impose a 2 percent annual tax on every bit of a person's net worth over $50 million and also an extra 1 percent tax on billionaires. GABRIEL ZUCMAN: The main justification for the wealth tax is that it's the most powerful tool to limit the rise in wealth inequality. ROSALSKY: That's Gabriel Zucman, an economist at UC Berkeley who studies wealth inequality. He helped design Warren's wealth tax. ZUCMAN: So Senator Warren was interested in proposing a wealth tax, and she knew about our work on wealth inequality in the U. S. ROSALSKY: Zucman's research showed that the top 1 percent has been gobbling up a greater and greater share of national wealth, which is why he supports a wealth tax. But while the wealth tax would be a new policy for the U. S. government, it's actually been tried before. SARAH PERRET: And they actually used to be quite popular in European countries. ROSALSKY: That's Sarah Perret, a tax economist at the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. She says wealth taxes didn't work that well in Europe. PERRET: And so the trend has really been to repeal them. ROSALSKY: In 1990, there were 12 countries in Europe that had a wealth tax. Today there are only three. Perret says they didn't work for a lot of reasons. Among other things, it costs a lot to enforce. It pushed rich people out of the country, and the wealth taxes didn't raise a lot of revenue. PERRET: That was mainly because many assets were exempt, and wealth taxes were easy to avoid. ROSALSKY: So when Perret looks at the policy's track record. . . PERRET: I would say, in general, it hasn't been great. ROSALSKY: Warren argues her proposal learns from the failures in Europe. She told us in an email, quote, \"I specifically designed this proposal to account for lessons learned from wealth taxes in other countries,\" unquote. Unlike in the European Union, it's hard for Americans to freely move to another country or state and escape national taxes. On top of that, the Warren plan imposes an exit tax, which would confiscate 40 percent of a person's wealth over $50 million if they renounce their citizenship. But the plan's key difference, Zucman says. . . ZUCMAN: It's only for people who have more than $50 million in wealth - ultra-wealthy individuals. ROSALSKY: In Europe, the tax affected a much bigger percentage of the population. Zucman believes that helped the rich lobby for all sorts of exemptions on business assets and pensions and artwork. It made for a leaky bucket. ZUCMAN: That's what killed, basically, the European wealth taxes - these exemptions. ROSALSKY: But Warren says that her proposal, which has no exemptions, will play out differently in the United States. Greg Rosalsky, NPR News.

S. But the Bay Area has become a notoriously difficult place for the food industry. All sorts of restaurants are closing their doors. One reason they're struggling - the cost of housing. It has soared, and restaurant workers say they can't afford to live in the area. NPR's Jasmine Garsd reports. JASMINE GARSD, BYLINE: Every morning, Armando Ibarra wakes up in the back of his van. He's been living here in his car for the last couple of years. ARMANDO IBARRA: I wake up in the morning - 5:00 in the morning. GARSD: On the dashboard rests a holy candle. A rosary hangs from the rearview mirror. Ibarra parks a few blocks from his job. He works at a chain hotel, so at least he can wash up there. IBARRA: I take a shower, I drink my coffee, I smoke a cigarette, and I'm ready to work. GARSD: The hotel is located near the San Francisco airport. Ibarra is a food runner at one of its restaurants. He makes around $15 an hour. He used to commute from neighboring San Jose, one of the most expensive cities in the U. S. He paid $800 a month for a room but just slept there. When traffic was bad, the drive back from work could take as much as three hours. IBARRA: You would go bumper-to-bumper, bumper-to-bumper. Sometimes you get crazy, like when is this going to be over? When? GARSD: Ibarra considered renting near work, but he couldn't afford it. He figured he was already spending as much as four hours a day in the car, might as well just sleep there. Over the last decade, as the tech industry expanded, rent has skyrocketed, and people who don't work at high-paying Google or Facebook jobs are finding it increasingly hard to live here or even commute. It's affected the restaurant business. Just last year, several high-profile eateries shut down. One owner told me in this area, even the chefs. . . ALLISON HOPELAIN: They also can't afford to live, even on $18 to $20 an hour here anymore, so they eventually move, become private chefs, go work at Google. And it sort of just leaves you, like, constantly behind. GARSD: That's Allison Hopelain. Her restaurant, Camino, was known for its wood-fire-cooked food. After a decade, she closed last year. She says they took a major hit when the chef moved away to Washington state. HOPELAIN: Because he couldn't afford to live here, felt like he would have better opportunities there in terms of opening his own place, buying a home. GARSD: Hopelain went on to open The Kebabery in Oakland. It's a small cafeteria-style joint. You just pick your food and find a table. Several owners I speak to say the days of the affordable diner with a host and waiters - that's just over. And some restaurants in the area are even turning to automation. Located in San Francisco, Creator offers burgers created by local celebrity chefs. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: So we have Masala Burger, one Recreator and one Tumami Burger. All right, anything else for you? GARSD: The thing is the burgers aren't made by a human. This right here is the sound of a giant robot slicing the brioche bun, grating cheese, cutting tomatoes for a $6 burger. (SOUNDBITE OF MACHINE WHIRRING)GARSD: It could be straight out of \"The Jetsons\" or Pee-wee Herman's kitchen. Founder Alex Vardakostas says the robot can flip burgers better and for cheaper. ALEX VARDAKOSTAS: The only way you can make a burger of this kind of quality at that price is using a device that's going to grind meat to order. It's going to slice a tomato to order, slice the bun to order. GARSD: Here at the hotel where Armando Ibarra works, a burger is about $20. IBARRA: You know, even when I get a discount, that's too much. GARSD: He can't really afford a meal at the place he works. He says he usually just goes to Burger King, Taco Bell or stops by the gas station before going home. The problem is, for people like him in the Bay Area, going back home keeps getting harder and harder to do. Jasmine Garsd, NPR News, San Francisco.

He's been living here in his car for the last couple of years. ARMANDO IBARRA: I wake up in the morning - 5:00 in the morning. GARSD: On the dashboard rests a holy candle. A rosary hangs from the rearview mirror. Ibarra parks a few blocks from his job. He works at a chain hotel, so at least he can wash up there. IBARRA: I take a shower, I drink my coffee, I smoke a cigarette, and I'm ready to work. GARSD: The hotel is located near the San Francisco airport. Ibarra is a food runner at one of its restaurants. He makes around $15 an hour. He used to commute from neighboring San Jose, one of the most expensive cities in the U. S. He paid $800 a month for a room but just slept there. When traffic was bad, the drive back from work could take as much as three hours. IBARRA: You would go bumper-to-bumper, bumper-to-bumper. Sometimes you get crazy, like when is this going to be over? When? GARSD: Ibarra considered renting near work, but he couldn't afford it. He figured he was already spending as much as four hours a day in the car, might as well just sleep there. Over the last decade, as the tech industry expanded, rent has skyrocketed, and people who don't work at high-paying Google or Facebook jobs are finding it increasingly hard to live here or even commute. It's affected the restaurant business. Just last year, several high-profile eateries shut down. One owner told me in this area, even the chefs. . . ALLISON HOPELAIN: They also can't afford to live, even on $18 to $20 an hour here anymore, so they eventually move, become private chefs, go work at Google. And it sort of just leaves you, like, constantly behind. GARSD: That's Allison Hopelain. Her restaurant, Camino, was known for its wood-fire-cooked food. After a decade, she closed last year. She says they took a major hit when the chef moved away to Washington state. HOPELAIN: Because he couldn't afford to live here, felt like he would have better opportunities there in terms of opening his own place, buying a home. GARSD: Hopelain went on to open The Kebabery in Oakland. It's a small cafeteria-style joint. You just pick your food and find a table. Several owners I speak to say the days of the affordable diner with a host and waiters - that's just over. And some restaurants in the area are even turning to automation. Located in San Francisco, Creator offers burgers created by local celebrity chefs. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: So we have Masala Burger, one Recreator and one Tumami Burger. All right, anything else for you? GARSD: The thing is the burgers aren't made by a human. This right here is the sound of a giant robot slicing the brioche bun, grating cheese, cutting tomatoes for a $6 burger. (SOUNDBITE OF MACHINE WHIRRING) GARSD: It could be straight out of \"The Jetsons\" or Pee-wee Herman's kitchen. Founder Alex Vardakostas says the robot can flip burgers better and for cheaper. ALEX VARDAKOSTAS: The only way you can make a burger of this kind of quality at that price is using a device that's going to grind meat to order. It's going to slice a tomato to order, slice the bun to order. GARSD: Here at the hotel where Armando Ibarra works, a burger is about $20. IBARRA: You know, even when I get a discount, that's too much. GARSD: He can't really afford a meal at the place he works. He says he usually just goes to Burger King, Taco Bell or stops by the gas station before going home. The problem is, for people like him in the Bay Area, going back home keeps getting harder and harder to do. Jasmine Garsd, NPR News, San Francisco.

S. trade talks with China face a fundamental problem. The two countries are negotiating to end a trade war. It was triggered by President Trump's demand for better terms. Now, it's easy for the Chinese to, say, promise to buy more U. S. goods. They've got the money. But it's hard for China to alter a basic fact of its economy. Unlike the U. S. government, China's government owns half the country's largest companies, and many receive big subsidies. That is the advantage the United States wants China to give up. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Michael Korchmar runs a company that makes travel bags and briefcases. It's been in his family for four generations. Over the years, he has watched one company after another in his field go out of business. And for those that survive. . . MICHAEL KORCHMAR: Oh, that means you lose. I lived it. We lost. We had, you know, 500 people employed in the U. S. And we went down to five. ZARROLI: Korchmar says a big problem for companies like his is brutal competition from Chinese rivals. He says they can undercut his prices because they're subsidized by their government. And this is at the heart of the current trade talks - the extent to which China props up its companies. Just last week, Massachusetts Congressman Richard Neal, who heads the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, spoke about it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RICHARD NEAL: The China that we trade with and compete with today is very different from the one that we had hoped would emerge. China's economy, which has taken on some market characteristics, remains fundamentally state-directed. ZARROLI: More than half of China's biggest companies are owned by the government. They include essential sectors like railroads, energy, shipbuilding and telecommunications. But government officials also maintain strong ties to private companies, says Jennifer Hillman of Georgetown University Law Center. JENNIFER HILLMAN: They're able to direct resources and push resources into those industries and those entities that they are trying to favor. ZARROLI: Hillman notes that Communist Party members sit on the board of virtually every big Chinese company. The four largest banks are controlled by the government. Mark Wu of Harvard Law School says even when a Chinese company is privately owned, it works hard to stay in Beijing's good graces. MARK WU: People understand what the objectives are, and they'll operate within those confines. It's especially true when the state asserts a strong enough control over the key elements of the economy, as the Chinese economy still does. ZARROLI: It wasn't supposed to be this way. When China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, it agreed to reform its system to become more free market. But Patrick Chovanec of Silvercrest Asset Management says events of the past decade have made China more confident about its own system. PATRICK CHOVANEC: In the wake of 2008 financial crisis, China took a different look at what its economic model should look like. And a model that was more state-driven looked a lot more attractive to them. ZARROLI: Under President Xi Jinping, the government's role in the economy has only gotten bigger. U. S. officials say these policies violate the spirit if not the letter of trade law. And they've pressed Beijing to stop subsidizing businesses. But the ties between the government and business in China can be opaque. Chovanec says Chinese officials know how to give preferential treatment to their own companies at the expense of outsiders without leaving their fingerprints anywhere. CHOVANEC: They will just say, well, there's a slowdown in inspections of this type of product from your country. It's for safety. It makes it hard for you to then turn around and say, OK. You're engaging in illegal activity because there's complete deniability. ZARROLI: Harvard's Mark Wu says the Trump administration needs to be realistic about what it can achieve. WU: To the extent that we're expecting major fundamental structural reforms, that's going to be very difficult to obtain because they see this governance structure as having been vital for both their political and economic successes.

A couple of figures made news this past week. According to the Commerce Department, the U. S. trade deficit in merchandise ballooned to $891 billion last year. That's the largest in history. And, yesterday, the Labor Department reported that the U. S. economy added only 20,000 jobs in February, and that is well below what analysts expected. So we wanted to get a sense of what all this might mean for the U. S. economy, so we've called David Wessel. He's a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, where he directs the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy. David Wessel, thanks so much for joining us once again. DAVID WESSEL: It's good to be with you, Michel. MARTIN: So let's start with the most recent figure - the employment report substantially weaker than the trends of the last few years. Analysts said this was not what they expected. Why is that? WESSEL: Well, we don't really know why it happened. I think the question is - is the fact that we created only 20,000 jobs in February - is that a warning sign or a fluke? I think, ordinarily, people would say it's a fluke. After all, the unemployment rate is still very low. But there's so many other worrisome signs in the economy - slowdowns around the world, the damage done by the president's tariffs and so forth - that this may be a sign that things are starting to slow. MARTIN: So let's talk about the trade deficit for a minute. It grew to $891 billion in merchandise. But even if you include the broader figure that includes services, that's a $621 billion deficit, and that's more than 100 billion greater than the figure that President Trump inherited from President Obama. So what does that mean? WESSEL: The president's tariffs and the retaliatory tariffs from our trading partners probably are having some negative effect. But the much bigger reason for this is quite simple. Our economy is growing faster than the economies of our major trading partners. Even China's starting to slow down. So when China slows, when Europe - which has slowed, precipitously - slow down, they buy less of our stuff. We're doing relatively better than they are. We buy more of their stuff. The trade deficit widens. MARTIN: So I guess I'm looking for a big picture there, if you feel comfortable giving us one. I mean, on the one hand, this is the 10th anniversary of the start of the bull market. We know that the president's budget is being delivered on Monday. One sign that concerns a number of people is that the budget deficit is rising, you know? Overall, how should we look at all these indicators kind of put together? Is this a glass-half-full story, a glass-half-empty story? How should we think about it? WESSEL: The economy has been doing very well for the past couple of years. That's why unemployment is at 3. 8 percent, which is roughly a 50-year low. And, finally, finally, wages are starting to go up faster than the rate of inflation. So I would say if all you were doing is looking in the rearview mirror, you would say things are doing better. And we have lots of chronic problems to solve, like inequality. I think the concern is that the best of the Trump years of the economy may be behind us, and it doesn't seem like we are willing to do the things that are necessary to put us on a faster growth pack for the long-term.

The U. S. trade deficit hit a record high last year despite President Trump's America First trade policies, and a weak jobs report yesterday, just 20,000 jobs added in February after a couple of blockbuster months before that. To try and help us sort out this news is Catherine Rampell, who writes about economics for The Washington Post. And she joins us from our studios in New York. Catherine, so much - thanks so much for being with us. CATHERINE RAMPELL: Great to be here. SIMON: Let's begin with that trade deficit. It grew to $891 billion in 2018, the highest on record. President Trump campaigned against it. He said enough's enough. What happened? RAMPELL: So one thing I want to say right out of the gate is that deficits are not necessarily a bad thing. I know Trump hates them, and he thinks that they're a sign of who's winning and who's losing. They actually reflect much broader macroeconomic factors in the economy like savings and investment. That said, why is Trump failing at reducing this metric that he thinks is a measure of success? And I think it partly - largely, although not exclusively - has to do with Trump's own economic policies, both his fiscal policies and his trade policies. So on the fiscal front, what I mean is that we had this major tax cut, of course. We also had a big federal spending hike. Both of those things kind of goosed the economy. And when you have a stronger economy and stronger growth, consumers have more money in their pockets. They want to buy more stuff, and a lot of that stuff comes from abroad. So that helped improve the number of imports that are coming in, which weighs on the deficit. Beyond that, the U. S. economy is doing well, while a lot of other major trading partners' economies - China, the EU, the U. K. - they're not so hot. And the combination of us doing well and their doing less, well plus Fed interest rate hikes, means that the dollar got stronger, which also means that our exports got less competitive. They got a little bit more expensive. So that's all the fiscal stuff. And I would add that, you know, Trump may want to cool it with the schadenfreude about China's economy faltering because that means that they're buying less stuff from us or that our dollar gets stronger. But then there's also, of course, his trade policies, which he has been using, he thinks, specifically to target the deficit. And in many ways, they have backfired. And what I mean by that is that by putting tariffs on imports coming into the United States or threatening even higher tariffs, as he has repeatedly done with China, for example, or with autos, what happens is that American importers freak out. And they basically start stockpiling stuff from abroad to try to outrun those tariffs. So that, again, leads to more imports. And then, on the other side of the ledger, you also have. . .

RAMPELL: (Laughter) On the other side of the ledger, you also, of course, have retaliatory tariffs, which are targeting American exports like soybeans and bourbon. So there's less demand for those abroad. SIMON: Jobs report just a blip or a trend? RAMPELL: You know, there's a huge margin of error in this jobs report. It could very well be a blip. It could just be offsetting what looked like possibly a blip the last couple of months. There have been a number of reports that came in recently that were pretty disappointing, so maybe there's a slowdown. But I wouldn't freak out just yet. SIMON: Catherine Rampell of The Washington Post, thanks so much for being with us. RAMPELL: Thank you. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  A lot of discouraging economic news this week. The U. S. trade deficit hit a record high last year despite President Trump's America First trade policies, and a weak jobs report yesterday, just 20,000 jobs added in February after a couple of blockbuster months before that. To try and help us sort out this news is Catherine Rampell, who writes about economics for The Washington Post. And she joins us from our studios in New York. Catherine, so much - thanks so much for being with us. CATHERINE RAMPELL: Great to be here. SIMON: Let's begin with that trade deficit. It grew to $891 billion in 2018, the highest on record. President Trump campaigned against it. He said enough's enough. What happened? RAMPELL: So one thing I want to say right out of the gate is that deficits are not necessarily a bad thing. I know Trump hates them, and he thinks that they're a sign of who's winning and who's losing. They actually reflect much broader macroeconomic factors in the economy like savings and investment. That said, why is Trump failing at reducing this metric that he thinks is a measure of success? And I think it partly - largely, although not exclusively - has to do with Trump's own economic policies, both his fiscal policies and his trade policies. So on the fiscal front, what I mean is that we had this major tax cut, of course. We also had a big federal spending hike. Both of those things kind of goosed the economy. And when you have a stronger economy and stronger growth, consumers have more money in their pockets. They want to buy more stuff, and a lot of that stuff comes from abroad. So that helped improve the number of imports that are coming in, which weighs on the deficit. Beyond that, the U. S. economy is doing well, while a lot of other major trading partners' economies - China, the EU, the U. K. - they're not so hot. And the combination of us doing well and their doing less, well plus Fed interest rate hikes, means that the dollar got stronger, which also means that our exports got less competitive. They got a little bit more expensive. So that's all the fiscal stuff. And I would add that, you know, Trump may want to cool it with the schadenfreude about China's economy faltering because that means that they're buying less stuff from us or that our dollar gets stronger. But then there's also, of course, his trade policies, which he has been using, he thinks, specifically to target the deficit. And in many ways, they have backfired. And what I mean by that is that by putting tariffs on imports coming into the United States or threatening even higher tariffs, as he has repeatedly done with China, for example, or with autos, what happens is that American importers freak out. And they basically start stockpiling stuff from abroad to try to outrun those tariffs. So that, again, leads to more imports. And then, on the other side of the ledger, you also have. . . SIMON: We just got 30 seconds left, you know. RAMPELL: Sure. Sure. Sorry. SIMON: You're being marvelously complete, but go ahead. RAMPELL: Yeah. SIMON: Yeah.

KEITH: NPR was invited to the listening session and given early details of a child care proposal from a Ivanka Trump included in the president's 2020 budget. The centerpiece is a one-time investment of $1 billion to increase the supply of child care. States would apply for funding and could use it to encourage employers, large and small, to invest in child care or to support child care providers that operate during nontraditional work hours. To get the money, states would have to cut regulations that limit supply or increase cost. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: We are doing a lot. But it's not perfect still. KEITH: Here are some of the challenges that Trump and the experts she met with identified in that White House meeting. The early years are critical for brain development, but quality, safe, affordable child care is often hard to come by. There are mile-long waitlists for care that, for many families, costs more than their housing. And yet, a lot of child care workers can't make ends meet. Trump described it as a market failure.

(SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD)ELIZABETH WARREN: That's why, for millions of families who need it, access to these child care options will be free. KEITH: And in Congress, there are multiple child care bills from Democrats. The price tag on these plans runs tens of billions of dollars each year, vastly more than the White House proposal.

The interest rate on long-term government debt has dipped below the rate on short-term bills. That's often a signal that a recession could be on the horizon. NPR's Scott Horsley explains. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Ordinarily, if you're willing to tie up your money for five or 10 years in a certificate of deposit, for example, you receive a higher interest rate than you would on a three-month CD. The payoff for people who buy government debt usually follows the same pattern. Economists call this the yield curve. The longer you're willing to wait, the higher interest rate, or yield, you can typically expect. (SOUNDBITE OF WHISTLE)CAMPBELL HARVEY: The normal behavior of yield curve is that the longer-term rates are higher than the shorter-term rates. HORSLEY: But Duke University finance professor Campbell Harvey says there are moments when that ordinary pattern turns on its head. (SOUNDBITE OF WHISTLE)HORSLEY: That's when the yield on the government's short-term debt is higher than the yield on long-term Treasury notes. HARVEY: We don't see that occur that often. But when it does, it's almost always bad news. HORSLEY: That's why warning lights started flashing on Friday when the yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped below that of the three-month bill. The last time that happened was just before the Great Recession. Harvey's been keeping a close eye on these inverted yield curves for more than 30 years as a kind of early warning signal. HARVEY: My indicator has successfully predicted four of the last four recessions. HORSLEY: Now, Harvey only gets really nervous about a looming recession when the yield curve stays inverted for at least three months. This one's only been upside-down for a couple of days. Still, Harvey says even a flat curve can be a signal that the economy is losing steam. HARVEY: It might be that we dodge a recession, but the economic growth will be lower - much lower. HORSLEY: In fact, last week, the Federal Reserve lowered its own forecast of economic growth to just over 2 percent for the year. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  The bond market has been flashing a warning sign in recent days. The interest rate on long-term government debt has dipped below the rate on short-term bills. That's often a signal that a recession could be on the horizon. NPR's Scott Horsley explains. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Ordinarily, if you're willing to tie up your money for five or 10 years in a certificate of deposit, for example, you receive a higher interest rate than you would on a three-month CD. The payoff for people who buy government debt usually follows the same pattern. Economists call this the yield curve. The longer you're willing to wait, the higher interest rate, or yield, you can typically expect.

Trump has said he wants to nominate campaign adviser and conservative pundit Stephen Moore to a powerful post on the Fed's Board of Governors. The Guardian newspaper reported today that the IRS is trying to collect more than $75,000 in back taxes from Moore who says he's disputing the tax. And even before that news broke, there were widespread complaints about Moore's fitness for the Fed position. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Stephen Moore has spent decades opining on economics at the conservative Heritage Foundation, on cable TV, on the editorial page at The Wall Street Journal and occasionally, like today, on NPR's Morning Edition. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)STEPHEN MOORE: I've been a economic policy person in Washington for well over 30 years, so I do think that I have probably more experience in this game than many, many other people - in fact, a lot of the people who have served on the Federal Reserve Board. HORSLEY: It's precisely that track record that worries many economists, like Justin Wolfers of the University of Michigan. JUSTIN WOLFERS: More than possibly any other economist in modern America, he has a track record of getting the big issues wrong, not just occasionally but time after time. HORSLEY: During the Great Recession, for example, Moore complained the Fed's efforts to prop up the economy with low interest rates would spark runaway inflation. That never materialized. Today, with unemployment below 4 percent, Moore is making the opposite case, warning that by raising interest rates last year, the Fed was causing a dangerous drop in prices, or deflation. That prompted this exchange on CNN with Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MOORE: Both of the rate hikes were unnecessary and have caused a deflation in the economy, and I think they're the biggest danger. . . CATHERINE RAMPELL: There is no - wait, wait, wait, wait. I want to stop you there. I want to stop you there because you said this last time I was on with you. There is no deflation. You look. . . MOORE: Yeah, there is. RAMPELL: No, there is not. HORSLEY: She's right. There's not. William Luther, who runs the Sound Money Project at the American Institute for Economic Research, says Moore's counterintuitive prescriptions for Fed policy - tight money in bad times, loose money in good - seems to be guided more by who's in the White House than any objective measure of the economy. WILLIAM LUTHER: If your goal is to stabilize the macroeconomy, then Stephen Moore's policies go in exactly the wrong direction. If instead your goal is to push Democrats out of office and get Republicans re-elected, then Stephen Moore's policies make perfect sense. HORSLEY: Moore's credentials as a partisan player are well established. He was one of the founders of the Club for Growth, which advocates limited government and low taxes. Moore was one of the architects of a tax-cutting experiment in Kansas in 2012. Miriam Pepper was editorial page editor at The Kansas City Star. MIRIAM PEPPER: There is this segment of economists who want to believe, whether the facts support them or not, that low-tax states will grow better than other states. And it certainly didn't work in Kansas. It was a disaster. So they've had to retreat. HORSLEY: The economic boom that Moore and others promised never arrived. And eventually, Kansas lawmakers changed course. Nevertheless, Moore wrote an op-ed for The Kansas City Star in 2014 defending the tax cuts and insisting low-tax states outperform others. Only after the column was published did Pepper and her colleagues discover Moore had his numbers wrong. When the paper ran a correction with the right numbers, they didn't support Moore's argument. PEPPER: That kind of factual error is just unacceptable. While he was the so-called top economist at Heritage, we decided we were finished with him. HORSLEY: Even conservative economists who might share Moore's policy preferences have spoken out against his nomination. Harvard economist Greg Mankiw who advised former President George W. Bush says Moore doesn't have the intellectual gravitas for an important job like the Fed. Professional economists don't have a vote on Moore's nomination, though. Senators do.

Stephen Moore has been an informal economic adviser to the president and makes frequent appearances in the media, often defending the president's decisions about the economy. The Federal Reserve regulates monetary policy, setting interest rates and keeping track of inflation and unemployment. President Trump has been hammering the Fed chair Jerome Powell for raising interest rates. Stephen Moore has repeated those criticisms. He's also facing criticism himself from some who say he is not qualified to sit on the Fed's Board of Governors. Moore is a distinguished visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation and founder of the Club for Growth, an organization that tries to help elect Republicans who will cut taxes. And Stephen Moore joins us this morning from his home in Maryland. Welcome back to the show. STEPHEN MOORE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: You have, as I noted, served as an economic adviser to President Trump during his campaign and while he's been in the White House in an informal capacity. We've had you on this very program because of your proximity to him. Will that very proximity undermine your ability to operate independently at the Fed? MOORE: Well, first of all, Rachel, I have to say it was an incredible honor when I got that call about 10 days ago from the president to serve on the Federal Reserve Board. I still kind of have goose bumps because I think it's an incredible opportunity to try to help, you know, create this high-growth and low-unemployment and high-wage economy that I want and, of course, the president wants. Some people have questioned whether I have qualifications for this. I am not a PhD economist. Maybe there are too many PhD economists over at the Fed. But I have - Rachel, I have been in this game a long time. I've been a economic policy person in Washington for well over 30 years. And I'm involved in fiscal policy, tax policy and monetary policy. So I do think that I have, probably, more experience in this game than many, many other people - in fact, a lot of people who have served on the Federal Reserve Board. MARTIN: To the question though, do you have the ability to be independent from President Trump when it comes to decisions that you may be making at the Fed? MOORE: Absolutely. Look. It is true that Donald Trump picked me because I do share a lot of his beliefs on the economy. I love the direction the economy has taken under Donald Trump, as do most Americans. Seventy-one percent of Americans like the direction of the U. S. economy and what's happened. I want to continue to pursue policies that, you know, are for high growth and for - I love the higher wages. I think a lot of Trump policies have gotten us there. This is the best labor market for workers in 50 years. But there are many areas, Rachel, in fact, that I've spoken about on this show, where I've disagreed with Donald Trump. I'm much more of a free trader than Donald Trump is. I've questioned some of his policies - for example, his steel tariffs, which I think are a mistake. So - and I've spoken out on that. So I think it's an unfair criticism to say I'm just going to be some kind of sycophant for Trump. I agree with a lot of his policies but some of them I don't. And when I don't, I will - you know, I will be an independent voice for what's best for the American economy and the American worker. MARTIN: Some of the blowback on your nomination has been quite personal. I want to give you a chance to respond specifically to a critique from the former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush, a conservative economist named Greg Mankiw. He said that you do not have the, quote, \"intellectual gravitas for this important job. \" How do you answer that? MOORE: Well, Greg's one of the best economists in the country, so, you know, I - but there are many other economists, by the way - Larry Lindsey, who served on the Federal Reserve Board, and others, who have come out strongly in favor of me. So these are very, you know, partisan, polarizing times right now. And I hope this is not a bruising confirmation. And I also hope that, you know, as I go through the confirmation, Rachel, it isn't these kind of personal attacks but more on what this is about. You know, what are my beliefs on the economy? What would I strive for if I were at the Fed? Those are very legitimate issues that we should debate. MARTIN: Mmm hmm. MOORE: I hope it doesn't get into these kind of personal criticisms. MARTIN: You said the economy is doing well, and by many metrics it is. Unemployment is low. It's a little less than 4 percent. But last month, U. S. employers added just 20,000 new jobs. Are you worried about a slowdown in hiring? MOORE: I'm - look. First of all, in terms of the labor market right now, this is the best labor market for workers in 50 years. So it's a great, great labor market. You know, we have 7 million more jobs today than people to fill them, and I think, in no small part, because of Trump's tax cuts and deregulations. But as to your question about whether the economy is slowing down a little bit, yeah, it is. And I think everybody's a little concerned about that. We had, you know, very robust growth in 2018. And so far in 2019, we have signs that the economy is slowing. I do not believe there is a recession looming, but I do think we're seeing slower growth. And by the way, one of the reasons for that, as I've said - I've started saying this back in October - was that I thought the Fed was raising interest rates at a time when it didn't need to be doing so. And I think I've actually been vindicated because I was worried that if the Fed did this, it would slow down the economy. And it looks like that's what's happened. MARTIN: OK. Stephen Moore, adviser to President Trump, nominee to the Federal Reserve Board - Stephen, thanks for your time. MOORE: Thank you, Rachel. Have a great day. MARTIN: You too. NPR's chief economics correspondent Scott Horsley has been listening in to that conversation. Scott, I mentioned some of the critiques of Moore's nomination. What are you hearing more broadly? SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Well, it has been pretty scathing, Rachel, from professional economists of all stripes. And that is in contrast with the way those economists have generally regarded Trump's other nominees for the Fed. They've generally earned high praise. But, of course, economists don't get a vote. Republican senators do, Democrats do. But so far the - any criticism in the Senate has been much more muted. MARTIN: What specifically are the critics saying? HORSLEY: There are questions, certainly, about Moore's judgment and his competence and also questions about his strong partisan streak. Critics say either of those could be problematic. And together, they are a bad combination. To give you an example, William Luther runs the Sound Money Project at the American Institute for Economic Research. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)WILLIAM LUTHER: If your goal is to stabilize the macroeconomy, then Stephen Moore's policies go in exactly the wrong direction.

MARTIN: Is it true that Stephen Moore is more political than past Fed picks? HORSLEY: Certainly, his background suggests more of a devotion to a partisan agenda than any kind of rigorous analysis of economic conditions. MARTIN: So I asked Stephen Moore if he is seeing signs of a recession. He says no but understands there to be signs of a slowdown. You have reported on that very thing. Are - is there a reason to be concerned right now? HORSLEY: There is certainly an indication that the economy is downshifting not slipping into a recession. But the Fed itself is predicting growth of around 2. 1 percent this year. Moore, in an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal a couple weeks ago, suggested there's still growth prospects of 3 to 4 percent for the next several years. MARTIN: NPR economics correspondent Scott Horsley. Scott, thanks. We appreciate it. HORSLEY: You're welcome.

In many places, housing prices are rising much more rapidly than wages. The market is bad enough to revive movements for rent control. For decades, of course, some cities have frozen rents or limited rent increases. Last month, for the first time, an entire state imposed rent control - Oregon. Greg Rosalsky from NPR's Planet Money podcast asked if there are better ways to make housing affordable. GREG ROSALSKY, BYLINE: Back in 1994, San Francisco renters had a lot to be happy about. The 49ers were about to win a Super Bowl. The Internet was taking off. And a new law, which expanded rent control around the city, told a lot of landlords they could only raise rents to about half the rate of inflation. That was only about 1 percent that year, which was the lowest rent increase most renters had seen in over a decade. REBECCA DIAMOND: All of the potential good things about rent control you do see going on for that initial set of renters. ROSALSKY: That's Rebecca Diamond, an economist at Stanford University who studied rent control in San Francisco. She says renters in 1994 did have a reason to believe rent control was awesome. DIAMOND: But then the problems of rent control start to show up in the longer run. ROSALSKY: Obviously, landlords were not thrilled with rent control. And at first, they couldn't do much about it. But after a few years. . . DIAMOND: You see them substituting away from supplying affordable rental housing into other types of real estate where there's no cap on the profits they can make. ROSALSKY: They got out of the rental business by doing things like selling their properties as condos, or they bulldozed their buildings and built new ones because the law didn't apply to new construction. DIAMOND: So we find that in the long run, landlords decreased the supply of rent-controlled housing by 25 percent. ROSALSKY: That's a huge decrease in the number of rentals. And because supply went down while demand continued going up, it meant higher rents for a group of people often forgotten in rent-control debates, future renters. DIAMOND: So renters overall don't even necessarily benefit from rent control. ROSALSKY: If you're grandfathered into a rent-controlled unit you plan on staying in forever, rent control is great - for everyone else, not so much. Diamond's study is just one of many that shows that the policy ends up making housing, overall, less affordable, which is why the MIT economist Albert Saiz says. . . ALBERT SAIZ: The evidence is very clear that rent control doesn't work the way it's intended to work. ROSALSKY: Both economists think there are better ways to provide affordable housing. The ultimate solution is building more homes. But there are more things we could do to lower rents. SAIZ: There are policies that look a bit like rent control but that do not necessarily distort the housing market. ROSALSKY: The benefit of rent control is it helps renters avoid the financial shocks of big rent increases. Diamond says that means it's basically like an insurance policy. DIAMOND: The question is, how do we want to fund that type of insurance? ROSALSKY: Instead of imposing a rigid price control on the value of rentals, Diamond says it'd be better if we funded rent insurance like we fund other insurance programs. DIAMOND: And, indeed, the government already provides many types of insurance policies. ROSALSKY: Saiz agrees we should ease the pain of skyrocketing rents through a government-funded insurance program. And he argues we should fund it by taxing the gains on property values. SAIZ: And that would actually be redistributed to help people who need affordable housing. ROSALSKY: These economists say this policy could help renters in distress while also avoiding the negative side effects of rent control. And with it, a rising tide of property values could help lift all households. Greg Rosalsky, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF TYCHO'S \"RECEIVER\") STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   How can Americans make housing more affordable? In many places, housing prices are rising much more rapidly than wages. The market is bad enough to revive movements for rent control. For decades, of course, some cities have frozen rents or limited rent increases. Last month, for the first time, an entire state imposed rent control - Oregon. Greg Rosalsky from NPR's Planet Money podcast asked if there are better ways to make housing affordable. GREG ROSALSKY, BYLINE: Back in 1994, San Francisco renters had a lot to be happy about. The 49ers were about to win a Super Bowl. The Internet was taking off. And a new law, which expanded rent control around the city, told a lot of landlords they could only raise rents to about half the rate of inflation. That was only about 1 percent that year, which was the lowest rent increase most renters had seen in over a decade. REBECCA DIAMOND: All of the potential good things about rent control you do see going on for that initial set of renters.

Supporters argued the bill was necessary to ease the state's affordable housing crisis and provide tenants with long-term housing stability. But as Oregon Public Broadcasting's Lauren Dake reports, not everyone's convinced this will work. LAUREN DAKE, BYLINE: First came the 30 percent rent spike. GLORIA MARIN: So it was quite a hike for us. And it was a surprise because there were no repairs done. The apartments weren't fixed up or things like that. DAKE: That's Gloria Marin (ph). She lived in the same apartment in a suburb of Portland, Ore. , for eight years. After the rent increase, she thought about moving. But her family decided to stay so their young daughter didn't have to switch schools. But then came the no-cause eviction. MARIN: It was really, really devastating and scary because my daughter was still in school. And everywhere I looked, the rents were so expensive. DAKE: That was before Democratic lawmakers last month passed a bill capping how much landlords can raise the rent. Now landlords in the state, who took a largely neutral stance on the legislation, are prohibited from increasing rents more than 7 percent annually plus inflation. Next year, that amounts to a 10 percent cap. The bill also included a provision saying landlords can no longer evict tenants without just cause after the person has lived in the building for more than one year. Senate President Peter Courtney joined his Democratic colleagues arguing that the housing crunch created an urgency for the measure. PETER COURTNEY: It's easy for me. I mean, I got a home. I got a home. It's paid for it. You know, I don't have to worry about it. But I got people that are struggling in my district, throughout the state, throughout the state, throughout the state. So let's go. DAKE: Since 2010, Oregon's population has grown by nearly 10 percent. But during the recession, a lot of the building in the state slowed. With a limited housing and rental inventory, rents skyrocketed. Not everyone is convinced imposing rent control is the answer. Republicans in the Oregon State House say the new law doesn't address the real need, a lack of housing supply and stagnant wages. Republican lawmaker Gary Leif argued the solution isn't one-size-fits-all and said the bill would not help rural parts of the state. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GARY LEIF: We do not need, do not want and believe that this legislation will harm the great citizens of southern Oregon. DAKE: Some tenant rights advocates were critical of the bill, believing the rent increase cap is too high. Margot Black is a co-founder of Portland Tenants United. MARGOT BLACK: This bill protects middle-class renters from 30, 40, 50 percent rent increases. For low-income renters who are already paying 50 percent or more of their income in rent, those people will be priced out. DAKE: Still, tenant activists elsewhere have been inspired. Efforts to expand rent control policies are underway in a handful of other states, including Illinois and Washington. And in California, where landlord groups spent millions to defeat a rent control ballot measure last November, Democratic lawmakers there are now considering a handful of bills that could increase protections for tenants. Although the bill came too late to prevent Gloria Marin from being evicted, she still feels a greater sense of security knowing it's the law. MARIN: I feel less scared of being displaced from a community and having my life turned upside down. DAKE: Oregon Governor Kate Brown signed the rent control bill into law last month. And it took effect immediately. For NPR News, I'm Lauren Dake in Portland.

So he has issued this threat. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If they don't stop them, we're closing the border. They'll close it. And we'll keep it closed for a long time. I'm not playing games. MARTIN: This is not the first time President Trump has sounded that warning. The border in San Diego was shut down for a few hours last year. This time, though, the president hasn't followed through on the threat. Stopping cross-border traffic with one of the nation's biggest trading partners could do serious damage to the U. S. economy. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Retailers in San Diego got a small taste of what a border shutdown might look like last November, when members of a migrant caravan charged the border and U. S. officials closed one border crossing in response. While that shutdown lasted only a few hours, it came on what should have been one of the busiest shopping days of the year, and fallout for local merchants was severe. LOUIE SALOUMI: I easily, easily lost between $3,500 to $4,500 just that day. HORSLEY: Louie Saloumi runs a churro stand in a large outlet mall just north of the border. Nine out of 10 customers there walk or drive over from Mexico. When that traffic was cut off for less than a day, the hit to the local economy topped $5 million. Saloumi says if the border were closed for a full week, he'd be out of business. SALOUMI: That mall would be a ghost town. HORSLEY: Closing the entire U. S. border with Mexico would also put the brakes on more than $1. 5 billion in goods crossing back and forth every day, including 50 million pounds of produce from Mexico that now fills 100 warehouses in Nogales, Ariz. One importer warned the U. S. would run out of avocados in three weeks. But guacamole is the least of it. Lance Jungmeyer, who heads the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas, says fresh tomatoes, peppers, melons and eggplant for the whole country would soon be in short supply. LANCE JUNGMEYER: Probably over half of what most consumers put in their shopping bag when it comes to fresh produce, they would find reduced quantities and higher prices. HORSLEY: Jungmeyer says the administration's already planning to halt truck traffic through Nogales on Sundays as customs officers, who typically staff the border crossing there, are reassigned to deal with the influx of Central American migrants. If that shutdown extends to other days of the week, Jungmeyer worries some people will be out of work. JUNGMEYER: There's jobs that depend on moving goods back and forth every day. And if that's not moving, those people are laid off. And that means those people are not able to keep the lights on in their own homes and put groceries in their own refrigerator. So it gets really dicey really quick. HORSLEY: And those effects are not limited to the border region. Mexico's a critical supplier for companies throughout the U. S. , especially in the highly integrated auto industry. KRISTIN DZICZEK: We don't just trade with each other. We're making things together. HORSLEY: Kristin Dziczek of the Center for Automotive Research says Mexico supplies 37 percent of all imported car parts in the U. S. and more than 70 percent of some critical components. Dziczek says because some of those parts are central to a car's assembly, without them, factories would soon grind to a halt. And that, in turn, would idle domestic parts makers. DZICZEK: We'll see auto production in the U. S. shut down pretty quickly. Some within hours, and certainly, the whole industry within days. HORSLEY: Dziczek says the fallout from a complete border shutdown would be so fast and so sweeping, it's hard to take the president's threat seriously. But White House counselor Kellyanne Conway insisted on \"Fox News Sunday\" it's a real possibility. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\")KELLYANNE CONWAY: It certainly isn't a bluff. You can take the president seriously. HORSLEY: Companies throughout the U. S. routinely make contingency plans for supply disruptions, but it's impossible to prepare for something like a complete border shutdown.

S. economy added 196,000 jobs in March. We learned that on the same morning that we're discussing some news about a vital agency that influences the economy. President Trump has said he would like to nominate Herman Cain to the board of the Federal Reserve, which monitors both inflation and employment and tries to keep both where people want them to be. NPR's chief economic correspondent Scott Horsley is in our studios, talked about this. Hi there, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Steve. INSKEEP: So when I think about Herman Cain, I think about the three Ps - pizza, presidential campaign, and just a bit of monetary policy. What's his background? HORSLEY: Well, he did serve for a time as chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. He has also, however, espoused some unorthodox views on monetary policy. Back in 2010, for example, he advocated a return to the gold standard. That's at the time when he was running for the White House in that crowded GOP field. He earned some notoriety for his 9-9-9 tax plan. But ultimately, he dropped out of the race amid allegations that he cheated on his wife and sexually harassed women. Nevertheless, President Trump told reporters yesterday he thinks Herman Cain will easily pass the background check that Trump says is now underway. And the president says he thinks the former Godfather's Pizza CEO would do very well as one of the seven members of the Fed's governing board. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He's a highly respected man. He's a friend of mine. He's somebody that gets it. And I hope everything goes well. But Herman Cain is a very good guy. INSKEEP: Although, as you pointed out, unusual views from time to time on monetary policy. What's it mean that this would be a second straight unusual nomination by President Trump for the Fed board? HORSLEY: Trump himself has been very critical of the central bank. He blames last year's rate hikes for putting the brakes on economic growth here in the U. S. And that criticism has continued even now that the Fed has said it's not planning to hike rates anymore for the rest of this year. Two weeks ago, President Trump said he was going to nominate conservative commentator Stephen Moore of the Heritage Foundation. That's drawn considerable criticism from people who say Moore would be too political, that he would compromise the Fed's independence. We should point out though, Steve, even though the president's sort of floated these two trial balloons, neither Moore nor Cain has officially been nominated. INSKEEP: OK. And, of course, the president's statements about what he will do - this is just a statement of fact - his statements about what he will do are not necessarily a reliable guide to what he actually does in days afterward. But we do have this jobs report - 196,000 jobs added in March. What does that mean? HORSLEY: It's reassuring that the very low jobs number we saw for February was kind of a fluke and not a signal that the economy is grinding to a halt. At the same time, we are seeing somewhat slower job growth than we were seeing at the end of last year. The average over the last three months now is about 180,000 jobs a month. The last three months of 2018, we were averaging 233,000. So there is a bit of a downshift. Sarah House is a senior economist at Wells Fargo. SARAH HOUSE: We are seeing overall economic growth slow, so that's going to reduce the pace of hiring. We're also seeing businesses are having a hard time finding workers. And so if they're not able to fill these positions, that's going to reduce the overall pace of job gains as well. HORSLEY: We did see modest job decline, Steve, in March in retail and manufacturing. INSKEEP: Are wages still going up? HORSLEY: They are. They're going up a little over 3 percent per year, which is pretty good, maybe not as much as you would think with unemployment under 4 percent. That's partly because some folks who had been on the sidelines keep coming back into the labor force. . . INSKEEP: Right. HORSLEY: . . . Suggesting employers still have room to hire without bidding up wages in a way that would really cause inflation to spike. INSKEEP: Scott, I'm sure you've earned a raise with your reporting today. HORSLEY: (Laughter) Thank you. INSKEEP: NPR economics correspondent Scott Horsley. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  The U. S. economy added 196,000 jobs in March.

And the president says he thinks the former Godfather's Pizza CEO would do very well as one of the seven members of the Fed's governing board. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He's a highly respected man. He's a friend of mine. He's somebody that gets it. And I hope everything goes well. But Herman Cain is a very good guy. INSKEEP: Although, as you pointed out, unusual views from time to time on monetary policy. What's it mean that this would be a second straight unusual nomination by President Trump for the Fed board? HORSLEY: Trump himself has been very critical of the central bank. He blames last year's rate hikes for putting the brakes on economic growth here in the U. S. And that criticism has continued even now that the Fed has said it's not planning to hike rates anymore for the rest of this year. Two weeks ago, President Trump said he was going to nominate conservative commentator Stephen Moore of the Heritage Foundation. That's drawn considerable criticism from people who say Moore would be too political, that he would compromise the Fed's independence. We should point out though, Steve, even though the president's sort of floated these two trial balloons, neither Moore nor Cain has officially been nominated. INSKEEP: OK. And, of course, the president's statements about what he will do - this is just a statement of fact - his statements about what he will do are not necessarily a reliable guide to what he actually does in days afterward. But we do have this jobs report - 196,000 jobs added in March. What does that mean? HORSLEY: It's reassuring that the very low jobs number we saw for February was kind of a fluke and not a signal that the economy is grinding to a halt. At the same time, we are seeing somewhat slower job growth than we were seeing at the end of last year. The average over the last three months now is about 180,000 jobs a month. The last three months of 2018, we were averaging 233,000. So there is a bit of a downshift. Sarah House is a senior economist at Wells Fargo. SARAH HOUSE: We are seeing overall economic growth slow, so that's going to reduce the pace of hiring. We're also seeing businesses are having a hard time finding workers. And so if they're not able to fill these positions, that's going to reduce the overall pace of job gains as well. HORSLEY: We did see modest job decline, Steve, in March in retail and manufacturing. INSKEEP: Are wages still going up? HORSLEY: They are. They're going up a little over 3 percent per year, which is pretty good, maybe not as much as you would think with unemployment under 4 percent. That's partly because some folks who had been on the sidelines keep coming back into the labor force. . . INSKEEP: Right. HORSLEY: . . . Suggesting employers still have room to hire without bidding up wages in a way that would really cause inflation to spike. INSKEEP: Scott, I'm sure you've earned a raise with your reporting today. HORSLEY: (Laughter) Thank you. INSKEEP: NPR economics correspondent Scott Horsley.", "section": "Economy", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

A new report from the Federal Government says those bills are lasting more than twice as long as they did at the beginning of the decade, and that's upending an old argument about replacing the dollar bill with a one-dollar coin. Here's NPR's Scott Horsley. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: For years now, there's been a persistent lobbying effort to force dollar coins on the American public. There's even a group called the Dollar Coin Alliance - co-chaired, oddly enough, by a former congressman named Tim Penny. Its argument has been that the government could save money by switching to dollar coins which last so much longer than paper money. And the Government Accountability Office used to agree. But on the subject of dollar coins, the GAO has flipped. It now says paper bills are more cost-effective. The GAO's John Schumann says that's because paper dollars now last more than twice as long as they used to. JOHN SCHUMANN: When we last looked at this issue in 2011, the paper dollar was only lasting a little bit over three years. And when we looked at this issue again this year, we found that the paper dollar is now lasting almost eight years long. HORSLEY: Schumann says that's partly because of changes in the way the Federal Reserve processes dollar bills. But it's also a sign that, in an increasingly cashless world, paper dollars aren't getting around like they used to. As part of its research, the GAO surveyed lots of industries that might have a stake in the paper-versus-coin contest and found most are not eagerly embracing the switch to coins, even those you might think would have a vested interest. BRIAN WALLACE: Yeah. It's right in our name - Coin Laundry Association. HORSLEY: Brian Wallace represents some 30,000 coin laundries around the country. He says only a handful have retrofitted their machines to accept dollar coins. But just about any other form of payment goes. WALLACE: You could still pay with a quarter. But you could also, you know, pay with a credit card or add value to a card or taking the Starbucks approach of just, you know, waving the phone at the washer and it starts. HORSLEY: Likewise, highway toll booths. NEIL GRAY: Once upon a time, toll roads along with the transit systems and the post office itself were the largest coinage handlers in the country. HORSLEY: Neil Gray of the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association says paper dollars can tie up traffic when they get jammed in a toll booth collection box. But that doesn't mean the IBTTA is itching for dollar coins. GRAY: To the extent possible, we've had entire toll road systems eliminate cash completely. HORSLEY: That means dollar bills are lasting longer, and there's less financial incentive for the government to replace them with dollar coins. Anyway, dollar coins have proven stubbornly unpopular with the public. That's why the Federal Reserve has more than a billion one-dollar coins unused in storage. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington.

We're going to spend the next few minutes talking about household appliances. Not so much about how they can refrigerate your food or wash your clothes, but rather, how they help us understand the current trade dispute between the U. S. and China. NPR's Alina Selyukh explains. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: Home renovations. If you've done one, you know it can be exasperating, time-consuming, expensive. And Jani Mussetter is doing more than a renovation. She's doing a remodel - bathrooms and a whole new kitchen. JANI MUSSETTER: It really was daunting, the whole experience. You know, I bought everything. I bought a washer, dryer, a refrigerator, freezer, dishwasher, a range. SELYUKH: And as she was going to showrooms for all these appliances in January, this stressful thing kept coming up. MUSSETTER: The moment I walked in, everyone pretty much warned me that February 1, everything was going up. SELYUKH: As in going up in price. And because Mussetter was shopping on the higher end, that could mean hundreds of dollars. Did they say why? MUSSETTER: They said because of all of the tariffs. SELYUKH: The tariffs. They've been making a huge impact on the cost of appliances in the U. S. Take Whirlpool. It's a leading American appliance maker, and Whirlpool prices barely changed for years, says Alvaro Lacayo, housing analyst at G. research. ALVARO LACAYO: And then when you look at what happened in 2018, you saw a big tick upward. SELYUKH: And at first, the price ticking upward was pretty welcome news for Whirlpool. It reflected Whirlpool's victory over its two main foreign competitors, LG and Samsung. They're both based in South Korea, and for years, Whirlpool argued. . . LACAYO: That LG and Samsung had been dumping appliances into the U. S. market at below cost, rendering competition irrational. SELYUKH: And last January, President Trump agreed with Whirlpool. He set a new hefty tariff on imported washing machines. Selling washers to Americans became more expensive for foreign companies, and domestic manufacturers, like Whirlpool, could finally raise prices. But then Trump imposed more tariffs - on metals, like aluminum and steel, which is critical to building almost any appliance. Suddenly, appliance makers everywhere, including Whirlpool, began complaining about the rising cost of raw materials. They had little choice but to start hiking their own prices. STEVE SHEINKOPF: On certain products, you could be looking at a 14 to 16 percent increase from last year to this year. SELYUKH: Steve Sheinkopf owns Yale Appliance and Lighting in the Boston area, and he's been in the industry his whole life. SHEINKOPF: I'm the third-generation owner. Yeah. We're here in Boston and have been here for almost a hundred years now. It's hard to believe. You know, I haven't been here all hundred. SELYUKH: But, you know, about 1/3 of that. Sheinkopf says many brands he works with, like Wisconsin-based Sub-Zero and Wolf, or German Thermador, they regularly inch up their prices. But in the past year, the increases have been bigger than most. Now overall prices of major appliances, tracked by the Labor Department, are starting to tick down month to month, but they are still higher than they were last year. SHEINKOPF: When you talk about machines that people want to buy, front-loaders, I think you're looking at $200 to $400 difference versus last year. SELYUKH: Sheinkopf predicts prices are probably stabilized at this point, at least for a while. But for shoppers who chase specials and deals, he says promotions have not been as good as a few years ago. He's noticed one other thing about Whirlpool's Korean competitors. Last year, both LG and Samsung fast-tracked two manufacturing plants in America. It's great news for American jobs, but for Whirlpool. . . SHEINKOPF: I think this is the biggest challenge they'll ever have. SELYUKH: And Mussetter, who is remodeling her house, she did manage to buy all her appliances before the February price jump. She later learned that saved her more than $1,200. Alina Selyukh, NPR News. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:   OK. We're going to spend the next few minutes talking about household appliances.

Now, oil money is dwindling, so there's not enough for both. The state's new governor wants to boost the cash payments at the expense of health care, schools and Alaska's iconic ferry system. Nat Herz with Alaska Public Media has more. NAT HERZ, BYLINE: The southeast Alaska town of Tenakee Springs has no airport and just a tiny stretch of dirt road. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Well, good for them. It's a beautiful day. HERZ: So the arrival of the twice-weekly ferry, the LeConte, is an event. Friends shout to each other across the water as it comes to shore, and at the dock, people load and unload with all-terrain vehicles. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Back it right in front of that trailer in line, OK? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: I've got two of them. HERZ: One of the passengers is Shayne Thompson who is shipping a weekly truckload of groceries to the indigenous village of Angoon, where he runs the store. And right now, Thompson is worried because Alaska's new governor, Republican Mike Dunleavy, has proposed a budget that would stop the ferry system's operations October 1. Thompson says he could hire a barge for his deliveries, but prices would rise by about 25 percent, and food would come less often. SHAYNE THOMPSON: It's like a giant step back in time, and we would have fresh produce and dairy for a week or two of the month. Then the rest of the month, it would be all dry goods. HERZ: The ferry system isn't the only government program that the governor wants to shrink. Dunleavy is also proposing major cuts to K-12 schools, the university system and health care. He says those cuts are needed to pay each resident a $3,000 dividend - about twice what it was last year. The governor campaigned on the issue, and he's continued to make the case that individuals should decide how to spend their dividends rather than the government. MIKE DUNLEAVY: I'm having a difficult time believing that we take that money off of elders in rural Alaska, we take that money off of 10-year-olds who are saving up for college, we take that money off of single parents that have three or four children in their families and are struggling, and we bring it in the government to continue spending at the rate we're spending. HERZ: The governor argues that the state can't afford that anymore with oil revenues less than half of what they were five years ago, and the money has to come from somewhere since Alaskans pay no state sales or income taxes. Dunleavy's proposal has sparked a debate that centers on what residents value and are willing to pay for. Dustin James spoke at a recent public forum in Fairbanks, the headquarters of the state university system. DUSTIN JAMES: The university on the hill has got to take a look at their income and stop demanding from the citizens to meet their salaries and their retirement programs and all these other things. It's not fair to the rest of us. HERZ: Many other Alaskans who turned out to the public hearings objected to the governor's proposed cuts, including those to the ferries, which function as school buses, freight vessels and even hearses in the southeast part of the state. On board the LeConte, as it steams from Tenakee Springs back to Juneau, retired state worker Erling Olsen says the reductions would cripple the region's economy. ERLING OLSEN: This boat is functioning for us people. We have no road system. We're on an island. I mean, this is what we rely on. HERZ: So far, the state legislature has rejected many of the governor's cuts, moving instead to lower residents' dividends and preserve state programs. The governor can't unilaterally boost dividends, but he does have line item veto power that he can use to cut spending after lawmakers pass the budget. For NPR News, I'm Nat in Anchorage.

On board the LeConte, as it steams from Tenakee Springs back to Juneau, retired state worker Erling Olsen says the reductions would cripple the region's economy. ERLING OLSEN: This boat is functioning for us people. We have no road system. We're on an island. I mean, this is what we rely on. HERZ: So far, the state legislature has rejected many of the governor's cuts, moving instead to lower residents' dividends and preserve state programs. The governor can't unilaterally boost dividends, but he does have line item veto power that he can use to cut spending after lawmakers pass the budget.

For now, managing a pot business in the 34 states where marijuana is legal requires some creative workarounds, as NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Tom DiGiovanni spends his time trying to figure out how to move money to run his business - loads of it. DiGiovanni is a former Ernst & Young accountant and a family man, but now his job feels a lot more gangster than pencil pusher. DiGiovanni looks like he could be Ray Liotta's brother with a nightclub bouncer's build. He says he likes living on the edge at least businesswise, and that's how he ended up here, leaning into an unmarked armored van. TOM DIGIOVANNI: These metal cages. . . NOGUCHI: That metal cage - it's to protect cash from would-be thieves. This is how you transfer money at Canndescent, an organic pot producer in Desert Hot Springs, Calif. , under the watchful gaze of big men carrying lots of guns. DIGIOVANNI: May have an ankle holster and, like, you know, another one on the small of their back, and they're wearing tactical gear. It's pretty crazy. NOGUCHI: They safeguard bar-coded bags carrying mostly $20 bills. DIGIOVANNI: Over the course of a month, we probably have $2 million in cash that's in some state of transit. NOGUCHI: Counting all of that is a pain, and it's heavy. He has full-time workers doing just that. DIGIOVANNI: It's three or four hours a day that they're standing in front of that machine, feeding cash into it. NOGUCHI: It's counted three times after every transfer at an undisclosed location. That process, he says, we're not allowed to see. DIGIOVANNI: And it gets transported again on a random schedule to our processing facility, which is in a different city that I won't name. NOGUCHI: The legal marijuana business operates in a murky financial world without help from major banks. Candescent, for example, is four years old and built its grow house largely with money from friends and family of the founder. DIGIOVANNI: This is 27,000 square feet total of grow. NOGUCHI: The estimated 300 financial institutions that serve the pot industry are small state-chartered banks or credit unions. They're audited frequently, and transactions are monitored closely for suspicious activity. A cannabis business pays thousands in monthly fees just to have an account. DiGiovanni found one after scouring the state, looking for a credit union willing to deposit his marijuana revenue. DIGIOVANNI: It's on the Controlled Substances Act, so that makes us a trafficker. NOGUCHI: Banks will not lend to the industry because if the federal government were to seize a company's assets, the lender would have nothing to collect. DiGiovanni says the risk of that is extremely low, yet that fear affects nearly every aspect of his job, from getting insurance to paying employees and finding accountants. As a result, everything costs more, including a $200,000 automated weighing machine that makes packaging six times faster. DIGIOVANNI: It's accurate to one-hundredth of a gram, and I call it the weed robot. NOGUCHI: The interest rate on the loan for that robot cost about triple the normal rate. And that's not all. Two years ago, an infection destroyed Candescent's hydroponic beds of seedlings. But crop insurance wasn't available for marijuana, so the company ate the $600,000 loss. DIGIOVANNI: We've been turned down by three different payroll companies who won't service this industry. NOGUCHI: And yet the IRS collects tax revenue from the industry, an ironic legal twist in DiGiovanni's eyes. DIGIOVANNI: And I can tell you the IRS is more than happy to take a check from a cannabis company. They're more than happy to take a bag of cash. They're more than happy to collect that tax revenue. NOGUCHI: Last month, a House committee approved a bill that would legalize banking for pot businesses. It has 157 bipartisan co-sponsors so far. Anti-cannabis groups oppose the bill and legalization generally. They argue the legal trade is a threat to public health that outweighs the tax benefits. But Alyson Martin says there are safety reasons to legalize banking for the industry. ALYSON MARTIN: Because these are essentially cash-only businesses, they become sitting ducks for robberies, thefts and those sorts of things. NOGUCHI: Martin co-founded the news site Cannabis Wire. She says banking is the industry's biggest challenge. MARTIN: I don't think I've talked to anybody who hasn't had banking headaches. NOGUCHI: Tom DiGiovanni says he thinks that will change soon. He says better access to banks would help him grow the business faster and hire more and, in the long run, raise even more tax revenue for the government. But until then, he'll continue moving piles of cash about in bulletproof vans under a blanket of secrecy. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News.

You might know this already. Today is Tax Day. But there is little encouragement for last-minute tax filers this April 15. Your chance of being audited by the IRS this year is as low as it has been in decades. Years of budget cuts have hollowed out enforcement of the nation's tax laws. Now even the Trump administration says those cuts may have gone too far. Here's more from NPR's Scott Horsley. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The IRS is responsible for collecting about $3. 5 trillion in taxes every year. But the agency's being asked to do that job with fewer dollars of its own. Chuck Marr, who studies tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, says adjusted for inflation, IRS funding's been cut by about 25 percent since the beginning of the decade, and staffing for tax enforcement has fallen by nearly 1/3. CHUCK MARR: Right now we have about the same number of auditors at the IRS that we had back in the 1950s when the economy was at 1/7 the size. HORSLEY: The IRS has always been something of a political punching bag. But the deep cuts began in 2010 when Republicans took control of the House, as GOP Congressman Dave Joyce of Ohio acknowledged last week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DAVE JOYCE: I know that when we were in the majority that we took great pleasure in cutting the amount of money that was going to the IRS every year. HORSLEY: The IRS was an easy target. After all, the agency was the enforcer of the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans despise. There were charges the IRS unfairly penalized conservative groups that tried to apply for nonprofit status. And even in the best of times, people don't have warm and fuzzy feelings about the tax collector, says Mark Mazur, who was assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy during the Obama administration. MARK MAZUR: It was always a concern among Americans that you have the jack-booted thugs coming into your business or office or home and auditing away. HORSLEY: Over time, both the criticism and the budget cuts have taken a toll. Tony Reardon, who heads the union representing IRS agents, says morale of the agency is down. Experienced agents are headed for the exits, and less than 3 percent of the IRS workforce is under 30. TONY REARDON: The IRS has essentially lost an entire generation of employees. When you look at pay freezes, retirement cuts, government shutdowns, it makes it incredibly difficult to recruit and retain new talent. HORSLEY: With the IRS cutting back sharply on tax enforcement, the federal government is leaving money it's owed by taxpayers on the table. According to ProPublica, the number of individual audits fell 42 percent between 2010 and 2017. Florida Congressman Charlie Crist complains IRS scrutiny of taxpayers making more than $500,000 a year dropped more sharply than audits of those making under $200,000. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHARLIE CRIST: This clearly indicates a policy shift of some sort, cracking down on people who have little and going easier on people who are doing very, very well. HORSLEY: Now after nearly a decade of cutting, the Trump administration is calling for a course correction. Trump has suggested sidestepping budget caps to spend an extra $362 million on tax enforcement next year. The new IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig says that additional spending is necessary to reassure Americans that tax cheats stand a good chance of getting caught. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHARLES RETTIG: Personally, I have both eyes focused on enforcement. HORSLEY: Rettig notes the vast majority of Americans, 83 percent, already pay the taxes they owe voluntarily. But if a more visible cop on the beat could boost compliance by just one percentage point, that would mean an extra $30 billion a year in revenue for the government. On the other hand, Mark Mazur warns, government revenues could take an equally big hit if the lack of enforcement were to trigger even a small drop in Americans' willingness to pay. MAZUR: Americans don't really want to feel like chumps, and so they want to make sure that everybody's paying their fair share. HORSLEY: Trust in the tax system takes a long time to develop. If it looks like tax cheats are getting away with it, that trust can evaporate very quickly. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington. DAVID GREENE, HOST:   All right. You might know this already.

And trade tensions are high between the U. S. and Europe. So where does that leave a Chinese-owned Swedish company building cars in South Carolina? It's all about adapting, as NPR's Camilla Domonoske reports. CAMILLA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: The port in Charleston, S. C. , has been a shipping hub for hundreds of years. JIM NEWSOME: Probably proportionally, South Carolina as a state is more dependent on global trade than any other state in the country. DOMONOSKE: Jim Newsome is the CEO of the South Carolina Ports Authority. He's run the port for nearly 10 years. He's a big believer in free trade. NEWSOME: We ought to be trying to lower tariffs, you know, not raise tariffs. I think the world would be - global automotive industry could benefit from zero tariffs. DOMONOSKE: BMW, Mercedes Benz and Volvo all have plants in South Carolina, employing thousands of people. Volvo's is brand new. It opened near the small town of Ridgeville last year. Volvo Cars is a Swedish company. It's owned by a Chinese firm, Geely. And a batch of cars made at this South Carolina factory was recently exported to Belgium. That was a quick shift after tariffs threw a wrench in Volvo's finely tuned plans. TREMAINE SMALLS: And we'll be locked and loaded and ready to go. DOMONOSKE: Tremaine Smalls has been working for Volvo for about 10 months. He's from Orangeburg, 40 miles up the interstate. Right now he's putting bypass tubes and drive shafts onto engines. SMALLS: They've got part numbers on them - 0321. You want to make sure you verify your part number. DOMONOSKE: These are the kind of American manufacturing jobs that protectionists want to, well, protect. But modern cars are built thanks to a global supply chain. These engines Smalls is working on, they were manufactured in Sweden. Each luxury sedan that rolls off this line is made of thousands of parts from around the world. So tariffs on imported parts can hurt auto manufacturers in the U. S. But tariffs also hurt companies that make those parts, including American suppliers. Christine McDaniel is a research fellow at the libertarian Mercatus Center. She points to companies in South Carolina that manufacture car components. CHRISTINE MCDANIEL: But to make those auto parts, they import steel and aluminum. DOMONOSKE: Tariffs on those raw materials have squeezed those suppliers, and there's a lot at stake. MCDANIEL: And in fact, there's more jobs in the supply chain than in the assembly line. DOMONOSKE: From McDaniel's perspective, tariffs are counterproductive if your goal is to protect jobs. So suppliers and manufacturers are woven into this global system even before a car starts down the assembly line. And once it's put together. . . (SOUNDBITE OF POWER TOOL WHIRRING)DOMONOSKE: Half the cars made at this plant are destined for export. And the original plan was to send cars to China. Then the trade war started. And after the U. S. put tariffs on Chinese goods, China retaliated with tariffs on U. S. -made products, including these cars. TREY YONCE: Unfortunately, we weren't able to, you know, ship to China, which is - you know, it's kind of a disappointment. But we're going to work through it. DOMONOSKE: Trey Yonce is the supervisor of Volvo's power pack line. He's a Charleston native and a former motorcycle racer. YONCE: It wasn't what we wanted to hear, you know, so - but like I said, we're a strong company. This plant's still going to be here. We're going to work through it and find our way, what we need to do. But yeah, it wasn't exciting news. DOMONOSKE: Yonce is right. The tariffs haven't derailed the plant's operations. Instead of exporting to China, Volvo's sending cars to Europe, Australia, Africa and the rest of Asia instead. And Volvo is still planning to ramp up production and add an SUV to this plant. Anders Gustafsson is the CEO of Volvo Car USA. He says Volvo has had to move quickly to adapt, but he's taking the long view. ANDERS GUSTAFSSON: To run a plant or run a company, you know, it's a long-term decision. So you lose, and you win. DOMONOSKE: Analysts compare tariffs to squeezing a balloon. Put pressure on one spot, and the global economy will shift. It won't stop altogether. So the delicate dance continues. Car parts keep showing up at a factory in rural South Carolina, and workers keep building cars that roll onto ships and cross the ocean, going somewhere - just not to China, at least for now.

For American dairy farmers, even a bit more. Milk prices are now just two-thirds what they were five years ago. Cows are making more milk, even as plant-based substitutes like soy milk, almond milk, rice milk and others have captured more of the market. Mark Berg, a dairy farmer in Pine Island, Minn. , who's in business with his parents, Tom and Penny, posted a video on Facebook to try to explain some of the brutal economics farmers now confront. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARK BERG: I love these fricking cows more than anything else. I don't want to do anything else, you know? And then, you know, I don't - I'm not financially stable enough to take over a farm. And you can't take over a business that's going to fail, you know? And this is like a guaranteed failure. SIMON: It's been seen almost half a million times all over the world. Mark Berg and his mother, Penny Berg, join us now. I want to thank you both very much for being with us. M BERG: Thank you. PENNY BERG: Thank you. SIMON: Penny Berg, let me begin with you. How much money do you make in the dairy business today, as opposed to five years ago? P BERG: Well, what Tom and I have always done is we've always been able to put money into our savings. Like, if we sell a cow or if we sell a calf or, like, we get checks, you know, at the beginning of the year. Well, with the milk prices being down for the last four years, as of right now, our savings has dwindled to zero. And so every check - it all has to go directly into our checking account to make ends meet. And after four years, it's not making ends meet. SIMON: Well, give us, if you could, please, some idea of some of the hard decisions you have to make just to get by week to week, month to month. P BERG: One of the hardest decisions for us is we're trying to decide which of our animals will have to be sold. We'll probably have to sell around at least 20. And the feed purchase prices are very high at this time, too, so we'll have to sell animals so we have enough to feed the ones we do have. SIMON: Can you give us an idea of how hard you work - what a day is like for you? P BERG: There are mornings that I'm up as early as 3:30. We feed calves before we start our morning milking around 6 o'clock. This morning, I was up, for example, at 10 to 4 and will probably get in the house tonight, I would say, 9:30 or so. Of course, we stop and have lunch together. And if I'm not outside helping Mark and Tom, I'm inside doing book work or trying to do some laundry, if that's possible. SIMON: Do you ever have a day off? P BERG: Well, we try to have at least a milking off, and that usually ends up for Tom and me on a Sunday night. And if Mark has a date with his girlfriend or something, we try to give him time off, too. It is hard. I mean, we have very, very good high school young men that come and help us after they're done at school. That helps the work load some, but it's still there. SIMON: Mark Berg, what's it like for you to see your mother work this hard - and your father? M BERG: You know, to watch mom and dad work that hard, I mean, it's - if I had to describe it in a word, it'd be unfair - just because, you know, both mom and him are getting older, and they work harder now than they ever have in their whole life. And it's not only physically draining, but it's mentally draining. SIMON: Why did you take the step of sharing your circumstances and worries on Facebook? M BERG: I guess what - maybe what brought me to post it was that I don't like to see the frustration in my family like it is. And I - and it's because this is just a hard business to be in currently for everyone. And I mostly posted it to just inform people who I know personally. And it ended up reaching a global scale. SIMON: Penny Berg, hard for you to hear your son talk like that? P BERG: Yeah, it is. It's hard for the whole family. I'm glad he did what he did, though, because the responses have - that he's gotten back have been overwhelming. I mean, it's - there's farmers that have been my husband and I's age that have said, thank you, Mark, for doing this because we couldn't have. And I feel the same way. I could've never done that. Farmers are proud people, and they're not going to tell somebody that they're having rough times. So I think what Mark did was exceptional. SIMON: Mark Berg, do you ever think about going into another line of work? M BERG: At this point, I guess I've never - I don't see myself doing another line of work just because of the fact that, you know, I love taking care of the animals. And I know for a fact that now I'm at the point in my life where if cows were not a part of my day, I wouldn't be happy with what I was doing. SIMON: Penny Berg, you see a way out? P BERG: I kind of have the same feelings that Mark does. I guess the way out would be to have the milk prices increase. But I can't see myself with an empty barn. I've - I love the animals, and I can't see myself do anything else. I just can't. SIMON: Penny Berg, Mark Berg - mother and son dairy farmers in Minnesota - thank you so much for being with us. M BERG: Thank you. P BERG: Thank you for having us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  These are hard times for many Americans. For American dairy farmers, even a bit more. Milk prices are now just two-thirds what they were five years ago.

And credit card debt is on the rise. ODYSSEAS PAPADIMITRIOU: There is a significant group of our society that is kind of left behind. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's Odysseas Papadimitriou, CEO of the personal finance website WalletHub. We've heard about credit card debt being a problem for middle and working classes before, but it's now become an issue for the upper-middle class. Papadimitriou says they're in the sweet spot for this type of easy lending. PAPADIMITRIOU: It is the consumer group that wants to take on some additional debt and also has the income and the assets to justify so. GARCIA-NAVARRO: On top of that, recent numbers show that people approaching retirement age are also accruing larger amounts of credit card debt. PAPADIMITRIOU: You know, they're away from retirement enough years to feel like, I will make up for it later on. Let me go and make this purchase. And then they end up later on in retirement with credit card debt. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Credit card debt is at its highest level since 2008. WalletHub is projecting that each U. S. household will have an average of $9,300 in credit card debt by the end of the year. And Papadimitriou believes it's hitting a breaking point. PAPADIMITRIOU: We start defaulting. Credit card companies stop lending. More people get into trouble. Interest rates go up. Penalty fees go up. And you get into a vicious cycle. . . GARCIA-NAVARRO: That could have larger repercussions. PAPADIMITRIOU: . . . Which is, obviously, negative for the economy as well with spending power going down. GARCIA-NAVARRO: The level of credit card debt is one economic warning sign. But Papadimitriou worries that lawmakers and consumers aren't taking it seriously. He says it could take the threat of a recession to get them to act. PAPADIMITRIOU: We'll be going into a recession the next couple of years. I think the question is, when? If that recession comes before the election, I think, absolutely, it's going to be a major political headwind, if you will. If it comes afterwards, it's going to benefit, I think, the current administration. GARCIA-NAVARRO: His advice - just because you have credit available to you doesn't mean you should use it.

Instead, they rent and share a whole lot more - houses, cars, music, workspaces. In some places, this rental life has gone to an extreme. NPR's Sam Sanders has one such story. SAM SANDERS, BYLINE: Steven T. Johnson works in social media advertising, and he spends most of his days using things he does not own. STEVEN T JOHNSON: I took an Uber to Equinox to shower before we met and then went to PodShare and then came to WeWork. SANDERS: Steven took a ride-share to get to the gym he uses. He does not own a car. At the gym, he rents a locker. He uses the gym's laundry service because he does not own a washing machine. He doesn't even have an apartment, actually. JOHNSON: Exactly. SANDERS: We were going to meet at PodShare, this co-living space where Steven rents a bed - just a bed - in a big, open room with about a dozen other people. But it was too loud. So we went to his co-working space, a place called WeWork, where Steven rents a desk. WeWork is also an NPR sponsor. How do you keep track? JOHNSON: That's what's great. When you don't own things, you don't have to keep track of them. You just show up. SANDERS: Steven owns so little, he can carry most of his stuff in his hands. JOHNSON: I actually gave up my backpack about - that was the smallest I got down to - and I gave that up two months ago. SANDERS: Steven also only owns two outfits - well, two of the same outfit. JOHNSON: Under Armour brand-less sport shoes, Lululemon pants, Lululemon socks, Lululemon shirt, Lululemon underwear. SANDERS: Steven is part of a newish group of young people - kind of well-off but also, in a way, homeless. Does Steven represent a fundamental shift in American capitalism as we know it? SKYLER WANG: The fact is that we can't afford to sort of hoard anymore. SANDERS: That's Skylar Wang. He's a Ph. D. student at UC, Berkeley. He studies the sociology of the sharing economy. And he thinks one of the biggest factors in this economic shift is younger people buying fewer houses and choosing to live in dense urban areas and rent smaller places. Part of this is houses just being more expensive than they were for our parents. But when you're more OK with renting the place you live in, it's maybe a lot easier to accept the life where you rent and share a whole lot more. Wang does point out even if young people own less, they still have a lot of stuff, stuff that isn't tangible. WANG: I talked to a lot of minimalists. They are the type of people who love to couch-surf, right? They own, like, 30 things, but then the interesting thing is that they hoard digitally. SANDERS: They hoard digitally. WANG: They have tons of photographs. They have thousands and thousands of Instagram posts. SANDERS: It's still an economy of stuff. It's just different stuff. It's experiences. So how do businesses deal with this? For starters, a lot more companies are getting into rentals. Even IKEA is starting to lease its furniture. The outdoor chain REI announced recently that it's vastly expanding its rental program for things like camping gear. Eric Artz is the acting CEO of the company. He says this requires a different kind of outreach - selling experience more than the actual item. ERIC ARTZ: We're selling joy. You know, we're selling inspiration when you get out on a trail or go for a bike ride. You know, we're selling the adrenaline buzz at the end of a run. We're just trying to enable that in any way we possibly can. SANDERS: We should point out REI is an NPR sponsor. Juliet Schor is a sociologist at Boston College. She studies the rental and sharing economies. And she says not everyone's in it for the same reasons. Some are doing it just for joy. Some are doing it to move towards more personal and less corporate transactions. Others are willing to spend more for convenience. But a lot rent and share because they're broke and they need to save money. JULIET SCHOR: So I think it's a mistake to characterize them with one kind of economic orientation or orientation to money. SANDERS: Which makes it really hard to predict whether renting and sharing is our long-term future or just a fad, even for Steven Jones (ph) who is totally plugged in to a rental life. JOHNSON: It's not something that you can do forever because you do need to have a place that you can genuinely point to and say this is my home. SANDERS: I asked him how long he can live the way he's living now - a bed in a large, shared room. He's already done that off and on for more than a year, sometimes for months at a time. Steven tells me he does not know, but he also says he didn't think he'd make it this far. Sam Sanders, NPR News.

NPR broke that news back in February. It put many greeters, particularly those with disabilities, in limbo, anxious to learn whether they could stay with Walmart. NPR's Alina Selyukh spent time recently with one Florida greeter. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: His name is Justin Kelley, and that weekend in February, he made the biggest financial commitment of his 33-year-old life - he paid a friend to start custom-building an airboat. (SOUNDBITE OF ENGINE TURNING OVER)SELYUKH: If you can't picture it, airboats are very flat with a giant propeller in the back and usually an airplane engine. They're big in central Florida. And Kelley has always lived around these lakes. Daredevils like him will run these boats on both water and dry land, in the marshes - going fishing, hunting, just cruising. JUSTIN KELLEY: We can go see water buffalo, axis deer, turkey, hog, gator - just pure God's country. SELYUKH: Of all the sounds in the world, Kelley says this engine's roar is one that calms him down. But it's not just that - onshore, he uses a walker to get around. Kelley has cerebral palsy. But on a boat. . . KELLEY: It, to me, is the one place that, when I'm in that seat, you don't see that walker. You don't see the chair. To me, that's my level playing ground; it's my freedom. SELYUKH: His dreamt half his life of building his own boat, made just right, just for him. But then two days after putting down money for the boat. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Walmart. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Walmart. STEVE INSKEEP, BYLINE: Walmart is saying goodbye to its greeters. SELYUKH: Kelley was among the greeters at about 1,000 Walmart stores who learned their job would be eliminated in late April. That gave them 60 days to get reassigned or take severance and leave. KELLEY: Everything I've worked for is, like, standstill right now because my whole life's on hold. SELYUKH: His life is on hold because, when I meet him, it's Day 49, and his job is still in limbo. Many other greeters have reassigned to new front-door jobs, but they're now more focused on security and helping shoppers so they have new requirements, like lifting 25 pounds or climbing ladders. Kelley uses a wheelchair at work, and he does not qualify. Walmart - which we should note is an NPR sponsor - told me that the majority of greeters who, quote, \"expressed interest\" in other roles would get reassigned at the end of 60 days - just some may be slower than others. KELLEY: There's lakes back in there, lakes over there (laughter). SELYUKH: When I meet Kelley on his porch, he actually strikes me as a pretty happy-go-lucky kind of guy, except lately he has not been sleeping well, spending more time in his room applying and hustling for new work - so far, no takers. Someone wants to buy his boat, which would float him for a while, but it took him five years to save for it. KELLEY: So do I start selling my stuff that I just bought? Do I take my dream right now and just go buy a for-sale sign? What do I do? SELYUKH: Friends reassure him, but he says their names aren't on the bills on his counter, and his life has a few more unique expenses. Because he spends so much time outdoors and out on the town, he goes through walkers three times faster than he's prescribed new ones. KELLEY: Luckily for me, most of my friends are welders. So we'll fix it, or my mom and dad - that'll be my Christmas present, is a walker. SELYUKH: Another expense is getting to the Walmart, almost nine miles away. Kelley doesn't live near public transportation, so on a short shift, he might spend almost half the day's pay just traveling to work. It's usually a $12 Uber ride or friends with cars. KELLEY: Let's do this. SELYUKH: Today, his longtime friend Karen (ph) arrives more than an hour before Kelley's shift. He's already waiting for her in work boots, that trademark Walmart yellow vest and blue hat in the sandy driveway. KAREN: I got to go backwards because I can't go frontwards. SELYUKH: After Kelley climbs into the passenger seat, she folds his wheelchair into the trunk. Kelley says, growing up, he often felt that people thought his parents were mean for how they pushed him to be self-sufficient, like learning to climb into a tall truck. His dad would say. . . KELLEY: Well, he knows the rules - if he can't do it himself, he can't go. SELYUKH: Kelley says now he thanks them for that all the time. So for a guy this independent-minded, you can imagine how important a job is. KELLEY: It's not, like, my life goal to live off a disability check. I don't want housing. I don't want free medical stuff. I want to be able say I paid for all that myself. SELYUKH: Finding and sometimes keeping jobs has not been easy for Kelley. He spent a year looking before he got hired at Walmart. He's been there nine years. KELLEY: For me to say that I work for a company - I got a 401(k), I got a chance to get insurance - that meant a lot to me, and I take a lot of pride in that. SELYUKH: Today Kelley works the garden entry at Walmart, greeting and checking receipts. RONALD SMITH: He's a good friend. I love him to death. He's a good guy. SELYUKH: Ronald Smith stops by to get medicine for his wife. SMITH: I hollered at him; I always do - going in and coming out. SELYUKH: At Kelley's Supercenter, every other shopper seems to know him. And Kelley says he also has a great manager who's been very understanding, fighting to keep him. Every day he's in, Kelley asks his bosses if they've heard about his job from corporate. On most days, they have not; but on Day 49 of his wait, they do have news. And it's good - he's smiling when I see him. Congratulations are in order. KELLEY: Thank you. Thank you. SELYUKH: Walmart is reassigning Kelley; he'll now be helping shoppers in the self-checkout area. He signed his offer on the spot. KELLEY: It's a big weight lifted off my shoulders. SELYUKH: Kelley is excited for stability, though, also, already worrying about lining up rides for a new schedule. But he's grateful, and more importantly, his boat is no longer for sale. Alina Selyukh, NPR News, Lake Wales, Fla. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  By today, a thousand Walmart stores were to eliminate their greeters - those workers who welcome shoppers. NPR broke that news back in February. It put many greeters, particularly those with disabilities, in limbo, anxious to learn whether they could stay with Walmart. NPR's Alina Selyukh spent time recently with one Florida greeter. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: His name is Justin Kelley, and that weekend in February, he made the biggest financial commitment of his 33-year-old life - he paid a friend to start custom-building an airboat. (SOUNDBITE OF ENGINE TURNING OVER) SELYUKH: If you can't picture it, airboats are very flat with a giant propeller in the back and usually an airplane engine. They're big in central Florida. And Kelley has always lived around these lakes. Daredevils like him will run these boats on both water and dry land, in the marshes - going fishing, hunting, just cruising. JUSTIN KELLEY: We can go see water buffalo, axis deer, turkey, hog, gator - just pure God's country. SELYUKH: Of all the sounds in the world, Kelley says this engine's roar is one that calms him down. But it's not just that - onshore, he uses a walker to get around. Kelley has cerebral palsy. But on a boat. . . KELLEY: It, to me, is the one place that, when I'm in that seat, you don't see that walker. You don't see the chair. To me, that's my level playing ground; it's my freedom. SELYUKH: His dreamt half his life of building his own boat, made just right, just for him. But then two days after putting down money for the boat. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Walmart. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Walmart. STEVE INSKEEP, BYLINE: Walmart is saying goodbye to its greeters. SELYUKH: Kelley was among the greeters at about 1,000 Walmart stores who learned their job would be eliminated in late April. That gave them 60 days to get reassigned or take severance and leave. KELLEY: Everything I've worked for is, like, standstill right now because my whole life's on hold. SELYUKH: His life is on hold because, when I meet him, it's Day 49, and his job is still in limbo. Many other greeters have reassigned to new front-door jobs, but they're now more focused on security and helping shoppers so they have new requirements, like lifting 25 pounds or climbing ladders. Kelley uses a wheelchair at work, and he does not qualify. Walmart - which we should note is an NPR sponsor - told me that the majority of greeters who, quote, \"expressed interest\" in other roles would get reassigned at the end of 60 days - just some may be slower than others.

Drivers here are soon going to be charged a toll to enter certain crowded neighborhoods.

(SOUNDBITE OF SIREN SOUNDING)DARIUS RAFIEYAN, BYLINE: We are standing at 42nd Street and 1st Avenue. We are going to try to do the impossible - get crosstown at rush hour. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE: So we should try to hail a cab. It looks like there's some cabs. We're just going all the way across town to the West Side. So this congestion pricing plan was passed by the New York legislature, but it won't be put in place for a couple of years. RAFIEYAN: Bruce Schaller, a transportation consultant who used to work for the city of New York, thinks that the system could really help cut down on traffic in the city. BRUCE SCHALLER: Because as you charge people, some people will decide to take the subway or bus to come in instead of driving. Secondly, it raises very badly needed revenue for public transportation. RAFIEYAN: It's estimated that New York will need to spend tens of billions of dollars to fix the subway system. VANEK SMITH: And congestion pricing has proven itself to be a really fast, effective way to raise money, says Bruce. Places like Singapore and Stockholm do it. London rolled out congestion pricing, and they've seen speeds increase by 30 percent. RAFIEYAN: So checking in. We're just passing Grand Central Station. We have been in the cab for six minutes. VANEK SMITH: Not bad. RAFIEYAN: There are still plenty of details that need to get ironed out, not least of which is, just how much is this toll going to cost? New York Governor Andrew Cuomo suggested a flat fee, per car, per day, of about $11 or $12 and $25 for trucks. But there will be some exemptions. The state has already approved breaks for emergency vehicles, for people with disabilities. And other groups are asking for exemptions, as well - delivery truck drivers, livery cab drivers, motorcyclists, police officers. VANEK SMITH: And that could really affect how much money the congestion pricing plan brings in. RAFIEYAN: Yeah. Because if cabs and delivery trucks and buses all get exemptions then who's going to be paying the toll? SCHALLER: I think it's really a question of choosing between two things. One is having people pay for something like this, and secondly, seeing the subway system continue to go downhill, seeing the streets become even more congested. And I think that in terms of the future of the city, it's really clear that we need to solve some of these problems, and congestion pricing is one part of that. VANEK SMITH: And Bruce says a whole bunch of cities are watching what happens in New York to see if maybe they will also try out congestion pricing. Washington, D. C. , San Francisco and Boston are all looking at this as a possible way to cut down on traffic and pollution and, you know, mostly to just raise a ton of money.

S. economy started 2019 with a bang. A report from the Commerce Department shows the economy grew at an annual rate of 3. 2% percent in the first three months of the year; that's a full point faster than it was growing at the end of last year. And as NPR's Scott Horsley reports, it's an encouraging sign that while other economies around the world may be tapping the brakes, the U. S. is still humming along. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The first quarter growth rate of 3. 2% was better than anyone expected - well, almost anyone. KEVIN HASSETT: Do you remember what our forecast for this year is? Three point two. And what was the first quarter? HORSLEY: White House economist Kevin Hassett hit the bull's-eye with his growth forecast. And while there's no guarantee the rest of the year will see similar growth, President Trump couldn't help gloating, as he prepared to board his helicopter outside the White House. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're knocking it out of the park, as they say, and we're very happy about that. HORSLEY: Many forecasters outside the administration say first quarter growth was boosted by temporary factors, and they don't believe the economy will continue to grow at this pace. Economist Ben Herzon of IHS Markit notes, with demand weak early in the year, many of the goods produced during the first quarter piled up in warehouses and on store shelves. BEN HERZON: I think what's going to happen is, after a first quarter burst in inventory building, that inventory building's going to slow down and contribute to a slowing in overall GDP growth. HORSLEY: White House economist Hassett agrees - sometimes a buildup in inventory is followed by a slump in production. But he's counting on a jump in demand the rest of this year to keep factories and other producers busy. HASSETT: So I'm not as concerned about the inventories as I normally would be. HORSLEY: Consumer spending did start to heat up towards the end of the quarter, as shoppers set aside their winter concerns over the government shutdown and stock market gyrations. Jack Kleinhenz of the National Retail Federation says consumers do have the money to spend more, thanks to a healthy job market. JACK KLEINHENZ: Every new job, we get new income into the economy, and that creates more spending. HORSLEY: Wage gains have been solid, if not spectacular, and some of the biggest raises have gone to those at the bottom of the income ladder, who are especially likely to spend the extra cash. Fears of an all-out trade war also eased during the first quarter. Chief economist Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics says most observers are now counting on the president to strike a deal with China and avoid a costly escalation of tariffs. MARK ZANDI: If he fails to follow through on that, I think there's going to be a lot disappointment around the globe, stock markets will fall, and the year is going to turn out to be much less positive than anyone would expect at this point. HORSLEY: Trade talks with China resume in Beijing next week. White House economist Hassett says the two sides are making progress towards an agreement. HASSETT: Last time I used a wedding analogy - I said we're at the point where we don't want the groom to see the bride. But now I think we're past that point. I think now we're at the point where we don't want Dustin Hoffman to show up at the wedding (laughter).

S. economy keeps growing. The pace of growth was strong in the first three months of the year. Now a report from the Commerce Department this morning shows better-than-expected annual growth in the first quarter of 3. 2%. Just a few weeks ago, forecasters were warning of a sharp slowdown in economic growth. A rebound in consumer spending helped turn things around, among other factors, which NPR's Scott Horsley is in the studio to explain. Hey, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Rachel. MARTIN: How big a surprise is this number? HORSLEY: You know, forecasters had been upping their estimates of GDP in recent weeks. But this is better than they were expecting. If you look back to the middle of March, there were dire warnings that first quarter GDP could be, you know, 1% or even lower. But there have been some good trade numbers that have come in since then, a strong rebound in consumer spending last month. And even with those revisions, this is still an eye-popping number. And it's going to be celebrated at the White House. The Trump administration has been promising growth of 3%. . . MARTIN: Right. HORSLEY: . . . Or better thanks to its tax cut and other economic policies. They basically hit the 3% target for 2018, and now they're starting off 2019 hitting that mark. Here's White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow talking to reporters earlier this week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LARRY KUDLOW: I know I may be at loggerheads with some of the forecasters or maybe even the consensus, but I really think this is going to turn out to be a pretty strong first half and a pretty strong year. We're staying with our 3% economic growth estimates. HORSLEY: Now, Kudlow is at odds with a lot of forecasters outside the administration. They're dubious this rapid pace of growth can be maintained. MARTIN: Why? I mean, why can't it be sustained? HORSLEY: You know, independent forecasters generally expect a slowdown in economic growth to around 2% this year as the effects of the tax cut and big government spending from last year wear off. In fact, we're already seeing some of that. Federal spending was a drag on GDP in the first quarter. What's more - some of the factors behind that headline number of 3. 2% are temporary, not likely to be sustained. For example, we saw a buildup in inventories during the first quarter. But, you know, as warehouses get full and stockpiles get to a certain point, they're not going to keep growing at that pace. We also saw a decline in imports in the first quarter. Imports count against our GDP. If the imports bounce back to more normal levels, that would put a damper on economic growth going forward. MARTIN: We also mentioned that consumer spending had a role in this, right? It bounced back at the end of the quarter. But it's been pretty volatile itself, hasn't it? - that metric. HORSLEY: Yeah. Consumers spent heavily in March, and that's a good sign. But we'd seen some shaky spending earlier in the quarter - kind of a hangover of what we saw at the end of 2018. In December, there was a sort of disappointing holiday shopping season. Consumers seemed rattled by the government shutdown, by some of the trade tensions, by the gyrations in the stock market. Now it seems consumers are shrugging off those worries. They're opening their pocketbooks again. And, Rachel, they've got money in those pocketbooks because we still have, you know, a really strong job market. And we're seeing strong if not spectacular gains in employee wages. MARTIN: All right. NPR's chief economics correspondent Scott Horsley reporting on the new Commerce Department stats showing a growth in the first quarter of the U. S. economy of 3. 2%. Scott, thanks. We appreciate it. HORSLEY: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:   The U. S. economy keeps growing. The pace of growth was strong in the first three months of the year.

MARTIN: How big a surprise is this number? HORSLEY: You know, forecasters had been upping their estimates of GDP in recent weeks. But this is better than they were expecting. If you look back to the middle of March, there were dire warnings that first quarter GDP could be, you know, 1% or even lower. But there have been some good trade numbers that have come in since then, a strong rebound in consumer spending last month. And even with those revisions, this is still an eye-popping number. And it's going to be celebrated at the White House. The Trump administration has been promising growth of 3%. . . MARTIN: Right. HORSLEY: . . . Or better thanks to its tax cut and other economic policies. They basically hit the 3% target for 2018, and now they're starting off 2019 hitting that mark. Here's White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow talking to reporters earlier this week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LARRY KUDLOW: I know I may be at loggerheads with some of the forecasters or maybe even the consensus, but I really think this is going to turn out to be a pretty strong first half and a pretty strong year. We're staying with our 3% economic growth estimates. HORSLEY: Now, Kudlow is at odds with a lot of forecasters outside the administration. They're dubious this rapid pace of growth can be maintained. MARTIN: Why? I mean, why can't it be sustained? HORSLEY: You know, independent forecasters generally expect a slowdown in economic growth to around 2% this year as the effects of the tax cut and big government spending from last year wear off. In fact, we're already seeing some of that. Federal spending was a drag on GDP in the first quarter. What's more - some of the factors behind that headline number of 3. 2% are temporary, not likely to be sustained. For example, we saw a buildup in inventories during the first quarter. But, you know, as warehouses get full and stockpiles get to a certain point, they're not going to keep growing at that pace. We also saw a decline in imports in the first quarter. Imports count against our GDP. If the imports bounce back to more normal levels, that would put a damper on economic growth going forward. MARTIN: We also mentioned that consumer spending had a role in this, right? It bounced back at the end of the quarter. But it's been pretty volatile itself, hasn't it? - that metric. HORSLEY: Yeah. Consumers spent heavily in March, and that's a good sign. But we'd seen some shaky spending earlier in the quarter - kind of a hangover of what we saw at the end of 2018. In December, there was a sort of disappointing holiday shopping season. Consumers seemed rattled by the government shutdown, by some of the trade tensions, by the gyrations in the stock market. Now it seems consumers are shrugging off those worries. They're opening their pocketbooks again. And, Rachel, they've got money in those pocketbooks because we still have, you know, a really strong job market. And we're seeing strong if not spectacular gains in employee wages. MARTIN: All right. NPR's chief economics correspondent Scott Horsley reporting on the new Commerce Department stats showing a growth in the first quarter of the U. S. economy of 3. 2%. Scott, thanks. We appreciate it. HORSLEY: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)", "section": "Economy", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Second-Hand books, vintage clothes, couches - but dinosaur fossils. Yup, you can make good money selling fossils online, but that does not sit well with some scientists. Cardiff Garcia and Stacey Vanek Smith - they are hosts of NPR's podcast The Indicator From Planet Money. And they've got the story of one guy's attempt to e-sell (ph) a Tyrannosaurus rex. CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE: Here is the specific eBay listing for the T-Rex. It reads young, baby T. rex dinosaur fossil. The price - $2. 95 million. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE: So first question - who has a T. rex to sell on eBay? ALAN DIETRICH: Hi, I'm Alan Dietrich. And I'm a professional dinosaur hunter. VANEK SMITH: In the U. S. , if you find a dinosaur on your property, you own it. It's yours. GARCIA: So fossil hunters like Alan go to fossil country. DIETRICH: I went to where they would find the big T. rexes - Garfield County, Mont. , and Harding County, S. D. GARCIA: They find the person who owns the property where the dinosaur is. And he says, let me look around your land for dinosaur bones. And if I find one, I'll give you a cut. VANEK SMITH: Alan's found a lot of fossils this way, including the baby T. rex. GARCIA: Finding dinosaur bones and selling them to museums and private buyers is how Alan makes money. One of the pioneers of this business is Pete Larson. Larson runs the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research in South Dakota. PETE LARSON: So far, we've collected 10 different Tyrannosaurus rex skeletons and partial skeletons. And that's kind of a record, I guess. VANEK SMITH: OK, Pete is being modest. There are around 40 T. rex skeletons that have ever been discovered, and Pete has found 10 of them. GARCIA: When Pete started out in the fossil business in the late '70s, it wasn't really a job that people had. But that changed in the mid-90s, when a couple of things happened. First. . . (SOUNDBITE OF JOHN WILLIAMS' \"THEME FROM JURASSIC PARK\")VANEK SMITH: \"Jurassic Park. \"GARCIA: Yeah (laughter). VANEK SMITH: (Laughter) That's such a good roar. GARCIA: Steven Spielberg happened. . . VANEK SMITH: Yes. GARCIA: . . . Basically. VANEK SMITH: Steven Spielberg happened. \"Jurassic Park\" was this huge hit. And suddenly, everybody was super into fossils and wanted to hunt for them. GARCIA: And number two, one of the T. rexes that Pete Larson found - a T. rex named Sue - fetched more than $8 million from a buyer. And people thought, whoa, there's real money to be made in dinosaurs. VANEK SMITH: And suddenly, Montana and South Dakota were just, like, crawling with fossil prospectors. And fossil hunting went from this kind of sleepy, shoestring, academic pursuit to a pretty hot, little business. GARCIA: Alan Dietrich is hoping to get a premium for Son of Samson because it's the only known baby T. rex. VANEK SMITH: So I'm looking at it now. It's 2. 95 million. DIETRICH: I priced it cheap. . . VANEK SMITH: You - it's priced to move (laughter). DIETRICH: . . . For a quick sale, yeah. GARCIA: Now, the for-profit fossil business has caused a lot of controversy among museums and the academic community because some of the people hunting just have no qualifications, so they can end up easily destroying priceless fossils. But Larson says the fossil market has to evolve with the times. LARSON: Without these private collectors, most museums would not be able to get real fossils for exhibit. GARCIA: The eBay play seems to be working. Alan Dietrich says he's gotten an offer. VANEK SMITH: Was it a good offer? DIETRICH: Well, I'm going to use a double entendre with you. VANEK SMITH: OK. DIETRICH: It's a bona fide offer. (LAUGHTER)VANEK SMITH: Stacey Vanek Smith. GARCIA: Cardiff Garcia, NPR News.

Employers added 263,000 new jobs last month. That's more than analysts had been expecting. And it's another sign that the U. S. economy keeps moving along after almost a decade of economic growth. NPR economics correspondent Scott Horsley is with us this morning. Hi, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Rachel. MARTIN: Pretty encouraging jobs numbers here - what do they tell us? HORSLEY: Well, there's certainly no slowdown in the labor market. In fact, the pace of hiring is accelerating. In the first three months of 2019, we saw average monthly job gains of about 180,000. This is obviously well above that. We also saw a modest revision in February's jobs number, which had been sort of the low point in the year. So even though, as you say, the economic expansion is about to begin its second decade, it shows no signs of slowing down. MARTIN: What about wages? That strong job market is helping to push wages up. HORSLEY: That's right. Wages rose at an average of 3. 2 percent over the last year. That's about the pace they've been climbing in recent months. And one thing that's encouraging is the strongest wage gains have come at the bottom of the income ladder. That's partly because of cities and states that have raised their minimum wage. But it's also because employers are having to compete for labor. And we're kind of in a sweet spot right now because workers are getting more money in their pockets, but wages are not going up so fast that inflation becomes a big concern. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell addressed that this week and said he sees more room for the growth to continue. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEROME POWELL: For a long time now, there've been anecdotal reports of labor shortages and difficulty in finding skilled labor and that kind of thing. Nonetheless, you have very strong job creation. And you have wages moving up at a rate that is appropriate but not at all signaling any overheating at all. HORSLEY: One thing that's helping is workers are becoming more productive. We got a report yesterday showing strong productivity gains in the first quarter. And that means employers can keep their costs in check, even as they're paying their workers a little bit more. MARTIN: And what about that unemployment number, 3. 6 percent? That is the lowest we have seen since 1969. What does that tell us? HORSLEY: Yeah, that's a great bumper sticker. It's actually, though, not a great statistic in this case because the reason unemployment ticked down in April was a lot of people left the job market, according to the survey that's used to compile that number - nearly half a million people. Now, that's in contrast to the pattern we've been seeing in recent months, when a lot of people were coming off the sidelines and looking for work because the job market's been so strong. And it's that trend we want to continue if we want to keep this expansion going. We want to certainly keep an eye that - on that labor force participation number. It can bounce around a little bit. And it may be noisy. We want to see participation increasing. In April, though, it went the other direction. MARTIN: Any other weak spots in this report? HORSLEY: Manufacturing employment was kind of weak. Factories added only 4,000 jobs last month. And revised figures for March show flat hiring in factories. For much of the last year, we saw manufacturing growing at about 22,000 jobs per month. So that does appear to be slowing down. That's consistent with some other indicators we've seen about manufacturing. The factory sector's still growing, just not as fast as it was last year. We're also seeing continued job losses in the retail sector. We lost 12,000 retail jobs last month. But we gained 11,000 jobs in warehousing and transportation. So you see right there the shift to e-commerce. On the whole, though, a pretty strong report - good gains in business, health care and construction.

As of now, those talks are scheduled to resume on Thursday. And to tell us more about the state of play, NPR's Jim Zarroli joins us now. Hi, Jim. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Hello, Ari. SHAPIRO: The U. S. and China have been negotiating for months about trade, and things seemed to be going pretty well up until this weekend. What happened? ZARROLI: Yeah. It seemed like the two countries were really moving toward a deal, which would be just an enormous breakthrough if it happened. There were still some outstanding issues. I mean, the United States wants China to address intellectual property theft and stop subsidizing its businesses. So these are real issues, real hurdles. But I think the feeling until today was that both sides really want a deal. And people like Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Larry Kudlow, who's the director of the National Economic Council, were out making a lot of very positive statements about the talks. So I think the financial markets had been sort of lulled into thinking that a deal was in the works. And then all of a sudden, everything just changed, that - things just seemed to have collapsed. SHAPIRO: So this goes back to the question, what happened? I mean, what triggered President Trump's tweets? ZARROLI: Well, we don't know for sure, but the the president's trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, said late this afternoon that China had backtracked on some of the promises it made. He said, \"we felt we were on track to get somewhere. Over the course of the last week or so, we've seen an erosion in commitments by China. I would say retreating from commitments that have already been made in our judgment,\" unquote. He said, we're moving backwards instead of forwards, and that is not acceptable to the president. And then the treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, said something similar. He said, the talks had gone substantially backward. But they did not provide any real details about what the disagreement is right now. SHAPIRO: OK, so tell us about the impact of this. The stock market opened a lot lower this morning after the president's comments. It came back somewhat after that. What's going on? ZARROLI: Yeah. I think Trump's tweets really scared people. I mean, he's talking about raising tariffs from 10 to 25% on $200 billion in imports and doing it as early as Friday. So a lot of companies that do a great deal of business in China like Apple and Qualcomm - they saw their stocks fall. And then today Robert Lighthizer, you know, said for sure that will happen one minute after midnight on Friday. So that will be a really big deal of it actually happens. But I think a lot of people in the stock market today were asking, you know, how serious is Trump? Is this just a negotiating tactic? Is he trying to, you know, squeeze China a little more? The United States has gotten some good economic news lately like Friday's unemployment report. And, you know, maybe Trump feels like he can play hardball, that the U. S. economy can withstand a little bit of a trade war. So I think people today were trying to figure out what that meant. And then after the markets closed, Lighthizer came out and made these comments about the tariffs. And you saw the stock futures fall again. So we are in a very volatile situation, really a high-stakes environment that's going to affect a lot of businesses. And it's a pretty safe bet that tomorrow the markets are going to open lower. SHAPIRO: And then on Thursday these talks between the U. S. and China are scheduled to resume. What do you expect to happen? ZARROLI: Well, the trip is still on. You know, it was a question of who will be part of the delegation. China could try to send a message by downgrading the delegation. I talked to Eswar Prasad of the Brookings Institution today, and he said the Chinese government really doesn't want to be seen as weak. ESWAR PRASAD: The complication right now is that the Chinese cannot afford domestically to be seen as cravenly giving in to U. S. demands, which in the Chinese narrative are multiplying by the day. ZARROLI: At the same time, China wants to get a deal. Its economy is slowing. A trade war with the United States would really aggravate the problems it faces. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Jim Zarroli.

I talked to Eswar Prasad of the Brookings Institution today, and he said the Chinese government really doesn't want to be seen as weak. ESWAR PRASAD: The complication right now is that the Chinese cannot afford domestically to be seen as cravenly giving in to U. S. demands, which in the Chinese narrative are multiplying by the day. ZARROLI: At the same time, China wants to get a deal. Its economy is slowing. A trade war with the United States would really aggravate the problems it faces. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Jim Zarroli.

It's expected to be one of the biggest IPOs in U. S. history. The company's grown massively over the last 10 years. You can hail Ubers all over the world. But it has never turned a profit. So is Uber actually worth 80- to $90 billion? NPR's Camila Domonoske has the story. CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: Uber started as a ride-hailing app, and it's become a household name. In fact, it was so popular that it became shorthand for any new app offering a service on demand. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: It's like Uber for dog owners. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Uber for conversations and. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: The Uber for trucks. MANISHA KRISHNAN: It's almost like Uber for weed. DOMONOSKE: These days, Uber itself wants to be the Uber for a lot more than just ride-hailing - Uber, but for takeout; Uber, but for packages; Uber, but for bikes and scooters. The company has spent a lot of money to expand like that. And it's expensive to try to be the Uber for everything. And it's had to keep rates low to compete with rivals. All told, it's losing billions of dollars a year, so how will it start making money? YGAL AROUNIAN: That's the hundred-billion-dollar question, right? DOMONOSKE: Ygal Arounian is an equity analyst at Wedbush Securities. AROUNIAN: Uber is losing money. And you have to have a little bit of a vision to see them taking that revenue and start turning it into profit. DOMONOSKE: Arounian is optimistic. Here's his vision. Once Uber has waited out the competition, the company can stop offering so many discounts. AROUNIAN: Rates will go up, or I think maybe a better way to look at it is that there will be less times where they'll get, like, a coupon, right? DOMONOSKE: Plus, he says, being the Uber for everything has its advantages. AROUNIAN: What they want to do is have their drivers drive for both ride-share and Uber Eats - you know, picking people up and dropping them off. Lunchtime kicks in; they're dropping off food. They switch back on during evening rush hour to drop people off, and then they could do dinner, right? DOMONOSKE: That gives it an edge over companies that just offer one service. Cut some expenses, eventually roll out self-driving cars, and you may have a recipe for profits. There's reason to be skeptical. To make this recipe work, Uber has to crush a small army of competitors. And when it comes to self-driving cars, there are huge challenges, including regulatory hurdles. Analysts who believe in Uber's future profits emphasize they're talking about the long term. In the meantime, aside from the minor detail that it burns billions of dollars each year, Uber has other challenges. Drivers have complained about their pay. Yesterday, cities across the U. S. saw drivers strike or protest. James Hicks was protesting in Los Angeles on Wednesday. JAMES HICKS: My main concern is making sure that each and every individual driver makes enough money to put food on their table, to pay their bills, to feed their children. DOMONOSKE: Some drivers have called to be treated like employees, not contractors, which would hurt Uber financially. And the company was long famous for openly flouting laws, and its corporate culture was toxic. Women who worked at Uber have reported rampant sexual harassment. Uber ousted co-founder Travis Kalanick as CEO and replaced him with Dara Khosrowshahi, who's been tasked with cleaning up shop. That included releasing a video that was an apology of sorts.

One reason for caution is the example set by ride-sharing rival Lyft, which set an ambitious price for its shares. After an initial pop, stock prices slid down dramatically.

KITTLE: I think about 30%. NOGUCHI: But much of the remaining 70% of goods are also affected. KITTLE: Much like automobiles, parts of those goods are produced offshore, some in China. NOGUCHI: Kittle's been through this before. Last September, a 10% tariff took effect. Back then, Kittle and his Chinese suppliers agreed to absorb most of that. The cost to consumers only increased 3%. This time around, his suppliers can't afford to do that, and neither can Kittle or other retailers. KITTLE: The vendor is no longer going to be able to take anymore. The retailer is not going to be able to absorb it because right now, retailers are at best marginally profitable. And furniture is no different. NOGUCHI: Existing tariffs are already making life more expensive. They've increased consumer costs by $1. 4 billion a month, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. To date, tariffs have largely affected raw materials, like chemicals and wooden beams used to make other products. New tariffs will affect a larger number of finished goods - things consumers actually buy, like bicycles. Katheryn Russ is an economics professor at the University of California at Davis. She says the latest round of tariffs will add another $500 a year in costs for the average American household. And that could grow. President Trump has pledged to broaden tariffs even further to all Chinese imports, including big-ticket items.

So Kittle's customers are already squeezed. KITTLE: If they don't have the money even to buy a tractor, they're probably not going to buy furniture.

Since China imposed tariffs last fall, farmer Brent Bible has nowhere to sell his soybean and corn crops. And that situation just got worse.

Scott, you heard what Dan DiMicco said. Are tariffs working? SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Well, they're certainly working for the steel industry that he represents, but they're not necessarily working for the larger economy. But no question, President Trump is a big fan of import tariffs. Economists say he has a fundamental misunderstanding of how these import taxes work. The president acts as if it's China that's getting the bill for his tariffs, but there are numerous studies saying the cost is being borne by U. S. consumers and businesses. And he's certainly hurting U. S. exporters. You talk about the farmers. Now the president's talking about using tariff revenue to offer relief to those hurting farmers. So just to be clear, President Trump is talking about taxing American consumers to buy produce from American farmers that those farmers can't sell to China because of retaliation for the president's tariffs. SIMON: And what about the argument that the economy is doing as well as it is precisely because of the tariffs? And Mr. DiMicco cited the steel industry. HORSLEY: The economy is doing well. We saw better-than-expected economic growth in the first quarter. We added more than a quarter-million jobs last month. And there are people like Mr. DiMicco who say that's because of the tariffs. But it's actually more likely the U. S. economy is doing well in spite of the president's tariffs, not because them. If you look at consumer confidence, if you look at the stock market, if you look at retail spending, they have generally done better at those times when it looked as if we were about to strike a truce with China, and they've tended to suffer whenever the trade war ratchets up. SIMON: Can tariffs be effective economic leverage on China? Is it the kind of economy that can be affected that way? HORSLEY: Certainly, it is possible that it was the tariffs that helped bring China to the bargaining table. And that's been the defense offered by folks who call themselves free traders of using these tariffs as sort of an instrument to further negotiations. But more and more, the president is talking about these tariffs not as a means to an end, not as a way to drive negotiations towards a future free trade agreement, but rather as an end in itself. Yesterday, the president was tweeting that the tariffs themselves will make America stronger than a conventional trade agreement would. And if you look at, for example, the steel and aluminum tariffs that the president posed on Canada and Mexico as a way to drive negotiations for a new NAFTA, now he's got that new NAFTA, and those steel and aluminum tariffs have remained in place. SIMON: And how does this fit into the administration's overall policy on trade? You note the quarrel we've had with Canada, for example. HORSLEY: Well, that's right. And, you know, Mr. DiMicco's absolutely right that there is a general international consensus that China has followed unfair trade practices and needs to be disciplined. But the president might have been in a stronger position to push that argument if he had not simultaneously picked fights with allies in Europe, in Canada, in Mexico, if he had not pulled out of the big Asia-Pacific trade agreement with 11 other countries - China not one of them, but all of that designed to put pressure on China. Instead, he has pursued a go-it-alone strategy and sacrificed allies who would've naturally been on the U. S. side in this fight. SIMON: And now tariffs are going to go up and on, perhaps, all Chinese goods, right? HORSLEY: You mentioned that last night, the U. S. trade representative formally began the process of extending tariffs to the 300 or so billion dollars' worth of imports that weren't already being taxed by the Trump administration. And while they have taken pains up until now to try to shelter consumer goods, this means the tariffs are going to fall on consumer items - the kind of thing you buy at Walmart and Target. And it's going to be impossible for the administration to hide those taxes. SIMON: Scott Horsley, thank you. HORSLEY: You're welcome.

S. and China broke off trade talks with no agreement as President Trump raised tariffs from 10% to 25% on $200 billion worth of goods from China. He also directed his trade office to start the process of raising tariffs on essentially all remaining imports from China. China says it will impose necessary countermeasures. Dan DiMicco is a former trade adviser for Donald Trump in 2016 and is currently chairman for the Coalition for a Prosperous America. Mr. DiMicco, thanks so much for being with us. DAN DIMICCO: My pleasure, Scott. SIMON: President Trump tweeted, tariffs will make our country MUCH STRONGER - all caps - not weaker. Just sit back and watch. But economists usually don't like tariffs, do they? It raises prices, reduces purchases and production. How does this make the U. S. stronger? DIMICCO: Well, listen; our economists have been dead wrong for a long time about the fact that free trade would work for us. And they have - are dead wrong now again. For far too long, China has repeatedly threatened U. S. economic and national security interests. And, finally, we have a president who's serious about getting tough on China and fighting for fair, reciprocal trade. And Trump is taking a long overdue action here on this. He's standing up to China's unfair trade practices. He defended American intellectual property. The whole world knows that China cheats. This is not new news. It's been talked about in every major newspaper. Even the economists recognize that. But they've been dead wrong about the impact of tariffs, and we can talk some more about that. SIMON: Well, you know, we have interviewed people, as every news organization has, over the past few months about the effect of - people who say they're hurt by the tariffs. Soybean futures are at their lowest prices in a decade. We've interviewed farmers, manufacturers who use steel, people in the fishing industry in Maine. They've been hurt by tariffs that have gone up 10%. Now it'll be 25%. Won't Americans wind up paying more? DIMICCO: Well, here's the reality, OK? You talk to some people, and some people certainly have reasonable concerns about some pain. But the vast impact on our economy is demonstrated by the fact that, you know, import prices have been flat for the last 12 months. Things like nonfuel import prices actually fell 20%. Tariffs are raising domestic production, and with no significant price increases. Even when you talk about steel, steel prices are back down to where they were before tariffs were put in place. And those tariffs I'm talking about are the 232s. SIMON: Well. . . DIMICCO: Yet, free traders in their fantasy world want to keep saying the tariffs are raising prices. The reality is they're not, and it's demonstrated by the performance of the economy. And for every one that you could bring to me that says, oh, we've been harmed, I can give you a hundred examples where they're not. You can take a look at GM. You take a look at Ford. All their money's being made in the United States, not in China. They both benefit by 25% tariffs that have been on trucks for decades, OK? And you bring up the point about soybeans. Well, the reality is the soybean issue has been going on with farmers for many, many years now - six, seven-plus years. The tariffs have been put in place, but one of the biggest factors affecting China's imports of soybeans is this swine flu that's in their farming because now they're reducing the amount of purchases because of that. So there's a lot of other things that go into this, Scott. SIMON: We're about to run out of time, Mr. DiMicco. But are you willing to say to Americans quite bluntly, look; some of you are going to lose out this way, but we think it's the great - for the greater good of America? DIMICCO: Exactly. Here's what I would - I'm going to say to all Americans. We are in an existential battle with China. They've been waging a trade war with us for 20-plus years. They've destroyed millions and millions of jobs. Tens of millions of people have been negatively impacted. Our social costs have gone through the roof. Also, we can get cheaper underwear. Enough's enough. China's the aggressor. It's time to stand up. Thank you, President Trump. SIMON: Thanks so much, Mr. DiMicco. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  The U. S. and China broke off trade talks with no agreement as President Trump raised tariffs from 10% to 25% on $200 billion worth of goods from China. He also directed his trade office to start the process of raising tariffs on essentially all remaining imports from China. China says it will impose necessary countermeasures. Dan DiMicco is a former trade adviser for Donald Trump in 2016 and is currently chairman for the Coalition for a Prosperous America. Mr. DiMicco, thanks so much for being with us. DAN DIMICCO: My pleasure, Scott. SIMON: President Trump tweeted, tariffs will make our country MUCH STRONGER - all caps - not weaker. Just sit back and watch. But economists usually don't like tariffs, do they? It raises prices, reduces purchases and production. How does this make the U. S. stronger? DIMICCO: Well, listen; our economists have been dead wrong for a long time about the fact that free trade would work for us. And they have - are dead wrong now again. For far too long, China has repeatedly threatened U. S. economic and national security interests. And, finally, we have a president who's serious about getting tough on China and fighting for fair, reciprocal trade. And Trump is taking a long overdue action here on this. He's standing up to China's unfair trade practices. He defended American intellectual property. The whole world knows that China cheats. This is not new news. It's been talked about in every major newspaper. Even the economists recognize that. But they've been dead wrong about the impact of tariffs, and we can talk some more about that. SIMON: Well, you know, we have interviewed people, as every news organization has, over the past few months about the effect of - people who say they're hurt by the tariffs. Soybean futures are at their lowest prices in a decade. We've interviewed farmers, manufacturers who use steel, people in the fishing industry in Maine. They've been hurt by tariffs that have gone up 10%. Now it'll be 25%. Won't Americans wind up paying more? DIMICCO: Well, here's the reality, OK? You talk to some people, and some people certainly have reasonable concerns about some pain. But the vast impact on our economy is demonstrated by the fact that, you know, import prices have been flat for the last 12 months. Things like nonfuel import prices actually fell 20%. Tariffs are raising domestic production, and with no significant price increases. Even when you talk about steel, steel prices are back down to where they were before tariffs were put in place. And those tariffs I'm talking about are the 232s. SIMON: Well. . . DIMICCO: Yet, free traders in their fantasy world want to keep saying the tariffs are raising prices. The reality is they're not, and it's demonstrated by the performance of the economy. And for every one that you could bring to me that says, oh, we've been harmed, I can give you a hundred examples where they're not. You can take a look at GM. You take a look at Ford. All their money's being made in the United States, not in China. They both benefit by 25% tariffs that have been on trucks for decades, OK? And you bring up the point about soybeans. Well, the reality is the soybean issue has been going on with farmers for many, many years now - six, seven-plus years. The tariffs have been put in place, but one of the biggest factors affecting China's imports of soybeans is this swine flu that's in their farming because now they're reducing the amount of purchases because of that. So there's a lot of other things that go into this, Scott. SIMON: We're about to run out of time, Mr. DiMicco. But are you willing to say to Americans quite bluntly, look; some of you are going to lose out this way, but we think it's the great - for the greater good of America? DIMICCO: Exactly.

He says Americans don't have to pay tariffs on Chinese goods if they buy the same products from other countries or, even better, from the U. S. He said today that goes for U. S. manufacturers, too. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Open your division, or open up your product. Have it made in this country as opposed to made in China. CORNISH: Many U. S. manufacturers do get their parts from China. To understand how easy it would be for them to make a swap, we turn to Kip Eideberg. He's with the Association of Equipment Manufacturers. Thanks for coming into the studio. KIP EIDEBERG: Thanks for having me, Audie. CORNISH: You represent a lot of firms. What are some of the ones that depend on China for the parts that go into their equipment? EIDEBERG: Well, look. We have about a thousand member companies in the United States. And many of them - if not most - rely on some sort of input from China. CORNISH: Can you give an example for those of us just, like, walking into a store and wondering what we might be purchasing? EIDEBERG: Yeah, absolutely. Let's take a consumer-friendly example so a power generator - small power generator's 5 to 9 horsepower - seems like as good of an example as any given the weather that we've been experiencing. So many of the engines - and certainly many of the components that go into those engines - are made in China or other countries. And the idea that a manufacturer could simply turn around and source those engines from an American supplier does not align with reality. CORNISH: Why? EIDEBERG: Well, lots of reasons. Sometimes they're not available; they're not made here. Sometimes they are not of the quality that's required. Sometimes they're too expensive. Sometimes domestic manufacturers can't simply meet the demand for the manufacturer. CORNISH: What would it take to make the switch? Or are you arguing that they don't want to, it's not financially appealing to them? EIDEBERG: Well, I think anytime politicians try to micromanage how businesses run their supply chains, it doesn't end well. But I will say that, you know, as an industry, we do agree with the precedent that it is time for China to make some changes to their industrial and to their trade policy. They haven't been a good faith factor over the years. But we should be focusing on negotiating with China, looking for structural changes, not doubling down on tariffs or forcing companies to change their supply chains. CORNISH: Now, the president says that these trade talks are meant to benefit the U. S. , including manufacturers. From your point of view, right, someone who helps represent these manufacturers, are they? EIDEBERG: Well, if we can get to an agreement at the end of the day, then absolutely. But in the short term, we're seeing some real pain for equipment manufacturers. In fact, we forecast that, with these additional tariffs and the ones that we've already facing on steel, aluminum and Chinese inputs, the industry stands to lose about 400,000 jobs over the next 10 years. Now, that's a 10-year timeframe, and we could wake up tomorrow and have an agreement with China. And certainly, we hope that would be the case. But I think that when you rely on tariffs, which are taxes on Americans and businesses, you know, it's a slippery slope. CORNISH: Why shouldn't you endure a little pain if it will get to your end goal? EIDEBERG: Well, that depends on how you look at, you know, the arc of trade negotiations. And again, I think we've been fairly patient. We've been supportive of the administration's efforts to address some of the issues with China. What we're saying is, you know, if we keep doubling down or tripling down on tariffs as a negotiating tactic, you know, in the long haul, that will have some consequences for our industry. And it will make us look at whether or not, you know, it's feasible to manufacture here or in other places. So I think it's a trade-off at the end of the day. It's not necessarily about short-term pain. But it's about, you know, where do you want to manufacture? Where is the most advantageous place to manufacture? And we hope that it continues to be here in America. CORNISH: That's Kip Eideberg. He's vice president of government affairs for the Association of Equipment Manufacturers.

Even companies that make products in the U. S. often get their parts from China. This week, President Trump suggested that to avoid tariffs, those companies should buy parts domestically or from a different country like Vietnam. To get a sense of what it takes to move a global supply chain, we're joined now by Mary Lovely, an economist with Syracuse University. Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. MARY LOVELY: Thank you, Ari. SHAPIRO: Have you already started to see manufacturers move their supply chains out of China as a reaction to these tariffs? LOVELY: Well, there certainly have been a lot of reports, and we've seen some. But on a scale that would move China's exports here very much - no, not yet. SHAPIRO: Why do you think that is? LOVELY: Well, the adjustment is going to be costly. You have to either find a new supplier or build a new factory. And so far, the tariffs have been conditional. You know, we might get a deal. The president might roll them back. So if firms believe the tariffs are temporary and there's a lot of uncertainty, then they won't go ahead and make that investment. SHAPIRO: Is it harder to move production of a high-end product like a smartphone than something like a pair of shoes? LOVELY: Definitely. It's not only just the production process itself. There's a whole host of other things. So for example, in shoes, say an American company may have a set of representatives who go out and find subcontractors. These subcontractors may change from season to season. Some subcontractors go out of business. Some of them don't provide the level of quality that was wanted. So there's a lot of fluidity in this process. And they can switch suppliers pretty quickly. When we look at something like an iPhone, you're seeing a process where at each point along the way, Apple has a role to play with very specific technology that's done in a very specific way to very high standards. And moving that kind of supply chain from the people you know and trust and have had relationships with for a long time is going to be costly and much more difficult. SHAPIRO: Do you think there could come a point when the trade war stretches on for so long or the tariffs get so high that companies decide they're just going to suck up the costs and relocate? LOVELY: Yes, and I think we're approaching that point. Businesses aren't seeing the trade conflict calm down. They're actually probably seeing it escalate. So this may be the time that firms actually say, hey, this is going to be around for quite a while, and maybe it's the time for us to start making the investments that we need. SHAPIRO: China is so large. If American manufacturers did decide to move their supply chains out of China, is there capacity in other countries to pick up all of this business? LOVELY: Short answer is really no, not in the short run. Longer-term, countries like India which have a large, untapped population that would like to be more deeply embedded into global value chains - they will be able to come online and gradually get the capacity to replicate what China had done. That's not just building factories. It's also developing the skills within the population, within the managers to get things like failure rates very low. You know, we kind of take for granted if we buy a television set that's made in Asia that it's going to work. This wasn't always the case. Products have gotten to be very good. And as we shift supply chains, you know, we'll see those types of costs going up where you get a piece of equipment, and it's what we might call a lemon, and you take it back to the store. That's going to raise the costs for the companies that are involved in that business. SHAPIRO: Mary Lovely is an economics professor at Syracuse University. Thanks for joining us.

S. and China today. It's a squabble that could have major consequences for the state of Nebraska. Nebraska had $1. 4 billion in exports to China in 2017 according to the US-China Business Council. That number was cut in half last year as China imposed steep tariffs on beef, pork and soybeans. With both countries announcing plans for new tariffs yesterday, there's no sign that a trade deal is imminent. And for more on what that means for Nebraska, I'm joined by the state's governor, Pete Ricketts. He's a Republican. Welcome to the program. PETE RICKETTS: Thank you very much for having me on. I appreciate it. CORNISH: A year into this trade war, what are the impacts you're seeing in Nebraska? RICKETTS: Well, we're seeing a variety of things. I mean, low commodity prices were one of the things we experienced beforehand. Some of your listeners may have seen about the flooding we had a couple of months ago. And then, of course, you know, we're looking to have markets open up for us. And China obviously is one of our bigger markets. It's our biggest market for ag. So we're following the trade talks with China very closely. CORNISH: It seems like the two sides were close to an agreement. Then the administration announced the most recent round of U. S. tariffs last week that led to retaliatory tariffs by China. Do you support the president on this move that's essentially escalated the trade conflict? RICKETTS: Yeah. The folks here in Nebraska want to see that we have a relationship with China and we start getting back to more normal trade relations so we can, you know, sell more products like soybeans. However, people also understand that we've got to have a fair trade deal and that if China is stealing our intellectual property, as the media has oftentimes reported on this, that that doesn't fall into that category of a fair trade deal. It's got to be something where both parties benefit. And so. . . CORNISH: So do you support what the president is doing? RICKETTS: Oh, I do, yeah, absolutely, for just that reason is that we've got to have a fair trade deal with China. And I think the president has rightly identified that China thinks about these things in decades, you know, with regard to relationships. And certainly President Xi has stated his goal to make China the world power by 2049. And so I think the president has understood that we've got to have a relationship with China where it's a mutually beneficial one and one where it's fair. And that's what he's trying to accomplish. Obviously, we'd like to see this thing get wrapped up as quickly as possible. But I do think these important issues around intellectual property have to be addressed. CORNISH: Are you essentially telling farmers in your state, look; there's going to be a fair amount of pain first, but it's going to be worth it in the long run? RICKETTS: Well, actually, they're the ones by and large telling me that. So they are the ones who are telling me that, hey, we support what the president is doing. We don't necessarily, you know, appreciate the pain we're going through right now. You know, they'd like to see this get opened. But they also understand that this is an important relationship that is fair and balanced on both sides. So that's what I hear when farmers tell me about it. CORNISH: I'm surprised to hear that because the state farm bureau said flooding this year caused hundreds of millions of dollars in agricultural losses. And now you have this tariff issue on top of that. I mean, there are farmers that are really struggling right now. RICKETTS: Oh, absolutely. And that's one of the things - reasons why we would like to see this relationship get to be more normalized. But we also got to remember low commodity prices are something that we've been struggling with here in farm country since 2013. You know, that's when farm income started going down. You know, the tariffs have not caused low commodity prices. That's something we experienced beforehand. CORNISH: So in the short term, the president has said he'll use revenue from U. S. tariffs on China to provide $15 billion in aid to American farmers who are feeling the impact. You know, just last year, you had folks like Senator Sasse saying that the trade war was cutting the legs out from under farmers and called, you know, the aid plan gold crutches. How much longer can farmers get this support from the federal government? RICKETTS: Well, I think everybody recognizes that an aid program like that is a temporary solution. That's not a permanent solution. It's really meant to be able to help tide farmers over as the president works on these trade deals. So I think that those things are helpful, but I think everybody recognizes that they're short term in nature. CORNISH: Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts, thank you for speaking with ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. RICKETTS: My pleasure. Thanks for having me on.

RICKETTS: Well, actually, they're the ones by and large telling me that. So they are the ones who are telling me that, hey, we support what the president is doing. We don't necessarily, you know, appreciate the pain we're going through right now. You know, they'd like to see this get opened. But they also understand that this is an important relationship that is fair and balanced on both sides. So that's what I hear when farmers tell me about it. CORNISH: I'm surprised to hear that because the state farm bureau said flooding this year caused hundreds of millions of dollars in agricultural losses. And now you have this tariff issue on top of that. I mean, there are farmers that are really struggling right now. RICKETTS: Oh, absolutely. And that's one of the things - reasons why we would like to see this relationship get to be more normalized. But we also got to remember low commodity prices are something that we've been struggling with here in farm country since 2013. You know, that's when farm income started going down. You know, the tariffs have not caused low commodity prices. That's something we experienced beforehand. CORNISH: So in the short term, the president has said he'll use revenue from U. S. tariffs on China to provide $15 billion in aid to American farmers who are feeling the impact. You know, just last year, you had folks like Senator Sasse saying that the trade war was cutting the legs out from under farmers and called, you know, the aid plan gold crutches. How much longer can farmers get this support from the federal government? RICKETTS: Well, I think everybody recognizes that an aid program like that is a temporary solution. That's not a permanent solution. It's really meant to be able to help tide farmers over as the president works on these trade deals. So I think that those things are helpful, but I think everybody recognizes that they're short term in nature. CORNISH: Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts, thank you for speaking with ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. RICKETTS: My pleasure.

The administration has offered similar waivers from its steel and aluminum tariffs. Some say it's put the Commerce Department in the awkward position of picking winners and losers. Republican Congresswoman Jackie Walorski calls the process a, quote, \"master class in government inefficiency. \" NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The Trump administration's gotten more than 80,000 requests for relief from its steel and aluminum tariffs imposed last year. And as of last week, well over half those requests were still awaiting a decision. The process has been maddeningly inconsistent for the companies seeking tariff waivers. PAUL EVERETT: It is a nightmare, like dealing with a lawyer and the IRS at the same time. HORSLEY: Paul Everett's vice president of purchasing at Omega Steel in St. Louis. The company sells heavy-walled steel pipe mostly to the oil and gas industry. Everett says there are only a handful of mills around the world that can produce that kind of pipe, so Omega has asked the Commerce Department for tariff waivers for numerous specialty products. EVERETT: We filed approximately 300 exclusions, and we've got, I think, 90 accepted. HORSLEY: Most of the company's applications for tariff relief are either still in limbo or were rejected usually because an American steel company said they could provide the same steel duty-free. SCOTT PAUL: The good news from the steel producers' perspective is that the tariffs so far are working. HORSLEY: Scott Paul represents American steelmakers and steel workers. He says since the tariffs were announced last year, steel imports dropped by a third as customers switched to domestic suppliers. PAUL: There have been about 12,000 jobs added in steel and aluminum since the tariffs were first announced, and you've seen more product lines come online. HORSLEY: American steelmakers are only supposed to object to a customer's application for tariff relief if the domestic producer can supply the steel within eight weeks. But in their objections, some U. S. steelmakers have been quoting delivery dates of 21 weeks. And Everett says others have promised products they can't deliver at all. EVERETT: Some of the mills just can't produce the sizes they say they can and have not ever produced those sizes. But unfortunately nobody's really checking the mills to make sure they're capable of producing the product. HORSLEY: Domestic steelmakers have successfully blocked thousands of tariff waivers with more than half the objections coming from just a handful of big steel producers. Trade economist Christine McDaniel of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University says U. S. Steel, Nucor and AK Steel have each raised objections to duty-free imports totaling more than the companies actually produce. CHRISTINE MCDANIEL: They have a very good batting average because when they object to something, it either gets denied, or it just goes into the pending pile. HORSLEY: Everett says since the government's granted only a few of Omega's requests for tariff waivers, the company's had no choice but to keep paying the 25% tariff. Some steel importers have to absorb that extra cost. But Omega largely passes the bill along to its oil and gas customers. EVERETT: Nobody wants to pay the additional 25%. The only people that have that kind of money are really in the oil and gas business, and it's a pass-through for them because you're paying for it at the pump. HORSLEY: That consumer tab is likely to increase as new and increased tariffs on Chinese imports take effect. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington.

Yesterday, they lifted those tariffs but only for Canada and Mexico. The administration also declared that imported cars and car parts are a threat to national security. So why would the White House consider your Subaru or maybe Volkswagen a national defense risk? NPR's Camila Domonoske reports. CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: The White House case against car parts boils down to this - competing with imports means U. S. companies sell fewer cars and parts. That means less money for research and development. And that means fewer innovations, which hurts the military. So reduce imports, boost American innovation and promote the national defense. National security experts say that logic is flawed. ASHLEY FENG: The perspective is this is something that will further harm national security as opposed to protecting it. DOMONOSKE: Ashley Feng is a researcher at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank. She points out that these imports come from U. S. allies, mostly Europe or Japan. And most people believe that competition leads to innovation. FENG: That is kind of just the basis of capitalism and our economy itself. DOMONOSKE: Ann Wilson is with the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association. She says the U. S. auto industry is, in fact, a leader in tech innovation. ANN WILSON: But if we don't have the free flow of goods, we're not going to see that investment in the U. S. DOMONOSKE: So imposing tariffs, like the White House is considering, would be counterproductive. In fact, the entire auto industry has united against the potential tariffs. Regardless, the president made this declaration anyway. He's relying on a 1962 law that gives him broad authority over tariffs in the name of national security. It's the same law he used to put tariffs on steel and aluminum. And courts have rarely challenged the president on questions of defense. Gary Hufbauer is an expert in international trade. He says that kind of power made sense during the Cold War. GARY HUFBAUER: At this time, you know, when we're talking about trade not with enemies but with allies, it's very odd. DOMONOSKE: This particular law was rarely used until this administration took office. And think back to your high school civics class. Under the Constitution, Congress, not the president, has the power to regulate international commerce. A few lawmakers are starting to object that setting tariffs like this should be up to them. HUFBAUER: But that's a nascent effort in the Congress. And right now he has the power. DOMONOSKE: So why use this power if car imports aren't really a national security threat? It's a negotiating tactic, leverage to try to get more favorable deals with European and Japanese trading partners. Instead of putting tariffs in place now, the president is setting a six-month deadline for trade talks. Industry leaders say the goals may be laudable, but the strategy is costly. All automakers rely on parts from around the world. So tariffs would raise costs for American companies. Hundreds of thousands of jobs could be lost, and car prices might go up by thousands of dollars. David Schwietert is the interim head of a group representing automakers. He says even before the tariffs are in place, just the threat of them is affecting investment. It's leaving companies in limbo. DAVID SCHWIETERT: This isn't just a hypothetical. It is causing significant angst. DOMONOSKE: And Schwietert warns that this could set a precedent. If a car part is a security threat, couldn't anything get that classification? That should be worrisome for all industries, he says. Camila Domonoske, NPR News.

The list of Chinese imports to the U. S. subject to increased tariffs runs 194 pages long. It includes things like frozen fish filets and bamboo furniture parts. The U. S. companies that depend on those items are evaluating what this means for their businesses, and that will determine how much consumers will pay. NPR's Yuki Noguchi has this report on how one business, a U. S. bike maker, is affected by tariffs in ways you might not expect. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: When Zakary Pashak I moved to Detroit in 2011, the city was reeling. But Pashak saw opportunity. ZAKARY PASHAK: What drew me to Detroit was the history, the music, the manufacturing. But, I mean, it was also the state that the city was in at that time. NOGUCHI: The financial crisis had slammed automakers. Thousands were laid off. Many of those workers abandoned their homes. Pashak envisioned an urban revival. Using those idle factories and workers, he wanted to build an American-made bicycle. That's how Detroit Bikes was born. As a domestic bike maker, Pashak is in a tiny minority. Nearly all bicycles sold in the U. S. , 94%, come from China. At times, he endured ridicule at trade shows. PASHAK: I'd get, you know, kind of surly bike mechanics coming up and telling me that my product stunk or, you know, whatever. There's definitely a fair bit of attitude in my industry. NOGUCHI: But last September, the industry's tune abruptly changed. The first round of tariffs upped the cost of imported Chinese bikes by 10%. PASHAK: All of a sudden, I felt like, you know, the belle of the ball or something. NOGUCHI: Companies saw this rare U. S. bike maker as a potential partner. This month, the Trump administration upped tariffs - basically import taxes - by an additional 15%. Now several companies seeking to avoid those fees are considering hiring Detroit Bikes to manufacture bikes for their brands. PASHAK: If these tariffs are still in place next year at this time, I would anticipate that would probably be quite good for my business. NOGUCHI: But the tariffs aren't all good for Detroit Bikes. In fact, Pashak says the effects are so convoluted he's not sure yet whether they will ultimately help or hurt. For one thing, Detroit Bikes relies on imported parts, the lion's share of which come from China. PASHAK: Like, the rims, spokes, the tires, the tubes. . . NOGUCHI: Tariffs on those also increased 25%, driving up Detroit Bikes' expenses. To counteract that, Pashak is painstakingly evaluating each part to see whether cheaper alternatives are available elsewhere. PASHAK: We'd want to be buying from Taiwan. Cambodia's sort of a new game, but it's sort of the new, you know, hot country, I guess, that everyone's trying to rush into. NOGUCHI: Businesses like Detroit Bikes react to tariffs in many ways. Finding alternate sources of goods is a significant one. If Pashak succeeds in finding cheaper substitute parts, he keeps costs down on his $500 bikes. That then blunts the overall price increase for his customers. Economists like Amit Khandelwal call this substitution. AMIT KHANDELWAL: The impacts of these wars depend heavily on the substitution effect. NOGUCHI: Khandelwal teaches international business at Columbia University. He says some substitutes are relatively easy to find. When China slapped retaliatory tariffs on American soybeans and corn, for example, buyers quickly turned to suppliers in South America. But finding replacements for things like bike chains or software chips is considerably harder. You can't just gin up a factory. KHANDELWAL: Generally, the more specialized product often take longer to substitute. NOGUCHI: And timing is a key factor here. It's unclear whether the tariffs will remain for a week, a month or years. Businesses I talked to, from farmers to retailers, are reluctant to make big changes when they can't plan for the long haul. Zakary Pashak says he's already mapped out some ingenious - if complicated - workarounds if the tariffs stay put. It might involve a web of countries. PASHAK: I can bring in Chinese parts to Canada at no tariff code, bring in a Cambodian frame to Canada, or ship my American frames up to Canada, put the parts on them, and then import them into the country. NOGUCHI: Doing so would relieve his tariff burden but would take months. In the meantime, he says tariffs might go away next week. So the easiest solution for many companies in the short run is to raise prices. Many of Detroit Bikes' rivals who rely on imported Chinese bikes say they'll have no choice. But Pashak says he's not sure if his company will follow suit. PASHAK: It might be better for me strategically just to let all my competitors raise their prices because they have to. NOGUCHI: He says he'll continue exploring options to make the tariffs work to his advantage. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Back to the ongoing trade conflict with China.

S. job market sounds amazing right now, with unemployment around 3. 6%. But what's it feel like to be in that market? All this week, we're asking what this economy means for people looking for a job, or looking for a better job or looking for a raise. Wages are rising, and some people who'd given up seeking work at all are coming back, yet some old economic divides have persisted. NPR's Scott Horsley spoke with David Greene. DAVID GREENE, BYLINE: So how tight is this tight labor market right now? SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: It is tight across the country, but it's really tight in some places. One of my NPR colleagues, Jim Zarroli, is going to take us to Ames, Iowa, which has the nation's lowest unemployment rate. It's just 1. 5%. And that means people like restaurant manager Elizabeth Kopecky really struggle to find and keep good help. ELIZABETH KOPECKY: We, last year, had a call from a restaurant down the street asking if we had any extra staff that they could share. That's how bad it's getting. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: What did you tell them? KOPECKY: That we didn't have enough for ourselves. HORSLEY: Even though wages have been going up in Ames, they still have trouble attracting workers. There just aren't a lot of people moving to Iowa, despite the healthy job market. We did find, though, people are moving to opportunities in other parts of the country. GREENE: Like where? Where are there opportunities right now? HORSLEY: People are moving to places like Atlanta, Tallahassee, and Charlotte, N. C. We've seen an influx of workers from up north looking for better jobs and also for more affordable housing. In particular, a lot of African Americans are making this move, sort of the reversal of the Great Migration we saw in the last century. NPR's Daniella Cheslow spent some time talking with African-American workers in North Carolina, both newcomers and some longtime residents, like Nicole Muse-Dennis (ph). She's a single mother of two who says she's working 65 hours a week and just barely getting by. NICOLE MUSE-DENNIS: I'm what I call over-employed. I have two jobs, and I'm still trying to make it. HORSLEY: Unemployment among African Americans, David, is 6. 7 percent. That is low by historical standards, but it's still nearly double the national average. GREENE: Well, Scott, we've been talking about full employment for a while. And yet, every month, employers are finding more people to hire. So what exactly is happening? Give me the broad look here? HORSLEY: One thing that's happened is that people who had been out of the job market altogether, either by choice or otherwise, are being lured back in. We have a number of stories in our series about, for example, women coming back into the job market. Sometimes full-time, sometimes in the gig economy. And other groups that were sort of on the margins - for example, people with disabilities or a prison record, those might have been disqualifying in the past, but desperate employers, like Christopher Dickerson (ph), say, not anymore. CHRISTOPHER DICKERSON: I don't care what your background is. I don't care where you came from. I don't care what color you are. I don't care - as long as you come to work every single day and give me everything that you can give me. HORSLEY: Over the last couple of years, David, about 7 in 10 new people finding jobs have been coming off the sidelines rather than from the ranks of the unemployed. GREENE: Well, what does all of this mean for people's paychecks? I mean, for a while, we kept talking about, even though the economy seemed to be doing better and better, wages weren't really keeping pace with inflation. HORSLEY: Yeah. For a lot of this very long economic expansion, wages did not go up very much. But they are finally picking up. And that's especially true for people on the lower rungs of the income ladder, which is encouraging. There is no question workers have more bargaining power now. And one of the things we looked at in the series is collective bargaining. During the recession, some unions grudgingly agreed to accept lower wages for newer workers, and that created some friction on the factory floor when people were doing the same job for less money. We're finally starting to see some of that turn around. I spoke with Courtney Herring (ph), who works at the Kohler company in Wisconsin. They recently inked a new contract that phases out that two-tiered wage scale. COURTNEY HERRING: You could tell there was a lot of happy people, a lot of 'em. Production went up. People are wanting to stay for more overtime because they know it's worth their time now. So they're actually able to go out and do more things, or save up for something. GREENE: All right. One of the voices in our full employment series, which is taking place all this week on the radio. You can also find it at npr. org. And you'll hear more on this program tomorrow.

Lots of employers say they're struggling to find qualified workers. This week, NPR is taking a closer look at the tight labor market. Business groups say one solution is to let more people into the country from other places. But in states like Iowa, that view is at odds with tough new policies meant to combat illegal immigration. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: At Jean C. Wiley & Sons' construction company, two workers are making cabinets for a new house. When company president Ted Wiley hires people, he trains them in woodworking and carpentry. Even so, he has trouble finding good people. TED WILEY: It is so hard to get people in the door just to sit down and interview. It's - you just - you're afraid you're going to scare them off - any little thing that you do. They won't show up for the first day of work. ZARROLI: The place where Wiley lives, Mount Pleasant, is a working-class town tucked amid the Iowa farm fields. It has a little college and a quaint tree-lined square rimmed with shops and restaurants. It's also small - only about 8,000 people. Not a lot of outsiders move here, and the job market is as tight as it's been in anyone's memory. There are 300 open jobs. Like a lot of business owners, Wiley says there's a solution. This part of Iowa needs to attract more immigrants. Wiley says he knows there are people who shouldn't be in the country - undocumented people, even criminals. WILEY: But I can also tell you that there are - I know that there are a lot that come in that are just here for a better life for their family - no different than any of the rest of us. As far as I'm concerned, we've got room for them. ZARROLI: But immigration is a controversial issue in Mount Pleasant these days because of something that happened last year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: After a massive immigration raid rocked the Mount Pleasant community. ZARROLI: One day last May, immigration agents swept into the Midwest Precast Concrete company on the edge of town. I spoke to one plant worker who says around lunchtime, he went out to buy food. UNIDENTIFIED WORKER: (Through interpreter) I'd just gotten back from the store. I was in the car eating when all of a sudden, they arrived - the helicopter, the patrol car, the Mount Pleasant sheriff. They took me out of the car and put handcuffs on me and on everyone else, too. They even had a dog. ZARROLI: The worker didn't want his last name used because his case is still being heard by a judge. He is from Mexico. And though his wife is American, he hadn't yet completed the lengthy process of getting citizenship, so he got his job by buying someone's Social Security number. He earned $13 an hour. When immigration officials learned he was working illegally, he was put in a van and taken to a detention center, along with 31 other men. UNIDENTIFIED WORKER: (Through interpreter) A lot of things were going through my mind, such as losing everything - my family, my job, years of sacrifice and work. It was very hard, and we haven't gotten over it. ZARROLI: In Mount Pleasant, the raid would ignite a debate about who should be allowed into the community. Rallies were held to support the man. A food pantry was set up for their families at the First Presbyterian Church. But Reverend Trey Hegar says some people hardened their hearts to the workers. TREY HEGAR: There were people who said, well, that's what you get if you're here illegally or undocumented. There was little compassion or understanding for that. ZARROLI: Some of these people faulted the undocumented workers. Others blamed the company for hiring them. The county where Mount Pleasant sits voted heavily for Donald Trump, and many share Trump's deep skepticism about immigration. Chelsea Sammons, a part-time convenience store clerk, believes companies hire immigrants because they don't want to pay fair wages. CHELSEA SAMMONS: It's just because they can pay them less money to work the same amount of hours or more. But, I mean, that's how businesses work. ZARROLI: The debate in Mount Pleasant mirrors a debate in Iowa as a whole. Seven cities have unemployment rates below 3%. In February, business leaders formed a group aimed at encouraging more immigration. They say outsiders will be good for the state. They make the economy more vibrant. But the Iowa Legislature has passed several bills cracking down on illegal immigration. Among the sponsors is Republican State Senator Julian Garrett. JULIAN GARRETT: If you're an honest employer, if you obey the law, and your competitor down the street is violating the law, hiring people who are here illegally - which is a federal crime, of course - that's not fair to you to have to compete with somebody that can lower their costs that way. ZARROLI: Garrett acknowledges there's a worker shortage, but he says with training and better pay, more native Iowans can be lured back into the workforce. But many business leaders worry that efforts such as these will discourage legal immigrants from coming to Iowa. Kristi Ray of the Mount Pleasant Chamber Alliance says, last year's raid underscores how broken the immigration system is. KRISTI RAY: That's where I say, who's to blame? The guy that bought the illegal Social Security number - they wanted to go to work. They wanted to take share their family. The company needs workers. That's why immigration is such a hard issue. ZARROLI: Meanwhile, most of the workers seized in last year's Mount Pleasant raid are free on bond. They're waiting for deportation hearings. There's a backlog of cases, and it will be a year or two before the worker we spoke to earlier sees a judge. His wife says, if he gets deported. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: And we'll go to Mexico. We never lived there. I have lived in Iowa all my life. My kids are born here in Iowa. But so my kids aren't separated from their dad, we will do what we have to do to be with him. ZARROLI: She has a job at a cookie factory, but without her husband's pay, the family is struggling financially. They get by on handouts from churches and a pro-immigration group called Iowa WINS. He says he hates being a burden, but he can't work legally. So he spends much of his time these days sitting at home, waiting, even though plenty of jobs in town are begging for applicants.

It's one of the ripple effects of the tight job market, which we are exploring all this week. NPR's Scott Horsley has this story. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: For almost 150 years, the Kohler Co. has been a fixture along the Sheboygan River in Wisconsin. Best known for its bathtubs and faucets, Kohler also makes decorative tile and industrial engines - solid products and solid jobs. For decades, Courtney Hering's family has been part of the Kohler story. COURTNEY HERING: My mother, she's been here 39 years. Two of my uncles - one works in the foundry. My dad worked here for 14 years. And my grandfather on my dad's side, he worked here as well. HORSLEY: I met up with Hering at the local union hall in Sheboygan. She moved back to this Midwestern manufacturing hub after a stint in the Marine Corps in North Carolina. She got a job in Kohler's distribution center, moving finished faucets and unfinished brass. Her starting pay was about $11. 50 an hour. It was only after she'd been working at Kohler for a couple of years that Hering came to a startling realization - many of her colleagues doing exactly the same work were paid nearly twice as much as she was. HERING: It really did open my eyes to see what was really happening and how much of an opportunity I was actually missing, compared to what I thought I was getting. It made me realize, oh, man, this is a huge gap. HORSLEY: That gap was a kind of hangover from the Great Recession. Back in 2010, Kohler adopted a two-tiered wage scale, and workers like Hering, who were hired after that, were stuck for years on a much lower track for both pay and benefits. A lot of companies made similar moves during the recession, most notably the big three automakers. Workers didn't have much power to resist when the economy was in free fall. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Seven-hundred seventy-seven points lower on the Dow. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: There's massive layoffs and the shuttering of facilities. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: There were steep declines in manufacturing, retail, even government. HORSLEY: George Cooper, who now drives a truck for Kohler, remembers that period as a desperate time. GEORGE COOPER: They were shutting down plants like the buildings was on fire, you know. And then the housing market took a tank. There's a lot of people that just went without jobs, and trust me, I was one of them. HORSLEY: Still, Cooper says it was frustrating when he got a job with Kohler two years ago, long after the recession was over, and found that two-tiered contract had locked in lower wages. Cooper realized his pay and benefits were no match for those of other drivers doing the same work. COOPER: Didn't matter how long I was there; I was never going to reach that same peak plateau that they did. HORSLEY: Courtney Hering saw similar friction in the distribution center, where newer, lower-paid workers grumbled at being asked to do the same level of work for less. HERING: Then you end up having your cliques because, oh, they're Tier A, and we're Tier B, and we shouldn't do the same type of work. They would just tell you, flat-out, well, why should I do the same amount of work as that Tier A that's been there 20 years? HORSLEY: That kind of division not only hurts morale, it can also splinter union solidarity. But in Kohler's case, the two-tiered wage scale became a rallying cry, as veteran workers joined the fight to boost pay for their newer colleagues. Tim Tayloe, who led that battle, started working for Kohler in the mid-1980s, forging molten metal into solid fixtures and a solid middle-class lifestyle. TIM TAYLOE: I started in the foundry, pouring iron in the foundry. And at that time, it was hard to get in at Kohler. It was the place to work - good benefits, good money, good everything. HORSLEY: Five years ago, Tayloe was elected president of the local union, and he was determined to restore that good pay and benefits for new Kohler workers. In the lobby of the union hall, Tayloe built a kind of shrine to past labor battles, complete with a picket sign from the middle of the last century, when American unions were at the peak of their bargaining power. TAYLOE: This was out of somebody's garage - the UAW on strike. That was 1954. We just don't want it to be forgotten, you know. They fought for our future. HORSLEY: Kohler workers mounted their own strike in 2015, and it lasted more than a month. When it was over, they had narrowed the gap in the two-tiered wage scale, but they hadn't closed it entirely. Then last year, Kohler was back at the bargaining table, even though its contract still had a year to run. By this time, the economy was humming, and Kohler was having trouble filling jobs. In December, the company agreed to a new five-year contract that effectively phases out the two-tiered wage scale by 2023 and gives new workers better benefits, as well. Tayloe says you can see the turnaround in the Kohler parking lot and a new attitude at union meetings. TAYLOE: Second shift meetings are usually the younger ones, and you see them talking now, and, hey, I'm buying a car. Hey, I got a little extra money; I'm going to go invest this a little for the future. HORSLEY: So what's changed in the nine years since Kohler first imposed the two-tiered wage scale? In a word, leverage. Unemployment in Sheboygan has tumbled to around 2. 5%, and some Kohler employees were defecting to nearby companies, like Sargento cheese and Johnsonville brats. Tayloe says that put workers in a much stronger bargaining position. TAYLOE: That's what it's about. It's negotiated; nobody hands it to you. You've got to negotiate for these wages and benefits. HORSLEY: Kohler declined to comment for this story, but when the new contract was signed, CEO David Kohler said in a statement, we are proud to be an employer of choice in Sheboygan County. Other companies are also phasing out two-tiered wages, including the big three automakers. A Ford executive called the unequal pay a distraction on the factory floor. But other companies are still moving in the opposite direction. For example, UPS just adopted a contract that puts new drivers on a lower pay scale. And this winter, the new owner of a locomotive plant in Pennsylvania tried to cut pay for new workers by almost 40%; that's now in mediation. For now, more than 2,000 Kohler workers in Wisconsin are celebrating their new contract. Courtney Hering, who's getting married next year, is planning a slightly more lavish wedding reception, and she says the mood's improved on the factory floor. HERING: You could tell there was a lot of happy people, a lot of them. Production went up. People are wanting to stay for more overtime because they know that it's worth their time now, so they're actually able to go out and do more things or save up for something. HORSLEY: Hering's thinking about buying a house someday. And after seven years at Kohler, she finally feels like she's found a professional home. HERING: I was told, don't go in a factory. Don't go in a factory. You're not going to have a life there. It feels like I do, and I'm getting somewhere. So I could see myself being here for my career. My family's been in it for at least 40-plus years, so I'd like to kind of continue that tradition. HORSLEY: Long after the recovery began, a tight labor market has finally given workers the leverage they need to demand a larger slice of the nation's growing economic pie. Scott Horsley, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF DEATH CAB FOR CUTIE'S \"TITLE TRACK\") NOEL KING, HOST:  It's been a long time coming, but paychecks are finally getting bigger. It's one of the ripple effects of the tight job market, which we are exploring all this week. NPR's Scott Horsley has this story. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: For almost 150 years, the Kohler Co. has been a fixture along the Sheboygan River in Wisconsin. Best known for its bathtubs and faucets, Kohler also makes decorative tile and industrial engines - solid products and solid jobs. For decades, Courtney Hering's family has been part of the Kohler story. COURTNEY HERING: My mother, she's been here 39 years. Two of my uncles - one works in the foundry. My dad worked here for 14 years. And my grandfather on my dad's side, he worked here as well. HORSLEY: I met up with Hering at the local union hall in Sheboygan. She moved back to this Midwestern manufacturing hub after a stint in the Marine Corps in North Carolina. She got a job in Kohler's distribution center, moving finished faucets and unfinished brass. Her starting pay was about $11. 50 an hour. It was only after she'd been working at Kohler for a couple of years that Hering came to a startling realization - many of her colleagues doing exactly the same work were paid nearly twice as much as she was. HERING: It really did open my eyes to see what was really happening and how much of an opportunity I was actually missing, compared to what I thought I was getting. It made me realize, oh, man, this is a huge gap. HORSLEY: That gap was a kind of hangover from the Great Recession. Back in 2010, Kohler adopted a two-tiered wage scale, and workers like Hering, who were hired after that, were stuck for years on a much lower track for both pay and benefits. A lot of companies made similar moves during the recession, most notably the big three automakers. Workers didn't have much power to resist when the economy was in free fall. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Seven-hundred seventy-seven points lower on the Dow. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: There's massive layoffs and the shuttering of facilities. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: There were steep declines in manufacturing, retail, even government. HORSLEY: George Cooper, who now drives a truck for Kohler, remembers that period as a desperate time. GEORGE COOPER: They were shutting down plants like the buildings was on fire, you know. And then the housing market took a tank. There's a lot of people that just went without jobs, and trust me, I was one of them. HORSLEY: Still, Cooper says it was frustrating when he got a job with Kohler two years ago, long after the recession was over, and found that two-tiered contract had locked in lower wages. Cooper realized his pay and benefits were no match for those of other drivers doing the same work. COOPER: Didn't matter how long I was there; I was never going to reach that same peak plateau that they did. HORSLEY: Courtney Hering saw similar friction in the distribution center, where newer, lower-paid workers grumbled at being asked to do the same level of work for less. HERING: Then you end up having your cliques because, oh, they're Tier A, and we're Tier B, and we shouldn't do the same type of work. They would just tell you, flat-out, well, why should I do the same amount of work as that Tier A that's been there 20 years? HORSLEY: That kind of division not only hurts morale, it can also splinter union solidarity. But in Kohler's case, the two-tiered wage scale became a rallying cry, as veteran workers joined the fight to boost pay for their newer colleagues. Tim Tayloe, who led that battle, started working for Kohler in the mid-1980s, forging molten metal into solid fixtures and a solid middle-class lifestyle. TIM TAYLOE: I started in the foundry, pouring iron in the foundry. And at that time, it was hard to get in at Kohler. It was the place to work - good benefits, good money, good everything. HORSLEY: Five years ago, Tayloe was elected president of the local union, and he was determined to restore that good pay and benefits for new Kohler workers. In the lobby of the union hall, Tayloe built a kind of shrine to past labor battles, complete with a picket sign from the middle of the last century, when American unions were at the peak of their bargaining power. TAYLOE: This was out of somebody's garage - the UAW on strike. That was 1954. We just don't want it to be forgotten, you know. They fought for our future. HORSLEY: Kohler workers mounted their own strike in 2015, and it lasted more than a month. When it was over, they had narrowed the gap in the two-tiered wage scale, but they hadn't closed it entirely. Then last year, Kohler was back at the bargaining table, even though its contract still had a year to run. By this time, the economy was humming, and Kohler was having trouble filling jobs. In December, the company agreed to a new five-year contract that effectively phases out the two-tiered wage scale by 2023 and gives new workers better benefits, as well. Tayloe says you can see the turnaround in the Kohler parking lot and a new attitude at union meetings. TAYLOE: Second shift meetings are usually the younger ones, and you see them talking now, and, hey, I'm buying a car.

S. is at a near 50-year low. People who couldn't find work in the past are suddenly in demand, and that includes people with disabilities. For a generation, the number of people on the federal government's disability insurance program grew steadily, but now for the first time in decades, that number is shrinking. NPR's Scott Horsley reports as part of our series on the ripple effects of a tight labor market. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Dani Izzie works as a digital and social media marketer for a company called Spinergy. DANI IZZIE: The main thing they do are wheels - high performance wheelchair wheels. HORSLEY: I say is not just a salesperson for the company. She's also a customer. A decade ago, Izzie slipped in the shower and suffered a spinal cord injury that left her unable to walk. For five years, she collected disability insurance from Social Security, but she was determined to go back to work. When Spinergy hired her, she says, they did have to make some changes in their Carlsbad, Calif. , offices. IZZIE: The bathroom door was extremely heavy, so I wasn't able to, you know, enter and exit the bathroom. It was a very easy fix for them. I don't think it cost a lot of money. HORSLEY: In today's tight labor market, more employers are willing to make that kind of adjustment, allowing more people with disabilities to go back to work or stay on the job. Spinergy also welcomed Izzie's service dog, a yellow lab named Zandra. She's able to retrieve things when Izzie drops them. She's also a great social icebreaker with people who might otherwise be awkward talking with someone in a wheelchair. IZZIE: I've noticed that people are more interested in the dog, you know? Oh, what's your dog's name? I love labs. I have a lab at home. So she helps a lot in that way. HORSLEY: These days, Izzie works remotely from a house in rural Virginia where she lives with Zandra, her husband, Rudy, and another, more talkative dog named Blue. It's still unusual for people to leave the disability program and return to work. Less than 1% of recipients do so each year. But the numbers have been growing as the job market's improved. At the same time, aging baby boomers are moving from disability into retirement, and the government has made it harder for new people to qualify for disability. ABBEY HERRIN CLARKSON: People typically approved in 2010 may not necessarily be approved now. HORSLEY: Abbey Herrin Clarkson is a lawyer who helps people apply for disability in Alabama. When jobs evaporated during the Great Recession, many people turn to disability as a kind of de facto unemployment insurance. By 2013, there were parts of Alabama where nearly 1 out of 4 workers was collecting a disability check. But since then, the state's disability rolls have shrunk by about 15 percent. It typically takes more than a year to qualify for disability, and Clarkson says these days, more of her clients are finding work during that period as employers have grown more willing to make allowances. CLARKSON: You know, like, someone, like, into their 50s, someone who's - maybe has a medical history with some surgeries. Maybe they need some sort of accommodation. More employers now because there is a demand for labor are more willing to kind of accommodate to that sort of thing. HORSLEY: Of course many people on disability are simply unable to work, Clarkson says, but not everyone. CLARKSON: Ninety-eight to 99% of all the people I run into would much rather work than collect a disability check, and that's just the truth. HORSLEY: Clarkson says many people who become disabled suffer from anxiety and depression when they can no longer work. Angel Salva felt that way six years ago when a bad back drove him out of the Air Force after a dozen years in the service. He and his wife had just had their first son. ANGEL SALVA: It was scary. You know, now I'm not able to provide for my family. I had a ton of challenges. HORSLEY: Salva still suffers from chronic pain, but a couple of years ago, he found a job doing IT work for a defense contractor. He still has trouble sitting for long periods, but his boss got some ergonomic furniture, and he allows Salva to work flexible hours. SALVA: I'm no longer sitting home thinking about what's going to happen tomorrow. I take it one day at a time. HORSLEY: Giving up the guaranteed income and health benefits that come with disability is a huge decision. Salva took advantage of a program designed to make that leap back in the job market a little less risky. It allowed him to keep his disability benefits for a trial period when he first returned to work. Making the move was still a bit of a gamble, Salva says, but he's glad he did it. SALVA: It was always a dream to serve my country. I joined the Air Force at 18 years old, and I was intending to have a 20-year career. But that was cut short and not on my terms, but I've discovered that it can be done. There is a market for every skill set out there. HORSLEY: The Trump administration wants to encourage more people with disabilities to work both to meet the demands of a growing economy and to save the government money. One of the president's economic advisers, former Cornell professor Richard Burkhauser, has long had a personal interest in the disability program. RICHARD BURKHAUSER: My dad was a steelworker. And when the plant closed down, he was out of work and in his late 50s. HORSLEY: Burkhauser encouraged his dad to apply for disability rather than looking for another job. But he later came to second-guess that advice. He thinks being out of work may have contributed to his father's death just a few years later. BURKHAUSER: And I think in part because his whole life was work. And, you know, I think it affected him. So I've always felt as a last resort, I think it's fine to be on these rolls. But if we can get people with disabilities to - into the workforce, it will be much better. HORSLEY: Burkhauser believes a hot economy has done more to move people off disability than any policy changes dreamed up here in Washington. Wheelchair marketer Dani Izzie agrees a tight job market is opening doors for people with disabilities, but she warns many still face discrimination. She says if employers can look past that, they'll be rewarded with workers who are adaptable, flexible and persistent. IZZIE: The can-do attitude, the creativity involved in living a life with a disability. Honestly, that attitude is an asset to an employer. HORSLEY: As the number of disabled workers grows, more employers are finding that out. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington.

But that might be changing thanks to a tight job market. With more employers looking for workers, that means more opportunities for former felons. NPR's Jasmine Garsd reports. JASMINE GARSD, BYLINE: A few years ago, when Robby Grant was looking for work, he got used to doors being shut in his face. ROBBY GRANT: Your resume is very impressive, but because of you being a felon, we're going to choose to go in a different direction. GARSD: Grant had been a salesperson in Michigan for years. He developed a drug addiction and started stealing. It ended up on his criminal record. This was during the recession. In Michigan, unemployment had peaked at just under 15%. Grant could not find a job. GRANT: You kind of get to a place where you feel like maybe you don't deserve. You're not going to ever get a second chance. You're never going to get a break to redeem yourself. GARSD: He spiraled into depression and further into drug use. He broke into someone's house, which is how he ended up here at the Richard Handlon Correctional Facility in Michigan. He's been serving almost three years. When he gets out in just a few months, he'll be facing a very different job market. Nationwide, unemployment is extremely low. In Michigan, it's at 4. 1%. Prison officials say companies are more open to hiring people convicted of felonies. And they're actually reaching out to people like Robby in prison about potential jobs in construction, furniture making and truck driving. HEIDI WASHINGTON: I mean, I've been here 21 years. I never thought I would have seen this. GARSD: Heidi Washington is the director of the Michigan Department of Corrections, which boasts a training program called Vocational Village. It trains about 400 prisoners at a time. Towards the end of their sentence, they get certified in trades like carpentry and machine operating. This is where Grant studies carpentry. It looks more like a high school woodshop than a prison. By the time he gets out, it's pretty likely he'll get a job. Washington says just in the last few months. . . WASHINGTON: About 95% of everybody who left Vocational Village had a job before they left. GARSD: That's no small feat. Difficulty finding employment is one reason why, if you've been locked up, there is about a 40% chance you'll be going back in the next few years. REBECCA VALLAS: We're creating a permanent underclass of workers who don't have the same opportunities as others. GARSD: Rebecca Vallas is with the left-leaning Center for American Progress. She says this especially affects communities of color - 33% of black men have felony convictions. The Center for American Progress is currently promoting the Clean Slate policy to automatically erase people's records after a certain amount of years. Reintegrating people coming out of prison is an issue that has created unlikely allies across the political spectrum. Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump have made it one of their main causes. Libertarians Charles and David Koch have championed it. Mark Holden, senior vice president of Stand Together, an anti-poverty group funded by the Koch brothers, says now is the perfect time to change things. MARK HOLDEN: Now that there is such a need for skilled labor in particular, that stigma is wearing off. And it gets back to the whole idea that when employers see the need for more labor and they see that out there there's people coming out of prison who have those skills, they're going to be willing to take a chance. GARSD: But just how big is the need for someone fresh out of prison? On a cloudy spring morning, I drive to a job fair for carpenters in Detroit. It's packed. CHRISTOPHER DICKERSON: I don't care what your background is. I don't care where you came from. I don't care what color you are. I don't care as long as you come to work every single day and give me everything that you can give me. GARSD: Christopher Dickerson is a senior manager at a construction company called Manic. And he is a little frenzied when he talks about how badly he needs workers. DICKERSON: The projects just keep coming in. I mean, we have to pass some things up because, well, we just don't have the manpower to do most of the stuff. GARSD: While he works on recruiting, I speak to one of his new employees, Ichard Oden. ICHARD ODEN: I always wanted to be a carpenter ever since I was little because when I was younger, I used to build basketball rims, clubhouses. GARSD: But things took a very bad turn in 1999. Oden was barely out of his teenage years when he was convicted of kidnapping and second-degree murder. ODEN: I was in my 12th grade year when I got locked up. GARSD: Oden spent two decades behind bars. As his release date approached, he faced the conundrum of so many inmates - a grown man with no skill set heading back into a city in dire need of workers. He was given a career test. It found he had a high aptitude for. . . ODEN: Being a cop, but we know that was out the window (laughter). GARSD: He also tested well for carpentry, which is what he studied at the Vocational Village. An entry-level carpenter can make around 16 bucks an hour. When Oden got out of prison in February, the next day he contacted the carpenters union. And about a week later, they sent him to the construction site. ODEN: Of course, I was nervous (laughter) because it's the first time in 20 years, like, I'm in society. GARSD: But Oden says he kept thinking about this thing, which was often on his mind while he was in prison. ODEN: I never pictured myself in prison all the time. I always pictured myself out of prison. So prison wasn't in me, but being free was, so I always thought about that. So when I went to the job site and he asked me - he like, what can you do? GARSD: Whatever you want me to do, Oden responded. He got hired that day. Jasmine Garsd, NPR News, Detroit, Mich.

He broke into someone's house, which is how he ended up here at the Richard Handlon Correctional Facility in Michigan. He's been serving almost three years. When he gets out in just a few months, he'll be facing a very different job market. Nationwide, unemployment is extremely low. In Michigan, it's at 4. 1%. Prison officials say companies are more open to hiring people convicted of felonies. And they're actually reaching out to people like Robby in prison about potential jobs in construction, furniture making and truck driving. HEIDI WASHINGTON: I mean, I've been here 21 years. I never thought I would have seen this. GARSD: Heidi Washington is the director of the Michigan Department of Corrections, which boasts a training program called Vocational Village. It trains about 400 prisoners at a time. Towards the end of their sentence, they get certified in trades like carpentry and machine operating. This is where Grant studies carpentry. It looks more like a high school woodshop than a prison. By the time he gets out, it's pretty likely he'll get a job. Washington says just in the last few months. . . WASHINGTON: About 95% of everybody who left Vocational Village had a job before they left. GARSD: That's no small feat. Difficulty finding employment is one reason why, if you've been locked up, there is about a 40% chance you'll be going back in the next few years. REBECCA VALLAS: We're creating a permanent underclass of workers who don't have the same opportunities as others. GARSD: Rebecca Vallas is with the left-leaning Center for American Progress. She says this especially affects communities of color - 33% of black men have felony convictions. The Center for American Progress is currently promoting the Clean Slate policy to automatically erase people's records after a certain amount of years. Reintegrating people coming out of prison is an issue that has created unlikely allies across the political spectrum. Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump have made it one of their main causes. Libertarians Charles and David Koch have championed it. Mark Holden, senior vice president of Stand Together, an anti-poverty group funded by the Koch brothers, says now is the perfect time to change things. MARK HOLDEN: Now that there is such a need for skilled labor in particular, that stigma is wearing off. And it gets back to the whole idea that when employers see the need for more labor and they see that out there there's people coming out of prison who have those skills, they're going to be willing to take a chance. GARSD: But just how big is the need for someone fresh out of prison? On a cloudy spring morning, I drive to a job fair for carpenters in Detroit. It's packed. CHRISTOPHER DICKERSON: I don't care what your background is. I don't care where you came from. I don't care what color you are. I don't care as long as you come to work every single day and give me everything that you can give me. GARSD: Christopher Dickerson is a senior manager at a construction company called Manic. And he is a little frenzied when he talks about how badly he needs workers. DICKERSON: The projects just keep coming in. I mean, we have to pass some things up because, well, we just don't have the manpower to do most of the stuff. GARSD: While he works on recruiting, I speak to one of his new employees, Ichard Oden. ICHARD ODEN: I always wanted to be a carpenter ever since I was little because when I was younger, I used to build basketball rims, clubhouses. GARSD: But things took a very bad turn in 1999. Oden was barely out of his teenage years when he was convicted of kidnapping and second-degree murder. ODEN: I was in my 12th grade year when I got locked up. GARSD: Oden spent two decades behind bars. As his release date approached, he faced the conundrum of so many inmates - a grown man with no skill set heading back into a city in dire need of workers. He was given a career test. It found he had a high aptitude for. . . ODEN: Being a cop, but we know that was out the window (laughter). GARSD: He also tested well for carpentry, which is what he studied at the Vocational Village. An entry-level carpenter can make around 16 bucks an hour. When Oden got out of prison in February, the next day he contacted the carpenters union. And about a week later, they sent him to the construction site. ODEN: Of course, I was nervous (laughter) because it's the first time in 20 years, like, I'm in society. GARSD: But Oden says he kept thinking about this thing, which was often on his mind while he was in prison. ODEN: I never pictured myself in prison all the time. I always pictured myself out of prison. So prison wasn't in me, but being free was, so I always thought about that. So when I went to the job site and he asked me - he like, what can you do? GARSD: Whatever you want me to do, Oden responded. He got hired that day.

But there is low and there's really, really low. NPR's Jim Zarroli recently visited a city in Iowa where the job market is so tight that workers pretty much have their pick of jobs, and they're seeing wages rise as a result. He prepared this report as part of NPR's series on the full-employment economy. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Two orders of cheese balls, and then. . . JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Hickory Park in Ames, Iowa, is a sprawling, family-style restaurant with a nostalgia theme. There's an old-fashioned soda fountain and jars of what used to be called penny candy out front. I went in there because of a help wanted sign on the highway outside. Manager Elizabeth Kopecky told me, these days, Hickory Park is always looking for workers. ELIZABETH KOPECKY: That sign - we have never hung a sign out in front of our building ever. ZARROLI: That sign says, help wanted - all positions. KOPECKY: Correct. ZARROLI: And you're saying that's been there for a little while. KOPECKY: Two years - used to be just kitchen, but now it's, like, all positions. ZARROLI: Welcome to Ames. It's a small city surrounded by farm fields, and it happens to have the country's hottest job market. Economist Peter Orazem says the unemployment rate is almost unprecedented. PETER ORAZEM: One point five percent in Ames. They actually reported 0. 9% at one time, and I don't even know what that means. ZARROLI: Orazem says the job market is strong here, in part because Iowa State, where he teaches, is located here. Because of Iowa State, some tech companies have set up shop here, and there's a big federal energy department lab that's generated jobs. EMILY FORRESTER: We refer to this part of Iowa as the silicon prairie. ZARROLI: Emily Forrester is human resources director at Workiva, a software company started by a couple of Iowa State Ph. D. s. Ames doesn't typically attract a lot of tech workers, and Workiva offers Silicon Valley-style perks to find employees. FORRESTER: We provide gourmet lunches to everyone in our Ames headquarters office for $5 a day. ZARROLI: Workiva offers flex time, generous family leave. You can bring your dog to work. Places such as Workiva pay really well from the Midwest, and that's filtered through the economy of Ames as a whole. Health care and service workers are in huge demand. I found Tanisha Cortez working at a restaurant. She's an assistant manager and wears a lot of different hats. Cortez went looking for a job last November. She answered about a half dozen ads. Every single place offered her a job. TANISHA CORTEZ: I think you could find a job very fast here because I put in applications for actually a few places, and they all got in contact with me. ZARROLI: And the job she took paid $2,000 a year more than her old one. That's typical. Wages are rising in Ames faster than the rest of the state. That's great for workers and not so great for employers. At Hickory Park, Elizabeth Kopecky is getting ready for the dinner hour. She darts around the restaurant floor checking schedules and running the cash register. Kopecky has been at Hickory Park for 40 years. She says it was once easy to find workers in Ames. You just posted something on the university job board. KOPECKY: Before, we never, ever had to even barely advertise for staff. And you had applicants - stacks and stacks of applicants to go through. And you had to choose which ones out of great applicants because you didn't need a whole lot. ZARROLI: These days, the restaurant hires just about anyone who walks in the door. It doesn't even have time to check their references. And still there aren't enough workers. She used to hire eight or 10 hosts to greet patrons. These days, she's getting by with four, even though the restaurant is really busy. Everyone has to multitask. And Kopecky says all of Hickory Park's competitors are in the same boat. KOPECKY: We last year had a call from a restaurant down the street asking if we had any extra staff that they could share. That's how bad it's getting. ZARROLI: And what did you tell them? KOPECKY: That we didn't have enough for ourselves. ZARROLI: There's another reason why it's so hard to find workers in Ames. Economist Peter Orazem says the local population hasn't grown a lot over the years. With its brutal winters, Iowa doesn't attract a lot of outsiders. ORAZEM: It's hard to get people just to show up in Iowa - right? - I mean, you know, unless their planes have been diverted. ZARROLI: For years, Ames was actually losing young people. So when the economy grows, like it is now, there aren't enough workers. Employers in Ames typically try to lure people by playing up the quality of life. Orazem says the nearest major league baseball team is four hours away. But the schools are good. There's little traffic. And Workiva's Emily Forrester says, just look at that cost of living. FORRESTER: Here, you could buy a home for $250,000 very easily. What would that get you in the Bay Area, for example? ZARROLI: But Peter Orazem says Ames, like the state as a whole, has to work harder to attract people. ORAZEM: For Iowa to continue to expand, it has to be able to bring in people from other places, whether it's people who are new arrivals to the United States or new arrivals from Illinois. ZARROLI: Orazem says Ames is starting to attract a lot of workers from rural Iowa. But there's probably a limit to how many people can be lured to Ames right now. That's because unemployment is almost as low all over the Midwest and in much of the country as well. Jim Zarroli, NPR News.

So all this month, NPR is looking at what that means for workers and communities. Many African Americans are seeing an opportunity for better jobs and cheap housing in the South, and Charlotte, N. C. , is one of their destinations. NPR's Daniella Cheslow reports. DANIELLA CHESLOW, BYLINE: Brittany Smith shows me around the house she and her husband bought on the outskirts of Charlotte. BRITTANY SMITH: And this is my laundry room here - washer, dryer - your standard (laughter). CHESLOW: It's a beige house with a brick facade. There's a front porch and a two-car garage and a green front lawn. She holds her 15-month-old daughter, Erelah. (SOUNDBITE OF BABY BABBLING)CHESLOW: Smith grew up mostly in Detroit. Six years ago, she struggled to find a full-time job in health care there. Her then-boyfriend Sam was a career counselor at a college campus that was closing. SMITH: We were looking at what cities are growing for young professionals, and Charlotte was always, like, one of the top five. CHESLOW: It helped that Smith's father had moved back to North Carolina, about two hours away from Charlotte. So they made the move. SMITH: We did have the idea of, you know, we may go down here for a year. If we don't like it, then we can always go home. CHESLOW: The Smiths are part of an influx of African Americans to Mecklenburg County, N. C. The African American population here has ballooned by 64% since 2000. Some people come from neighboring counties in North and South Carolina, but thousands are coming from Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Illinois. And other cities in the South are seeing similar growth, including Houston, Atlanta, Tallahassee and Columbia, S. C. Smith, 32, is about to begin a new job at a health insurance company doing community outreach. SMITH: It starts Monday, actually, so very quick turnaround. But, yeah, starts Monday. CHESLOW: Her previous job was similar. It was a dream job, she says. But the new position pays better and has more responsibility. Sam, now her husband, found work in Charlotte, too, as a university career counselor. JESSICA BARRON: Opportunities for black folks - the South and that have never been in the same sentence. CHESLOW: Demographer Jessica Barron in Durham, N. C. , says, throughout much of the 20th century, millions of African Americans left the South to escape racial discrimination and lack of opportunity. BARRON: That's why we got the Harlem Renaissance and Chicago blues. These are all a part of the story of the Great Migration. CHESLOW: As manufacturing dried up in the Rust Belt, services, tech and finance expanded in Southern cities. African Americans started coming back. Barron says migrants tend to have higher education and more connections than African Americans who remained in places like North Carolina for generations. The job market for African Americans over the past two years is the best ever. Unemployment is at 6. 7%, although it's double the rate for whites. Charlotte, in particular, is booming. The city has seen eight straight years of job growth. TOM HANCHETT: But as the tide has risen here, it has not lifted all boats equally. CHESLOW: Charlotte historian Tom Hanchett says decades of segregation and redlining have given African Americans in Charlotte fewer opportunities to buy homes and build wealth. HANCHETT: Affordable housing is especially an issue for African Americans. It requires special effort to overcome it because special effort created it. CHESLOW: And in Charlotte, many African Americans work in industries like hospitality and retail, where wages have stagnated. That mirrors the national trend, where wages have grown more slowly for African Americans than any other group. I meet Nicole Muse-Dennis at one of two jobs she works - as bar manager at night and a special education teacher during the day. NICOLE MUSE-DENNIS: I'm what I call overemployed. I have two jobs, and I'm still trying to make it. CHESLOW: Muse-Dennis says raising two daughters as a single mom on a teacher's salary has forced her into a 65-hour workweek. A couple days later, I join her morning routine. MUSE-DENNIS: Come on. Let's brush your hair. CHESLOW: It's still dark as she gets ready to drive her daughter to school. MUSE-DENNIS: The hard part is just making sure I get up - actually, like, get up in the morning. That's the hard part. And then making sure I can actually drive there. CHESLOW: Muse-Dennis owns her town house in a middle-class neighborhood called University City. And the value of her home has increased in recent years, but her taxes have gone up, too. (SOUNDBITE OF BABY CRYING)CHESLOW: As Muse-Dennis strains to make a living, Brittany Smith, the Detroit transplant, is not as overextended. She and her husband both work jobs they love, and they have just one child. She feeds her daughter Erelah a pouch of organic sweet potatoes. SMITH: Here I am, a transplant that has come down here, and I've taken advantage of all these opportunities. Now, some of it may be due to I have, you know, an education, and same for my husband. But also, it make me - actually, my husband and I - to look at ways that we can help bridge the gap. CHESLOW: The structural issues that keep many African Americans unemployed or underpaid are difficult to fix. But a strong economy opens more paths to success, and that's the experience of the Smith family and millions of other African Americans who are starting new lives in the South.

And it turns out that grocery delivery gigs are particularly attractive to women, who make up the majority of workers. Two apps confirmed this to NPR's Alina Selyukh. As NPR's look into the full employment economy, she spent a day with one suburban mom in Sacramento to find out why. HILARY GORDON: You want apple? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Just apple and. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: We'll be going to bed. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: At 6:30 a. m. , 4 out of 5 Gordon family members are up - if you only count the humans, because there are also dogs, chickens, goats, a bunny, a tortoise and a not-so-miniature miniature pig. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Squiggy, come here. Good boy. (SOUNDBITE OF PIG SNORTING)GORDON: This is what I have in my kitchen every morning. SELYUKH: That's Hilary Gordon - she's 47 - doing the morning mom hustle. GORDON: OK. Your breakfast sandwich, Jane's check for graduation. Drew, soccer ball - really? SELYUKH: Her daughters are 14 and 17. Her son is 11. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Oh, by the way. I forgot. I have homework. SELYUKH: Having time like this with her family is a major reason why Gordon works as a shopper for Instacart. It's one of the delivery apps that hires tens of thousands of people like her to deliver groceries from supermarkets - think Safeway or Sam's Club. It's the epitome of gig work. Like with Uber and Lyft, you can decide when to work. But with deliveries, you don't invite strangers into your car. This draws women, often in their 40s and 50s, who now make up more than half of the contractors working for major food delivery apps. GORDON: This is what I tend to do. I'll sit and wait. SELYUKH: This Subaru SUV is Gordon's office. Her Instacart shift today is 8 p. m. to 6 p. m. She'll spend much of it in her car in parking lots with her shopping sneakers on, watching her phone, waiting for grocery orders. GORDON: There we go. We've got a batch - $8, there's no tip, for seven items to take 4 miles. SELYUKH: Plus, the store is another 8 miles away. GORDON: It's really hard to say yes to that because you feel like then they're thinking, oh, well, see, they'll work for that. And I don't want to work for that. SELYUKH: But you can't skip too many orders. The app will think you stopped working. Eventually, we get a good one. GORDON: It's 9. 87 for them and a $6 tip, but it's half a mile. SELYUKH: We're close. The order is eight items. Gordon can knock it out in about 20 minutes. Shopping for other people is a bit like a scavenger hunt, except the app is timing you. You rush through the whole store, do your best quality checks on produce, some Hail Marys on hard versus soft avocados. . . GORDON: Is it for tomorrow? Is it for today? SELYUKH: . . . And a surprising amount of chatting up store workers. GORDON: Hi, Belle (ph). Do you know if they're going to stock more in here? SELYUKH: Gordon says this is the part she loves the most - meeting other people at the store or at their homes, especially if they have friendly pets. But, like a lot of gig workers, this is not a career she pictured for herself. GORDON: So I've got two master's degrees - one in counseling and one in - master of family therapy. SELYUKH: Gordon worked as a therapist in other states, but a move to California required more classes and exams right as her oldest was born. She became a social worker until she made the calculation familiar to many working women. Her job took up mornings and evenings. Her salary - not great. GORDON: When you're going to pay the majority of it to let somebody else raise your kids, just didn't make any sense. SELYUKH: A few years later, the recession hit. Her husband lost his job in finance. Their house value dropped. They're still paying down the debt that stacked up. But now, there's also. . . GORDON: Swim team, soccer - Drew's cleats fell apart on the field - trips to look at colleges, AP exams, junior prom dresses. . . GORDON: This is what I heard a lot as I interviewed more than a half-dozen women working for Instacart and other delivery apps like DoorDash, Shipt and Postmates. They said the apps help them cover some expenses of child and health care and opportunity for side income on top of another steadier job - their own or their partner's. Researchers say this supplemental work is the fastest-growing part of the gig economy. STACIE BALLARD: If you're a mom or a caregiver, something that's really flexible. MARTIN: That Stacie Ballard from Atlanta, who's worked for at least seven apps while building her own business. She keeps a stack of work T-shirts in her trunk - a green one to walk dogs for Wag, a gray one to deliver packages for Shipt. BALLARD: Run to the bathroom, put the shirt on, go through the grocery thing (laughter). And then, if it was the next one, swap the shirt out. And yeah, it was kind of funny. SELYUKH: Ballard works for apps part-time, like many women in the gig economy. Hustling like this full-time is exhausting. But also, hours are unreliable. Take Gordon, who after a year and a half is a super user at Instacart. She's one of the regulars who gets early access to all hours for the week. But to qualify for that access, she has to commit to this gig basically full-time. And on Sunday mornings, it's a moment of madness signing up for shifts. GORDON: So it's really anxiety-producing. SELYUKH: And you're just clicking. GORDON: Click, click, click, click, click and then save. And then you hit the next day. Click, click, click, click, click, click, click. SELYUKH: After all that, as any gig worker knows, having more hours does not assure a huge paycheck bump. Remember all that math Gordon does before deciding if an order is worth taking? Gas expenses are a huge factor. Some days, Gordon might drive a total of 100 miles. Instacart pays some of the delivery mileage, but not for the drive to the store in the first place. Next to consider is what she'll be buying. Is it complicated or heavy - like this job shopping for two customers at one store for 32 bucks before tips? GORDON: It looks decent if you don't scroll all the way through to see the last - 13 cases of water. SELYUKH: This lesson she learned early on when she accidentally signed up for a batch with 81 cases of water from Costco. She had to return and give up the whole order. One final thing she always checks is whether she knows the delivery address. GORDON: There's occasionally places that I will not go. SELYUKH: Shoppers said they like to keep mental track of houses with creepy dudes, apartments with no elevators and bad tippers. Orders from businesses are notorious for not tipping. So if the batch does not check all these boxes with enough money, Gordon will probably skip it with a sassy message for Instacart. GORDON: Pay too low - I will not work for free. SELYUKH: Today, she delivered eight orders in 10 hours and made $133. Today was OK. Her best day was $255 in 12 hours. As another woman told me, working for an app is a great job as long as you don't really need the money. Alina Selyukh, NPR News, Sacramento, Calif. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:   Some of the newest jobs of this economy have been created by apps like Uber and Instacart. And it turns out that grocery delivery gigs are particularly attractive to women, who make up the majority of workers. Two apps confirmed this to NPR's Alina Selyukh. As NPR's look into the full employment economy, she spent a day with one suburban mom in Sacramento to find out why. HILARY GORDON: You want apple? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Just apple and. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: We'll be going to bed. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: At 6:30 a. m. , 4 out of 5 Gordon family members are up - if you only count the humans, because there are also dogs, chickens, goats, a bunny, a tortoise and a not-so-miniature miniature pig. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Squiggy, come here. Good boy. (SOUNDBITE OF PIG SNORTING) GORDON: This is what I have in my kitchen every morning. SELYUKH: That's Hilary Gordon - she's 47 - doing the morning mom hustle. GORDON: OK. Your breakfast sandwich, Jane's check for graduation. Drew, soccer ball - really? SELYUKH: Her daughters are 14 and 17. Her son is 11. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Oh, by the way. I forgot. I have homework. SELYUKH: Having time like this with her family is a major reason why Gordon works as a shopper for Instacart. It's one of the delivery apps that hires tens of thousands of people like her to deliver groceries from supermarkets - think Safeway or Sam's Club. It's the epitome of gig work.

Nationwide, it's at 3. 6%. This week, NPR is bringing you profiles of how this affects different communities. Among Hispanics, joblessness has hit a low of 4. 2%, but many say that is not all good news. There is still a wide income gap compared to whites. Hispanics earn about one-fourth less than white workers do. NPR's Jasmine Garsd spent time with one family who struggle to succeed, but there is one investment they have made that could change the family's entire future. JASMINE GARSD, BYLINE: Ernesto Martinez remembers this one day when he was 17. He had 120 bucks to his name, and it was all in his pocket. That's how much he got paid for his first job in the U. S. as a mover. And he says he stood there, in front of a shop window at the mall. He was mesmerized. It was a pair of Air Jordans. They cost around $100. ERNESTO MARTINEZ: (Speaking Spanish). GARSD: \"I fell in love with them,\" he says. He didn't speak English, so he turned to his brother and said, ask them to bring me a size eight. And his brother responded disapprovingly, what do you want those shoes for? Martinez says that's when he decided to learn English so he could speak for himself and go back and buy the shoes. He'd just arrived from Mexico. It was the 1990s, and back then, if you turned on the radio, you might hear this No. 1 billboard hit. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LIVIN' LA VIDA LOCA\")RICKY MARTIN: (Singing) Upside, inside out, she's living la vida loca. She'll push and pull you down. GARSD: This is what pundits called the Latin explosion. Over the next two decades, the Hispanic population would grow from 22. 4 million people to 50. 5 million. But many Latinos were hardly living la vida loca. The 2000 Census reported that they had a poverty rate of 22. 6%. Ernesto Martinez's wife, Araceli, had three cleaning jobs, and it was still hard to get by. ARACELI MARTINEZ: (Speaking Spanish). GARSD: She says the owners of one of the hotels she cleaned at made her do the heavy lifting, like moving furniture. It was grueling, but she just could not afford to lose that job. Today across the U. S. , there is an abundance of jobs. Unemployment is at the lowest ever for Latinos, and their poverty rate has gone down somewhat. ARACELI MARTINEZ: This is my kitchen. So this is the dining room. GARSD: On a rainy Sunday afternoon, Araceli shows me around her home in southern New Jersey. They were able to buy it in the year 2000. It's beautiful. The backyard is expansive, and it takes a lot of work to afford this place. Araceli still has three jobs - cleaning houses, as a supermarket cashier and she's a day care assistant. Ernesto owns a small drywall company, and in this booming economy, there's so much construction, he can hardly keep up. Things have improved dramatically for this family, but Araceli says their income has barely budged in the last decade. And meanwhile, the cost of living has gone up. ARACELI MARTINEZ: (Speaking Spanish). GARSD: \"Sometimes you have to have two or three jobs to make ends meet,\" she says. Everything is expensive - food, utilities, car insurance. It's these details economists point to when heeding caution about the stunning unemployment numbers. Yes, joblessness is down, and that's great, but there's still this huge wage gap between Latinos and whites. And for some 7 million Central American and Mexican immigrants who don't have legal status, it's even harder to move up. Being undocumented often leads to exploitation. It makes it harder to get an education. It forces people to work for low wages in the informal economy. It makes it difficult to start and build a company. Which is why for all the talk about the Latin cultural explosion and unemployment going down, there are activists who worry about the formation of a permanent Latino underclass in America. But Ernesto and Araceli Martinez say they actually see a really bright future, and it's because of their kids. ARACELI MARTINEZ: Alondra. GARSD: Alondra, or Alo, is 22 years old. She's the older of the two Martinez kids. When they were born, Ernesto says he had this really clear vision. E MARTINEZ: (Speaking Spanish). GARSD: He didn't want to see them doing drywall. He says, I want them to have a 9-to-5 job. I want them to be well dressed and not dirty like we get dirty. As soon as she was born, he started saving for her college. He saw it as an investment. The problem is as Alondra got older, she didn't see herself as the kind of person who goes into higher education. ALONDRA MARTINEZ: I feel like growing up, I was very aware of the kind of family I came from. I feel like when you're - when you don't know, when you don't have people that are, like, lawyers and doctors and people with careers in your family, then you think it's so farfetched and it's, like, so much money. GARSD: It was a high school Spanish teacher who spoke to her about New Jersey's Educational Opportunity Fund, the state's support program for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. That's how Alondra ended up at Montclair State University. She's part of the record number of Hispanics going to college. Nationwide, enrollment nearly tripled between 1999 and 2016. (SOUNDBITE OF SIR EDWARD ELGAR'S \"POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE\")GARSD: She graduated this month with a degree in human development. At the ceremony for the Educational Opportunity Fund's students, she gave a speech. She was nervous. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ALONDRA MARTINEZ: Sorry. I didn't expect to be so emotional. GARSD: But she started. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ALONDRA MARTINEZ: Being a first-generation college student means breaking every barrier, silencing every negative voice and pushing myself to be the woman I know I am meant to be. GARSD: And then she broke format, speaking in Spanish. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ALONDRA MARTINEZ: And to my parents, Mama, Papa (speaking Spanish). GARSD: \"Mom, Dad, we made it. \" In fall of this year, Alondra Martinez will be going to Rutgers University to get her master's degree in college student affairs. She dreams of being dean of a university someday. She'll likely earn many times what her parents do. Her father, Ernesto, marvels at this. This generation's goal is to be lawyers, engineers, architects. E MARTINEZ: (Speaking Spanish). GARSD: \"That is their dream,\" he says. \"And what was my dream?

Trump wants the Mexican government to stop the flow of illegal immigrants from Central America into the U. S. He said he would impose a 5% tariff on June 10 and then steadily raise it if no progress is made. Now, to talk about the economic impact of these latest tariffs, we turn to NPR's Jim Zarroli. And Jim, let's just start with how the markets reacted today. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Yeah. Well, the markets are worried because the economies of the United States and Mexico have become really intertwined as a result of NAFTA. Mexico is now the second-largest market for U. S. products after Canada. We sell a lot to them. They sell a lot to us. Now, Trump already risked disrupting that relationship by renegotiating NAFTA. Last year, the U. S. , Mexico and Canada were able to come up with a revised agreement. And it really looked like things were getting back to normal. And then yesterday, Trump disrupted everything all over again by imposing these new tariffs for reasons having nothing to do with trade, and the markets don't like it. CORNISH: Can you give us an example of how these economies are intertwined? ZARROLI: Yeah. The auto sector, for example - let's say you have a car that's made in Mexico and sold here. It has many thousands of parts. They may be made in Canada. These parts may be made in the U. S. or Mexico, maybe even a fourth country. And these parts go back and forth over the border multiple times before the car is finished. So we have this elaborate supply chain for autos that's been built up. And if you start to slap tariffs - which are a kind of tax - on these parts every time they cross the border, it gets, you know, not only really complicated, but really expensive, especially if Mexico retaliates with tariffs of its own. CORNISH: Does President Trump have the legal authority to impose these tariffs, or does Congress have to get involved? ZARROLI: Yeah, I was wondering that, too. And I put the question to Matt Gold, who was a trade official in the Obama administration. And he said Trump probably does have the authority to do this. Congress has delegated to the president the power to impose certain temporary tariffs, but Gold says this is almost certainly a violation of international law. MATT GOLD: We're definitely violating both the World Trade Organization agreements that we have with Mexico and the NAFTA agreement that we're having with Mexico in very, very major ways with very, very scary long-term potential impact. ZARROLI: And Gold says the U. S. may have some legitimate issues about immigration, but tariffs aren't the way to deal with it. It's better to deal with it through some diplomatic channels, only, he says, Trump at this point just doesn't have that much credibility with the Mexican government. GOLD: Any previous American president, Republican or Democrat, would have had a good enough relationship with the Mexican government to be able to solve this problem without such a dramatic and self-damaging measure. CORNISH: Can we talk more about that relationship? How is Mexico reacting? ZARROLI: Well, the response from Mexican President Lopez Obrador was pretty subdued. He said he would send a government official to Washington to discuss the matter. There has been a bit more pushback from other places. The Wall Street Journal says trade representative Robert Lighthizer is actually opposed to the new tariffs. He is worried that they will jeopardize passage of this revised NAFTA - this U. S. -Mexico-Canada agreement - which already faced a pretty uncertain future in Congress. Also, Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley said today what Trump did was a misuse of the president's tariff authority. Iowa, of course, is a big agriculture state. And farmers there sell a lot of products to Mexico, so they will be heard, especially if Mexico decides to retaliate with tariffs of its own. CORNISH: That's NPR's Jim Zarroli. Jim, thank you. ZARROLI: You're welcome. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  The financial markets took a tumble today after President Trump threatened to impose tariffs on all goods imported from Mexico. Trump wants the Mexican government to stop the flow of illegal immigrants from Central America into the U. S. He said he would impose a 5% tariff on June 10 and then steadily raise it if no progress is made. Now, to talk about the economic impact of these latest tariffs, we turn to NPR's Jim Zarroli. And Jim, let's just start with how the markets reacted today. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Yeah. Well, the markets are worried because the economies of the United States and Mexico have become really intertwined as a result of NAFTA. Mexico is now the second-largest market for U. S. products after Canada. We sell a lot to them. They sell a lot to us. Now, Trump already risked disrupting that relationship by renegotiating NAFTA. Last year, the U. S. , Mexico and Canada were able to come up with a revised agreement. And it really looked like things were getting back to normal. And then yesterday, Trump disrupted everything all over again by imposing these new tariffs for reasons having nothing to do with trade, and the markets don't like it. CORNISH: Can you give us an example of how these economies are intertwined? ZARROLI: Yeah. The auto sector, for example - let's say you have a car that's made in Mexico and sold here. It has many thousands of parts. They may be made in Canada. These parts may be made in the U. S. or Mexico, maybe even a fourth country. And these parts go back and forth over the border multiple times before the car is finished. So we have this elaborate supply chain for autos that's been built up. And if you start to slap tariffs - which are a kind of tax - on these parts every time they cross the border, it gets, you know, not only really complicated, but really expensive, especially if Mexico retaliates with tariffs of its own. CORNISH: Does President Trump have the legal authority to impose these tariffs, or does Congress have to get involved? ZARROLI: Yeah, I was wondering that, too. And I put the question to Matt Gold, who was a trade official in the Obama administration. And he said Trump probably does have the authority to do this. Congress has delegated to the president the power to impose certain temporary tariffs, but Gold says this is almost certainly a violation of international law. MATT GOLD: We're definitely violating both the World Trade Organization agreements that we have with Mexico and the NAFTA agreement that we're having with Mexico in very, very major ways with very, very scary long-term potential impact. ZARROLI: And Gold says the U. S. may have some legitimate issues about immigration, but tariffs aren't the way to deal with it.

S. and the U. K. to go into effect after the U. K. 's expected departure from the European Union. The negotiations come as trade tensions are rising around the world. The U. S. and China have imposed steep tariffs on each other's goods. Last week, Trump announced new tariffs that would apply across the board to imports from Mexico. To help us sort out the prospects of a bilateral trade deal between the U. S. and the U. K. and to look at the historical context, we're joined by Professor Dennis Novy. He's an economist at the University of Warwick. Welcome to the program. DENNIS NOVY: Thank you. CORNISH: Before we dig into the history, I want to find out from you if you think there's a chance that the U. S. and the U. K. will come to an agreement on a bilateral trade deal. NOVY: That chance, in my view, is close to zero. And the reasons are quite simple. Well, first of all, any such trade agreement would take many, many years to negotiate - probably at least four, five years. And who knows what happens by the end of that? Second reason is that there are some fundamental difficulties. For example, the U. S. wants to open up the U. K. health care market, the National Health Service, which is a very delicate issue politically. They also want to open up the U. K. market for agricultural exports. That includes lots of regulation issue, food safety. Chlorinated chicken is the big issue of contention. These are very difficult issues. They've proven very difficult before, so I don't expect any swift resolution there because these issues go back a long time. CORNISH: So you recently published a paper looking at trade disputes in the 1930s, specifically that countries began striking bilateral trading agreements like the ones being negotiated now. Why did you look back at that period, and what did you find? NOVY: We looked back at that period because people have been discussing this notion of trade wars recently. So it's quite natural to look back in history, and asking, well, what happened in previous times when we had trade wars? And the 1930s is probably the obvious point to look. And it's quite interesting that during that time period, what the trade wars really did is they cemented preexisting trading blocs, in particular the British Commonwealth. CORNISH: So you had the U. K. negotiating bilateral agreements with, like, Australia and Canada and India, right? And then I read you also had Germany forming its own bloc with members, countries that it had relationships with. And the U. S. did something similar. NOVY: That's right. The origins of the British trading bloc really go back to World War I. And a lot of the considerations are of a military nature, a geostrategic nature. They were bottlenecked in some supplies, especially for the military, and that's why the British government was thinking more about how to secure its supplies. And that happened on the German side as well. Germany was preparing for war. They were gearing up for war, so they needed to make sure they had the right supplies, especially for the military. CORNISH: Now, you write that if similar patterns play out today, we could see a, quote, \"reorientation of world trade around China- and U. S. -centric trade blocs. \" How likely do you think that is? NOVY: Well, it depends on the politics. The White House wants to have a more bilateral approach where the U. S. deals with one individual country, as opposed to a group. And China now wants to create a system of its own. So that does include establishing a sphere of influence in Asia. And each of them will want to build up their own realm where they have the power in the region. CORNISH: What do you think is at stake here? If this approach continues, what are your main concerns? NOVY: The main concern is retaliation. We go back to a period where countries didn't coordinate. That was very much the case in the 1930s. If I slap a tariff on you, you don't like that, and you slap a tariff on me, and we're both worse off. That's why after World War II, we had multilateral negotiations to get rid of that problem. And now we are at risk of going back to the previous period during the Great Depression when people didn't coordinate their trade policy and everyone ended up being worse off. And I think that's the concern. The international architecture, the institutional framework for doing trade policy might just break down, and it might become much more national or bilateral. CORNISH: Professor Dennis Novy of the University of Warwick, thank you so much for speaking with us. NOVY: My pleasure.

And according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the big topic of discussion at a weekly Senate Republicans meeting was President Trump's plan to raise tariffs on imports from Mexico. McConnell told reporters there's not much support for the move. Just last week, trade disputes with Mexico and Canada seemed to be on the cusp of resolution, so this new tariff threat surprised many U. S. businesses with supply chains that cross the border, as NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Auto parts makers are just one of many industries closely intertwined with Mexico that are reeling from what seems like a sudden about-face by the Trump administration. It's not clear what the latest tariff threats will mean for passage of the president's U. S. -Mexico-Canada Agreement or USMCA. Worse, Mexico might impose its own tariffs on American products. ANN WILSON: We just did not see this coming. NOGUCHI: Ann Wilson is senior vice president of government affairs for the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association. She says her industry was relieved last month, when the administration lifted tariffs on steel and aluminum from Mexico and Canada. Now it's all back in flux. President Trump has pledged to raise tariffs on all Mexican products starting at 5% next week and going up to 25% by October. WILSON: Manufacturers flourish in this country when they have certainty. Now we're - we have a real question about whether that certainty even exists. NOGUCHI: Wilson says higher tariffs would increase supply costs and raise car prices. Taken together, uncertainty about tariffs have been a drag on the economy, including for clothing companies. Stephen Lamar is executive vice president of the American Apparel & Footwear Association. He was on the phone with White House officials about the trade deal when he heard about the new tariff threat. STEPHEN LAMAR: It does come as a gut punch in the efforts of those who are trying to get USMCA approved. NOGUCHI: Clothing prices already spiked because of increased tariffs on Chinese imports. Lamar says tariffs have become too unpredictable. LAMAR: It is a surreal, in some cases, existential crisis that every day or every couple of days, these companies come into work and find that their product may be subject to additional taxes. NOGUCHI: Normally, businesses have months to adapt. They optimize their supply chains down to the last button.

MILLER: Typically, what happens is if the market goes up as a result of the tariffs, then, in my experience, the Canadian market will most likely follow.

NPR's chief business editor Pallavi Gogoi visited the company's headquarters. She spoke with its chairman, and she joins us now. And Pallavi, what did you hear? PALLAVI GOGOI, BYLINE: So today, as part of a small group of visiting U. S. journalists, I was at Huawei's beautiful leafy campus. We met with Chairman Liang Hua, who had a surprising message for American leaders who worry that Huawei technology would be used for spying by the Chinese government. In fact, I asked him whether the company would be willing to sign a no-spy agreement, which is basically like a promise that the Huawei technology would not be used for spying. And he said yes. He'd be willing to do that with any country. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LIANG HUA: (Speaking Chinese). GOGOI: What he's saying is that he is skeptical that such a deal might not necessarily be possible, specifically with the U. S. And he said the U. S. has not bought anything from Huawei, is not buying anything. And that's the reason why he doesn't see an opportunity to sign such an agreement, specifically with the U. S. CORNISH: Remind us what this is all in response to. GOGOI: So a lot of things, right, Audie? In recent weeks, Huawei has come under intense attack from the U. S. government. Just last month, the U. S. added Huawei to its, quote, unquote, \"entity list,\" which bars American businesses from selling technology to Huawei without government approval. That hurts Huawei at its core. For instance, Google won't be able to supply Huawei with its Android operating system, which you use to get, you know, for Google search or to get Gmail. But really, when you think about it, all of this began last year when the U. S. and China were clashing over trade. In the midst of all that, the U. S. issued an arrest warrant for Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou on charges that Huawei's breaching American sanctions against Iran, among other allegations. Now, Meng is not just any, you know, CFO. She's also the daughter of Huawei's founder and CEO and is now under house arrest in Canada. Huawei has maintained consistently that the arrest is all about politics and stymieing Huawei's ambitions. CORNISH: Why is this company at the heart of this trade war? GOGOI: So Huawei is one of China's most successful tech companies. It is the world's second-largest smartphone maker, behind Samsung, even ahead of Apple. But more significantly, Huawei is expected to be a world leader in 5G. That's a revolutionary technology that will fuel the future of, you know, things like driverless cars, smart cities, smart traffic lights and what have you. The Trump administration believe that trade is about dominance, and China is showing - China and Huawei is showing to be ahead in this key area. CORNISH: In the meantime, what's next for this company? GOGOI: There is no doubt that if the U. S. ban is imposed, it will hurt Huawei in the short-term. However, there are some experts who say that it might strengthen Huawei's hand over the long-term. Huawei has a plan B to make its own computer chips and operating system in the coming years. Now, there was another development today that could signal an easing of tensions between the U. S. government and Huawei. President Trump was in London, and he met with Theresa May earlier today. In that press conference, he was asked specifically about the U. S. warning European countries just this week of dire consequences, you know, when it comes to sharing intelligence if those countries don't ban Huawei from their 5G networks. President Trump sounded conciliatory, actually. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, because we're going to have, absolutely, an agreement on Huawei and everything else. We have an incredible intelligence relationship, and we will be able to work out any differences. GOGOI: But as we have learned, the devil really is in the details. We'll have to find out, you know, what such an agreement would look like. So stay tuned. CORNISH: That's NPR's Pallavi Gogoi reporting on Huawei in China. Thank you for speaking with us.

S. warning European countries just this week of dire consequences, you know, when it comes to sharing intelligence if those countries don't ban Huawei from their 5G networks. President Trump sounded conciliatory, actually. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, because we're going to have, absolutely, an agreement on Huawei and everything else. We have an incredible intelligence relationship, and we will be able to work out any differences. GOGOI: But as we have learned, the devil really is in the details. We'll have to find out, you know, what such an agreement would look like. So stay tuned. CORNISH: That's NPR's Pallavi Gogoi reporting on Huawei in China. Thank you for speaking with us.

He wants to pressure Mexico to slow the flood of Central American migrants headed to the U. S. border. President Trump says starting Monday, the U. S. will put tariffs on all Mexican goods coming into the country if Mexico doesn't do more to stop migration. If the tariffs are imposed, it would play havoc with supply chains of many U. S. companies. NPR's Camila Domonoske looks at the auto industry. CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: You have a nervous system. Your car has a complex network of wires tied together into something called a wire harness. It connects electronics throughout a vehicle. SUE HELPER: So it's a huge, heavy bundle of wires, and it's gotten dramatically more complicated as cars become more electronic. DOMONOSKE: Sue Helper is a case Western Reserve University economist. Every car has a different configuration for its wires. HELPER: If they're done wrong, you can get electrical problems that you'll never solve (laughter). DOMONOSKE: So before those wires go in the car, you bundle them together. And for U. S. -made cars, that bundling almost always happens in Mexico, specifically in Juarez. HELPER: Wiring harness capital of the world. DOMONOSKE: It takes a lot of human hours to do this work, and labor is cheaper in Mexico. But the bundling of wires together is just one step in a long process. At a plant in Warren, Ohio, workers stamp out metal parts that will connect wiring to just about every electronic thing in a car. HELPER: And these presses go so fast that you can't really see them. It's amazing how quickly they move. DOMONOSKE: Those parts go to Mexico, get attached to wires, and the wires get bundled together and then come back the U. S. to go in a car. Smaller parts can have their own wiring harnesses, too. Brad Kraft is the CEO of Hopkins Manufacturing Corporation, which, among other things, makes parts for trailers, like a device to stop a runaway trailer if it breaks off. It starts off simply in Emporia, Kan. BRAD KRAFT: We manufacture the plastic box in Kansas, bring it down into our manufacturing facility in Mexico. DOMONOSKE: There in Juarez, his company will add other components and of course bundle together the wires. KRAFT: And bring it back into the U. S. as a complete, finished good. DOMONOSKE: Ready to be installed in a trailer or sold at auto parts stores. This happens all the time and not just with wiring. The process of building a seat might send the same part back and forth across the border multiple times, which would mean multiple tariffs even if a car is assembled in America and even on parts that started out in America. The supply chain didn't always work like this. Sue Helper says that decades ago, a lot of work like this would have been done close together in the U. S. And the process could shift in the future, but experts say these tariffs are not likely to bring those wire bundling jobs back to the U. S. Instead they might push them overseas to other places with low labor costs. Ann Wilson is with the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association. ANN WILSON: Keep in mind the wire that goes into those wire harnesses, the fabric that is coated around those wires as well as all of the connectors are oftentimes made in the United States. So if we make it more expensive to make wire harnesses in Mexico and they move that offshore someplace else, we are going to lose those jobs in the United States. DOMONOSKE: That's probably a long-term concern. In the short term, Brad Kraft says he can't just pick up and move his factory from Juarez. He's only got a week of warning and no way of knowing how long these tariffs would last. KRAFT: So there's very little that we can do. DOMONOSKE: Just one thing, really - prepare to pay the tariff and raise prices as a result, a change which would be felt by U. S. consumers. Camila Domonoske, NPR News.

S. job market. Employers added just 75,000 jobs last month, which is well below analysts' expectations. And it's a significant slowdown from the two previous months. Wage growth also slowed a bit while the unemployment rate held steady at a low 3. 6%. NPR economics correspondent Scott Horsley is in the studio to talk about these numbers. Hi, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: Seems like not that long ago, you were right here in that same seat, probably talking about a blockbuster jobs number. So what happened? HORSLEY: A lot of people are going to be pointing to the ongoing trade war, Rachel. May is the month when President Trump ratcheted up his trade battle with China, boosting tariffs on some $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. Now, of course, we have the possibility of a new front in the trade war with Mexico. And all of this creates some uncertainty for business people, who are trying to make plans, trying to make investments, trying to make hiring decisions. Manufacturing, which is especially trade-sensitive, has seen slow job growth for a number of months now. And that continued in May, when we added just 3,000 factory jobs. Tim Quinlan, who is a senior economist at Wells Fargo, says that's consistent with some of the other indicators we've seen this week of a slowdown in the manufacturing sector. TIM QUINLAN: There's increasing evidence that the ongoing trade war here is beginning to have some tangible effects on the U. S. economy. HORSLEY: And we're also seeing a general slowdown in the much larger services sector. Private employers added just 82,000 service jobs last month. That's less than half the number they added the month before. And, Rachel, the Labor Department revised its job growth figures for March and April, down by a combined 75,000 jobs. So all around, this is a pretty weak employment report. MARTIN: Unemployment, though, is still near a 50-year low, so does that mean that workers can expect pay raises? HORSLEY: Wages are still going up, although not quite so fast as they had been. For the year ending last month, wage gains averaged 3. 1%. That's down just a tick from the 3. 2% figure we saw in April. One thing to keep in mind - part of the reason the unemployment rate is so low - near this 50-year low - is that a lot of people dropped out of the labor market in March and April. We saw labor force participation fall in those months by four-tenths of a percentage point, which is pretty significant. In May, the participation rate held steady, but we still have less than 63% of eligible workers actually working or looking for work. That's pretty low by historical standards. And so long as there's this sort of untapped army of people who are not working but could be, we may not see a lot more upward pressure on wages. MARTIN: How's this going to affect interest rates set by the Fed? HORSLEY: Well, the Federal Reserve's rate setting committee is set to meet less than two weeks, and this is going to raise the pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates - maybe not this month but sooner rather than later. The stock market is clearly anticipating a rate cut sometime in the near future, and that's contributed to the big rally we've seen on Wall Street this week.

President Trump is also visiting state today. On his itinerary, a tour of an ethanol plant in western Iowa and a GOP dinner near Des Moines. Just before leaving the White House, Trump talked about the political importance of this Midwestern battleground. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I won Iowa, as you know, by a lot. I have a great relationship with the farmers. I have a great relationship with everybody. I mean, Iowa, I think, is going to be something that we win very easily. KELLY: Trump has carefully cultivated the farm vote. But farmers in Iowa and neighboring states are facing big challenges this spring, challenges both natural and man-made. In a moment, we will hear from our reporter in the Midwest. First, we are joined by NPR economics correspondent Scott Horsley. Hey, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Hi. KELLY: So what kind of political climate is the president wading into in Iowa today? HORSLEY: Trump did win Iowa, as he said, by more than 9 points back in 2016. But just two years later, Democrats carried three of the state's four congressional districts. The president still has strong backing from Republicans in Iowa, as he does across the country. But there's no question farmers have been casualties of the president's trade war. A recent poll by Morning Consult found Trump's overall approval rating in the state is underwater by about 12 points. And of course, that's not all that's underwater. On Air Force One this afternoon, the president got an update on flood recovery efforts. And we're starting to see flood damage showing up in the national economic statistics. KELLY: So the president got a view of what we've all been watching; at least, we have photographs of these homes and businesses flooded and underwater. But you're hinting at a broader economic impact of all that water. HORSLEY: Right. White House economist Kevin Hassett says the flood may have contributed to that much weaker than expected jobs report we got last Friday. Remember the U. S. added just 75,000 jobs last month, less than half of what was expected. Hassett says, were it not for all the high water in the Midwest, we might have seen another 40,000 jobs added. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KEVIN HASSETT: The flooding of the Mississippi is a really, really serious thing that it closed I-29; a lot of the ports were closed. That's something that we would expect to bounce back as soon as the floods, God willing, recede. HORSLEY: In the meantime, though, the flooding has definitely put a damper on jobs. It's estimated, Mary Louise, that more than half a million jobs - about 550,000 - are tied directly or indirectly to barge traffic on big rivers like the Mississippi. These are major commercial arteries for big heavy stuff that has to get somewhere. And right now, a lot of that traffic's being disrupted because there's just too much water on the river. KELLY: And to the claim there that the White House - as Hassett was making about a rebound when the flooding recedes, God willing, as he put it, what is the forecast economically and actual water? HORSLEY: We have seen some improvement over the weekend, at least on the upper half of the Mississippi River. There's a hundred-mile stretch between Bellevue and Muscatine, Iowa, that's expected to reopen shortly. Upstream from St. Louis, the flood waters have crested now. But downstream, you're still getting more rain, more high water. I spoke to Deb Calhoun, who's with the Waterways Council. And she says there are parts of this liquid highway that just look like a parking lot. DEB CALHOUN: Barges everywhere with nowhere to go across the system. For farmers, they've sort of had a quadruple whammy, if you will. They can't get their fertilizer that moves upriver. They can't move their finished harvest from last season downriver. They have been unable to plant their corn and beans. And then, of course, the tariffs on soybeans are impacting farmers, as well. HORSLEY: Even when the floodwaters recede, there's going to be a lot of dredging necessary. And of course, that doesn't address the man-made challenges. KELLY: Thank you, Scott.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LARRY KUDLOW: You know how you get from here to there? You kick some butt. You kick some butt. CORNISH: That's not the kind of dry, technocratic language one usually associates with trade talks. But it's another example of how President Trump has turned to international commerce into a highly unusual spectator sport. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The next big matchup in the U. S. -China trade tussle is expected to be a face-off between President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. No formal meeting has been scheduled yet, but there's been plenty of buildup for the expected showdown at the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan, a week from Saturday. You could almost imagine a TV promotion. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (As announcer) Saturday, Saturday, Saturday - be ready for an epic pounding. HORSLEY: It's another high-stakes showcase, this \"Talka in Osaka,\" for a president who's managed to turn trade talks into must-see television - less WTO, more WWE - complete with heroes, villains, plot twists and plenty of trash talk. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (As announcer) Fight fans, are you ready? HORSLEY: Earlier this week, Trump declared that China, quote, \"ate the United States alive, economically\" before he took office. The president's retaliated with steep tariffs on Chinese imports. And he's threatened to go further if China won't throw in the towel. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: China wants to make a deal very badly. It's me right now that's holding up the deal. HORSLEY: Like last week's tariff battle with Mexico, the showdown with China has kept the president on the front page, sent shockwaves through the stock market and turned dusty rules of international commerce into a hot topic around the dinner table. MATTHEW SLAUGHTER: There'll be no shortage of conversations in the early summer barbecues for people looking at their portfolios. HORSLEY: Dartmouth economist Matthew Slaughter, who served in the George W. Bush White House, says Trump has managed to put trade front and center in the national conversation. And because the president himself is such a polarizing figure, he's managed to scramble the usual partisan cheering sections. Some Republicans are now defending tariffs and other protectionist measures while some Democrats are pushing in the opposite direction. SLAUGHTER: There's some Democrats who are now saying, boy, we need to be careful on levying these new trade barriers, and we need to worry about trade wars. The president and his policies are starting to muddy those waters again. HORSLEY: A Quinnipiac poll last month found more than half of all Americans disapprove of the president's handling of trade while just 39% approve. That poll was taken about a week after talks between the U. S. and China broke down and Trump boosted tariffs on some $250 billion worth of Chinese imports. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Right now China is paying us billions and billions of dollars. They never gave us 10 cents. HORSLEY: Never mind that most economists say those tariffs are largely paid by American businesses and consumers or that China has raised tariffs of its own on U. S. exports. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow talked about the standoff today at a pro-trade think tank here in Washington. Kudlow calls himself a free trader but says he's come around to the president's view that tariffs can be a useful economic weapon. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KUDLOW: It's a negotiating tool, but it's not a bluff. As you've seen, he will actually execute or implement tariffs. HORSLEY: A member of the audience asked Kudlow, what happens if Trump's tariffs don't deliver a knockout punch? What if instead the two sides settle into a costly, rope-a-dope trade war? Kudlow didn't have a ready answer for that. A senior fellow at the think tank observed that for much of the last century, the U. S. has gone largely unchallenged in the global ring. In China, it's finally facing another economic heavyweight. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:   White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said today that the Trump administration is determined to make China play by the rules of international trade. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LARRY KUDLOW: You know how you get from here to there? You kick some butt. You kick some butt. CORNISH: That's not the kind of dry, technocratic language one usually associates with trade talks. But it's another example of how President Trump has turned to international commerce into a highly unusual spectator sport. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The next big matchup in the U. S. -China trade tussle is expected to be a face-off between President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. No formal meeting has been scheduled yet, but there's been plenty of buildup for the expected showdown at the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan, a week from Saturday. You could almost imagine a TV promotion. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (As announcer) Saturday, Saturday, Saturday - be ready for an epic pounding. HORSLEY: It's another high-stakes showcase, this \"Talka in Osaka,\" for a president who's managed to turn trade talks into must-see television - less WTO, more WWE - complete with heroes, villains, plot twists and plenty of trash talk. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (As announcer) Fight fans, are you ready? HORSLEY: Earlier this week, Trump declared that China, quote, \"ate the United States alive, economically\" before he took office. The president's retaliated with steep tariffs on Chinese imports. And he's threatened to go further if China won't throw in the towel. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: China wants to make a deal very badly. It's me right now that's holding up the deal. HORSLEY: Like last week's tariff battle with Mexico, the showdown with China has kept the president on the front page, sent shockwaves through the stock market and turned dusty rules of international commerce into a hot topic around the dinner table. MATTHEW SLAUGHTER: There'll be no shortage of conversations in the early summer barbecues for people looking at their portfolios. HORSLEY: Dartmouth economist Matthew Slaughter, who served in the George W. Bush White House, says Trump has managed to put trade front and center in the national conversation. And because the president himself is such a polarizing figure, he's managed to scramble the usual partisan cheering sections. Some Republicans are now defending tariffs and other protectionist measures while some Democrats are pushing in the opposite direction. SLAUGHTER: There's some Democrats who are now saying, boy, we need to be careful on levying these new trade barriers, and we need to worry about trade wars. The president and his policies are starting to muddy those waters again. HORSLEY: A Quinnipiac poll last month found more than half of all Americans disapprove of the president's handling of trade while just 39% approve. That poll was taken about a week after talks between the U. S. and China broke down and Trump boosted tariffs on some $250 billion worth of Chinese imports. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Right now China is paying us billions and billions of dollars. They never gave us 10 cents. HORSLEY: Never mind that most economists say those tariffs are largely paid by American businesses and consumers or that China has raised tariffs of its own on U. S. exports. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow talked about the standoff today at a pro-trade think tank here in Washington. Kudlow calls himself a free trader but says he's come around to the president's view that tariffs can be a useful economic weapon. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KUDLOW: It's a negotiating tool, but it's not a bluff. As you've seen, he will actually execute or implement tariffs. HORSLEY: A member of the audience asked Kudlow, what happens if Trump's tariffs don't deliver a knockout punch? What if instead the two sides settle into a costly, rope-a-dope trade war?

We've heard this before. What you might not know is that within the next few years, China is predicted to become the largest theme park market on Earth. Ride manufactures in the U.

And some American companies are feeling squeezed. KUER's Rebecca Ellis reports. REBECCA ELLIS, BYLINE: Pretend you're a bullet hanging out in the barrel of a gun. The trigger's pulled, and then - boom - you're hurled into the air at turbo speed. Zero to 80 miles in two seconds - that's what being on a roller coaster made by S&S Worldwide is like. These organ-jumbling rides have turned the northern Utah company into one of the largest amusement ride manufacturers in the country. Earlier in May, Preston Perkes, an executive director at S&S, was overseeing roller coasters bound for. . . PRESTON PERKES: Dubai, New Jersey, Pittsburgh, Chicago and China. ELLIS: In the center of the factory sit two massive white steel pulleys, part of a $16 million ride going up in eastern China's newest military-themed amusement park, Sun Tzu Cultural Park. Soon, a truck will cart off these pulleys to Los Angeles. They'll cross the Pacific in an ocean container and arrive at the Qingdao port southeast of Beijing. That's when the customer will have to pay a tariff of a little over 25%. Perkes says there's going to be some sticker shock. PERKES: Never would they have thought that they would have to pay such a high duty and tax. ELLIS: Just like soybeans, cars, lithium batteries and thousands of other goods, roller coasters have gotten caught up in the escalating trade war between the U. S. and China. Since last fall, Beijing has hiked up the tariff on American-made amusement rides twice, potentially costing customers in China more than a million dollars in extra fees. It's enough, Perkes says, for some buyer's remorse to creep in. PERKES: And when our customers are having to pay more money because of a added tariff, they're going to look other places, and that's what they've done. ELLIS: This year, only one Chinese customer has reached out to purchase a ride. In past years, Perkes says, about half of their business came from China. John Gerner is a managing director of Leisure Business Advisors. In China, he says, American companies are known as the go-to guys for high-tech rides - pricey, but worth it. JOHN GERNER: And so they've been able to compete on the value of innovation, quality, intellectual property, characters and brands. ELLIS: If the new tariffs stay in place, Gerner warns, American rides could lose their appeal, as Chinese companies are encouraged to buy Chinese. Dave Tolman is a ride packager at the company, one of its hundred or so employees. He says it's not just the Chinese duties that have made the trade war such a bumpy ride for S&S. DAVE TOLMAN: The tariffs on steel and aluminum affect us in this business a real big amount. That's, you know, two of the main things that we use. ELLIS: Since last March, when the Trump administration announced tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, the price of the metal parts used by S&S has risen by as much as 70%. Perkes says they had to rethink parts of their supply chain, seeking out cheaper steel for the ties that hold roller coaster tracks together and for the walkways for ride maintenance. PERKES: We have to change our country of origin. We have to build things in other countries to avoid the tariffs. ELLIS: Since the metal tariffs were imposed last year, he says, that work is now done closer to much of their customer base - in China. For NPR News, I'm Rebecca Ellis in Salt Lake City.

S. footwear companies. That's because most of the shoes sold here are made in China. Even more of those shoes have parts from China. NPR's Alina Selyukh has been wondering could America ever make its own shoes again? ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: Douglas Clark has been asking this question for decades. In the '80s, he worked for Nike as factories closed all around him in the Northeast. DOUGLAS CLARK: I'll tell you, one of the darkest parts of being at Nike was when I watched domestic manufacturing evaporate and everything go to Asia. SELYUKH: Where labor was much cheaper. What followed was a mass exodus. If you chart jobs in footwear manufacturing in the U. S. , the graph has the curve of a stiletto, a steep slope through the '90s before it levels out around fewer than 13,000 jobs in the past decade. CLARK: As a true Yankee, (laughter), and my father was the colonial historian, you know, it was heartbreaking. SELYUKH: Clark would go on to a long career in footwear - at Converse, Reebok, Timberland then his own line of shoes at New England Footwear - and eight years devoted to one mission. CLARK: Not only can we create a model for how footwear can be made back in the U. S. in a profitable way, but that that model could transfer to all the other lost industries that have left the U. S. SELYUKH: This was a tall order. At a time when the president speaks of rebuilding American manufacturing, footwear is a telling example of how hard it is to turn back time. These days, 99% of shoes sold in the U. S. are imported from countries like China, Vietnam, Indonesia. And that's the number that Clark was going up against when he went after the main reason why shoemakers left in the first place - labor costs. Here's Mike Jeppesen, head of global operations at Wolverine Worldwide, which owns brands like Merrill, Sperry and Keds. MIKE JEPPESEN: Our actual cost price in making the shoes is somewhere around $16 an hour. When we are sourcing from China today, that price is about $3 an hour. SELYUKH: More than five times more, a cost that ends up quadrupling after wholesale and retail markups. JEPPESEN: So that's a $50 price difference between a pair of shoes made in the U. S. and a pair of shoes made in China. Simple as that. SELYUKH: That's why the mass market companies, especially athletic shoes and women's fashion shoes, have focused their U. S. operations more on design and marketing, leaving all the cutting and gluing and stitching to manufacturers overseas. So Clark focused on automating and simplifying this labor-intensive work. CLARK: Instead of a shoe being made of 55 parts, we had a shoe that was made of 10, or 11 or 12 parts. SELYUKH: To be clear, shoe-making never entirely left America. But it's down to some 200 factories. The majority of them employ fewer than 10 people. For many, the U. S. military is the main customer, which has to buy made-in-the-U. S. A. But outside of that, large shoe companies will say there's little commercial reason for them to manufacture here. Smaller ones say they stay because they found a unique niche, or want to carry on the tradition or take a stand against the environmental impact of trans-Pacific shipping. To make it work, these firms rely on their shoppers choosing to pay more for bespoke quality and the made-in-America brand. NANCY RICHARDSON: We know that we can't make a $19 shoe to be sold at Target or Walmart. That's just not going to be possible for us. SELYUKH: Nancy Richardson is CEO of SAS. (SOUNDBITE OF FACTORY MACHINERY NOISE)SELYUKH: It's a mid-sized company that's been making shoes in San Antonio since the '70s, still starting the traditional way, carving the shape of a foot into wooden block called the last. (SOUNDBITE OF HAMMERING ON WOOD)SELYUKH: SAS shoes cost around $150 to $200. And the biggest challenge for SAS is finding workers. RICHARDSON: At one time in the U. S. , you might have put an ad and gotten 200 resumes. Today, you might get a handful of people. SELYUKH: U. S. factories rarely get applicants under 40. Arthritis is a common struggle. As shoe-making jobs disappeared, so did the support system. Suppliers of things like metal parts or colorful leather followed the industry overseas. Doug Clark, on his mission to return mainstream manufacturing to America, knew all this. But he also knew that history was already starting to repeat itself in China, too. Wages have been going up. Footwear companies have been moving, again chasing lower costs. This could be the opportunity for America's comeback, Clark thought. But for it to work, you need robots. A few years back, he got a contract with a big brand and a grant to make shoe manufacturing less manual starting with the top parts. CLARK: The first thing we did was we basically developed ways to make uppers that didn't involve a lot of labor. SELYUKH: Footwear manufacturing has long included machines cutting or gluing soles. But higher-level innovation? Ironically, factory owners I spoke with said that's happening where the industry is, overseas. Major brands like Nike and Adidas have been developing new technologies, including in the U. S. , but they still rely heavily on factory workers abroad. Because unlike humans, robots aren't nimble. They can't notice imperfections or quickly switch to a new fashion style. CLARK: Robots are not forgiving. SELYUKH: For Clark, the story had a frustrating end. Developing automation got very expensive and slower than expected. He ran out of money and sold his factory to a technology company which knew a lot about robots. The factory is now closed. Clark hoped his legacy would be reviving American shoe manufacturing. Instead, he's now in real estate. Alina Selyukh, NPR News.

It looks like a candid shot, but if you hit like, leave a comment and tag a friend, you can get three different blends of brew for free. GRETCHEN ALTMAN: They approached me, and I sent them my rate sheet. I sent them an invoice. And we agreed on a set number of posts. GARSD: Altman's is going rate is $300 to $800 to promote something. She does some posts in exchange for free goods, she says, as long as it's stuff she believes in. Altman doesn't have the 140 million Instagram followers of Kim Kardashian. She has around 6,000. That makes her a micro-influencer. ALTMAN: I'm just living a normal life, and people relate to that. They just feel like I'm a friend of theirs. GARSD: Bonnie Patten, the executive director of Truth In Advertising, says. . . BONNIE PATTEN: It works. Consumers are very apt to buy things that they see being promoted on social media, especially by people they feel they have some sort of authentic, natural connection with. GARSD: This worries Patten and consumer rights groups. Several recent studies have found that young audiences are largely unable to understand when something is sponsored content. (SOUNDBITE OF AD)JONATHAN VAN NESS: Do you know a woman who needs a brand-new wardrobe all year long? GARSD: In this Instagram post, Jonathan Van Ness, star of Netflix's \"Queer Eye,\" is excited about a clothing rental service. (SOUNDBITE OF AD)VAN NESS: We're going to try on clothes. We're doing the most. We're doing everything. Love you, guys. Happy Holidays. Yas (ph). GARSD: In this case, Van Ness' post is clearly labeled as an advertisement. But what happens when it's an everyday person with just a couple thousand followers? PATTEN: The problem with a lot of these social media posts is that you don't know whether it's an ad or not. GARSD: What Patten wants is transparency in social media advertising. That nutritional shake, that tooth whitener that will make you look like a Cheshire cat - Patten wants influencers to be clear that they're getting paid to recommend it, which means including the hashtag #advertisement or #sponsoredcontent. Ultimately, consumer advocates say the buck stops with the Federal Trade Commission, the FTC, which several watchdog groups say has done little in terms of enforcement. PATTEN: Unfortunately, the FTC does not have the resources to police social media platforms to the extent necessary. GARSD: NPR reached out to the FTC, who referred us to their guidelines. If you're getting paid to promote, quote, \"then a disclosure is appropriate,\" end quote. To be clear, Gretchen Altman is diligent about using those hashtags. She loves what she does and sees it as a business. She doesn't necessarily want to be a social media celebrity. ALTMAN: With social media being so integrated into our everyday lives, we have this unique opportunity that I don't think anyone has ever had before, where we can each be our own brand. GARSD: For many, the very idea of everyday people becoming brands sounds like a nightmare capitalist dystopia. Professor Saleem Alhabash teaches public relations and social media at Michigan State University. He says there are bigger implications to this. When the lines between what is real life and what is marketing get blurred, it changes people's behaviors. SALEEM ALHABASH: You always need to be doing something exciting - taking pictures of your food, taking pictures of your feet by the beach. It becomes so important for people to be liked and appreciated that they always have to almost live another person's life. GARSD: He, like many, wonders, what are we buying into when we're all trying to sell something? Jasmine Garsd, NPR News, New York. (SOUNDBITE OF '80'S CHILD'S \"I CANT GO 4 THAT\") MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   Today on All Tech Considered, living in a world where anyone can be a social media influencer. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KELLY: Influencing took off years ago, with reality stars such as the Kardashians leading the way.

But much of the focus will be on the G-2, the United States and China. President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have a chance to diffuse their ongoing trade war, or possibly to escalate it. NPR's Scott Horsley has the story. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Summits like the G-20 are often a chance for geopolitical speed dating. President Trump has meetings scheduled with at least eight world leaders over the next three days. But none is more consequential than his sit-down Saturday with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Two big, very different personalities jockeying for global power and economic might with hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of trade on the line. Matthew Goodman, who served in both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, says the talks could go either way. MATTHEW GOODMAN: They may have an incentive to do a deal and shake hands. I think that's the least likely outcome. The other extreme is that they have a breakdown and they decide they're going to escalate further. That's possible, but I think also not the most likely. HORSLEY: Like many observers, Goodman thinks the likeliest course is a temporary truce that leaves existing tariffs in place but postpones additional taxes on Chinese imports while the two sides go back to the bargaining table. David Dollar, who focused on China at the Treasury Department and the World Bank, agrees. Although Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, Dollar says that would be costly for both countries. DAVID DOLLAR: At the minimum, I think it's in the U. S. interest to hold off on the next round of tariffs 'cause I think that's going to have a fairly serious effect on the U. S. economy and a bad effect on markets. HORSLEY: The stock market breathed a sigh of relief last week when Trump said he had a very good telephone conversation with Xi. Still, Dollar says, it's doubtful the two countries can quickly nail down an agreement that would address all the U. S. concerns around intellectual property protection and China's forced transfer of American know-how. DOLLAR: I just don't see how that can be negotiated in the next couple of days. HORSLEY: The White House also downplayed expectations for the Xi meeting, saying Trump is comfortable with any outcome. Ordinarily, the U. S. could expect some support from allies around the G-20 table, many of whom share Washington's concerns about China. But Michael Green of the Center for Strategic and International Studies says Trump has pursued a go-it-alone strategy while simultaneously picking fights with Europe, Japan and neighbors in North America. MICHAEL GREEN: What we're doing is we're saying loudly that we're the sheriff, and there's a bad guy at the end of the street and we're going to get him. You know, we're calling the posse together, which would be Japan and Europe, and then we're shooting at them. HORSLEY: Far from rallying the international community, Trump often thumbs his nose at it. In fact, it's not clear the president will even go along with the traditional joint statement at the end of the G-20 summit if other countries insist on including tough warnings about protectionism or the dangers of manmade climate change. That could be awkward for Japan, which is hosting the summit. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has frequently courted Trump both on and off the golf course. Mireya Solis of the Brookings Institution says Abe will try to preserve a veneer of international cooperation. MIREYA SOLIS: He wants to have a functional G-20. But with a very unconventional president and outspoken critic, I think that's going to be an uphill battle. HORSLEY: Abe will hold his own one-on-one meeting with Trump where they'll discuss a possible U. S. -Japan trade agreement. Trump's withdrawal from a big Asia-Pacific trade pact has left U. S. exporters at a disadvantage in Japan. Trump wants to strike a new bargain. If that fails, he's held out the threat of steep tariffs on Japanese cars. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington.

What's more surprising is that some of those millionaires and billionaires are calling for a wealth tax themselves. One of those people is Abigail Disney. Her grandfather was Roy Disney, co-founder of the multibillion-dollar entertainment company. And she has been speaking out on the issue of income inequality. She is here with us in our New York studio. Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. ABIGAIL DISNEY: I'm glad to be here. SHAPIRO: You were one of 18 people in the top one-tenth of 1% who signed a letter supporting a wealth tax for households with $50 million or more in assets. Just briefly, why? DISNEY: Well, nothing in history ever moved forward just because people advocated for their own interests. Things really change when people are traitors to their class. And my class needs some really good traitors these days. SHAPIRO: Have you been treated as a traitor for signing this letter? DISNEY: Oh, my goodness gracious, yes. SHAPIRO: Really? DISNEY: But, you know, it is just really important. We're not in a democracy all assigned with the task of advocating for ourselves. We're assigned with the task of trying to create the best and strongest and fairest country we can create. And what I've watched over the last 30 years is rich people going from terribly rich to awfully rich to obscenely and insanely rich. And we have to draw a line. SHAPIRO: If you and your cohort of wealthy individuals gave your money to philanthropic causes instead of being taxed, you could direct it to education or homelessness or whatever your cause may be. Why would you rather see it go to the federal government? DISNEY: Here's the world I want to live in. I want to live in a world that doesn't need philanthropy. And if Jeff Bezos earned less and paid his people more and didn't have $37 billion to put into a philanthropy and figure out what to do with, there really wouldn't be that much of the philanthropy that was needed. I would rather not to be needed as a philanthropist. And I will never stop feeding the hungry and housing the homeless and all the other things that I want to do. But I would so much prefer that public schools function, that roads don't break your axles, you know, that people have health care - which they have a right to have - that low-income people who work full-time at minimum wage don't need food stamps to get through their days. That's the world I want to live in. SHAPIRO: On an issue that is related but separate, I want to ask about your very public criticism of the current CEO of Disney for his compensation package. You have no formal role with the Disney Company. For people who have not been following this very public back-and-forth, what is the nut of your critique here? DISNEY: The nut of my critique is that I know that company pretty well? Obviously, it's a big, sophisticated company. And it's grown a lot since I, you know, worked sort of in a way with it. When you're in what is setting up to be the largest media and entertainment conglomerate on the planet in the history of the world. . . SHAPIRO: Because of its merger with Fox. DISNEY: Right. And when you have record profits, when your stocks are at record highs and you're going home with obscene amounts of money - and I have no objection to obscene amounts of money in and of themselves. My objection is you have $15-an-hour workers who cannot buy enough food to eat. They are rationing their insulin. They are sleeping in their cars. How do you jibe one thing with the other? When you're running such an enormous conglomerate, can you not break from orthodoxy? What if you made less money and everybody else made some more? You don't have to create a foundation to go feed those hungry people because you've paid them fairly. SHAPIRO: When you give those examples of people rationing insulin and sleeping in their cars, is that something that you are specifically literally aware Disney employees are doing? Or is this just a hypothetical? DISNEY: I have literally sat in a room with the people who pour your soda and the people who clean your room and scrape gum off the sidewalks who have told me, I have to ration my insulin. I have sat with them. And I have felt a kind of rage that I don't even know how to describe to you. Those were the people that I was taught to revere. You know, so I'm not really in fact in the business of just attacking Disney because, you know, I can attack Disney. Look. I know that if I say something about Disney, people pay more attention. I could say something about IBM. I could say something about Walmart. I could say something about a lot of things. Nobody would care. And the fact is Disney is kind of like the last shameable (ph) company in a lot of ways. SHAPIRO: What do you mean by that? DISNEY: It's a different kind of brand. This is a brand people feel actual love for. I mean, I use the word love very mindfully here - love. And when somebody loves something, they expect more of it than just the minimum-allowable legal thing. And so when you say to somebody about the Disney brand, the people pouring your soda cannot afford their insulin, and the man in charge of them is coming home with nine-figure paycheck, they do feel an outrage that is very visceral. And I think that given that there are so few companies that can be shamed anymore, this is a really important place to start a bigger, broader conversation about all of these companies where, you know, the thing is that Bob Iger is kind of a nice guy. He really is a nice guy. And everybody around him are nice people. What has become thought of as normal and the kind of thing nice people do isn't nice. And somebody has to say the emperor is wearing no clothes, somebody just has to say it. SHAPIRO: I'm thinking of how this story would be told in a Disney film about the granddaughter of the co-founder turning against the empire. DISNEY: Well, you know what I'm doing? I'm turning against the empire itself. You know, it's like the empire went off in its own direction. It's almost unrecognizable to me now. And we have no family engagement on the company anymore. There's nobody from the family on the board. It's still my name. You know, and I still use my credit card. And I still feel all that comes with that and the expectations. And people still say to me, you must have had such a happy childhood. Oh, how wonderful the gifts your grandfather and uncle gave to the world. Those are very lovely feelings. And if I am welcoming to those kinds of receptions, I also have an obligation to attend to the rest of the ways in which it's not engaging with the world in a good way. And it's actively promoting something that's really deleterious, not just to the low-income people. They're destroying class, and they're having a go at democracy itself. SHAPIRO: Is that overstating it, though? Destroying the middle class and having a go at democracy itself is, I mean, almost apocalyptic language. DISNEY: Yes, I was raised by an Irish Catholic woman, so I don't go anywhere short of apocalypse. SHAPIRO: I was struck by something you said in a Washington Post op-ed, and I'm paraphrasing here that if your last name were Procter or Gamble, people would not respond your message in the same way. DISNEY: Yeah. SHAPIRO: What do you mean by that? DISNEY: Because Procter & Gamble don't make people all warm and fuzzy. People get warm and fuzzy when they talk to me, and I love that. That's the best part of my life. You know, I have my quibbles with the history of the company and the princesses or the rest of it. But, you know, I've traveled everywhere in the world, and everywhere you go, you find a hand-drawn painting of Mickey Mouse on the side of a children's school. I mean, I've seen this everywhere. He has jumped out of the celluloid. And he exists. And he is a citizen of the world. And everybody understands what he means and what he's for. This is not true of any other brand that I can think of. And so we have a special responsibility, and that's why I feel the weight of this. When I went last year and met with the workers at Disneyland, I could not shed the weight I was carrying once I went home from there. I couldn't say nothing. SHAPIRO: Filmmaker and activist Abigail Disney. Thank you very much. DISNEY: Thank you. SHAPIRO: The Walt Disney Company has responded to Abigail Disney's criticisms. In a statement, the company says, Disney offers a workforce education program that covers college tuition and child care for Disney workers. And the statement says continuing education, quote, \"is widely recognized as the best way to create economic opportunity for employees and empower upward mobility. \" ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  It's no surprise that a strong majority of Americans supports a wealth tax - a higher tax rate for a small number of millionaires and billionaires.

And people still say to me, you must have had such a happy childhood. Oh, how wonderful the gifts your grandfather and uncle gave to the world. Those are very lovely feelings. And if I am welcoming to those kinds of receptions, I also have an obligation to attend to the rest of the ways in which it's not engaging with the world in a good way. And it's actively promoting something that's really deleterious, not just to the low-income people. They're destroying class, and they're having a go at democracy itself. SHAPIRO: Is that overstating it, though? Destroying the middle class and having a go at democracy itself is, I mean, almost apocalyptic language. DISNEY: Yes, I was raised by an Irish Catholic woman, so I don't go anywhere short of apocalypse. SHAPIRO: I was struck by something you said in a Washington Post op-ed, and I'm paraphrasing here that if your last name were Procter or Gamble, people would not respond your message in the same way. DISNEY: Yeah. SHAPIRO: What do you mean by that? DISNEY: Because Procter & Gamble don't make people all warm and fuzzy. People get warm and fuzzy when they talk to me, and I love that. That's the best part of my life. You know, I have my quibbles with the history of the company and the princesses or the rest of it. But, you know, I've traveled everywhere in the world, and everywhere you go, you find a hand-drawn painting of Mickey Mouse on the side of a children's school. I mean, I've seen this everywhere. He has jumped out of the celluloid. And he exists. And he is a citizen of the world. And everybody understands what he means and what he's for. This is not true of any other brand that I can think of. And so we have a special responsibility, and that's why I feel the weight of this. When I went last year and met with the workers at Disneyland, I could not shed the weight I was carrying once I went home from there. I couldn't say nothing. SHAPIRO: Filmmaker and activist Abigail Disney. Thank you very much. DISNEY: Thank you. SHAPIRO: The Walt Disney Company has responded to Abigail Disney's criticisms. In a statement, the company says, Disney offers a workforce education program that covers college tuition and child care for Disney workers. And the statement says continuing education, quote, \"is widely recognized as the best way to create economic opportunity for employees and empower upward mobility. \"", "section": "National", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.

With a campaign for the upcoming presidential election already underway, you can expect the state of the economy to get a lot of attention. And one of the tools economists use to predict whether a recession is coming is the yield curve, so we want to tell you what that is and why it matters. We've called Campbell Harvey for that. He's a professor of finance at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University, and he was the first to demonstrate that the yield curve can predict a recession. Professor Harvey also says he only considers the indicator definitive if the inverted yield curve lasts for an entire quarter. And, well, the quarter ends today, so here to give us his thoughts about what's to come is professor Campbell Harvey. Welcome. Thank you so much for joining us. CAMPBELL HARVEY: Great to be on the show. MARTIN: All right. So let's get the headline, and then we'll work backwards. Are we going into a recession? HARVEY: The yield curve has inverted for a full quarter, and that has been associated with predicting a recession for the last seven recessions. So from 1960s, this indicator has been reliable in terms of foretelling a recession. And also, importantly, it has not given any false signals yet. MARTIN: So that would mean yes (laughter). HARVEY: That means yes. MARTIN: OK. So let me break down - let me ask you to break down what that means. What is the yield curve, and what does it mean when it's inverted? HARVEY: So the yield curve represents interest rates at different maturities. So usually, it's the case that a longer-term interest rate has a higher rate than a short-term interest rate. So think of a certificate of deposit at your bank. If you lock your money up for five years, you expect to get a higher rate than, let's say, locking it up for six months. But in certain rare situations, things get backwards, and it turns out that the long-term interest rate is lower than the short-term rate. And that's called an inverted yield curve. That's exactly the situation we've got right now. And it is a harbinger of bad news. MARTIN: So unemployment is at a 50-year low. The GDP is growing. Does that have an effect on the yield curve? HARVEY: So what happens to GDP in the first quarter - that is the past. Corporate earnings, whatever they are - that's the past. Unemployment is a classic lagging indicator. So yes, the economy looks good right now, but the yield curve - the beauty of the yield curve is that it's about the future. It reflects the future, and it captures the expectations of the broad market in terms of what might happen in the future. MARTIN: So before we let you go - and I apologize if this is kind of reductionist, but this is something that journalists are always accused of all the time, so I'm going to ask. Is there any risk of this being a self-fulfilling prophecy? Is there any validity to the idea that if you, you know, believe that a recession is coming that you could actually in some way influence that it will? Is there any validity to that at all? Not that it's going to change our reporting on what - the facts. But I have to ask. HARVEY: Sure. And it's a great question. When I originally published my research, nobody much noticed the yield curve. But then it got a considerable profile in predicting the global financial crisis. So now it's on the radar screen. My model is not a model that says the yield curve causes a recession. It is a model that says, well, there's information in the yield curve that can help you forecast a recession. But the idea of self-fulfilling prophecy essentially perhaps makes it causal - that people see this red flag. They know its reliability, and they are more cautious. So think of a company - major expansion, need to borrow money to build a new plant. The yield curve inverts, and they say, well, let's wait. Or a consumer going on a big vacation where you know that you need to borrow on the credit card. Yield curve inverts - well, maybe we should defer that expensive vacation. So I look at it more in terms of risk management. This is an important piece of information that helps people plan. It helps corporations plan. And if you can be prudent, you avoid the situation where, oh, you go ahead and build that plant, you borrow the money, we go into recession, and you're out of business, and people are laid off. So I believe that this indicator gives people the ability to do prudent risk management and enhances the possibility that we have a soft landing, not a hard landing like the global financial crisis. MARTIN: That was Campbell Harvey. He is a professor of finance at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University and a research associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Mass. You heard the man.

President Trump announced two new picks for the central bank's governing board this week - this after the president's last two choices backed out amid criticism they were too political. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: President Trump announced his nominees to help steer the Fed in a series of tweets Tuesday night. The first is a fairly conventional choice. Christopher Waller's a former economics professor at Notre Dame who's now the director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank in St. Louis. It was Trump's second pick, Judy Shelton, who raised eyebrows. ALAN BLINDER: I think when you mention her name to a mainstream economist, the first thing they think about is the gold standard. HORSLEY: That's not a compliment. Former Fed Vice Chairman Alan Blinder says advocating for a return to the gold standard, as Shelton does, is well outside the mainstream. BLINDER: To say it went out with high-button shoes is far too charitable. It's a completely crazy idea. HORSLEY: Blinder says tying the dollar to a fixed amount of gold would limit the overall money supply to whatever miners happened to dig out of the ground. Still, he's not terribly worried about Sheldon actually imposing the gold standard even if she wins a seat on the Fed's seven-member governing board. BLINDER: I think most everybody else around the table would look at her political attitudes as if she landed from Mars. HORSLEY: James Pethokoukis of the American Enterprise Institute is not so confident. He warns if Shelton makes it onto the Fed board and President Trump is reelected, she could be in line to replace Jerome Powell when his term as chairman expires in 2022. JAMES PETHOKOUKIS: Given her views about the gold standard and given her criticism of the Fed's extraordinary actions during the financial crisis, what would happen if Judy Shelton was head of the Fed during another financial crisis? I think that's really unclear, and it's worrisome. HORSLEY: During the Great Recession, Shelton criticized the Fed for its efforts to prop up the economy. Now, she takes the opposite tack. Even though unemployment's as low as it's been in nearly 50 years, Shelton echoes Trump's call for a cut in interest rates. Here she is on CNBC. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JUDY SHELTON: The last thing you want to do is starve a high-growth productive economic trend by not providing the financial resources. HORSLEY: Shelton did not respond to an interview request. Experts can certainly disagree about Fed policy and whether interest rates are too high or too low. But chief economist Diane Swonk of Grant Thornton says Shelton's views seem to be driven less by economic conditions and more by which political party controls the White House. DIANE SWONK: She's done a 180 on many of her views, and when they do a 180 on their views like that, they seem to be politically motivated instead of economically motivated.

U. S. employers added a net 224,000 jobs in June. That is far more than many analysts were expecting and also a sharp improvement over a disappointing May. NPR chief economic correspondent Scott Horsley is working on the job numbers, and he's here. Good morning, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: Does this mean that May was just a blip? HORSLEY: This is a reminder, Steve, of why we always say, don't put too much stock in any one month's datapoint. Watch for the larger. . . INSKEEP: No pun intended on the stock thing there. HORSLEY: That's right. INSKEEP: Go on. Go on, please. HORSLEY: Watch for the longer trend, you know? It's interesting. Actually, the number for May was actually revised even lower today, so it looks like there really was a slowdown in the month of May. But hiring bounced back strongly in June. So if we look at the longer trend, the average over the last three months is now about 171,000 jobs being added each month. That's roughly where we were at the beginning of the year, although it's still kind of a slowdown from the pace of hiring we saw at the end of 2018. You would expect to see some slowdown in hiring at this late stage in what is now a record-long economic expansion, but it's looking more like a sort of gentle deceleration, rather than an economy that's slamming on the brakes. INSKEEP: One-seventy-one per month on average, so pretty good - not amazing, but pretty good job growth. Unemployment, we should note, is now 3. 7% - still fairly low. Where are the jobs being added? HORSLEY: We saw a rebound in June in manufacturing and transportation. That's interesting because those are sectors that are especially sensitive to trade-related disruptions. Seventeen thousand new factory jobs were added last month, about 24,000 transportation and warehousing jobs. That shows some resilience, even with all the trade friction we've been going through. We should say the June report covers a week in the middle of June, so it's after the threat of tariffs on Mexico was relieved, but before this latest meeting between President Trump and Xi Jinping that dialed down tensions with China. INSKEEP: Oh. A week, you're saying, because they take a slice of the month, and they survey that slice. . . HORSLEY: The June number reflects a week in the middle of the month. That's right. We also saw some gains in government jobs last month. That may reflect the census. We saw big gains in health care. But we saw a decline, once again, in the retail sector. INSKEEP: This is going to become a matter of some political discussion, so just give us your best estimate that you can. You said 17,000 new factory jobs amid the president's trade war and other things. People will be wondering, is there a way to draw a connection between higher tariffs and more manufacturing jobs? The president's theory has been more things will be made at home. HORSLEY: Well, this follows, though, several months of flat or down jobs in the factory sector. So it's. . . INSKEEP: Oh. So, again, we should look at the longer trend. . . HORSLEY: Exactly. INSKEEP: . . . And it doesn't look so great. Now, the president has been pushing the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to rev up the economy. How does this affect his argument when we find out that the job market is not doing so badly? HORSLEY: This is going to make the Fed's job a little trickier. Last month when the Fed gathered, they decided to hold off on lowering interest rates, even though they acknowledged there were some worrisome signs on the economic horizon. Officials said they wanted to see more data. The jobs report is one datapoint that they keep an eye on. They also watch inflation, all sorts of other clues. And not all those arrows are pointing in the same direction right now. This arrow, though, is definitely saying the economy is in pretty good shape. That's going to weigh against a cut in interest rates when the Fed meets later this month. As a result, Steve, we could see one of those perverse reactions in the stock market to this very solid and encouraging jobs number. A month ago when we got a lousy jobs number, the stock market rallied because investors were betting, OK, now the Fed's going to cut interest rates. This very good jobs number may have the opposite effect. If investors decide, OK, now the Fed is going to be less likely to cut interest rates, we could actually see a drop in the stock market. INSKEEP: And just to be really clear here, it sounds like the choice for the Fed right now is between leaving interest rates alone or cutting them. The idea of raising interest rates is not really on the table. The economy is not that strong at the moment. HORSLEY: Correct. INSKEEP: Scott, thanks very much for the update. HORSLEY: You're welcome. INSKEEP: That's NPR chief economics correspondent Scott Horsley. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   The job market accelerated last month. U.

INSKEEP: No pun intended on the stock thing there. HORSLEY: That's right. INSKEEP: Go on. Go on, please. HORSLEY: Watch for the longer trend, you know? It's interesting. Actually, the number for May was actually revised even lower today, so it looks like there really was a slowdown in the month of May. But hiring bounced back strongly in June. So if we look at the longer trend, the average over the last three months is now about 171,000 jobs being added each month. That's roughly where we were at the beginning of the year, although it's still kind of a slowdown from the pace of hiring we saw at the end of 2018. You would expect to see some slowdown in hiring at this late stage in what is now a record-long economic expansion, but it's looking more like a sort of gentle deceleration, rather than an economy that's slamming on the brakes. INSKEEP: One-seventy-one per month on average, so pretty good - not amazing, but pretty good job growth. Unemployment, we should note, is now 3. 7% - still fairly low. Where are the jobs being added? HORSLEY: We saw a rebound in June in manufacturing and transportation. That's interesting because those are sectors that are especially sensitive to trade-related disruptions. Seventeen thousand new factory jobs were added last month, about 24,000 transportation and warehousing jobs. That shows some resilience, even with all the trade friction we've been going through. We should say the June report covers a week in the middle of June, so it's after the threat of tariffs on Mexico was relieved, but before this latest meeting between President Trump and Xi Jinping that dialed down tensions with China. INSKEEP: Oh. A week, you're saying, because they take a slice of the month, and they survey that slice. . . HORSLEY: The June number reflects a week in the middle of the month. That's right. We also saw some gains in government jobs last month. That may reflect the census. We saw big gains in health care. But we saw a decline, once again, in the retail sector. INSKEEP: This is going to become a matter of some political discussion, so just give us your best estimate that you can. You said 17,000 new factory jobs amid the president's trade war and other things. People will be wondering, is there a way to draw a connection between higher tariffs and more manufacturing jobs? The president's theory has been more things will be made at home. HORSLEY: Well, this follows, though, several months of flat or down jobs in the factory sector. So it's. . . INSKEEP: Oh. So, again, we should look at the longer trend. . . HORSLEY: Exactly. INSKEEP: . . . And it doesn't look so great. Now, the president has been pushing the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to rev up the economy. How does this affect his argument when we find out that the job market is not doing so badly? HORSLEY: This is going to make the Fed's job a little trickier. Last month when the Fed gathered, they decided to hold off on lowering interest rates, even though they acknowledged there were some worrisome signs on the economic horizon. Officials said they wanted to see more data. The jobs report is one datapoint that they keep an eye on. They also watch inflation, all sorts of other clues. And not all those arrows are pointing in the same direction right now. This arrow, though, is definitely saying the economy is in pretty good shape. That's going to weigh against a cut in interest rates when the Fed meets later this month. As a result, Steve, we could see one of those perverse reactions in the stock market to this very solid and encouraging jobs number. A month ago when we got a lousy jobs number, the stock market rallied because investors were betting, OK, now the Fed's going to cut interest rates. This very good jobs number may have the opposite effect. If investors decide, OK, now the Fed is going to be less likely to cut interest rates, we could actually see a drop in the stock market. INSKEEP: And just to be really clear here, it sounds like the choice for the Fed right now is between leaving interest rates alone or cutting them. The idea of raising interest rates is not really on the table. The economy is not that strong at the moment. HORSLEY: Correct. INSKEEP: Scott, thanks very much for the update.

We may get a clue this morning as the government releases employment numbers for June. David Wessel is with us next. He's director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution. David, good morning. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: What are you looking for? WESSEL: Well, the government reported a month ago that payrolls increased only 75,000 in May; that's very little. And it led people to think that maybe we were on the cusp of a real serious slowdown in the economy. Economists are predicting that later this morning, the government will report that we added double that number of jobs. Now, the monthly number bounces around a lot. But if the government reports a big increase in jobs or a big revision of the May number, everyone will breathe a sigh of relief, and maybe the economy isn't slowing that much. If it's a bad number - if it surprises people on the downside, then we're going to hear a lot more talk about the prospect of recession. And there'll be a lot more pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates when officials meet there later this month. INSKEEP: I'm thinking about some of the basic numbers the government covers. You're talking about the number of jobs added. Of course, there's the unemployment rate, which is related but not exactly the same, doesn't always move the same direction. Then there's the question of how much people are paid. You've been telling us, David, that wages have been going up the last couple of years, which sounds good. But are they going up equally for people at different points in the income scale? WESSEL: Well, you're right. Wages, after a long period of not rising very fast, have finally started to pick up. Over the last 12 months - or at least as of May - they were up about 3. 1% average hourly earnings. That's a little better than inflation. But one of the things that's interesting is that the data suggests that wages at the bottom of the income ladder are rising a little faster than those in the middle. And that suggests that some of the inequality we've seen in the job market and wages has narrowed some, although people at the very top are still doing better than everybody else. INSKEEP: Oh, so the problem of inequality is still huge in this country. But it's a little bit better, a little bit less. That's what you're saying? WESSEL: By this measure. Because what's happening is that the demand for workers at the bottom - service workers and such - have - apparently are very sensitive to how strong the labor market is. And so there must be more people hiring in restaurants and stuff like that. And that's pushed up raises - wages a little bit at the bottom faster than at the middle. And we've had some increases at the state and local level in the minimum wage. INSKEEP: Oh. So how have those increases affected things? And where are we talking about here? WESSEL: Well, you know, the federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7. 25 an hour for 10 years. And it's been eroded by inflation; $7. 25 buys 16% less today than it did a decade ago, when the minimum wage was last raised by Congress. Now, there are proposals to raise it now - probably would pass the House, not the Senate - to raise it to $15 over the next several years. But in the face of this federal inaction, there's been a lot of action at the state and local level. In fact, just this week, at the beginning of the week, some increases took effect. In New Jersey, for instance, they decided to raise the minimum wage from $8. 85 to $10, and it's on track to go to 15 by 2024. Oregon's minimum wage rose this week by 50%. And a number of cities are doing the same thing. San Francisco and Berkeley, for instance, raised their minimum wage at the beginning of this week to $15. 59 an hour. INSKEEP: Does all of that mean the federal minimum wage no longer matters as much? WESSEL: It doesn't matter as much, but it still matters. There are still 21 states that either don't have a minimum wage or they match the federal level, including some big states like Texas and Pennsylvania. But it turns out that most workers who are paid the minimum wage live in places - California, Florida, New York - where the minimum wage is higher than $7. 25. An analyst named Ernie Tedeschi, who's at an outfit called Evercore ISI, estimates that 90% of the people who earn the minimum wage are in places where local laws have already put the minimum wage before the federal $7. 25.

S. economy just keeps chugging along. Employers have been adding jobs month after month for almost nine straight years. And according to new numbers from the Labor Department, last month was a big one with 224,000 new jobs added. That's one of the factors the Federal Reserve will take into consideration when officials meet later this month to set interest rates. NPR's Scott Horsley joins us to talk about this. Hello, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: I mean, the big job gains in June followed a rather disappointing record the previous month. What changed? HORSLEY: Yeah. It was a really big turnaround. Three times as many jobs were added last month as in May when job growth was really anemic. We saw broad-based gains in June, solid growth in health care, business services, construction. We saw about 33,000 new government jobs, some of which may be tied to the upcoming census. We also saw, Renee, a lot of hiring in factories and in transportation. And that's important because both manufacturing and transportation can suffer in a trade war. So the good numbers in June, which were an improvement over previous months, suggest manufacturing and transportation are weathering the trade tensions OK. And speaking of weather, a month ago, the White House blamed flooding on the Mississippi River for part of the lousy jobs numbers in May. The improvement we saw last month suggests that barge traffic at least on the Upper Mississippi is flowing again. MONTAGNE: And back to the Federal Reserve. A lot of people have been expecting it to cut interest rates later this month. Does this change that? HORSLEY: Not necessarily. Although the Fed's job may get trickier now as officials try to sort out just what's happening from all the conflicting data. The June jobs number is a big thumbs up, suggesting maybe the economy doesn't need any additional help right now in the form of lower interest rates. But there are some other indicators that are not so rosy. This past week, for example, we saw signals in both the manufacturing and the services sector suggesting a slowdown. So that could point the Fed in the direction of cutting rates if only as a kind of insurance policy against a sharper downturn. Finally, you have President Trump who continues to browbeat the Fed, saying the economy could be growing faster if they just pump more money out there. Federal Reserve officials insist they are not swayed by that kind of political pressure, but it is pretty hard to ignore. MONTAGNE: Well, wages have been going up as well but actually not that much. So if the job market is so strong, why aren't workers seeing more money in their paychecks? HORSLEY: Good question. Over the last year, wages have gone up by a little over 3%. That is faster than inflation, so workers are seeing real gains in their buying power but not the kind of gains you might expect when unemployment is as low as it is. We hear a lot of grousing from employers that they have trouble finding workers to fill vacant jobs, but it hasn't triggered the kind of acceleration in wages that you might look for. One reason may be that the supply of workers keeps growing. People who have been on the sidelines are joining or rejoining the workforce. We saw 335,000 people enter the workforce last month. Unemployment actually inched up just a little bit because there were more people joining the workforce than actually found jobs. So that is helping to keep a lid on wage gains. MONTAGNE: And how about weak spots - any in this jobs report? HORSLEY: The big weak spot, Renee, is retail. We have just been seeing a steady erosion of retail jobs - 6,000 lost last month, 7,000 the month before, 15,000 the month before that. The whole retail industry has just been going through a wrenching reorganization with chains like Toys R Us and Payless laying workers off. Some of that reflects a shift to e-commerce, so you are seeing job gains in categories like warehousing. But if you work at the mall or some other corner of retailing, this is a really tough environment. MONTAGNE: NPR's Scott Horsley. Scott, thanks very much. HORSLEY: You're welcome.

MARTIN: OK. I have to admit, when I first heard this, I thought, when there are parents who financially are in a position to help their kids, haven't they always? SANDERS: They have, but it seems to be more frequent. There's a recent report by a financial services firm called Country Financial, and it found that a little more than half of all Americans ages 21 to 37 received some sort of financial assistance from a parent or guardian or someone. And by one count, millennials - the oldest folks in that group are 38. MARTIN: Right. SANDERS: About a quarter of those who work full time still rely on their parents to pay at least one of their bills. MARTIN: Why? SANDERS: There are so many reasons, Rachel. MARTIN: Do tell. SANDERS: But the biggest of them are the cost of stuff just being higher. We all know that college costs more. We know that it costs a lot more to buy a house, and so parents help with that. And we see an entire swath of folks who graduated college into the Great Recession, so their careers have just kind of been slowed to launch as well. When we talk about student debt and how it exacerbates this phenomenon. . . MARTIN: Yeah. SANDERS: . . . The folks that are most hurt by this are usually first-generation black and brown students who got swindled by for-profit colleges. MARTIN: I mean, I know you talk to a lot of young people about how they are grappling with this. SANDERS: Yes. MARTIN: What struck you about those conversations? SANDERS: We talked to a bunch of people, and the one constant throughout was folks telling me how much shame they feel discussing getting help from their parents. We heard from Christina Crupie. She's 22. Her parents helped her pay for living expenses for undergrad, and they're offering to give her a personal loan to help her pay for graduate school. They're not rich, but they can help, and they want to help. But Christina told me, when she talks to friends, she lies about their help. CHRISTINA CRUPIE: I've had a few conversations with people who, like, we'll start talking about grad school, and they'll be like, oh, yeah, and those loans. And I'm like, uh, yeah, man. Like, kind of just go along with it, and I'm just feeling super weird about myself 'cause I'm not actually taking loans so, like, I'm telling people that I am. SANDERS: People feel this shame over their privilege, but also, in the midst of all that emotion, people aren't connecting the dots and having larger, more systemic conversations about how some families got all this wealth and how some families did not. MARTIN: Right. So let's talk about the people who did not. What'd you hear from folks who don't come from generational privilege? SANDERS: Exactly, and that's a lot of people, you know. So we reached out to Aminatou Sow for this episode. She's a journalist and a host of a podcast called \"Call Your Girlfriend. \" And she's written a lot about being a millennial and dealing with money. And she is a woman of color and an immigrant, and she says, for folks like her, they actually send money home to their parents. AMINATOU SOW: Whenever I read stories of millennials and money, and especially when we talk about millennial entitlement of money, the subtext is always, like, white millennials and, to be fair, like, a certain kind of white millennial. SANDERS: For first-gen students, for low-income families, for black and brown folks, they are often asked more often by their parents to give money, and there's data that backs this up. A poll from Clark University found that black and Hispanic parents are more likely to expect support from their children than white parents. . . MARTIN: Which. . . SANDERS: . . . For a lot of reasons. MARTIN: Right, which upends the entire stereotype about what we think of when we think of millennials and money. SANDERS: Exactly. All this to say, this group of people, like all groups of people, are not a monolith. MARTIN: NPR's Sam Sanders. He's the host of It's Been A Minute. And if you want to hear more - and I bet you do - he's got a new episode of his podcast out right now all about this issue - millennials, debt, money, the whole thing. Sam, thanks so much. SANDERS: Thank you.

CHRISTINA CRUPIE: I've had a few conversations with people who, like, we'll start talking about grad school, and they'll be like, oh, yeah, and those loans. And I'm like, uh, yeah, man. Like, kind of just go along with it, and I'm just feeling super weird about myself 'cause I'm not actually taking loans so, like, I'm telling people that I am. SANDERS: People feel this shame over their privilege, but also, in the midst of all that emotion, people aren't connecting the dots and having larger, more systemic conversations about how some families got all this wealth and how some families did not. MARTIN: Right. So let's talk about the people who did not. What'd you hear from folks who don't come from generational privilege? SANDERS: Exactly, and that's a lot of people, you know. So we reached out to Aminatou Sow for this episode. She's a journalist and a host of a podcast called \"Call Your Girlfriend. \" And she's written a lot about being a millennial and dealing with money. And she is a woman of color and an immigrant, and she says, for folks like her, they actually send money home to their parents. AMINATOU SOW: Whenever I read stories of millennials and money, and especially when we talk about millennial entitlement of money, the subtext is always, like, white millennials and, to be fair, like, a certain kind of white millennial. SANDERS: For first-gen students, for low-income families, for black and brown folks, they are often asked more often by their parents to give money, and there's data that backs this up. A poll from Clark University found that black and Hispanic parents are more likely to expect support from their children than white parents. . . MARTIN: Which. . . SANDERS: . . . For a lot of reasons. MARTIN: Right, which upends the entire stereotype about what we think of when we think of millennials and money. SANDERS: Exactly. All this to say, this group of people, like all groups of people, are not a monolith. MARTIN: NPR's Sam Sanders. He's the host of It's Been A Minute. And if you want to hear more - and I bet you do - he's got a new episode of his podcast out right now all about this issue - millennials, debt, money, the whole thing. Sam, thanks so much. SANDERS: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF SENA & DJ VADIM'S \"WORK HARD\")", "section": "Economy", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

He's trying to sort out conflicting economic signals while also dodging insults from President Trump. Today, Powell went before a divided congressional committee to offer an update on the economy just weeks ahead of a key decision on interest rates. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Powell told lawmakers the U. S. economy is still growing, though not as fast as it was earlier this year. The Fed chairman left little doubt he and his colleagues are prepared to cut interest rates later this month to prolong the economic expansion now entering its 11th year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEROME POWELL: We see the economy as being in a good place, and we're committed to using our tools to keep it there. HORSLEY: Powell says many Americans on the lower rungs of the income ladder are only now beginning to enjoy the benefits of the recovery, so he doesn't want it to end prematurely. Manufacturing has slowed around the world, and tariff battles are disrupting trade. While, so far, consumer spending in the U. S. has held up well, Powell says business spending is taking a hit. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)POWELL: Uncertainty can cause businesses to hold back on investment and hiring. In fact, we've been hearing that in our discussions with businesses around the country. HORSLEY: The Fed's been signaling for weeks now that it might prop up the economy by cutting interest rates, making it easier for consumers and businesses to borrow money. But when Powell and his colleagues last met in June, they left rates unchanged. President Trump has been browbeating Powell, saying the economy would be growing faster if only the central bank had acted more quickly. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If we had a Fed that would lower interest rates, we'd be like a rocket ship. But we're paying a lot of interest and it's unnecessary, but we don't have a Fed that knows what they're doing, so it's one of those little things. HORSLEY: Today, Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee accused the president of meddling with what's supposed to be an independent Federal Reserve. Chairwoman Maxine Waters of California sought reassurance from Powell that he wouldn't bend to political pressure. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MAXINE WATERS: If you got a call from the president today or tomorrow and he said, I'm firing you, pack up, it's time to go, what would you do? POWELL: Well, of course, I would not do that. WATERS: I can't hear you. (LAUGHTER)POWELL: My answer would be no. HORSLEY: Powell reiterated his intention to serve out his four-year term. The ranking Republican on the committee, Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, downplayed the president's kibitzing, suggesting it does not amount to interference with the Fed. McHenry also touted GOP tax cuts and deregulation as key ingredients in the long-running expansion. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PATRICK MCHENRY: The economy over the last 2 1/2 years has witnessed remarkable growth, and unemployment has reached lows that many believe were impossible. HORSLEY: Powell agreed at 3. 7%, unemployment is lower than many forecasters thought would be sustainable. But with wages rising only modestly about 3% per year, Powell sees little sign of an economy overheating. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)POWELL: To call something hot, you need to see some heat. And while we hear lots of reports of companies having a hard time finding qualified labor, nonetheless we don't see wages really responding, so I don't really see that as a current issue. HORSLEY: Lawmakers quizzed Powell about a proposal to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour nationwide, but the Fed chairman didn't take the bait. Congressional forecasters said this week there'd be both cost and benefits to the plan with at least 17 million people getting raises but more than a million possibly losing jobs.

And as Finn Myrstad was just saying, we as consumers may not have a lot of choice when we're dealing with these massive companies. But just how massive are they? SCOTT GALLOWAY: Well, I'll give you some specific examples. In a 12-month period from June of '17 to, I think, June of '18, Amazon added to its market capitalization the value of the entire CPG industry. RAZ: This is Scott Galloway. GALLOWAY: Professor of marketing, NYU Stern School of Business. RAZ: And that phrase that he just used. . . GALLOWAY: The entire CPG industry. RAZ: . . . Means consumer packaged goods. So we're talking Nestle, Tyson Foods, Pepsi. . . GALLOWAY: So you could take every consumer product sold globally. . . RAZ: . . . Nike, Unilever, Procter and Gamble. . . GALLOWAY: When we're talking about companies - Unilever and PNG - that have been around for decades. . . RAZ: . . . 3M, L'Oreal, Kraft, Heinz. . . GALLOWAY: . . . Not generations. . . RAZ: . . . Adidas, General Mills, Hershey. . . GALLOWAY: . . . Not centuries. . . RAZ: . . . Mattel, Anheuser-Busch, Philip Morris. . . GALLOWAY: . . . That have unbelievably robust consumer brands, global reach, credible supply chain - and Amazon added the entire value of that industry in a 12-month period. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Amazon is doing fine. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: May be headed for global dominance. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: The stock is now up 2%. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: They're becoming a profit machine. You are seeing their profits. . . (CROSSTALK)RAZ: And it's not just Amazon. In his TED talk, Scott focused on the three other behemoth companies that, with Amazon, make up the big four. They are Apple, Facebook and Google. So what does it mean that these companies are so big and so good at manipulating, well, almost every part of our lives? Here's Scott Galloway's take from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GALLOWAY: These four companies - at the end of the Great Recession, the market capitalization of these companies was equivalent to the GDP of Niger. Now it is equivalent to the GDP of India, having blown past Russia and Canada in '13 and '14. There are only five nations that have a GDP greater than the combined market capitalization of these four firms. Amazon has become so powerful in the marketplace; they can conduct Jedi mind tricks that can begin damaging other industries just by looking at it. Nike announces they're distributing on Amazon - their stock goes up; every other footwear stock goes down. When Amazon stock goes up, the rest of retail stocks go down because they assume what's good for Amazon is bad for everybody else. They cut the cost on salmon 33% when they acquired Whole Foods. In between the time they announced the acquisition of Whole Foods and when it closed, Kroger, the largest pure-play grocer in America, shed a third of its value because Amazon purchased a grocer one-eleventh the size of Kroger. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: When we talk about the four big companies - right? - let's put this into a historical context. Are we kind of living through a similar period in history where you had, like, the railroad barons and the oil barons and the finance barons - the Rockefellers, the Carnegies, the Crockers - is that the world we're living in today? GALLOWAY: Yeah, we've been to this movie before. And history may not repeat itself, but it rhymes, and this definitely rhymes with periods when companies have concentrated or through excellent execution, macroenvironment, luck - whatever you want to call it - become an invasive species; and that is, small companies have a difficult time getting out of the crib. Large companies are kind of euthanized prematurely, and large companies tend to be great employers and good taxpayers. What's different about this era is that we seem to have lost the script around antitrust. And that is, with the railroads, telcos, the aluminum companies, the seven sisters, the oil companies - we decided to move in and break them up and we had, quote, unquote, a \"class traitor\" (ph). And that is, a lot of people think the railroad money elected Teddy Roosevelt, a Republican, but he was willing to go in and say, I love you guys. Thanks for getting me in the office, but I'm now breaking you up because we need to oxygenate the economy. But we have been to these levels of concentration before. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GALLOWAY: Whose fault is it? It's our fault. We're electing regulators who don't have the backbone to actually go after these companies. Amazon only needs one person for two at Macy's. If they grow their business $20 billion this year, which they will, we will lose $53,000 cashiers and clerks. This is nothing unusual. This has happened all through our economy. We've just never seen companies this good at it. That's one Yankee Stadium of workers. It's even worse in media. Facebook and Google grow their business $22 billion this year, which they will, we're going to lose approximately 150,000 creative directors, planners and copywriters. Or we can fill up 2 1/2 Yankee Stadiums and say, you are out of work, courtesy of Amazon. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: When it comes to Google or Amazon or Facebook or even Apple, how much do we control our interaction with those platforms and how much are we controlled by our interaction with those platforms? GALLOWAY: So look - every time you light up a cigarette, you're making a conscious choice. But the question is, at some point, do you become so biologically addicted to nicotine, does the organization require scrutiny around what it's doing to addict you? And power corrupts, and when you're a monopoly and you're Facebook, and the worse that's going to happen to you is a fine that's equivalent of seven days' income or seven weeks of cash flow and maybe some public shaming, you're always going to find a reason not to figure it out. The NRA has never been able to connect the sale of assault weapons with the murder of children. Big Tobacco was never able to connect tobacco with cancer. Big tech is never going to connect the underlying algorithms of their companies and the lack of security and the lack of human discretion and screening of their content with the division or serious division in our culture, the weaponization of these platforms to clear (ph) our elections or teen depression. They will never make that connection on their own because when it's raining money, it blurs your vision. RAZ: See, I think the thing about these big companies that really worries me is how much I feel manipulated by them. And I don't - and it's not that I want to blame them because I am making choices. I am deciding to use these platforms and to check on Facebook or Twitter or buying things on Amazon because it's easy, you know. Like, that's the part of it that really bothers me, more than the sort of the economic cost of it, which is obviously a problem; it's the personal cost. It's how it sort of changes and has changed our behavior. GALLOWAY: Hundred percent. And I would argue that if you're going to look at price, at some point, if we end up with a group of people who can all have Netflix, all have a great phone, all have tons of content and get paper towels delivered really inexpensively, but we're - our wages are flat for five decades, OK, do we need to reevaluate priorities? I would argue that the pricing or the prices we pay for these platforms has skyrocketed. And that is, when we have a country where a lot of us wonder if the elections were manipulated, that's an enormous price we all pay. When we worry about our 16-year-old daughters sitting in their room, knowing they weren't invited to a party, that's one thing. But seeing the party play out in real time, on their phones, as they're in their rooms alone, that's a price that my household pays. I'm worried that my son, my oldest son who's 11 and does a handstand, and I video it, and he asks me to post it on YouTube, and then he gets a like, and he says, can we check back in and see if I got more likes? And then someone makes kind of a snarky comment about his video, and it really bums him out. And Google responds, well, yeah, but your son can learn how to play the piano on YouTube. RAZ: Yeah. GALLOWAY: There's some wonderful things about social media, but the addiction here - we know we're being manipulated. That's an enormous price we all pay.

Some lawmakers are downright hostile to the idea that a company that has broken public trust repeatedly, especially in its handling of user data, would venture into high-stakes global finance. NPR's Aarti Shahani reports on today's hearing before the Senate Banking Committee. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Facebook has proposed with partners to create digital money, a currency called the Libra. The move requires approval by regulators who are overseen by lawmakers who were on fire at today's hearing and using fire metaphors. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SHERROD BROWN: Facebook is dangerous. SHAHANI: Senator Sherrod Brown, Ohio Democrat. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BROWN: Like a toddler who has gotten his hands on a book of matches, Facebook has burned down the house over and over and called every arson a learning experience. SHAHANI: Money is a massive experiment in trust. We trust the dollar. We use it and don't burn it because we trust that it's backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. Facebook does not have a great track record in trust, as David Marcus, the man at the company who oversees the new currency project, admitted repeatedly as he sat in the hot seat. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DAVID MARCUS: Trust is primordial, and we've made mistakes in the past. And we have been working and are continuing to work really hard to get better. SHAHANI: Primordial, meaning from the beginning of time. The endearing origin story of Facebook, the miracle of capitalism - started in a college dorm - was absent. Senators offered an alternative origin story that early on, Facebook killed the local newspapers that keep those with power accountable; that by making hate speech go viral, it helped fuel genocide in the country Myanmar; that Facebook turned a blind eye to Russian interference in the 2016 elections; that the company has lied repeatedly about how it handles users' personal data. Senator Martha McSally, Arizona Republican. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARTHA MCSALLY: Mr. Marcus, I don't trust Facebook, and it's because of the repeated violations of your users' privacy, repeated deceit. And I am not alone. SHAHANI: Facebook's Marcus promised that if given permission to mint money, the company would monitor and report money laundering, but Facebook would not exploit users' spending data to target ads though Facebook has said one thing and done another before. The company promised to keep customer data private. Then, charged with lying, it entered a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission in 2011. And now caught up again, Facebook faces a $5 billion fine. Marcus made this case. Digital currency is not a data grab. Rather, it will make Facebook more popular by making it a shopping destination kind of like Amazon. As he tried to explain to Senator McSally, that is a service to an estimated 90 million businesses on Facebook. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARCUS: If they now have the ability to sell to more constituents across the Facebook platform and more people have access to the services and products of those 90 million businesses, then more commerce will happen on the Facebook platform. MCSALLY: Oh, that's wonderful public good that you guys are committed to. I know I'm way over time here, and that was extremely sarcastic. Thank you. SHAHANI: Timing matters. The announcement by Facebook that it plans to create its own currency may be too soon after Wall Street's financial crisis or too soon after Facebook's data scandals, which are still ongoing. Though Senator Pat Toomey, Pennsylvania Republican, did offer some encouragement for the tech giant's foray into digital currency. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PAT TOOMEY: To announce in advance that we have to strangle this baby in the crib I think is wildly premature. SHAHANI: Tomorrow Facebook's Marcus appears before the House Financial Services Committee. This is one of a handful of hearings this week examining the power of big tech. Aarti Shahani, NPR News. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   Well, while the House is looking today at whether Google and other tech giants are too big, across Capitol Hill, senators are debating whether it would be OK if Facebook creates its own currency - safe to say Facebook has not convinced either Republicans or Democrats so far. Some lawmakers are downright hostile to the idea that a company that has broken public trust repeatedly, especially in its handling of user data, would venture into high-stakes global finance.

When she announced this, everyone asked, how are you going to pay for it? Here's what she told Morning Edition earlier this year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ: I think the first thing that we need to do is kind of break the mistaken idea that taxes pay for 100% of government expenditure. KING: She says ambitious government programs can be financed through deficit spending. And in saying that, she has spotlighted an obscure brand of economics known as Modern Monetary Theory. NPR's Scott Horsley has a beginner's guide. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Modern Monetary Theory's been around for years, but it's only recently stepped out of the shadows. Economist Stephanie Kelton of Stony Brook University says that's partly thanks to Ocasio-Cortez. The social media darling embraced the theory while making an unapologetic case for costly new government programs. STEPHANIE KELTON: There was something of an Oprah effect when she did that. People immediately probably started googling Modern Monetary Theory to find out what she was referring to. HORSLEY: Run that Google search, and you'll quickly find Kelton herself. The economist, who advised Bernie Sanders' 2016 campaign, is one of the best-known evangelists for MMT. Kelton says paying for big government programs is the easy part. If Congress has the will, she argues, the Federal Reserve can effectively print the money. KELTON: If Congress authorizes a few billion dollars of additional spending or a few hundred billion dollars, then the Fed's job is to make sure that those checks don't bounce. HORSLEY: A central element of MMT is that governments that control their own currency, like the United States, don't have to worry about spending more than they collect in taxes. They can always create more money. But Kelton says that's not a blank check for unlimited government spending. KELTON: Too often, people get a whiff of MMT. They don't read the literature. And they somehow arrive at the takeaway that MMT is about printing prosperity. And of course, when people hear printing money, they go straight to Zimbabwe or Weimar Germany. HORSLEY: Those are notorious cases of runaway price hikes. But Kelton says inflation is only a danger when demand outstrips the real capacity of the economy - the people, machines and raw materials. Last week, under questioning from Ocasio-Cortez, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged the U. S. job market has shown more capacity to grow without triggering inflation than he and his colleagues had expected. Still, Powell's no fan of MMT, as he told a Senate hearing back in February. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEROME POWELL: The idea that deficits don't matter for countries that can borrow in their own currency, I think, is just wrong. We're going to have to either spend less or raise more revenue. HORSLEY: Tax historian Bruce Bartlett also blasts MMT as little more than a fig leaf giving license for big spending, in the same way Art Laffer gave Republicans cover to cut taxes with the dubious claim they'd pay for themselves. BRUCE BARTLETT: MMT is sort of the Laffer Curve for the left. HORSLEY: Some of MMT's biggest supporters, however, are not liberal politicians but bond traders at firms like PIMCO and Goldman Sachs. James Montier, who's with the investment firm GMO, says he turned to MMT after more conventional economics led him astray. In the 1990s, Montier and many others were convinced Japan's rising government debt would drive up borrowing costs. It didn't. JAMES MONTIER: That cost both me and my clients or anyone who was stupid enough to follow me money. It was one of the worst trade positions I have ever suggested in my entire life. HORSLEY: Montier says MMT offers better financial forecasts and helped him understand why interest rates in the U. S. have stayed low despite growing government deficits. Persistently low interest rates have also prompted some mainstream economists like Larry Summers and Jason Furman to rethink their attitudes and be less concerned about federal deficits. But they haven't gone so far as to embrace MMT. Furman, who advised former President Obama, says there are always a lot of ambitious ideas floating around Washington.

By one estimate, the state must build more than 3 million new homes by 2025 to satisfy demand. And for Darius Rafieyan of NPR's daily podcast The Indicator From Planet Money, the shortage hit home. DARIUS RAFIEYAN, BYLINE: In my hometown of Huntington Beach, Calif. , housing development has become a very contentious issue. And recently, I broached the subject with one longtime resident. FREDDIE RAFIEYAN: My name is Freddie (ph), last name is Rafieyan. And I am your father. D RAFIEYAN: My dad moved to California from Iran 40 years ago. And he's really learned to embrace the SoCal lifestyle. He can almost always be found wearing board shorts and a T-shirt. He's also had an uninterrupted tan since at least 1986. And recently, we met up at our old apartment building. Here we are, good old 610. Good old unit 610. F RAFIEYAN: Yup, 610. Yup, I lived there - we lived there for 18 years. D RAFIEYAN: Our old apartment building - it's on a street called Edinger Avenue. And I went back there because that street is at the center of a lawsuit that could determine the future of housing policy for the entire state of California. When me and my dad moved there, it was known for, like, the crumbling, old shopping mall on the corner. Now its high-end lifestyle plazas and luxury apartment buildings and all that development - it's chipping away at the small-town feel that people love so much, including my dad. F RAFIEYAN: They should stop. They should leave Huntington Beach the way it is. It's not Huntington Beach anymore. D RAFIEYAN: And my dad - he's far from the only person in town who feels this way. Take a listen to this city council meeting from 2015. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: We don't need a congested city. We don't need giant buildings. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: This is insanity. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: We are outraged by that monstrosity that's under construction at Beach and Ellis. (APPLAUSE)D RAFIEYAN: So at that meeting, the council voted to halt new development on Edinger. But California has this law. It says every city has to identify how much housing it needs and make a plan to build those houses. By limiting the number of new units allowed on Edinger, Huntington Beach fell out of compliance with their plan. For decades, though, that would not have mattered. The law has gone basically unenforced for 50 years. But when California Governor Gavin Newsom came into office, he made it his mission to change all that, and he chose to start with my hometown of Huntington Beach. GAVIN NEWSOM: I mean, the city council just say, no, not interested. They just thumbed their nose at the state. D RAFIEYAN: And Newsom decided to do something drastic. He took Huntington Beach to court. That's right. The state of California is suing one of its own cities. NEWSOM: People are dying on the streets because of the affordability crisis. We're not asking for high-rises. We're not asking for the impossible. Just increase the supply modestly. Show us you give a damn about the people that are commuting two, three hours to come in and work in your restaurants. Show us you give a damn about the kids there that can't afford to buy a home there or even rent a house there. D RAFIEYAN: Huntington Beach and the state of California - they've long had a troubled relationship. It's a Republican stronghold in a deeply Democratic state. The two entities have been suing each other back-and-forth for years. But this latest legal spat - it's going to have real consequences. I mean, remember my dad, the one who didn't want to see any more ugly apartment buildings going up on his street? Well, he doesn't live on that street anymore. In fact, he doesn't live in Huntington Beach anymore. F RAFIEYAN: In about a year and a half, the rent was raised 40% nearly. It's a good city. I love Huntington Beach. I would love to come back and live here. But with the rents going up as much as they are, I don't think I'll ever be able to come back. D RAFIEYAN: So my dad - he's a low-income renter who was pushed out of his home by rising prices. He's exactly the kind of person that Governor Newsom says he is trying to help with this lawsuit. But he's also a fierce opponent of more building. You would rather have to leave Huntington Beach but keep the city the same way it is rather than be able to live here but see it change. F RAFIEYAN: Yes. Even now, I come down here and visit friends, and I always - in a way, I get excited when thinking I'm going to Huntington Beach to see places that I have been around there for many, many years. D RAFIEYAN: And this is what is so challenging about all this. I mean, housing is an area where economic policy collides with people's sense of identity. And identity is messy. It's not always rational. It doesn't really fit into a city zoning plan, sort of like Edinger Avenue. Darius Rafieyan, NPR News. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  California faces a housing shortage.

Let's talk next about the financial impact of Brexit. British business leaders and international business leaders are urging Boris Johnson to sign some sort of deal governing Britain's withdrawal from the European Union. To leave without a deal, they say, threatens both Britain's economy and global markets. On to get a handle on the financial impact of Brexit under a new prime minister, we have reached Nicholas Bloom. He's economics professor at Stanford University. Professor Bloom, welcome. NICHOLAS BLOOM: Thank you. KELLY: So to state the obvious, Brexit has not happened yet. But you have been studying this since 2016, which, of course, is when the vote to go ahead with Brexit took place. What has the financial impact been just of the specter of Brexit, the prospect of Brexit? BLOOM: Brexit is very scary for businesses. So already, we've seen very negative effects in investment. So that's almost completely collapsed. Employment growth has slowed down. Productivity is down. You know, the best indicator is the pound has fallen. So 10 years ago. . . KELLY: Yeah. BLOOM: It was $2 to the pound, and now it's $1. 25. So, you know, the only upside is it's a very cheap time to go to England if you want to go shopping. KELLY: A good time to be a tourist there - maybe not quite so good a moment to be a business investor. How do things change under Prime Minister Boris Johnson? BLOOM: Boris Johnson is basically going to press the Brexit nuclear button. So for the last three years, the British have been trying to get a good deal with the Europeans under Brexit. They basically failed to do that. And Johnson has said, I'm leaving anyway. Who knows what's going to happen? I think if he leaves without a deal, the pound is going to crash further. We'll probably see a recession. You know, unemployment will shoot up. It is genuinely really scary. KELLY: And can you put any numbers on - just in terms of - you said it's really scary, meaning what? What is the range for how tricky things could get? BLOOM: Give you the numbers. In 2016, Britain voted for Brexit. Since then, growth has basically flatlined. We've lost three years of growth. I think if we actually leave with no deal on October 31 this year, the forecast says anything between, you know, 2- to 4% negative - so you know, a pretty bad recession, which would mean, you know, 10 years after the vote, we'll be maybe 10% poorer, which is, like, a huge amount of money. We think the average Brit is earning $40,000 a year. To lose $4,000 a year each year because of Brexit is an enormous impact. KELLY: Although wouldn't a no-deal Brexit at least provide certainty? You may not like it, but part of what has spooked investors, my understanding is, has just been not quite knowing what's going to happen. Boris Johnson says, let me - I'm going to tell you what's going to happen, and it is happening on - by October 31. BLOOM: I mean, yes, it's certainty. You're being told the - certainly the worst case possible. You know, you're facing a prison sentence, and you get told you're given a very worst outcome. You're more certain, but, of course, you're very depressed. And that's really what's facing British businesses. One good example is the British car industry are mothballing and closing down plants. For example, Ford is closing a plant in Bridgend in Wales, which has 1,700 employees. And a large driver behind this is Brexit. It's going to be hard for Ford to export those cars to Europe, so they're now going to move these factories into Europe. KELLY: And we've been talking about businesses operating in Britain. We've been talking about the impact on Britain. What about on the global system? BLOOM: There'll be some washback. The country that's going to be damaged quite badly is actually Ireland 'cause Ireland is very connected with the U. K. , and its economy is going to be hit badly. It's also quite a high chance Scotland may separate off. The U. K. going into recession won't be great for the rest of Europe. I think America is pretty insulated. KELLY: Nicholas Bloom - he is a professor of economics at Stanford University, and he's part of the Decision Maker Panel project team, which is dedicated to tracking Brexit's impact on businesses in the U. K. Professor Bloom, thanks for your time. BLOOM: Thanks very much. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  All right. Let's talk next about the financial impact of Brexit. British business leaders and international business leaders are urging Boris Johnson to sign some sort of deal governing Britain's withdrawal from the European Union. To leave without a deal, they say, threatens both Britain's economy and global markets. On to get a handle on the financial impact of Brexit under a new prime minister, we have reached Nicholas Bloom. He's economics professor at Stanford University. Professor Bloom, welcome. NICHOLAS BLOOM: Thank you. KELLY: So to state the obvious, Brexit has not happened yet. But you have been studying this since 2016, which, of course, is when the vote to go ahead with Brexit took place. What has the financial impact been just of the specter of Brexit, the prospect of Brexit? BLOOM: Brexit is very scary for businesses. So already, we've seen very negative effects in investment. So that's almost completely collapsed. Employment growth has slowed down. Productivity is down. You know, the best indicator is the pound has fallen. So 10 years ago. . . KELLY: Yeah. BLOOM: It was $2 to the pound, and now it's $1. 25. So, you know, the only upside is it's a very cheap time to go to England if you want to go shopping. KELLY: A good time to be a tourist there - maybe not quite so good a moment to be a business investor. How do things change under Prime Minister Boris Johnson? BLOOM: Boris Johnson is basically going to press the Brexit nuclear button. So for the last three years, the British have been trying to get a good deal with the Europeans under Brexit. They basically failed to do that. And Johnson has said, I'm leaving anyway. Who knows what's going to happen? I think if he leaves without a deal, the pound is going to crash further. We'll probably see a recession. You know, unemployment will shoot up. It is genuinely really scary. KELLY: And can you put any numbers on - just in terms of - you said it's really scary, meaning what? What is the range for how tricky things could get? BLOOM: Give you the numbers. In 2016, Britain voted for Brexit. Since then, growth has basically flatlined. We've lost three years of growth. I think if we actually leave with no deal on October 31 this year, the forecast says anything between, you know, 2- to 4% negative - so you know, a pretty bad recession, which would mean, you know, 10 years after the vote, we'll be maybe 10% poorer, which is, like, a huge amount of money. We think the average Brit is earning $40,000 a year. To lose $4,000 a year each year because of Brexit is an enormous impact. KELLY: Although wouldn't a no-deal Brexit at least provide certainty? You may not like it, but part of what has spooked investors, my understanding is, has just been not quite knowing what's going to happen. Boris Johnson says, let me - I'm going to tell you what's going to happen, and it is happening on - by October 31. BLOOM: I mean, yes, it's certainty. You're being told the - certainly the worst case possible. You know, you're facing a prison sentence, and you get told you're given a very worst outcome. You're more certain, but, of course, you're very depressed. And that's really what's facing British businesses. One good example is the British car industry are mothballing and closing down plants. For example, Ford is closing a plant in Bridgend in Wales, which has 1,700 employees. And a large driver behind this is Brexit. It's going to be hard for Ford to export those cars to Europe, so they're now going to move these factories into Europe. KELLY: And we've been talking about businesses operating in Britain. We've been talking about the impact on Britain. What about on the global system? BLOOM: There'll be some washback. The country that's going to be damaged quite badly is actually Ireland 'cause Ireland is very connected with the U. K. , and its economy is going to be hit badly. It's also quite a high chance Scotland may separate off. The U. K. going into recession won't be great for the rest of Europe. I think America is pretty insulated. KELLY: Nicholas Bloom - he is a professor of economics at Stanford University, and he's part of the Decision Maker Panel project team, which is dedicated to tracking Brexit's impact on businesses in the U. K. Professor Bloom, thanks for your time. BLOOM: Thanks very much.", "section": "Economy", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: The letter from the Wyoming Valley West School District said if cafeteria dues are not paid, officials could take parents to court for neglecting their children.

There is the PLANET MONEY T-shirt, a Santa hat, a little vial of oil, another little vial of gold and. . . (SOUNDBITE OF COINS CLINKING)FOUNTAIN: . . . This. It's a jar - looks like it was once a peanut butter jar. And on the side of it is this label. It says PLANET MONEY investment fund. And there is a handful of bills in it - a five, a 50, oh. Every few years at PLANET MONEY, we take this money, and we make investments with it - some would say somewhat questionable investments. One of our favorite experiments we did back in 2015. We did a few shows on it, and the first one of those we're going to replay today. Here it is. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DAVID KESTENBAUM, HOST: So I had this moment the other day where I realized that basically every penny I own - it's all a bet in one direction. It's all a bet that everything is going to get better. Like, I own a house, right? That is a bet that real estate is going to go up. ROBERT SMITH, HOST: And, you know, it's sort of crazy because you are a guy who is normally pretty cynical about life. KESTENBAUM: (Laughter) I looked - my entire retirement account, right? It's, like, stocks and bonds. Stocks are a bet that a company is going to be worth more. A bond is a loan to some municipality that's going to build, like, a sewage treatment facility. It's a bet that that's going to work out; they're going to pay me back. SMITH: No one would call you Little Mary Sunshine, and yet, you are doing what everyone else in America does, which is to bet that things are just going to get better. And historically, like, that is not the worst bet in the world. KESTENBAUM: No, it's a totally fine bet. It just struck me as odd all of a sudden because there is this other bet you can make, right? You can bet in the opposite direction. You can make a bet that will pay off when things go badly. SMITH: And perhaps you've heard us talk about this before. It is called a short, a short sell. So if you short Apple stock, you're basically betting that Apple stock is going to be worth less in a month or two months or a year. KESTENBAUM: And if it goes down - everyone else is crying; they're very, very sad - you get to celebrate. Their loss is your gain. SMITH: And, you know, it's not actually that hard to short something. I mean, you can do it online. Anywhere where you can buy stocks, you can also short stocks. And yet, for the most part, nobody does it. KESTENBAUM: We decided we would. We would short something. We consulted a bunch of experts. They told us not to do it. They said there are some very, very good reasons people don't short. Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm David Kestenbaum. SMITH: And I'm Robert Smith. Today on the show, we ignore the advice of some very smart people and we short something. We're going to put our money down on a bet against something that everybody loves. (SOUNDBITE OF DANIEL TEPER'S \"FLINGING ABOUT\")KESTENBAUM: Longtime listeners will know that we have a little bit of money set aside for moments like this. I like to call it the PLANET MONEY investment fund. SMITH: Also known as the world's least-successful hedge fund. KESTENBAUM: The world's smallest hedge fund. Back in 2010, I think it was, we all put 200 bucks in each, total of $1,000. First, we bought a toxic asset, one of those mortgage things that almost brought down the global economy. SMITH: Toxic. KESTENBAUM: We lost half our money on that. Then Jacob and I took what was left and we bought gold. We actually bought a gold coin. We lost some more money. That was, like, three years ago. I put whatever we had left in a locked cabinet here, and we basically forgot about it until last week. Robert? SMITH: Yes, sir. KESTENBAUM: You want to see how much money we have left in the PLANET MONEY investment fund? SMITH: Oh, yeah, totally. Wait; where is it? KESTENBAUM: It's in the locker here. SMITH: (Laughter) I'm surprised it's under lock and key. (SOUNDBITE OF LOCKER OPENING)KESTENBAUM: I think this is the key. It's in a jar here. SMITH: It's in a jar? KESTENBAUM: Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF LOCKER CLOSING)SMITH: (Laughter) Wait; what is there, like, $6 in there? (SOUNDBITE OF COINS RUSTLING)SMITH: Come on. KESTENBAUM: And a note. I have a confession. A couple years ago, I needed cash. I didn't have time to go to an ATM, so I got the money out of the jar. I did put a little note there, but looking at it today, like, I don't know exactly what I meant by the note. There are two numbers there. One is crossed out. I'm pretty sure we have $406. 06 left in the fund. SMITH: You are the worst. I can't believe this. All right, man. PLANET MONEY jar is back in effect. (SOUNDBITE OF COINS CLINKING)SMITH: Put the lid on. And this is it. Let's see if we can - let's see if we can make it all back. KESTENBAUM: There's no way we're making it all back. SMITH: (Laughter) It is theoretically possible. And the reason why we wanted to pick shorting is, really, we have done podcasts on shorting before, and economists are always talking about this as this important part of the financial market - that it helps stocks from becoming too hyped. It keeps bubbles from forming. KESTENBAUM: But I really had no idea how it really worked. I certainly didn't know, like, what we should short or how to do it. So we went to consult an expert - one of the experts. This guy's name is Andrew Left. He used to write a newsletter. The title was StockLemon, though he changed the title. ANDREW LEFT: Well, StockLemon was very tongue-in-cheek. I thought I just needed more of a highbrow name. SMITH: The new name - I love it - Citron Research. KESTENBAUM: Andrew's been at this for over a decade. He's the guy that when CNBC needs to get a short seller on, they often grab him. SMITH: And he's great on the air because he's betting against things that other people love. You know those little cameras that if you go skiing, you see everyone has these little cameras on top of their helmets - GoPro? KESTENBAUM: GoPro, yeah. SMITH: He short GoPro. He short Tesla, another company a lot of people love. KESTENBAUM: And Green Mountain Coffee. SMITH: Yeah, those little, tiny K-Cups that you put in the. . . KESTENBAUM: Oh, that's what those are. SMITH: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. KESTENBAUM: So we asked his advice. Suppose someone with almost no investment experience and very little money came up to you and said, I want to try to short a stock. LEFT: No, don't do it. KESTENBAUM: Why? LEFT: It's not - it's a very skilled form of investing. It really is not for the average investor. It's dangerous. You could lose too much money doing it. The forces of Wall Street are against you. It's not worth it. Do something else. KESTENBAUM: You know, when we went into this, I sort of thought that shorting a stock was just the opposite of buying a stock. You know, instead of betting that a stock is going to go up, you're just betting that it's going to go down. But as we dug into it, I realized it is not. It is a completely different animal in just about every way. SMITH: Yeah, there's all these hurdles you have to go through, I think both mentally and financially, before you can short a stock. I mean, the first one is the most basic thing, which is - OK, most stocks seem to go up over time. You have to find a company that is different. You have to find a company where you know something that no one else knows. You have to find a company that you hope will plunge in value. KESTENBAUM: You got to find something like this guy found. SAHM ADRANGI: My name is Sahm Adrangi. I'm the chief investment officer of Kerrisdale Capital. SMITH: Sahm is another famous short seller. He is 33 years old. And for a 33-year-old, he has a very large coin jar. His hedge fund has over a quarter-billion dollars under management. KESTENBAUM: His offices were a few blocks away. We went over to talk to him - very un-fancy. Sahm sat down in this little conference room, and he coached us on how to pick a stock to bet against. He told us this one perfect little story, a best-case scenario, about this one company that he'd found to short. SMITH: This is back in 2010, and Sahm is poking around, looking at certain Chinese companies. Chinese companies were just starting to be listed on U. S. stock exchanges. And he found this one company that had a business model like Princeton Review. They basically coached Chinese students on how to pass entrance exams for college. KESTENBAUM: The company was called China Education Alliance. It was offering these classes and selling these sample tests online. And Sahm looked at the website. It looked OK to him, but he couldn't read Chinese. So he got a guy who could read Chinese to actually try it out, and he found something weird. ADRANGI: And what he came back with was - can't - couldn't actually purchase any products. Despite the fact that this business generated half of its sales from selling, testing out website - its website was completely nonfunctional. SMITH: Wait; they couldn't, like, order anything or put in a credit card? ADRANGI: Yeah, so when you tried to go to the part of the website where you would put in your credit card, an error screen popped up. SMITH: Very, very suspicious. But, you know, the company did say that it taught classes in person. So he decided to check on that, too. KESTENBAUM: So this was harder to check because the building where the classes were taught were in this northern province of China near the border with Russia. But Sahm found a guy to go check it out. Like, he found a freelancer through one of these websites where people say, I'll do odd jobs. Sahm paid the guy $1,000, which he was very excited about, and asked him to go check out the building. ADRANGI: And we asked him to take a camera. So he went there and saw that it was a completely vacant building. When you went to each of the floors - there were six floors - there were no chairs, there were no chalkboards. It was just a completely vacant building. SMITH: So think about this for a moment. There is a company that everyone loves, that everyone thinks is doing this gangbusters business, and Sahm knows something unique. He knows that this company isn't doing anything. Sahm thinks it's a fraud. KESTENBAUM: A perfect stock to short. Now, Sahm warned us. He said, like, if you find something you think is like this, you have to be really careful. You have to do your research because what's about to happen next can be a total roller coaster, though the actual act of shorting a stock turns out to be very simple. ADRANGI: It's just a matter of pressing the red button instead of the green button on your account. KESTENBAUM: Was it really just a button - a red button you press? ADRANGI: It is a red button, yeah. I think it was. Or it might say short. KESTENBAUM: Do you remember how it felt pressing that button? ADRANGI: You know, slightly dangerous (laughter). KESTENBAUM: If you're a normal investor and you buy a stock, you can just sit back and wait for the company to succeed, right? They have a PR team out there. The company itself is trying to make the case that it's going to be great. But if you short a company, you got to go out there and make the case that it's overvalued. Sahm had bet against China Education Alliance, but he was only going to make money if the stock price dropped. So he shouted it to the world. He posted a video of the empty building online. And he and his team wrote this really detailed report that they put out there basically saying the company was a fraud. ADRANGI: I think we released it around 10 a. m. on November 30, 2010. And within two hours, the stock had declined 50%. SMITH: He ended up making a bunch of money. And we asked Sahm, you know, how did it feel? And he was like, good. Like, no, seriously, like, were you dancing? Did you pop Champagne? I mean, you had just brought down a company and made a fortune. And he's like, no, no, not really. KESTENBAUM: We asked it, like, 10 different times. And I think, basically, he's a pretty even-keeled kind of guy. But I also think there's this other going on, which is really another way in which shorting is totally different from normal investing. Your profit is really everyone else's loss. There were lots of other people who had invested in this company hoping the stock price was going to go up. And now, thanks to Sahm, it had collapsed. I get that it felt weird to celebrate. ADRANGI: Yeah, it's a bit bad form. I mean, I think there's a lot of investors that, you know, become blindsided when we put out these reports. And these guys don't like us for losing the money. We'll say, you know, you were investing in a company that was committing fraud and so you should be blaming the management instead of us, but most guys blame us. SMITH: There are so many reasons not to become a short seller. I mean, we have to be ready to be hated by everyone, David. We have to have some sort of special, secret knowledge that we're 100% sure of. KESTENBAUM: You're leaving out the best thing. This is a very practical point that Andrew Left made. LEFT: You can lose an infinite amount of money - infinite. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SMITH: I feel like we should just pause on that - infinite. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SMITH: This is probably the major reason that people don't short, because - let's just say that you are an optimist, that you're buying stock in a company that you hope will go up, and it goes down, right? What's the most you could lose if you buy $100 worth of stock? You could lose $100. But if you short sell, it is completely different. KESTENBAUM: When you short a stock, what you're actually doing is - here, I'll spell it out. You borrow the stock, then you sell it in the hopes that you can buy it back at a lower price and return it. Got it? (Laughter) So I know Jacob hates it when we do this, but let's demonstrate. SMITH: We got to do it. KESTENBAUM: I think it's going to actually help. Robert, you have an actual stock. SMITH: Yeah. And until I got this in the mail, I didn't know that they still made. . . KESTENBAUM: What is it? SMITH: . . . Paper stocks anymore. This is a paper stock certificate for a small community bank in Pennsylvania. It is a gift to my daughters from their grandmother, in theory, I suppose, to pay for part of their education. KESTENBAUM: All right. So say I, for whatever reason, want to short this lovely little bank. Here's how it would work. First, I need to borrow a share from someone who has one. SMITH: I got one. KESTENBAUM: Give it to me. Thank you. I have to give it back to you at some point. SMITH: Oh, yeah. It's for my kids. KESTENBAUM: All right. So I take this borrowed stock, and I sell it. So say the price right now is 10 bucks a share. I pocket that 10 bucks. Now, I got to give you a share of the bank stock back at some point. SMITH: Damn straight. KESTENBAUM: So I wait. Hopefully, the stock price drops. Then - great - I can buy one back cheap, hopefully for, like, you know, pennies. Then I return the stock to you, and we're done. I made a profit - almost 10 bucks. SMITH: So that's the rosy scenario for you. Now the, as Andrew Left put it, the infinite-amount-of-money scenario. KESTENBAUM: Starts the same way. OK, let me borrow the stock. All right. I sell it for 10 bucks, and I wait. But this time, instead of the stock price dropping, let's say it goes up. And let's say it goes way up. Like, the bank has an incredible year. Some big investor comes in, wants it to expand. And say the stock price goes up to, like, 50 bucks. SMITH: Now you are screwed, David Kestenbaum, because you owe me that stock and you have to buy that stock and it's at $50. You have lost a ton of money. Or suppose the stock went up tenfold. Now you got to spend $100 to buy that stock to return it to me - or $200 or $500 or $1,000. In theory, there is no limit to how much you can lose. LEFT: You can lose an infinite amount of money - infinite. SMITH: And how much is in the jar? KESTENBAUM: (Laughter) Four-hundred and six dollars and six cents. That's less than infinite. SMITH: All right, David. Let's go down the checklist of things that we need to short a stock. No. 1 - a stock we think will go down. KESTENBAUM: No check. We don't have that. SMITH: Big pile of money. KESTENBAUM: Don't have that. SMITH: And No. 3 - No. 3 - we heard about this from several people - we need a lawyer. KESTENBAUM: Andrew Left told us that he had been sued four times. And he told us about this one episode where a CEO got really, really, really mad at him. Andrew's wife noticed this black truck parked across the street. LEFT: And she went out, and they said, does Andrew Left live here? And she says yes. They made comments. We're friends of - and they said the CEO's name. SMITH: They just sat out there, outside Andrew's house in that black truck. LEFT: I called the CEO right there on the phone. I'm like, what do you think you're doing? This is Wall Street. This is business. Like, what world do you live in? What do you think - like, what world do you live in? KESTENBAUM: What did the guy say after you said that to him on the phone? LEFT: Typical thuggery-type stuff. You don't know who I am. Like, what does that mean? I know who you are. You're the CEO of a publicly traded company - like, (laughter) just nonsense. SMITH: You know, David, this is exactly the kind of drama I was worried about when we started this project because I'm a journalist, you're a journalist, kind of in our DNA is to be neutral, and the premise of this project is that we are going to bet against a company. We're going to put our money on the line saying that some company is going to fail. KESTENBAUM: And then we're going to talk about it on the radio and the podcast. SMITH: This is probably against the NPR ethics guidelines, I'm sure. KESTENBAUM: I mean, we knew this was a problem from the start, so we spent a while in the office here talking about this. And we came up with a solution that I was actually really excited about. Instead of shorting a particular company, we would short every company. We'd short the entire stock market. SMITH: Which is not as complicated as it sounds. There's a way to do this. KESTENBAUM: You know how there are index funds, which include, like, a tiny piece of lots and lots of stocks? You can buy those. Turns out you can also short them. You can bet that the entire stock market is going to go down. SMITH: And as we went back-and-forth about this, we realized that this is a perfect short because we weren't picking on some tiny, little company where some CEO is going to call us up and try and bully us. We were picking on the biggest economic target there is in the entire world. The plan would be for PLANET MONEY to short America. KESTENBAUM: We ran the idea by Sahm. ADRANGI: Yeah, that's a terrible idea. It's very dangerous, and it's a great way to lose lots of money. Basically, you know, the stock market is a reflection of the aggregate profits of all of the nation's public companies. And every year, companies make more and more profits, especially American companies because, you know, I think 40% of their revenue comes from outside of the U. S. So you're essentially shorting global corporate profits. And as long as populations are growing and there's innovation, companies are going to make more money year in, year out. KESTENBAUM: I'm shorting the whole planet. ADRANGI: Yeah, that's why it usually doesn't work. KESTENBAUM: Sahm did have a name for what we were proposing. He called it the Armageddon Trade, which sealed it for me. We definitely had to do it. SMITH: Yeah, I think he was trying to talk us out of it, but Armageddon Trade was perfect 'cause you could picture some broker somewhere saying everything great and powerful that has ever existed in the world eventually goes away - the Ottoman Empire gone, Roman Empire destroyed, dinosaurs disappeared. KESTENBAUM: The dinosaurs were before the others. (LAUGHTER)SMITH: Go with me on this. No one thought that they would fail, and they did. America can't last forever. KESTENBAUM: Sahm was not persuaded by the dinosaur argument. I ran the idea also by Andrew Left, and he was actually OK with the trade. He said the stock market could go down. If you time this right, you guys could make some money. But he was not OK with the term shorting America. He really didn't like it. LEFT: Do we have problems? Of course. We have a lot of moving parts. But as for shorting America, I just don't - I don't like the way that sounds. We are hands-down the greatest country in the world to invest in. We've really done an amazing thing in this country. KESTENBAUM: It's nice to hear a pep talk from a guy who specializes in shorting. LEFT: Yeah. Listen; that's what's part of - the amazing part about this country is the ability to short. I mean, how great is that that we live in a country that says, you know what? You can buy a stock. You don't like the stock? You can short the stock. KESTENBAUM: And that's what we did. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)STEPHEN PEARSON: E-Trade, elite client services. This is Stephen Pearson. KESTENBAUM: I did it through an E-Trade account. Because shorting can potentially cost you so much, I had to stick extra money in - not an infinite amount, but 2,000 bucks of my own money into the account just as a buffer. Then we were ready to go. I want to short something. PEARSON: All right. KESTENBAUM: I want to short the entire stock market. PEARSON: The entire stock market? Well. . . KESTENBAUM: Stephen said, I'm not sure we can short the entire stock market, but we can come close. He said there's this thing that tracks the S&P 500. It has a little slice of the 500 largest stocks in it. Great, I said, let's short that. A minute later, it was done. PEARSON: All right. I've got that trade placed for you. SMITH: America, your bad news is now our good news. KESTENBAUM: In fact, by the end of the call, the stock market had gone down and we made a little money. SMITH: How much? KESTENBAUM: Eighty cents. It's a start. (SOUNDBITE OF ANDREW PETER KINGSLOW'S \"FRENCH QUARTER BOOGALOO\")FOUNTAIN: On the next show, we're going to find out how Robert and David did. And they'll tell the story of what, as far as we can tell, was the very first short ever. It was a surprisingly long time ago, and it does not work out well for the guy trying to do it. Let's just say it gets a mention on his gravestone. If you liked today's show and want to support us, help us grow. Send the podcast to a friend. If you have questions or complaints or whatever, we're at planetmoney@npr. org, or we're on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram. Some surprisingly good stuff on there. Today's show was produced by Jess Jiang originally. The rerun was produced by Rachel Cohn. SMITH: I'm Robert Smith. KESTENBAUM: I'm David Kestenbaum. FOUNTAIN: And I'm Nick Fountain. This is NPR. Thanks for listening. NICK FOUNTAIN, BYLINE: Here at PLANET MONEY, in the NPR offices in New York, we have this little museum with a bunch of memorabilia from different episodes across the years. There is the PLANET MONEY T-shirt, a Santa hat, a little vial of oil, another little vial of gold and. . . (SOUNDBITE OF COINS CLINKING) FOUNTAIN: . . . This. It's a jar - looks like it was once a peanut butter jar. And on the side of it is this label. It says PLANET MONEY investment fund. And there is a handful of bills in it - a five, a 50, oh. Every few years at PLANET MONEY, we take this money, and we make investments with it - some would say somewhat questionable investments. One of our favorite experiments we did back in 2015. We did a few shows on it, and the first one of those we're going to replay today. Here it is. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) DAVID KESTENBAUM, HOST:  So I had this moment the other day where I realized that basically every penny I own - it's all a bet in one direction. It's all a bet that everything is going to get better. Like, I own a house, right? That is a bet that real estate is going to go up. ROBERT SMITH, HOST:  And, you know, it's sort of crazy because you are a guy who is normally pretty cynical about life. KESTENBAUM: (Laughter) I looked - my entire retirement account, right? It's, like, stocks and bonds. Stocks are a bet that a company is going to be worth more. A bond is a loan to some municipality that's going to build, like, a sewage treatment facility. It's a bet that that's going to work out; they're going to pay me back. SMITH: No one would call you Little Mary Sunshine, and yet, you are doing what everyone else in America does, which is to bet that things are just going to get better. And historically, like, that is not the worst bet in the world. KESTENBAUM: No, it's a totally fine bet. It just struck me as odd all of a sudden because there is this other bet you can make, right? You can bet in the opposite direction. You can make a bet that will pay off when things go badly. SMITH: And perhaps you've heard us talk about this before. It is called a short, a short sell. So if you short Apple stock, you're basically betting that Apple stock is going to be worth less in a month or two months or a year. KESTENBAUM: And if it goes down - everyone else is crying; they're very, very sad - you get to celebrate. Their loss is your gain. SMITH: And, you know, it's not actually that hard to short something. I mean, you can do it online. Anywhere where you can buy stocks, you can also short stocks. And yet, for the most part, nobody does it. KESTENBAUM: We decided we would. We would short something. We consulted a bunch of experts. They told us not to do it. They said there are some very, very good reasons people don't short. Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm David Kestenbaum. SMITH: And I'm Robert Smith. Today on the show, we ignore the advice of some very smart people and we short something. We're going to put our money down on a bet against something that everybody loves. (SOUNDBITE OF DANIEL TEPER'S \"FLINGING ABOUT\") KESTENBAUM: Longtime listeners will know that we have a little bit of money set aside for moments like this. I like to call it the PLANET MONEY investment fund. SMITH: Also known as the world's least-successful hedge fund. KESTENBAUM: The world's smallest hedge fund. Back in 2010, I think it was, we all put 200 bucks in each, total of $1,000. First, we bought a toxic asset, one of those mortgage things that almost brought down the global economy. SMITH: Toxic. KESTENBAUM: We lost half our money on that. Then Jacob and I took what was left and we bought gold. We actually bought a gold coin. We lost some more money. That was, like, three years ago. I put whatever we had left in a locked cabinet here, and we basically forgot about it until last week. Robert? SMITH: Yes, sir. KESTENBAUM: You want to see how much money we have left in the PLANET MONEY investment fund? SMITH: Oh, yeah, totally. Wait; where is it? KESTENBAUM: It's in the locker here. SMITH: (Laughter) I'm surprised it's under lock and key. (SOUNDBITE OF LOCKER OPENING) KESTENBAUM: I think this is the key. It's in a jar here. SMITH: It's in a jar? KESTENBAUM: Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF LOCKER CLOSING) SMITH: (Laughter) Wait; what is there, like, $6 in there? (SOUNDBITE OF COINS RUSTLING) SMITH: Come on. KESTENBAUM: And a note. I have a confession. A couple years ago, I needed cash. I didn't have time to go to an ATM, so I got the money out of the jar. I did put a little note there, but looking at it today, like, I don't know exactly what I meant by the note. There are two numbers there. One is crossed out. I'm pretty sure we have $406. 06 left in the fund. SMITH: You are the worst. I can't believe this. All right, man. PLANET MONEY jar is back in effect. (SOUNDBITE OF COINS CLINKING) SMITH: Put the lid on. And this is it. Let's see if we can - let's see if we can make it all back. KESTENBAUM: There's no way we're making it all back. SMITH: (Laughter) It is theoretically possible. And the reason why we wanted to pick shorting is, really, we have done podcasts on shorting before, and economists are always talking about this as this important part of the financial market - that it helps stocks from becoming too hyped. It keeps bubbles from forming. KESTENBAUM: But I really had no idea how it really worked. I certainly didn't know, like, what we should short or how to do it. So we went to consult an expert - one of the experts. This guy's name is Andrew Left. He used to write a newsletter. The title was StockLemon, though he changed the title. ANDREW LEFT: Well, StockLemon was very tongue-in-cheek. I thought I just needed more of a highbrow name. SMITH: The new name - I love it - Citron Research. KESTENBAUM: Andrew's been at this for over a decade. He's the guy that when CNBC needs to get a short seller on, they often grab him. SMITH: And he's great on the air because he's betting against things that other people love. You know those little cameras that if you go skiing, you see everyone has these little cameras on top of their helmets - GoPro? KESTENBAUM: GoPro, yeah. SMITH: He short GoPro. He short Tesla, another company a lot of people love. KESTENBAUM: And Green Mountain Coffee. SMITH: Yeah, those little, tiny K-Cups that you put in the. . . KESTENBAUM: Oh, that's what those are. SMITH: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. KESTENBAUM: So we asked his advice. Suppose someone with almost no investment experience and very little money came up to you and said, I want to try to short a stock. LEFT: No, don't do it. KESTENBAUM: Why? LEFT: It's not - it's a very skilled form of investing. It really is not for the average investor. It's dangerous. You could lose too much money doing it. The forces of Wall Street are against you. It's not worth it. Do something else. KESTENBAUM: You know, when we went into this, I sort of thought that shorting a stock was just the opposite of buying a stock. You know, instead of betting that a stock is going to go up, you're just betting that it's going to go down. But as we dug into it, I realized it is not. It is a completely different animal in just about every way. SMITH: Yeah, there's all these hurdles you have to go through, I think both mentally and financially, before you can short a stock. I mean, the first one is the most basic thing, which is - OK, most stocks seem to go up over time. You have to find a company that is different. You have to find a company where you know something that no one else knows. You have to find a company that you hope will plunge in value. KESTENBAUM: You got to find something like this guy found. SAHM ADRANGI: My name is Sahm Adrangi. I'm the chief investment officer of Kerrisdale Capital. SMITH: Sahm is another famous short seller. He is 33 years old. And for a 33-year-old, he has a very large coin jar. His hedge fund has over a quarter-billion dollars under management. KESTENBAUM: His offices were a few blocks away. We went over to talk to him - very un-fancy. Sahm sat down in this little conference room, and he coached us on how to pick a stock to bet against. He told us this one perfect little story, a best-case scenario, about this one company that he'd found to short. SMITH: This is back in 2010, and Sahm is poking around, looking at certain Chinese companies. Chinese companies were just starting to be listed on U. S. stock exchanges. And he found this one company that had a business model like Princeton Review. They basically coached Chinese students on how to pass entrance exams for college. KESTENBAUM: The company was called China Education Alliance. It was offering these classes and selling these sample tests online. And Sahm looked at the website. It looked OK to him, but he couldn't read Chinese. So he got a guy who could read Chinese to actually try it out, and he found something weird. ADRANGI: And what he came back with was - can't - couldn't actually purchase any products. Despite the fact that this business generated half of its sales from selling, testing out website - its website was completely nonfunctional. SMITH: Wait; they couldn't, like, order anything or put in a credit card? ADRANGI: Yeah, so when you tried to go to the part of the website where you would put in your credit card, an error screen popped up. SMITH: Very, very suspicious. But, you know, the company did say that it taught classes in person. So he decided to check on that, too. KESTENBAUM: So this was harder to check because the building where the classes were taught were in this northern province of China near the border with Russia. But Sahm found a guy to go check it out. Like, he found a freelancer through one of these websites where people say, I'll do odd jobs. Sahm paid the guy $1,000, which he was very excited about, and asked him to go check out the building. ADRANGI: And we asked him to take a camera. So he went there and saw that it was a completely vacant building. When you went to each of the floors - there were six floors - there were no chairs, there were no chalkboards. It was just a completely vacant building. SMITH: So think about this for a moment. There is a company that everyone loves, that everyone thinks is doing this gangbusters business, and Sahm knows something unique. He knows that this company isn't doing anything. Sahm thinks it's a fraud. KESTENBAUM: A perfect stock to short. Now, Sahm warned us. He said, like, if you find something you think is like this, you have to be really careful. You have to do your research because what's about to happen next can be a total roller coaster, though the actual act of shorting a stock turns out to be very simple. ADRANGI: It's just a matter of pressing the red button instead of the green button on your account. KESTENBAUM: Was it really just a button - a red button you press? ADRANGI: It is a red button, yeah. I think it was. Or it might say short. KESTENBAUM: Do you remember how it felt pressing that button? ADRANGI: You know, slightly dangerous (laughter). KESTENBAUM: If you're a normal investor and you buy a stock, you can just sit back and wait for the company to succeed, right? They have a PR team out there. The company itself is trying to make the case that it's going to be great. But if you short a company, you got to go out there and make the case that it's overvalued. Sahm had bet against China Education Alliance, but he was only going to make money if the stock price dropped. So he shouted it to the world. He posted a video of the empty building online. And he and his team wrote this really detailed report that they put out there basically saying the company was a fraud. ADRANGI: I think we released it around 10 a. m. on November 30, 2010. And within two hours, the stock had declined 50%. SMITH: He ended up making a bunch of money. And we asked Sahm, you know, how did it feel? And he was like, good. Like, no, seriously, like, were you dancing? Did you pop Champagne? I mean, you had just brought down a company and made a fortune. And he's like, no, no, not really. KESTENBAUM: We asked it, like, 10 different times. And I think, basically, he's a pretty even-keeled kind of guy. But I also think there's this other going on, which is really another way in which shorting is totally different from normal investing. Your profit is really everyone else's loss. There were lots of other people who had invested in this company hoping the stock price was going to go up. And now, thanks to Sahm, it had collapsed. I get that it felt weird to celebrate. ADRANGI: Yeah, it's a bit bad form. I mean, I think there's a lot of investors that, you know, become blindsided when we put out these reports. And these guys don't like us for losing the money. We'll say, you know, you were investing in a company that was committing fraud and so you should be blaming the management instead of us, but most guys blame us. SMITH: There are so many reasons not to become a short seller. I mean, we have to be ready to be hated by everyone, David. We have to have some sort of special, secret knowledge that we're 100% sure of. KESTENBAUM: You're leaving out the best thing. This is a very practical point that Andrew Left made. LEFT: You can lose an infinite amount of money - infinite. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SMITH: I feel like we should just pause on that - infinite. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SMITH: This is probably the major reason that people don't short, because - let's just say that you are an optimist, that you're buying stock in a company that you hope will go up, and it goes down, right? What's the most you could lose if you buy $100 worth of stock? You could lose $100. But if you short sell, it is completely different. KESTENBAUM: When you short a stock, what you're actually doing is - here, I'll spell it out. You borrow the stock, then you sell it in the hopes that you can buy it back at a lower price and return it. Got it? (Laughter) So I know Jacob hates it when we do this, but let's demonstrate. SMITH: We got to do it. KESTENBAUM: I think it's going to actually help. Robert, you have an actual stock. SMITH: Yeah. And until I got this in the mail, I didn't know that they still made. . . KESTENBAUM: What is it? SMITH: . . . Paper stocks anymore. This is a paper stock certificate for a small community bank in Pennsylvania. It is a gift to my daughters from their grandmother, in theory, I suppose, to pay for part of their education. KESTENBAUM: All right. So say I, for whatever reason, want to short this lovely little bank. Here's how it would work. First, I need to borrow a share from someone who has one. SMITH: I got one. KESTENBAUM: Give it to me. Thank you. I have to give it back to you at some point. SMITH: Oh, yeah. It's for my kids. KESTENBAUM: All right. So I take this borrowed stock, and I sell it. So say the price right now is 10 bucks a share. I pocket that 10 bucks. Now, I got to give you a share of the bank stock back at some point. SMITH: Damn straight. KESTENBAUM: So I wait. Hopefully, the stock price drops. Then - great - I can buy one back cheap, hopefully for, like, you know, pennies. Then I return the stock to you, and we're done. I made a profit - almost 10 bucks. SMITH: So that's the rosy scenario for you. Now the, as Andrew Left put it, the infinite-amount-of-money scenario. KESTENBAUM: Starts the same way. OK, let me borrow the stock. All right. I sell it for 10 bucks, and I wait. But this time, instead of the stock price dropping, let's say it goes up. And let's say it goes way up. Like, the bank has an incredible year. Some big investor comes in, wants it to expand. And say the stock price goes up to, like, 50 bucks. SMITH: Now you are screwed, David Kestenbaum, because you owe me that stock and you have to buy that stock and it's at $50. You have lost a ton of money. Or suppose the stock went up tenfold. Now you got to spend $100 to buy that stock to return it to me - or $200 or $500 or $1,000. In theory, there is no limit to how much you can lose. LEFT: You can lose an infinite amount of money - infinite. SMITH: And how much is in the jar? KESTENBAUM: (Laughter) Four-hundred and six dollars and six cents. That's less than infinite. SMITH: All right, David. Let's go down the checklist of things that we need to short a stock. No. 1 - a stock we think will go down. KESTENBAUM: No check. We don't have that. SMITH: Big pile of money. KESTENBAUM: Don't have that. SMITH: And No. 3 - No. 3 - we heard about this from several people - we need a lawyer. KESTENBAUM: Andrew Left told us that he had been sued four times. And he told us about this one episode where a CEO got really, really, really mad at him. Andrew's wife noticed this black truck parked across the street. LEFT: And she went out, and they said, does Andrew Left live here? And she says yes. They made comments. We're friends of - and they said the CEO's name. SMITH: They just sat out there, outside Andrew's house in that black truck. LEFT: I called the CEO right there on the phone. I'm like, what do you think you're doing? This is Wall Street. This is business. Like, what world do you live in? What do you think - like, what world do you live in? KESTENBAUM: What did the guy say after you said that to him on the phone? LEFT: Typical thuggery-type stuff. You don't know who I am. Like, what does that mean? I know who you are. You're the CEO of a publicly traded company - like, (laughter) just nonsense. SMITH: You know, David, this is exactly the kind of drama I was worried about when we started this project because I'm a journalist, you're a journalist, kind of in our DNA is to be neutral, and the premise of this project is that we are going to bet against a company. We're going to put our money on the line saying that some company is going to fail. KESTENBAUM: And then we're going to talk about it on the radio and the podcast. SMITH: This is probably against the NPR ethics guidelines, I'm sure. KESTENBAUM: I mean, we knew this was a problem from the start, so we spent a while in the office here talking about this. And we came up with a solution that I was actually really excited about. Instead of shorting a particular company, we would short every company. We'd short the entire stock market. SMITH: Which is not as complicated as it sounds. There's a way to do this. KESTENBAUM: You know how there are index funds, which include, like, a tiny piece of lots and lots of stocks? You can buy those. Turns out you can also short them. You can bet that the entire stock market is going to go down. SMITH: And as we went back-and-forth about this, we realized that this is a perfect short because we weren't picking on some tiny, little company where some CEO is going to call us up and try and bully us. We were picking on the biggest economic target there is in the entire world. The plan would be for PLANET MONEY to short America. KESTENBAUM: We ran the idea by Sahm. ADRANGI: Yeah, that's a terrible idea. It's very dangerous, and it's a great way to lose lots of money. Basically, you know, the stock market is a reflection of the aggregate profits of all of the nation's public companies. And every year, companies make more and more profits, especially American companies because, you know, I think 40% of their revenue comes from outside of the U. S. So you're essentially shorting global corporate profits. And as long as populations are growing and there's innovation, companies are going to make more money year in, year out. KESTENBAUM: I'm shorting the whole planet. ADRANGI: Yeah, that's why it usually doesn't work. KESTENBAUM: Sahm did have a name for what we were proposing. He called it the Armageddon Trade, which sealed it for me. We definitely had to do it. SMITH: Yeah, I think he was trying to talk us out of it, but Armageddon Trade was perfect 'cause you could picture some broker somewhere saying everything great and powerful that has ever existed in the world eventually goes away - the Ottoman Empire gone, Roman Empire destroyed, dinosaurs disappeared. KESTENBAUM: The dinosaurs were before the others. (LAUGHTER) SMITH: Go with me on this. No one thought that they would fail, and they did. America can't last forever. KESTENBAUM: Sahm was not persuaded by the dinosaur argument. I ran the idea also by Andrew Left, and he was actually OK with the trade. He said the stock market could go down. If you time this right, you guys could make some money. But he was not OK with the term shorting America. He really didn't like it. LEFT: Do we have problems? Of course. We have a lot of moving parts. But as for shorting America, I just don't - I don't like the way that sounds. We are hands-down the greatest country in the world to invest in. We've really done an amazing thing in this country. KESTENBAUM: It's nice to hear a pep talk from a guy who specializes in shorting. LEFT: Yeah. Listen; that's what's part of - the amazing part about this country is the ability to short. I mean, how great is that that we live in a country that says, you know what? You can buy a stock. You don't like the stock? You can short the stock. KESTENBAUM: And that's what we did. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING) STEPHEN PEARSON: E-Trade, elite client services. This is Stephen Pearson. KESTENBAUM: I did it through an E-Trade account. Because shorting can potentially cost you so much, I had to stick extra money in - not an infinite amount, but 2,000 bucks of my own money into the account just as a buffer. Then we were ready to go.

But how does that land get used? The co-hosts of NPR's daily economics podcast The Indicator, Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia, use a familiar fast-food meal to answer that question. CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE: The U. S. is enormous. It's hundreds of millions of acres big, and it's full of resources, not to mention some of the most productive land on Earth. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE: And this got us thinking. The U. S. has all of this land, and it's been such an amazing resource for the country and for the economy. How exactly are we using this resource? And Cardiff, I will present you with the object that I think best represents how we use land in the U. S. But, first, I want to speak with Lauren Leatherby. She's a data journalist from Bloomberg News. And she went through the reports issued from the U. S. Department of Agriculture. It's about 1. 9 billion acres of land that we're dealing with, entirely. What was the biggest use of land in the U. S. ? LAUREN LEATHERBY: Cattle. VANEK SMITH: Cattle (laughter). LEATHERBY: Just livestock in general. About 41% was used for either grazing or to grow food for livestock - was, really, pretty surprising to us. VANEK SMITH: What was the second biggest use of land in the U. S. ? LEATHERBY: Forestland. And that's a combination of unprotected forestland, which means that it's not a part of a national park or state park, and about 14% was owned by corporations. But it was quite striking to see this massive chunk of the U. S. designated as forestland, and about 2% of that goes away and then comes back every year (laughter) - gets replanted. VANEK SMITH: (Laughter). But that still leaves us with about 700 million acres. So what is the third biggest use of land in the U. S. ? LEATHERBY: So that's cropland. Cropland is about a fifth of the U. S. But what's interesting is that the amount of food that we eat from all of that cropland, a lot of it is used for livestock. And so that's corn for livestock, soy for livestock. VANEK SMITH: All told, that is nearly 1. 6 billion acres of land for just those three uses. And then we get to a relatively small category, which is urban areas. LEATHERBY: That's by far the fastest growing. In the past 10 years, it's been growing at a rate of about 1 million acres per year. So that's the size of about Phoenix and LA and Houston combined, every year, growing in urban area. VANEK SMITH: After going over the land use data myself, I came up with this object that I think really represents in one word - I guess it's actually two words - how we use land in the U. S. It's a Happy Meal. OK, so the main events of the Happy Meal is of course the beef burger. GARCIA: Yes. VANEK SMITH: And this is of course the largest use of land in the U. S. - that is, cow pasture - 654 million acres, plus the feed for the livestock, which is 127. 4 million acres. And then of course there is the paper that the Happy Meal box is made out of. That is the second largest use of land in the U. S. - unprotected forest. That's 538. 6 million acres. Wheat for the bun - 21. 5 million acres. Also in the box - the fries. A million acres of potatoes are grown in the U. S. But also, private land ownership, which is also on the rise. Most of the top landowners in the U. S. are cattle ranchers and oil barons. So if we add all of these things up together, that is roughly 1. 5 billion acres of land of the 1. 9 billion available all wrapped up in this Happy Meal. GARCIA: Cardiff Garcia. VANEK SMITH: Stacey Vanek Smith, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  There are 1. 9 billion acres of land in the continental United States. But how does that land get used? The co-hosts of NPR's daily economics podcast The Indicator, Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia, use a familiar fast-food meal to answer that question. CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE: The U. S. is enormous. It's hundreds of millions of acres big, and it's full of resources, not to mention some of the most productive land on Earth. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE: And this got us thinking. The U. S. has all of this land, and it's been such an amazing resource for the country and for the economy. How exactly are we using this resource? And Cardiff, I will present you with the object that I think best represents how we use land in the U. S. But, first, I want to speak with Lauren Leatherby. She's a data journalist from Bloomberg News. And she went through the reports issued from the U. S. Department of Agriculture. It's about 1. 9 billion acres of land that we're dealing with, entirely. What was the biggest use of land in the U. S. ? LAUREN LEATHERBY: Cattle. VANEK SMITH: Cattle (laughter). LEATHERBY: Just livestock in general. About 41% was used for either grazing or to grow food for livestock - was, really, pretty surprising to us. VANEK SMITH: What was the second biggest use of land in the U. S. ? LEATHERBY: Forestland. And that's a combination of unprotected forestland, which means that it's not a part of a national park or state park, and about 14% was owned by corporations. But it was quite striking to see this massive chunk of the U. S. designated as forestland, and about 2% of that goes away and then comes back every year (laughter) - gets replanted. VANEK SMITH: (Laughter). But that still leaves us with about 700 million acres. So what is the third biggest use of land in the U. S. ? LEATHERBY: So that's cropland. Cropland is about a fifth of the U. S. But what's interesting is that the amount of food that we eat from all of that cropland, a lot of it is used for livestock. And so that's corn for livestock, soy for livestock. VANEK SMITH: All told, that is nearly 1. 6 billion acres of land for just those three uses. And then we get to a relatively small category, which is urban areas. LEATHERBY: That's by far the fastest growing. In the past 10 years, it's been growing at a rate of about 1 million acres per year. So that's the size of about Phoenix and LA and Houston combined, every year, growing in urban area. VANEK SMITH: After going over the land use data myself, I came up with this object that I think really represents in one word - I guess it's actually two words - how we use land in the U. S. It's a Happy Meal. OK, so the main events of the Happy Meal is of course the beef burger. GARCIA: Yes. VANEK SMITH: And this is of course the largest use of land in the U.

Most analysts do not predict calamity, but many do see a trend of slower growth. And that's different from the Trump administration's promise of economic boom times. NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Part of what appears to be happening is that those Republican tax cuts from a year and a half ago, if they were giving the economy a boost, that's wearing off. That wasn't what was supposed to happen, according to President Trump. Here he is talking before boarding an aircraft back in 2017 when he was pushing for those tax cuts. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The economy now has hit 3%. Nobody thought it would be anywhere close. I think we can go to four, five and maybe even 6% ultimately. Each percentage point is two and a half trillion dollars. We are back. We're really going to start to rock. ARNOLD: Each percentage point of GDP growth is actually way less than that. That number isn't right. But the promise was clear. BETSEY STEVENSON: What Donald Trump was talking about there is he believed that the tax cuts would unleash unprecedented investment by businesses that would set forth a stream of growth well into the future. ARNOLD: That's Betsey Stevenson, a University of Michigan economist who was an adviser in the Obama White House. She says this wave of business investment sparking a new era of remarkable growth, that didn't happen. And in this latest report, spending by businesses actually was particularly weak. STEVENSON: And that's where the tax cuts have been really disappointing. ARNOLD: Now, in 2018, the economy did manage about 3% growth. That was better than most of the prior decade, which averaged closer to around 2%. But now, many economists say the trend is heading back down, and they're predicting a return to that more ho-hum rate of growth. Now, 2% versus 3% growth, is that even such a big deal? STEVENSON: Two to 3%, that sounds like, oh, that's just small. ARNOLD: Stevenson says, though, it's actually a huge difference. Three percent growth is 50% faster than 2% growth, right? STEVENSON: Fifty percent faster growth. ARNOLD: I see. So it's like, you know, driving down the freeway at 40 miles an hour or driving at 60. You're getting where you're going a lot quicker. STEVENSON: Yeah, that's a great analogy. If you look back over 10 years, you're going to be in a very different place if we were growing at 3% than if we were growing at 2%. ARNOLD: Meaning more money flowing into businesses, which could lift wages, standard of living. But again, that burst of 3% growth appears to be fizzling. Still, all this is not to say that the economy is terrible. In fact, most analysts agree that these latest GDP numbers were reassuring, given all the headwinds - slower growth in Europe, trade fights and tariffs. Randy Kroszner is a former governor of the Federal Reserve Board. RANDY KROSZNER: The GDP report shows that the U. S. economy is growing pretty solidly. There have been lots of concerns that we're about to go off the cliff. No evidence that we're going off the cliff. ARNOLD: Consumer spending was strong. And even if we are returning to slower growth, Betsey Stevenson says what most people probably care most about is their jobs. STEVENSON: The labor market is still really strong. Unemployment is low and has been low for a long time. We're starting to see some wage gains. And what's clear is it's a really good time for workers to be finding a job, asking for a raise.

The move is designed to give a boost to the slowing U. S. economy and extend the decade-long economic expansion. Although the Fed's action was widely telegraphed in advance, the stock market reacted negatively. Major indices fell more than 1%. NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now to explain the Fed action. Welcome back to the studio. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good to be with you. CORNISH: Scott, by most outward appearances, the U. S. economy seems to be in pretty good shape. We've got unemployment near a 50-year low. Employers have been hiring workers at a steady clip. Do I have that right? I mean, why did the Fed need to cut interest rates? HORSLEY: We have seen some slowdown in economic growth. We learned last week that the economy grew at an annual rate of just 2. 1% in the spring. That's down from 3. 1% earlier this year. We've also seen a slowdown in manufacturing, partly because of the various trade tensions that are underway. We've also seen slower growth overseas. With all that, though, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell did not characterize this rate cut as a rescue effort for an ailing economy. Rather, he described the economy as relatively healthy and said the Fed's cutting rates in an effort to keep it that way. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEROME POWELL: There really is no reason why the expansion can't keep going. Inflation is not troublingly high. If you look at the U. S. economy right now, there's no sector that's booming and, therefore, might bust. HORSLEY: Ordinarily, when we have unemployment this low, we might expect to see the Fed raising rates to ward off inflation. And in fact, the Fed was doing that as recently as December. But inflation has stayed really low - in fact, too low as far as the Fed's concerned. So the central bank does have room to lean on the side of goosing the economy. CORNISH: At the same time, the stock market fell. So what are the markets telling us? HORSLEY: It's a little puzzling because, you know, the Fed did almost exactly what everyone was predicting it would do. At first, when the news broke, there was actually a little market reaction. It was while Powell was holding his news conference about a half-hour later that we saw a pretty rapid slide in the market. Investors seemed to be unhappy with Powell's suggestion that the Fed might cut rates this one time and then be done when the market would like to see additional rate cuts. Powell did, however, backtrack a bit and left the door open for additional cuts if economic conditions warrant. CORNISH: How did the president's comments figure into the Fed's decision? - because Trump has been agitating for a rate cut for months now. HORSLEY: Right. The central bank insists it's not responding to the president's comments but rather to what's happening in the economy. But Powell also says he and his colleagues aren't going to hesitate to cut interest rates just because that's what the president's asked for, just to kind of show they're willing to stand up to Trump. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)POWELL: We never take into account political considerations. There's no place in our discussions for that. We also don't conduct monetary policy in order to prove our independence. HORSLEY: The Fed is keeping an eye on what other central banks around the world are doing. The president's been complaining that other central banks are cutting their interest rates and giving a boost to their economies. And in Trump's mind, that comes at the expense of the U. S. , so he's wanted the Fed to do the same. Not everybody on the Fed's rate-setting committee was in agreement about today's rate cut. Two Fed officials voted to leave rates where they were. CORNISH: In the end, what does this mean for ordinary Americans? HORSLEY: This will mean slightly lower interest rates on things like car loans and credit cards. Mortgage rates, which tend to follow the bond market, have already fallen. So in a sense, the Fed's just sort of catching up to what's happening in the mortgage market. Consumer spending does account for more than two-thirds of the U. S. economy, so it's - this is an important leg of the economy that's being propped up here. But, you know, consumer spending was already pretty strong. The weak spot in recent months has been business investment, so we'll have to see if this rate cut helps to stimulate business spending in a way that prolongs the expansion. Powell is determined to do that because he says there are a lot of Americans who are only now beginning to feel the fruits of economic growth, even though it's been underway for more than a decade. CORNISH: That's NPR's Scott Horsley. Scott, thanks for explaining it. HORSLEY: You're welcome. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  The Federal Reserve cut interest rates today for the first time in over a decade.

It's a move the Fed normally makes when the economy is slow or crashing. So why make this move after a decade of economic growth? David Wessel is with us next. He is director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution. David, good morning. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: I got to note the Fed just raised rates in December, which is the kind of move you would expect. Why do they go the other way now? WESSEL: Right. I mean, not only did they raise rates in December, but they suggested they want to keep raising rates this year. And now they're doing the opposite. I think there are at least three reasons. One is the Fed is implicitly saying that it made a mistake in December. The economy's doing OK now, but the Fed thought it would be doing even better. I mean, consumer spending has been pretty good. Wages are rising a little bit, finally. But manufacturing is weak. Housing isn't doing as well as you'd expect with mortgage rates low. And business investment is particularly disappointing. Second, the Fed expected inflation to be moving convincingly up to its 2% target, and it hasn't. And they want to be sure that inflation and, importantly, public and market expectations of inflation don't slide down towards zero. And third, I mean, as they look ahead, which is what they have to do, there are a lot of things to worry about out there. From China to Europe, the rest of the world's economies are slowing down, some of them precipitously. That has negative effects on us. And President Trump's trade war is hurting U. S. exports and, I think, depressing business sentiment and business willingness to invest. So in a sense, they're taking out insurance against a really bad outcome even though right now the economy feels pretty good. INSKEEP: Taking out insurance against the president. And yet, they are doing with interest rates exactly what the president wants. He's been complaining constantly about the Fed for quite some time. And he said again what he wanted yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I would like to see a large cut. And I'd like to see immediately the quantitative tightening stop. It should be stopped. For them to have done quantitative tightening and also higher interest rates simultaneously, I think, was a big mistake. INSKEEP: OK. I'd like to see a large cut in interest rates. Now, the Fed seems poised to go ahead with roughly what the president has been demanding on interest rates anyway. Is there any evidence to suggest the Fed is just doing what the president demanded to rev up the economy right before an election - just to put it out there in the most blunt way? WESSEL: Yeah. Well, I don't think so, but I know that a lot of people will assume that's happening. And there's, like, no way for the Fed to escape the implication that they're succumbing to the pressure from the Fed. Think what - the way that people at the Fed talk about it is our job is to keep the economy humming with low and stable inflation. And that means that sometimes we have to cut interest rates to protect the economy when there are disturbances, even if those disturbances are created by the president or the Congress. So in a sense, he's creating the conditions or helping to create the conditions that lead them to think that a rate cut is necessary. But I think they're very determined to say, we're doing it because this is our reading of the economy, not because we've been reading the President's tweets. And a lot of people won't believe them. INSKEEP: Why is the president focused not only on interest rates but on the strength of the U. S. dollar relative to other currencies? WESSEL: Well, the dollar has been pretty strong lately. And the president worries about that because he understands that when the dollar goes up, that hurts our exports, makes them more expensive for foreign customers. And that makes the trade deficit wider, and he worries about the trade deficit. Now, you'd expect a rising dollar when the U. S. economy is doing better than other economies, and that's the case now. But part of what's going on is other countries are cutting interest rates. And as they cut their interest rates, that tends to pull their currency down against ours. And so the Fed has to keep up with them. So there - he's got a point there that interest rates have something to do in exchange rates. And if the Fed doesn't cut interest rates today and doesn't signal they're going to do more, then the dollar will be strong. And that'll hurt the trade deficit, which he cares about. INSKEEP: David, you mentioned that the experts at the Fed now think they made a mistake to raise interest rates. Even a decade into an economic expansion, too early to raise interest rates, is what they're finding out. Are we learning that the economy has fundamentally changed from what people thought it was and how people thought it worked? WESSEL: Yes, I think we are. I mean, interest rates around the world - not only the ones that the Fed and the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan set, the short-term rates - but the longer term rates set in the bond markets are very low by historical standards, partly because we don't have very much inflation. But it's also worrisome. It's a sign that the outlook for the global economy and growth is distressingly poor. And it has a number of implications. One of them is that it's going to be much harder for the Fed to fight the next recession because they won't have very much margin to cut interest rates. They usually cut them about 4 percentage points. It's only at 2 1/2% now. INSKEEP: David, thanks so much. WESSEL: You're welcome. INSKEEP: David Wessel of the Brookings Institution. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Later today, the Federal Reserve will likely cut interest rates. It's a move the Fed normally makes when the economy is slow or crashing.

And business investment is particularly disappointing. Second, the Fed expected inflation to be moving convincingly up to its 2% target, and it hasn't. And they want to be sure that inflation and, importantly, public and market expectations of inflation don't slide down towards zero. And third, I mean, as they look ahead, which is what they have to do, there are a lot of things to worry about out there. From China to Europe, the rest of the world's economies are slowing down, some of them precipitously. That has negative effects on us. And President Trump's trade war is hurting U. S. exports and, I think, depressing business sentiment and business willingness to invest. So in a sense, they're taking out insurance against a really bad outcome even though right now the economy feels pretty good. INSKEEP: Taking out insurance against the president. And yet, they are doing with interest rates exactly what the president wants. He's been complaining constantly about the Fed for quite some time. And he said again what he wanted yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I would like to see a large cut. And I'd like to see immediately the quantitative tightening stop. It should be stopped. For them to have done quantitative tightening and also higher interest rates simultaneously, I think, was a big mistake. INSKEEP: OK. I'd like to see a large cut in interest rates. Now, the Fed seems poised to go ahead with roughly what the president has been demanding on interest rates anyway. Is there any evidence to suggest the Fed is just doing what the president demanded to rev up the economy right before an election - just to put it out there in the most blunt way? WESSEL: Yeah. Well, I don't think so, but I know that a lot of people will assume that's happening. And there's, like, no way for the Fed to escape the implication that they're succumbing to the pressure from the Fed. Think what - the way that people at the Fed talk about it is our job is to keep the economy humming with low and stable inflation. And that means that sometimes we have to cut interest rates to protect the economy when there are disturbances, even if those disturbances are created by the president or the Congress. So in a sense, he's creating the conditions or helping to create the conditions that lead them to think that a rate cut is necessary. But I think they're very determined to say, we're doing it because this is our reading of the economy, not because we've been reading the President's tweets. And a lot of people won't believe them. INSKEEP: Why is the president focused not only on interest rates but on the strength of the U. S. dollar relative to other currencies? WESSEL: Well, the dollar has been pretty strong lately. And the president worries about that because he understands that when the dollar goes up, that hurts our exports, makes them more expensive for foreign customers. And that makes the trade deficit wider, and he worries about the trade deficit. Now, you'd expect a rising dollar when the U. S. economy is doing better than other economies, and that's the case now. But part of what's going on is other countries are cutting interest rates. And as they cut their interest rates, that tends to pull their currency down against ours. And so the Fed has to keep up with them. So there - he's got a point there that interest rates have something to do in exchange rates. And if the Fed doesn't cut interest rates today and doesn't signal they're going to do more, then the dollar will be strong. And that'll hurt the trade deficit, which he cares about. INSKEEP: David, you mentioned that the experts at the Fed now think they made a mistake to raise interest rates. Even a decade into an economic expansion, too early to raise interest rates, is what they're finding out. Are we learning that the economy has fundamentally changed from what people thought it was and how people thought it worked? WESSEL: Yes, I think we are. I mean, interest rates around the world - not only the ones that the Fed and the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan set, the short-term rates - but the longer term rates set in the bond markets are very low by historical standards, partly because we don't have very much inflation. But it's also worrisome. It's a sign that the outlook for the global economy and growth is distressingly poor. And it has a number of implications. One of them is that it's going to be much harder for the Fed to fight the next recession because they won't have very much margin to cut interest rates. They usually cut them about 4 percentage points. It's only at 2 1/2% now. INSKEEP: David, thanks so much. WESSEL: You're welcome.

That's according to retailers who warn the tariffs would apply to a broad swath of consumer items, from electronics to tennis shoes. Rising trade tensions with China prompted another sell-off on Wall Street today, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 100 points. NPR's Scott Horsley has more. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: More than 40% of all the clothes sold in the United States are made in China. China also makes nearly 70% of all the shoes sold here and 88% of the toys. These items have been largely untouched by the tariffs President Trump has already imposed on China over the last year. But trade analyst Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics says they'll almost certainly be on the target list if the president makes good on his threat to impose new tariffs September 1. CHAD BOWN: What really does set this list of products apart from all of the earlier tariffs are, it's basically consumer goods - clothing and toys, iPhones - all of that stuff has been shielded so far, and that's what's likely on the list this time around. HORSLEY: Senior Vice President David French with the National Retail Federation says, at first, some store owners might try to absorb the cost of the tariffs to keep customers happy. But ultimately, he says those import taxes will show up in the prices people pay at the cash register. DAVID FRENCH: All of this is just going to add up. And at some point, whether it's this holiday season or sometime next year, the full pain is going to come home to roost. HORSLEY: The administration downplays those warnings. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow insists the trade war is costing China more than it is the U. S. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LARRY KUDLOW: Any consumer impact is very, very small, minuscule. By the by, consumer spending and consumer wages and salaries are all booming. HORSLEY: Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy has been strong, but the trade war is taking a toll. While unemployment is a low 3. 7%, the Labor Department said today hiring has downshifted, with employers adding about 140,000 jobs in each of the last three months, down from about 233,000 in the final months of last year. Imports from China fell 12% in the first half of the year, but exports to China fell even further - 18%. Bown says China has not only imposed retaliatory tariffs on U. S. exports, but it's relaxed tariffs on competing products from other countries. BOWN: That puts American exporters at a disadvantage. They're getting hurt twice - by the retaliatory tariffs, and now they're having an even more difficult time competing in the Chinese market. HORSLEY: Farmers and ranchers have been particularly hard hit by the president's trade battles, as other countries have targeted farm goods in an effort to score political points here in the U. S. Cattle ranchers did get some relief today, though - an agreement making it easier to export American beef to Europe. Trump announced the deal at the White House, surrounded by ranchers in broad-brimmed hats. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This is a tremendous victory for American farmers, ranchers and, of course, European consumers because American beef is considered the best in the world. HORSLEY: The deal with Europe applies a thick steak to the black eye U. S. exporters have been nursing for the last year, but Trump still seems more interested in erecting new trade barriers than knocking down old ones. As he left the signing ceremony, the president couldn't resist joking about imposing a new 25% tariff on imported Mercedes and BMWs - at least the president said he was joking.

S. -China trade war is not new, but this new phase of the war could be different because you might be more likely to feel the effects. President Trump has threatened more tariffs, this time a 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports. And the list includes laptops, smartphones, sandals, toys, power tools, stuff that you might buy. The president made a threat after trade talks between the two countries made little progress this week, and we have President Trump's chief trade adviser on the line with us from the White House. Peter Navarro is assistant to the president and director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy. Mr. Navarro, welcome back. PETER NAVARRO: Thanks, Mr. Greene. GREENE: So if the president follows through on the threat here, could this start to get too personal for Americans who would be paying higher prices on this stuff? NAVARRO: Not at all. We've seen with 25% tariffs on the first $250 billion of these Chinese exports zero inflation. What China will do and has done is simply bear the burden of these tariffs through lower prices for their products, fewer exports and lower profits. The Chinese government bears the burden through slower growth, and, in the meantime, this country is better off. So what you see is the Chinese, basically, absorbing that. The other thing they do is manipulate their currency downward. For example, when we originally imposed the tariffs, we saw them drop their currency by almost 10%. So consumers don't have to worry. I think what I would like the. . . GREENE: I just want to say, consumers don't have to worry? I mean, it's. . . NAVARRO: That's correct. I am stating that. . . GREENE: You can guarantee that if a family is going to buy toys for their kids, a new power tool, work on the house, they will absolutely not see higher prices? There's no chance of that? NAVARRO: Mr. Greene, by the end of today, another 100 Americans or more will die from Chinese fentanyl. By the time the week ends, it's over a thousand. By the time the year ends, it's over 50,000. Fentanyl into this country is something that the Chinese president promised he would stop doing. There's other things. Here's what I think we need to talk about in a bipartisan, nonpartisan way - the acts of aggression that China engages in, and then we have to decide what to do about it. First, uniformed soldiers of the Chinese Army regularly hack into our business computers. If you want to be a business and access the Chinese market, you're required to hand over your technology. We have hundreds of billions of dollars every year of intellectual property theft. China dumps products from steel and aluminum to cars into this country and puts - American factories closed and American workers out of work. . . GREENE: Yeah, I don't think anyone disputes that a lot of. . . NAVARRO: Hang on, this is important, Mr. Greene, because. . . GREENE: Yeah, but I don't think anyone disputes China's behavior. I just want to ask you the direct impact of this. I mean, is your basic in argument. . . NAVARRO: I've told you what the direct - is that what we've seen with the first $250 billion with the 25% tariffs - not 10, 25% tariffs - we've seen virtually no inflation, and China has absorbed these tariffs. They've borne the burden by lowering their prices and devaluing their currency and. . . GREENE: But these are different goods, right? I mean, these are different goods. You have the Retail Industry Leaders Association - that represents Walmart, Target, Home Depot. . . NAVARRO: Sure. GREENE: . . . You know, stores that a lot of American families go to to shop - saying that prices will go up. And I guess I just am - I'm asking - you know, you might be able to talk about the behavior of China and how important it is to try and change that. I'm wondering if the message to Americans is you might have higher prices if you go to shop at Home Depot, but we as an administration are going to make the case that it's worth it. I mean, can you be. . . NAVARRO: I can make that case, but what I'm also telling you is that a 10% tariff will mostly be borne by China in the form of them lowering their prices and devaluing their currency. That's what they did with the first 250 billion, but you make a good point. You make the point for me, I guess. What are we to do here as a country when China cheats, steals, and takes our technology which is the seed corn for the future? And I would point out here that one of the first people to endorse this latest move by the president was Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, a senator who we rarely agree with on a lot of issues. But I think what's important here for your listeners is to understand that we have a significant problem with China. The president has been consistent about two things. One, his door is always open to negotiate in good faith. And two, if the Chinese don't fulfill their commitments and don't negotiate in good faith, he will take action. And that's what this president does, and he ran on that. He promised that. And what he's trying to do is restore the manufacturing base of this country through Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana, which have borne the burden of it.

And there were signs of a possible reprieve from the all-out trade war between the U. S. and China. China's central bank took steps overnight to prevent a freefall in the country's currency. A day earlier, the currency hit an 11-year low, prompting complaints from the U. S. Treasury Department. We've got NPR's Scott Horsley in the studio to explain what all this means. Hi, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: So yesterday was a bad day for the market, the worst all year right? What are we seeing today? HORSLEY: Stocks have bounced back a little bit. Yesterday, both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 were off about 3 percent. So far this morning, they've regained a fraction of that. The Dow is up about four-tenths of a percent, the S&P up about six-tenths of a percent. The markets are still pretty jittery, though. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow tried to offer some reassurance this morning. He told CNBC there's still a chance of a truce in the U. S. -China trade war. (SOUNDBITE OF CNBC BROADCAST)LARRY KUDLOW: As difficult as things may be - and I know the markets are a bit volatile - but the reality is we would like to negotiate. The president has said, you know, if you make good deal or good progress on a deal, maybe he'll be flexible on the tariffs. On the other hand, if there's no progress on the deal, then the tariffs might get worse. But he's open to it. HORSLEY: The sell-off on Wall Street really began last week when the president announced plans to slap new tariffs on another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods. And the drop in stocks on Monday - the stocks dropped yesterday after China allowed its currency to fall. MARTIN: Right. So what's happening with the Chinese currency now? HORSLEY: China's central bank says it is committed to maintaining the basic stability of the currency and says it won't use devaluation to gain a competitive advantage - making its own exports more affordable, for example. China's currency is still trading below seven to the dollar, which is a threshold that China had maintained for a long time. But for the moment at least, it looks like China's not going to just let the currency drop a lot below that. Last night, the Treasury Department officially labeled China a currency manipulator, which is a step the president has long called for but hadn't actually done until just now. The odd thing is most analysts say China didn't so much artificially depress its currency yesterday as just stop taking artificial steps to prop that currency up. MARTIN: Can you explain, Scott, why these currency moves cause so much havoc in the market? HORSLEY: Lower currency does make Chinese goods cheaper on the world market and puts U. S. manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage. But even beyond the actual currency moves, what the market seems to be reacting to in recent days is just a threat that both the U. S. and China are digging in in this trade war. Earlier this year, markets were kind of hoping there'd be a quick resolution. Now that's looking less likely. Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital in Chicago says that's causing a lot of volatility. JACK ABLIN: Any investor who had anticipated that President Xi and President Trump would shake hands and reach some kind of an agreement by year end is probably scratching that scenario off their blackboard. HORSLEY: Now, Larry Kudlow, always the sunny optimist, tried to put the best face on this this morning, telling CNBC that there is going to be another round of negotiations here in Washington next month. The last couple of rounds, however, have not yielded much progress. And the uncertainty that's resulted from that has led to a slowdown both in the U. S. factory sector - and, Rachel, this week there were signs the much-larger services side of the economy is slowing down, as well. MARTIN: NPR's Scott Horsley for us. Thanks, Scott. We appreciate it. HORSLEY: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:   The stock market appears to be rebounding a bit this morning, regaining some of the ground it lost yesterday.

The president has said, you know, if you make good deal or good progress on a deal, maybe he'll be flexible on the tariffs. On the other hand, if there's no progress on the deal, then the tariffs might get worse. But he's open to it. HORSLEY: The sell-off on Wall Street really began last week when the president announced plans to slap new tariffs on another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods. And the drop in stocks on Monday - the stocks dropped yesterday after China allowed its currency to fall. MARTIN: Right. So what's happening with the Chinese currency now? HORSLEY: China's central bank says it is committed to maintaining the basic stability of the currency and says it won't use devaluation to gain a competitive advantage - making its own exports more affordable, for example. China's currency is still trading below seven to the dollar, which is a threshold that China had maintained for a long time. But for the moment at least, it looks like China's not going to just let the currency drop a lot below that. Last night, the Treasury Department officially labeled China a currency manipulator, which is a step the president has long called for but hadn't actually done until just now. The odd thing is most analysts say China didn't so much artificially depress its currency yesterday as just stop taking artificial steps to prop that currency up. MARTIN: Can you explain, Scott, why these currency moves cause so much havoc in the market? HORSLEY: Lower currency does make Chinese goods cheaper on the world market and puts U. S. manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage. But even beyond the actual currency moves, what the market seems to be reacting to in recent days is just a threat that both the U. S. and China are digging in in this trade war. Earlier this year, markets were kind of hoping there'd be a quick resolution. Now that's looking less likely. Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital in Chicago says that's causing a lot of volatility. JACK ABLIN: Any investor who had anticipated that President Xi and President Trump would shake hands and reach some kind of an agreement by year end is probably scratching that scenario off their blackboard. HORSLEY: Now, Larry Kudlow, always the sunny optimist, tried to put the best face on this this morning, telling CNBC that there is going to be another round of negotiations here in Washington next month. The last couple of rounds, however, have not yielded much progress. And the uncertainty that's resulted from that has led to a slowdown both in the U. S. factory sector - and, Rachel, this week there were signs the much-larger services side of the economy is slowing down, as well. MARTIN: NPR's Scott Horsley for us. Thanks, Scott. We appreciate it. HORSLEY: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)", "section": "Business", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Treasury's move is the latest sign that President Trump's trade war with China is getting uglier. To talk about it, we're joined now by NPR's Jim Zarroli. Hi, Jim. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: What does this mean that the Trump administration has now officially labeled China a currency manipulator? ZARROLI: Well, this is considered largely a symbolic step. It's one that the Trump administration has avoided doing until now. Even though President Trump has often talked about China as being a currency manipulator, they haven't taken this formal step. And it allows the United States to take up China's currency practices with the International Monetary Fund to try to get them to address it. It is mainly a big ratcheting-up in tensions between the U. S. and China. And this, really, represents just a further deterioration in the relations between the two countries. SHAPIRO: And this is connected to what happened in the markets today. Walk us through what it involved. ZARROLI: Yeah, it was brutal. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down, I think, 800 points at one time during the day. Lots of big companies like Apple and Caterpillar were down. And this just came after a string of bad days in the markets. Just a few weeks ago, we saw stock prices hitting record highs. Now the Standard & Poor's 500 index has fallen for six days in a row. And then you had all the things that normally happen when stocks fall - energy prices down, interest rate on government debt falling and so on. SHAPIRO: Explain why now. What happened to cause the markets to crash like this? ZARROLI: Well, this pretty much does seem to be all about the trade war with China. You know, all summer, it's been looking like maybe the United States and China were headed towards some kind of agreement. They were talking. They have another meeting scheduled for September. But then last week, President Trump, all of a sudden, imposed this new round of tariffs on Chinese imports. He said China had backed off some promises that it had made in trade talks. And then today, as we said, China responded by letting its currency, the yuan, fall in value. Trump was not happy about that. He put out a tweet that said, this is a major violation which will greatly weaken China over time. And then tonight, the Treasury Department took this step of formally labeling China a currency manipulator. SHAPIRO: Explain why China devaluing its currency matters so much to President Trump and to the economy more broadly. ZARROLI: Well, remember. One of the big points of Trump's trade war is to reduce the trade deficit with China. China just sells a lot more to the U. S. than the U. S. sells to China. Trump says that China does this by cheating it. For instance, it closes off its markets to American products. And Trump says if he can close this trade deficit, it won't create jobs for Americans. But the problem is when China lets its currency fall, that undercuts what he's trying to do. It means Chinese products are cheaper in the United States. Americans buy more of them. And suddenly, American products cost more in China. So it has the exact wrong effect when the yuan loses value. It means the trade deficit actually gets bigger. SHAPIRO: And, just briefly, explain why that matters to countries beyond the U. S. and China. ZARROLI: Well, these are the two biggest economies in the world. And if they're fighting a trade war, it has ripples - effects all over. China, in particular, is just this giant engine of growth. And when its economy slows down, then everybody's economy slows down, so this is not just about China and the U. S. It's much bigger. SHAPIRO: NPR's Jim Zarroli, thank you. ZARROLI: You're welcome.

(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Americans are in the middle of a sex recession. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Less sex than ever before. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Sex - millennials are not having as much of it as their parents or grandparents did. SANDERS: For a few years now, America has been in what many are calling a sex recession or a sex drought. The General Social Survey at the University of Chicago, it found that in 2018, almost a quarter of adults under 30 didn't have sex in the last year. Almost 1 in 4 young adults sexless. That's a record high. Part of the explanation is everyone's spending more time alone on the Internet, but also younger people are waiting longer to find a life partner or even cohabitate. For a lot of young men, that's not always by choice. Nate Koch is 23, recent college graduate, lives in Colorado, and he is currently single. NATE KOCH: When I was in high school, I really liked that show \"How I Met Your Mother. \" I feel like shows like that created this sort of image of what it's like to be in your 20s. And you're hanging out in bars and you're just sort of, like, meeting people in these strange ways and you're a wingman for other. . . SANDERS: Koch says everything about online dating today, it feels incredibly less straightforward than a sitcom. KOCH: There's, like, no rules anymore. Like, we don't know what to do on these apps. It feels like kind of like the Wild West. SANDERS: Koch says online dating in many ways is good. It gives women more power over their dating and sex lives. And he says it's making men question some of the power they've always had. I talked to another young man, also in his 20s, not Nate Koch. And he told me that his dad asked his mom out five times before she said yes. That kind of behavior may sound sweet in retrospect, but today, online, that could be considered harassment. Figuring out these new rules can be hard. For Nate Koch, it's time consuming. KOCH: I'm literally applying to jobs at the same time that I'm dating. The similarity between the two is a little bit, like, horrifying to me. Like, it feels like I'm doing the same thing. SANDERS: All of this has slowed down Koch's potential baby timeline. KOCH: I thought that I would probably know the person that I was going to get married to by my age now. Like. . . SANDERS: I guess you're saying that you thought at this point you'd be further along that track. KOCH: What - are you trying to depress me? SANDERS: More women are dealing with another reason we're seeing America's birthrate dip so low - career considerations. Rashmi Venkatesh is 30 years old and married. She has a Ph. D. and she works in science research. Her job is kind of her No. 1 priority right now. RASHMI VENKATESH: Having pictured in the past a fully formed professional life and a fully formed family life and having realized that for most of us, one of those things has gone by the wayside, and that thing is the family life. SANDERS: Venkatesh says she's still in that phase of her career where she's moving up the ladder really quickly. So when she thinks of having a kid, she worries that it might hurt her career advancement. She tells me she couldn't even imagine taking, like, 10 or 12 weeks off for a new baby. VENKATESH: Two and a half months off, you would miss something or, you know, the time that I spend in the evening reading up on things, the time that I spend outside of work thinking about problems at work, would now be focused on something else - a child. SANDERS: On top of all this - money. Venkatesh worries about losing income if she leaves work to have a kid, and she worries about one big new expense a baby would bring - child care. The cost of child care is eating up more of families' incomes than in decades past. Venkatesh says that when she was younger, she imagined several kids. VENKATESH: The number three always seemed like a good number, like a number that was right. SANDERS: So then now being 30, do you still think three? VENKATESH: Realistically, no. SANDERS: Wow. How does that make you feel? VENKATESH: It's a bummer. It's a bummer for sure. SANDERS: The longer women like Venkatesh wait to have a kid, the fewer kids they're likely to have. Jennifer Glass is a demographer at The University of Texas at Austin. She says America's baby drought and sex recession, it's happening in other developed countries, too. Some have tried to fix it by urging citizens to get busy. Glass says one commercial from Denmark is the craziest.

GLASS: What we need is a policy that gives you four to six months almost completely paid and is available to both partners. The second thing that works is to have subsidized child care available. SANDERS: And there's another fix - immigration. Immigrants tend to be younger, the kind of workers aging economies need. And new immigrants often have childbirth rates that are higher than the native-born population. PHILIP COHEN: We should not worry about the birthrate in the United States. SANDERS: Philip Cohen is a sociologist at the University of Maryland. COHEN: If we want to let those people come to this country, we can solve any problem you can think of related to population size.

It is postponing tariffs on some popular Chinese-made items to avoid affecting the holiday shopping season. Now, this made retailers happy and investors happy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped more than 370 points today. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The administration's been preparing to impose 10% tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of Chinese imports in less than three weeks. But this morning, the president's top trade official announced more than half those tariffs will be delayed until mid-December when store shelves will already be stocked for holiday sales. Economist Mary Lovely of Syracuse University says that means there will be no import tax this fall on popular consumer items, such as cellphones, laptop computers, video game consoles and certain toys and clothing. MARY LOVELY: These are products that lots of people buy for Christmas presents and back to school. And so I think that that would have been quite unpopular. HORSLEY: President Trump told reporters the tariffs were postponed after what he called a very productive phone call with Chinese officials. Trump also said he was acting to avoid any consumer fallout from the tariffs, a tacit admission that his import taxes are paid at least in part by Americans, something the president has long disputed. The stock market rallied on news of the tariff delay. The move was also welcomed by David French, senior vice president of the National Retail Federation. DAVID FRENCH: It was an acknowledgement that we need to take a step back and slow the tariffs a little bit so that consumers don't feel the full brunt of it during the holiday season. HORSLEY: Still, the delay is only a partial reprieve. While tariffs on an estimated $160 billion worth of goods are being delayed, tariffs on another $112 billion are still set to take effect September 1. French says it's all pretty confusing for retailers. FRENCH: It's very difficult to operate a retail business when you don't know from month to month or week to week what the prices of your goods in the future will be. HORSLEY: The administration's shifting trade policies are also a source of uncertainty for other countries. The president has now threatened and backtracked on tariffs on more than one occasion. As a result, Lovely says other countries may be more willing to wait Trump out or call his bluff. LOVELY: Many people still support the president. They believe that this process will lead to a better outcome with China. Unfortunately, I think that that happy ending is looking more and more in doubt with each passing week. HORSLEY: The administration did drop some items from the tariff target list altogether, including Bibles. It turns out China's a big supplier. American flags from China, however, are not getting a pass. Last year, the U. S. imported more than $6 billion worth of American flags from China. They'll face a 10% tariff starting next month. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  The Trump administration is retreating a bit in its trade war with China. It is postponing tariffs on some popular Chinese-made items to avoid affecting the holiday shopping season. Now, this made retailers happy and investors happy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped more than 370 points today. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The administration's been preparing to impose 10% tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of Chinese imports in less than three weeks. But this morning, the president's top trade official announced more than half those tariffs will be delayed until mid-December when store shelves will already be stocked for holiday sales. Economist Mary Lovely of Syracuse University says that means there will be no import tax this fall on popular consumer items, such as cellphones, laptop computers, video game consoles and certain toys and clothing. MARY LOVELY: These are products that lots of people buy for Christmas presents and back to school. And so I think that that would have been quite unpopular. HORSLEY: President Trump told reporters the tariffs were postponed after what he called a very productive phone call with Chinese officials. Trump also said he was acting to avoid any consumer fallout from the tariffs, a tacit admission that his import taxes are paid at least in part by Americans, something the president has long disputed. The stock market rallied on news of the tariff delay. The move was also welcomed by David French, senior vice president of the National Retail Federation. DAVID FRENCH: It was an acknowledgement that we need to take a step back and slow the tariffs a little bit so that consumers don't feel the full brunt of it during the holiday season. HORSLEY: Still, the delay is only a partial reprieve. While tariffs on an estimated $160 billion worth of goods are being delayed, tariffs on another $112 billion are still set to take effect September 1. French says it's all pretty confusing for retailers. FRENCH: It's very difficult to operate a retail business when you don't know from month to month or week to week what the prices of your goods in the future will be. HORSLEY: The administration's shifting trade policies are also a source of uncertainty for other countries. The president has now threatened and backtracked on tariffs on more than one occasion. As a result, Lovely says other countries may be more willing to wait Trump out or call his bluff. LOVELY: Many people still support the president. They believe that this process will lead to a better outcome with China. Unfortunately, I think that that happy ending is looking more and more in doubt with each passing week. HORSLEY: The administration did drop some items from the tariff target list altogether, including Bibles. It turns out China's a big supplier. American flags from China, however, are not getting a pass. Last year, the U. S. imported more than $6 billion worth of American flags from China. They'll face a 10% tariff starting next month.

CHANG: (Laughter) All right, so just walk us through what happened today. BERLINER: So the sell-off was deep and very broad. All the major stock market indexes fell sharply - the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Trade, once again, seemed to be a big factor. Just yesterday, markets rallied, and there was an upbeat mood on Wall Street. That was after the Trump administration announced it was going to delay tariffs on a wide range of Chinese imports. And it was seen as a breather from the trade war. But today, suddenly, there was a complete reversal of the mood. It got pretty dark. CHANG: So why did things turn around so abruptly? BERLINER: So, you know, as you noted, there is increasing evidence of economic weakness around the world. Just today, we learned Germany's economy shrank in the latest quarter. That's Europe's most important economy. Germany relies heavily on trade and exports for its prosperity. Trade tensions are affecting Germany's important car industry. And over in China, there's new evidence that its economy, too, is slowing. Growth in the U. S. is also starting to weaken. In the second quarter, the economy grew just 2. 1%. That's down from earlier in the year. So you have the big three - U. S. , China and Europe - all slowing down at the same time. That's not a happy combination for the stock market. CHANG: And then on top of all this, I understand there was an ominous signal coming from the bond market as well. BERLINER: That's right. CHANG: OK. BERLINER: The interest rate on 10-year - on the 10-year Treasury note briefly fell below the yield on the two-year rate. That's unusual, and it's the first time that's happened since 2007. This is called an inverted yield curve. And if it persists, it's often seen as a bad sign for the economy. An extended inversion between these two interest rates has preceded the past seven recessions. Now, most economists don't believe the U. S. is headed for a recession soon. But. . . CHANG: Good. BERLINER: This - (laughter) good, good, yeah. But this inverted yield curve ramped up the anxiety on Wall Street today. I spoke to Joe Brusuelas. He's the chief economist at the consulting firm RSM. And he says a lot rides on the U. S. and China, quickly dialing back these disputes over trade. JOE BRUSUELAS: Essentially, if the trade war's not rolled back in the near term, I think we're going to have a very difficult 2020. CHANG: OK, that sounds really unsettling. I guess the question I have after all of this is what do ordinary people like you and me have to worry about going forward? BERLINER: Well, so for now, the U. S. economy is doing pretty well. Unemployment rate remains really low. Wage growth is decent - very little inflation. But if you're in the markets, if you're an investor for the long term, a one-day drop in the market like this shouldn't really scare you, shouldn't freak you out. But if you're just about to retire and you're looking at your 401(k), these days, understandably, can be really stomach-churning. CHANG: OK. Well, that's NPR's senior business editor Uri Berliner.

S. headed for a recession? Well, it depends on whom you ask. Recession fears triggered a big selloff on Wall Street yesterday. The stock market suffered its biggest loss all year. But today, we saw relatively quiet trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose modestly as investors tried to decipher some of the mixed signals we've been getting about what direction the economy is headed. NPR's Scott Horsley joins me now with more clues about that. Hey, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, Alisa. CHANG: So let's talk about some of these mixed signals. I want to start with retail sales. Spending doesn't seem to be slowing down. In fact, it's picking up. What does that tell us? HORSLEY: Yeah, retail sales in July jumped even more than forecasters were expecting, and that was the fifth consecutive monthly gain. Alisa, that's important because consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of overall economic activity in the country. And economist Jack Kleinhenz of the National Retail Federation says after a soft patch early in the year, it looks like consumers are really opening their pocketbooks and spending freely. JACK KLEINHENZ: Consumers are alive and well. Job growth is good. We're seeing wage increases. The savings rate is up. Confidence continues to stay at a fairly elevated level. This is a good place to be. HORSLEY: So if you started out the day worried about yesterday's stock market swoon, consumer spending was one place you could look for some reassurance. CHANG: OK, that's mildly comforting, but we were just saying that there were mixed signals today. So where are some of the more ominous signs that we're seeing from the economy? HORSLEY: Factories. We've got a report on industrial production today, and once again, it's pointing in the wrong direction. Manufacturing output declined last month, and it's declined in five of the last seven months. Senior economist Ted Quinlan (ph) of Wells Fargo Securities says the factory slowdown is all about the trade war. TIM QUINLAN: The trade war does two things that are not good for the manufacturing sector. One is it disrupts supply chains and increases costs. The other reason that the trade war is bad for the manufacturing sector is it's had a chilling effect on global growth. U. S. manufacturers who export things to other places are feeling some trade winds as well. HORSLEY: Now manufacturing is not what it once was. It's dwarfed by the much larger services side of the economy. But we've also seen some indications that the slowdown is spreading beyond factories to the broader economy. Business investment has slowed down, and economic growth has definitely down-shifted. The question is, does it actually shift into reverse? CHANG: Well, meanwhile, President Trump has been talking up the economy. And today, he criticized reporters for emphasizing all the negative economic news. What did he have to say today? HORSLEY: Yeah, the president tweeted this afternoon that the news media is doing everything it can to, in his words, crash the economy. He says news outlets are trying to talk down his reelection chances. But Trump insists the economy is way too strong to be frightened into a recession, and there are some serious economists who are also voicing confidence about the strength of the economy ten years into this long economic expansion. One of those is Janet Yellen, the former Federal Reserve chair. She was asked about the economic climate on Fox Business. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED INTERVIEWER: Are we going into a recession? JANET YELLEN: I think the answer is most likely no. I think that the U. S. economy has enough strength to avoid that. HORSLEY: Yellen discounted the warning sign we got in the bond market yesterday when the yield or payoff on long-term government debt briefly dipped below the yield on short-term debt. Historically that has been a harbinger of recession, but Yellen and some other economists say they think it's different this time around. That said, Yellen acknowledges the odds of a recession have gone up, and she says that makes her a little bit uncomfortable. One thing to watch for is whether the swoon in the stock market yesterday makes ordinary Americans uncomfortable to the point where they stop spending. CHANG: Right.

That is probably not the technical term for the massive plunge in the market, but we probably can't repeat the language likely used on the trading floor as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 800 points yesterday, making it the worst day for stocks this year. DAVID GREENE, HOST: Now, what's kind of weird about this is that this big slide came just a day after the Dow actually rose a lot after the Trump administration announced it would postpone tariffs on some Chinese goods, so why this sudden and really steep turnaround? MARTIN: Who better to ask than NPR's chief economics correspondent Scott Horsley, who joins us this morning. Hi, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: So as David noted, earlier this week, big surge in the Dow. Next day, it tanks. How come? HORSLEY: You know, if you pull the camera back a bit, Tuesday's up-day in the market after the president announced that he was postponing some of those tariffs actually stands out as kind of the lone bright spot. You know, it followed a 400-point drop on Monday, a string of big losses in the market last week and then yesterday's big plunge, when both the Dow and the S&P 500 dropped around 3%There's just been a lot of volatility, a lot of nervousness. We got news yesterday that Germany's economy actually contracted in the most recent quarter. We also got some disappointing data about China's factory production. Both Germany and China are big exporters, so that signals a lot of anxiety about softening world trade. And then there was that worrisome signal from the bond market, which the president tweeted about in all caps as the crazy inverted yield curve. MARTIN: What does that mean? I mean, I will cop to not knowing what the inverted yield curve is about. HORSLEY: OK, ordinarily, the payoff on long-term government debt is higher than the payoff on short-term debt. Investors get a reward for tying up their money longer. And if you plot that out on a graph, the curve bends upward like a smiley face. MARTIN: OK. HORSLEY: What's unusual is when the curve turns upside down, and you get a lot of frowny faces on Wall Street. And that's what happened yesterday. The yield, or the payoff, on the 10-year treasury note dropped below that on a two-year note. And this gets a lot of attention because historically, that's often been a harbinger of a looming recession. Now that doesn't mean it's going to happen tomorrow, but it does signal some concern about the path the economy is on. We still have low unemployment. We still have pretty good consumer spending. But we have seen a drop-off in business investment, and of course, all this trade tension is not helping. MARTIN: Uh huh. Happy face, smiley face - Scott, you could be an econ teacher in high school. I would have taken your class. So what about the Fed, because this has been a favorite target of President Trump? Yesterday, he directed a personal attack at Fed Chairman Jay Powell, blaming him in particular for some of the economic market jitters we're seeing right now. What point is the president trying to make with that? HORSLEY: Yeah, the Fed has become the president's favorite whipping boy or scapegoat or distraction from the president's own policies, and yesterday was no exception. He wants the Federal Reserve to act more aggressively to cut interest rates. Now the Fed insists it's driven by economic data and not political pressure, but if the economy continues to soften, the president may get what he wants. MARTIN: Here's the how-to part of the segment. People are going to look at a bad day in the market, think about their own investments, obviously with their retirement accounts. Should people be worried? HORSLEY: You know, if you're thinking about retirement savings and retirement is still many years away, all this is probably just a footnote, nothing much to worry about. For the president, though, who likes to use the stock market as a scorecard, his time horizon is shorter than that, you know? President's up for reelection in 15 months. He used to boast about all the people who thought they'd become investing geniuses when their 401ks jumped. Over the last year, the stock market has pretty much been treading water. And the real challenge now is going to be if that spreads to the wider economy, then it won't just be the bond market where we're seeing all those frowny faces. MARTIN: NPR's Scott Horsley. Thanks, Scott. HORSLEY: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MARTIN: All right, we're going to turn now to Philadelphia because there was this eight-hour police standoff last night that came to an end pretty late in the day. GREENE: Yeah, so police say they were going to try and serve a drug warrant, and then gunfire erupted. And this confrontation just went from bad to worse. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER: We got several shot officers. We got an officer down. I need all guidance live. GREENE: As you can hear there, officer down. The suspected gunman wounded six officers who ended up in the hospital, fortunately with non-life-threatening injuries. This is what Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross had to say about the shooting. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RICHARD ROSS: We are very, very lucky. There were six police officers shot in one incident. It is remarkable that, you know, I believe a couple of them have been released already. And so it is nothing short of astounding that, in such a confined space, that we didn't have more of a tragedy than we did. MARTIN: All right, for more, we're going to turn now to NPR's Jeff Brady, who is in Philadelphia. I guess, Jeff, how did it start? I mean, why were police targeting the house in the first place? JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: Well, at about 4:30 Wednesday afternoon, officers were serving a narcotics warrant. And police say the situation, it turned dangerous almost immediately. Officers were inside the house. They were headed toward the rear where the kitchen is, and police say that's when gunfire erupted. Officers, of course, they returned fire. They tried to escape. Police Commissioner Richard Ross, he painted this really dramatic picture of officers escaping wherever they could - through windows, through doors. He described it as a barrage of bullets. And they didn't stop. The suspect kept firing for hours afterwards. As you mentioned, six officers were struck by gunfire, one actually in the head. But none of those injuries was life-threatening. They were taken to two local hospitals that are right there - very nearby - treated and released a few hours later. MARTIN: Do we know anything at this point about the suspect? BRADY: He's 36 years old. His name is Maurice Hill. It sounds like officers may have had some idea that he might be dangerous. Hill reportedly has a pretty long criminal history. And the local newspaper the Inquirer says that he had resisted attempts to be arrested in the past. MARTIN: How did police ultimately get him out of the house? BRADY: You know, it took more than seven hours. And they talked with the suspect on a phone that was in the house. They said he picked it - or at least they called him on a phone that was in the house. They - early on, they said he picked it up a few times but didn't answer. They used a loudspeaker to try to convince him to come out peacefully. They even told him that police officers who were injured would survive, trying to encourage him to end the standoff peacefully. They also were worried about what the police chief early on referred to as a potential hostage situation. Two officers and three people they had arrested before the gunfire started were stuck in the house for hours. Eventually, a team was sent in to get them, and those five people got out fine. Then right around midnight, the suspect, Maurice Hill, came out of the house with his hands up, and police say he is in custody. MARTIN: And have charges been filed? BRADY: Well, you know, clearly he's going to be facing much more than drug charges now. Police also are thinking about how they serve these types of warrants. They're going to be examining this incident to see if there's anything they can learn to prevent violence from happening in the future. MARTIN: NPR's Jeff Brady in Philadelphia for us. Jeff, thanks. BRADY: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MARTIN: One of the hardest things to preserve in any organized movement is unity, keeping everyone together. Disagreements over goals and tactics can, and often do, undermine the cause. GREENE: Yeah, so let's talk about what's happening in Hong Kong, where protesters have been pushing for more freedoms from China. There are signs now of divisions within this pro-democracy movement. The protests there, let's remember, started over a bill that would have allowed people in Hong Kong to be extradited to China to face criminal charges. In recent days, though, there have been more instances of protester violence, even though the movement has been demonstrating against police brutality. MARTIN: OK, NPR's Anthony Kuhn is back on the ground in Hong Kong. Anthony, let me first ask about these reports that protesters at the airport have been wearing signs saying I'm sorry. What's that all about? ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: Well, it's mostly about Tuesday night. What happened at the airport then was that protesters grabbed two mainland Chinese men - one of them a journalist, the other a suspected policeman. They mauled them. They beat them. Medics were prevented from getting them in to take them out. And the protesters hassled travelers just trying to get through. They clashed with police. One officer drew his gun, and luckily nobody got shot. So now protesters realize they blew it. They acted like a mob. Many of the protesters are feeling bad. They're feeling reflective, and some of them apologized. And there are people who think that's a good thing for the movement. They've cleared out of the airport entirely now in - and it's a de-escalation. This was getting really tense. People were afraid that it was going to lead to a government crackdown. MARTIN: So, I mean, what does that mean for the broader goals, this push for democracy? I mean, the group itself, it's not - there's no organization to it, is it? It's a purely grassroots endeavor. Is it truly unified right now? KUHN: Well, that's right. It's a movement without leaders and a strategy of no strategy. All we can say for now is that the protests are going to continue, but this is - looks like an inflection point, a turning point. And for the first time, protesters are suggesting that yes, they can beat a tactical retreat, and that's a very important thing. And they're reaffirming that they can do this without injury. Another thing is that the police have admitted that they had undercover cops working among the protesters. And the protesters can now point in that violence and say hey, maybe it wasn't us. Maybe it was the undercover cops that did it. MARTIN: I mean, is Carrie Lam talking about these accusations specifically of not just the police brutality, but, you know, the placement of undercover cops within the movement - Carrie Lam being the chief executive of Hong Kong? KUHN: Yeah, right. Well, it's mostly the police who've been addressing these charges, and they say yes, we did have undercover cops posing as demonstrators. But we - they were not stirring up violence as people have accused them. They didn't do anything illegal. All the charges saying that, you know, they used tear gas improperly, that they fired rubber bullets at close range, they have denied any impropriety. And that makes people very mad. And it's just, you know, it's really interesting now that for the first time, we have protesters who were previously saying we're not going to quit, we're not going to step back, actually stepping back for a minute. MARTIN: Have you heard from anyone who's against the protests, who now thinks it's time for everyone to go home? KUHN: There have been those voices all along. And there are also pro-Beijing voices within Hong Kong, but Beijing has been not so effective in mobilizing those. MARTIN: NPR's Anthony Kuhn in Hong Kong reporting for us on this ongoing story. Thanks, Anthony. We appreciate it. KUHN: Sure thing, Rachel. (SOUNDBITE OF DISTANT. LO'S \"TOO OFTEN\") RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  It was a doozy of a day on Wall Street. That is probably not the technical term for the massive plunge in the market, but we probably can't repeat the language likely used on the trading floor as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 800 points yesterday, making it the worst day for stocks this year. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  Now, what's kind of weird about this is that this big slide came just a day after the Dow actually rose a lot after the Trump administration announced it would postpone tariffs on some Chinese goods, so why this sudden and really steep turnaround? MARTIN: Who better to ask than NPR's chief economics correspondent Scott Horsley, who joins us this morning. Hi, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: So as David noted, earlier this week, big surge in the Dow. Next day, it tanks. How come? HORSLEY: You know, if you pull the camera back a bit, Tuesday's up-day in the market after the president announced that he was postponing some of those tariffs actually stands out as kind of the lone bright spot. You know, it followed a 400-point drop on Monday, a string of big losses in the market last week and then yesterday's big plunge, when both the Dow and the S&P 500 dropped around 3% There's just been a lot of volatility, a lot of nervousness. We got news yesterday that Germany's economy actually contracted in the most recent quarter. We also got some disappointing data about China's factory production. Both Germany and China are big exporters, so that signals a lot of anxiety about softening world trade. And then there was that worrisome signal from the bond market, which the president tweeted about in all caps as the crazy inverted yield curve. MARTIN: What does that mean? I mean, I will cop to not knowing what the inverted yield curve is about. HORSLEY: OK, ordinarily, the payoff on long-term government debt is higher than the payoff on short-term debt. Investors get a reward for tying up their money longer. And if you plot that out on a graph, the curve bends upward like a smiley face. MARTIN: OK. HORSLEY: What's unusual is when the curve turns upside down, and you get a lot of frowny faces on Wall Street. And that's what happened yesterday. The yield, or the payoff, on the 10-year treasury note dropped below that on a two-year note. And this gets a lot of attention because historically, that's often been a harbinger of a looming recession. Now that doesn't mean it's going to happen tomorrow, but it does signal some concern about the path the economy is on. We still have low unemployment. We still have pretty good consumer spending. But we have seen a drop-off in business investment, and of course, all this trade tension is not helping. MARTIN: Uh huh. Happy face, smiley face - Scott, you could be an econ teacher in high school. I would have taken your class. So what about the Fed, because this has been a favorite target of President Trump? Yesterday, he directed a personal attack at Fed Chairman Jay Powell, blaming him in particular for some of the economic market jitters we're seeing right now. What point is the president trying to make with that? HORSLEY: Yeah, the Fed has become the president's favorite whipping boy or scapegoat or distraction from the president's own policies, and yesterday was no exception. He wants the Federal Reserve to act more aggressively to cut interest rates. Now the Fed insists it's driven by economic data and not political pressure, but if the economy continues to soften, the president may get what he wants. MARTIN: Here's the how-to part of the segment. People are going to look at a bad day in the market, think about their own investments, obviously with their retirement accounts. Should people be worried? HORSLEY: You know, if you're thinking about retirement savings and retirement is still many years away, all this is probably just a footnote, nothing much to worry about. For the president, though, who likes to use the stock market as a scorecard, his time horizon is shorter than that, you know? President's up for reelection in 15 months. He used to boast about all the people who thought they'd become investing geniuses when their 401ks jumped. Over the last year, the stock market has pretty much been treading water. And the real challenge now is going to be if that spreads to the wider economy, then it won't just be the bond market where we're seeing all those frowny faces. MARTIN: NPR's Scott Horsley. Thanks, Scott. HORSLEY: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: All right, we're going to turn now to Philadelphia because there was this eight-hour police standoff last night that came to an end pretty late in the day. GREENE: Yeah, so police say they were going to try and serve a drug warrant, and then gunfire erupted. And this confrontation just went from bad to worse. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER: We got several shot officers. We got an officer down. I need all guidance live. GREENE: As you can hear there, officer down. The suspected gunman wounded six officers who ended up in the hospital, fortunately with non-life-threatening injuries. This is what Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross had to say about the shooting. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICHARD ROSS: We are very, very lucky. There were six police officers shot in one incident. It is remarkable that, you know, I believe a couple of them have been released already. And so it is nothing short of astounding that, in such a confined space, that we didn't have more of a tragedy than we did. MARTIN: All right, for more, we're going to turn now to NPR's Jeff Brady, who is in Philadelphia. I guess, Jeff, how did it start? I mean, why were police targeting the house in the first place? JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: Well, at about 4:30 Wednesday afternoon, officers were serving a narcotics warrant. And police say the situation, it turned dangerous almost immediately. Officers were inside the house. They were headed toward the rear where the kitchen is, and police say that's when gunfire erupted. Officers, of course, they returned fire. They tried to escape. Police Commissioner Richard Ross, he painted this really dramatic picture of officers escaping wherever they could - through windows, through doors. He described it as a barrage of bullets. And they didn't stop. The suspect kept firing for hours afterwards. As you mentioned, six officers were struck by gunfire, one actually in the head. But none of those injuries was life-threatening. They were taken to two local hospitals that are right there - very nearby - treated and released a few hours later. MARTIN: Do we know anything at this point about the suspect? BRADY: He's 36 years old. His name is Maurice Hill. It sounds like officers may have had some idea that he might be dangerous. Hill reportedly has a pretty long criminal history. And the local newspaper the Inquirer says that he had resisted attempts to be arrested in the past. MARTIN: How did police ultimately get him out of the house? BRADY: You know, it took more than seven hours. And they talked with the suspect on a phone that was in the house. They said he picked it - or at least they called him on a phone that was in the house. They - early on, they said he picked it up a few times but didn't answer. They used a loudspeaker to try to convince him to come out peacefully. They even told him that police officers who were injured would survive, trying to encourage him to end the standoff peacefully. They also were worried about what the police chief early on referred to as a potential hostage situation. Two officers and three people they had arrested before the gunfire started were stuck in the house for hours. Eventually, a team was sent in to get them, and those five people got out fine. Then right around midnight, the suspect, Maurice Hill, came out of the house with his hands up, and police say he is in custody. MARTIN: And have charges been filed? BRADY: Well, you know, clearly he's going to be facing much more than drug charges now. Police also are thinking about how they serve these types of warrants. They're going to be examining this incident to see if there's anything they can learn to prevent violence from happening in the future. MARTIN: NPR's Jeff Brady in Philadelphia for us. Jeff, thanks. BRADY: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: One of the hardest things to preserve in any organized movement is unity, keeping everyone together. Disagreements over goals and tactics can, and often do, undermine the cause. GREENE: Yeah, so let's talk about what's happening in Hong Kong, where protesters have been pushing for more freedoms from China. There are signs now of divisions within this pro-democracy movement. The protests there, let's remember, started over a bill that would have allowed people in Hong Kong to be extradited to China to face criminal charges. In recent days, though, there have been more instances of protester violence, even though the movement has been demonstrating against police brutality. MARTIN: OK, NPR's Anthony Kuhn is back on the ground in Hong Kong. Anthony, let me first ask about these reports that protesters at the airport have been wearing signs saying I'm sorry.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its biggest one-day loss of the year on Wednesday, and the bond market sent up a recessionary warning flare. Investors made up some of their losses later in the week, though. And retailers got an early Christmas gift from President Trump, who postponed some of his new China tariffs until after the start of the holiday shopping season. NPR's Scott Horsley joins us. Scott, thanks so much for being with us. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good to be with you. SIMON: So when the stock market rebounded yesterday with the Dow up more than 300 points, does that mean forget what we were saying about that steep drop? HORSLEY: Not completely. It was not a bad day for the Dow who's up about 1. 2% on Friday. The S&P 500 is up about 1. 4%, but both had fallen more than twice that far on Wednesday so we still ended down for the week. And investors really can't say they're out of the woods. People are still nervous about what they saw in the bond market this week when the yield or the payoff on long-term government debt fell below the yield on short-term debt. Historically, that has been a warning flare of a coming recession. Now, it can sometimes be a lag of several years, so even if you believe this signal doesn't mean it's going to happen right away. And we do continue to get some encouraging signs from the economy, as well. This week, we got a better than expected report on consumer spending. Shoppers were out in force in July, which is not surprising. A lot of people were working. Wages have been going up modestly. As long as the American consumer is spending money, the economy will keep chugging along. But more worrisome is what we've seen in the factory sector. We saw a report this week that had factories still in a slump. They're very susceptible to the global economy, which has been tapping the brakes. And, of course, factories have also been affected by trade tensions. SIMON: And speaking of trade wars, President Trump blinked - right? - in the trade battle with China this week. Is that how you read it? HORSLEY: Yeah. He delayed more than half of the latest round of tariffs, which were set to take effect on Chinese imports September 1. The president postponed tariffs on a lot of popular consumer items like cell phones and laptops and, well, some toys and clothing until the middle of December. Trump said he was doing that to avoid taxing consumers during the busy holiday shopping season. That's kind of a breakthrough because it's the first time the president has acknowledged even tacitly what economists have been saying, which is that it's Americans who are paying for these tariffs. Even though some of the consumer tariffs have been postponed, others are going to take effect September 1. And China's promising to retaliate. Now, the U. S. and China are scheduled for another round of trade talks in September, but the last few have not really yielded any progress. SIMON: President loves to boast about the economy, obviously, when it's doing well. How's he handling this period? HORSLEY: He does like to talk about the market when it's doing well. He thinks it's kind of a scorecard. And he used to brag about being approached by a worker, usually some hardhat or something who says, Mr. President, my wife thinks I'm an investing genius because my 401(k) is doing so well. Some of those wives may be having second thoughts now because for the last year or so, the stock market has more or less been treading water. Nevertheless, at a campaign rally in New Hampshire this week, the president was warning that retirement accounts would do worse if a Democrat were to win next November. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You have no choice but to vote for me because your 401(k)s - down the tubes. Everything is going to be down the tubes. So whether you love me or hate me, you got to vote for me. HORSLEY: Takes a little chutzpah to say something like that one day after the market has suffered a 3% plunge, but that's our president. Trump did have a conversation on that volatile day, Wednesday, with some big bank CEOs to talk about the market, as well as the economy. Let's face it - the president knows his re-election could hinge on how the U. S. economy does over the next 15 months. SIMON: NPR's chief economics correspondent Scott Horsley. Thanks so much.

The stock market fell 3% this past Wednesday but later made back some of those losses. While in the bond market, a key marker of a coming recession has been playing out. Now the payoff for long-term government debt fell below the yield on short-term debt. So what are we looking for when the bell rings tomorrow? Catherine Rampell writes about economics for The Washington Post, and she joins me now. Welcome. CATHERINE RAMPELL: Good to be here. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So first off, I just want a gut check from you - Wall Street ups and downs, that warning flare in the bond market, but we're also seeing strong consumer spending at the same time. What is your take on these mixed indicators? RAMPELL: I think the story thus far has been there are warning signs out there. Consumers have been the strong point. Up until this week, however, there was a consumer sentiment number that it was at its lowest notching since, I want to say, six or seven months. So that does suggest that consumers may be wavering a little bit. I think the bigger picture, though, is the global risks essentially. So right now, we have something, like, nine major economies around the world either currently in recession or on the verge of recession, and you could imagine that there would be contagion effects. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What will you be looking for tomorrow and in the near term beyond tomorrow? RAMPELL: I will continue to be looking at the economic data as they come out, of course some of these leading indicators, including things like business-consumer sentiment, durable goods orders, other things that are not exactly household names. I'll also, of course, be looking at the messaging that we're getting out of this White House and how equipped they are to deal with these latent risks. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Which actually brings me to my next question - how equipped do you think this administration is? RAMPELL: That is what I'm very worried about. The real risk, as I see it right now, is that we will have a badly mismanaged recession because, right now, this administration has made pretty clear that it doesn't have a plan. It never had a plan. In fact, colleagues of mine from The Washington Post on the news side - I'm on the opinion side to clarify - reported earlier this week that administration officials have done no planning for any possible recession because they don't want to feed a negative narrative. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, that brings me to this, which is that President Trump has been aggressive in using his position to juice the economy. I'm thinking of how he has been pressuring the Fed. That is unusual, needless to say. But is it a tactic that could work? RAMPELL: This is also very, very troubling. His political pressure that he's putting on the Fed is largely unprecedented at least for the last several decades. Historically, going back to about the early '90s, the executive branch, the White House in particular, has made a concerted effort to never comment on monetary policy because you need the central bank to be independent both in practice and in perception in order for its actions to be credible. And if people start questioning whether the Fed is making choices about interest rates, that undermines their ability to make those decisions and for those decisions to have their intended effect. GARCIA-NAVARRO: You keep on using this word credible, and it just reminds me that so much about the economy is based on people's perception, people's confidence in not only the leadership but where the leadership is taking us, right? RAMPELL: Yes, absolutely. These are sort of big institutional questions that I fear could endanger us the next time that we do have a downturn. And there will be a next time. The question is will Americans believe messaging coming out of their political and economic leadership but also confidence in leadership to make the right decisions and to make the right decisions for the right reasons? GARCIA-NAVARRO: Catherine Rampell is a columnist with The Washington Post. Thank you very much. RAMPELL: Thank you.

That's after a sharp drop in the stock market last week, when investors reacted to warning signs of a looming recession. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: President Trump knows his best hope for winning a second term in the White House is a solid U. S. economy. So after three rocky weeks on Wall Street, including the biggest sell-off all year last Wednesday, it was time for a little damage control. Trump and his advisers offered a chorus of upbeat assessments about the economy over the weekend, while accusing Democrats and reporters of painting a picture of doom and gloom. This afternoon, Vice President Pence was in the swing state of Michigan delivering a rosy forecast to the Detroit Economic Club. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE PENCE: Despite the irresponsible rhetoric of many in the mainstream media, the American economy is strong. And the U. S. economic outlook remains strong as well. HORSLEY: White House economist Larry Kudlow will underscore that message this week in a series of phone calls with business and community leaders around the country. The administration says those calls were long planned. On NBC's \"Meet The Press\" yesterday, Kudlow emphasized some of the positive forces boosting the economy, especially the robust level of consumer spending. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MEET THE PRESS\")LARRY KUDLOW: We're doing pretty darn well in my judgment. Let's not be afraid of optimism. HORSLEY: Consumer spending has been strong. A lot of people are working and getting modest pay raises, so they have money to spend. But consumer confidence has dropped in the last month, and volatility in the stock market could make shoppers more cautious about opening their wallets. Business spending has already taken a hit, partly as a result of the ongoing trade war with China. Today, the administration granted a temporary reprieve to Chinese telecom giant Huawei. But Pence says the president is not about to go soft on Beijing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PENCE: The time has come for China to come to the table, open their markets and live by the rules of international commerce like every other industrialized nation does. HORSLEY: Trump argued to reporters over the weekend the trade war has taken a bigger toll on other countries than it has on the United States. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You look at a lot of countries, they're not doing well. China is doing poorly. Parts of Asia are doing poorly. We are doing better than any country or even area, anywhere in the world. We're doing great. HORSLEY: Trump often views other countries' pain as a potential gain for the United States. But that approach can backfire in a globally connected economy. News of a slowdown in China and Germany last week contributed to investors' jitters in this country. Trump also shrugged off a warning sign from the bond market last week that often signals a recession is looming within two years. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: That's a long time, two years. But I don't think so. Interest rates are low. I think I could be helped out by the Fed, but the Fed doesn't like helping me too much. HORSLEY: The president continues to browbeat the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, even though rates are already low - around 2%. Trump tweeted today they should be at least a full percentage point lower. The National Association for Business Economics released a survey today showing 4 out of 10 economists now expect a recession by the end of next year. That's actually down a bit from the group's last survey back in February. Nearly half the economists surveyed now think a recession won't come until 2021 or later. Even as he talked up the economy in Detroit today, the vice president had a warning of his own. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PENCE: I honestly believe if any one of the Democrats on that debate stage wins the presidency, the gains of the last two and a half years would be wiped out.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRES DONALD TRUMP: Payroll tax is something that we think about, and a lot of people would like to see that. That very much affects the working - the workers of our country. CORNISH: The payroll tax is the money that's automatically deducted from employees' paychecks for Social Security and Medicare. But would cutting those taxes now help juice the economy? We're going to put that question to Jason Furman. He served as an economic adviser to President Obama when Congress last gave a temporary payroll tax cut. Welcome back to the program. JASON FURMAN: Thanks for having me back. CORNISH: The economy is growing at a slower rate now. The stock market has been jittery. People are worried about the prospect of a recession. This is not exactly what was going on during the Obama administration in those early days, right? But would cutting the payroll tax now help stimulate growth? FURMAN: When we did the payroll tax cut, the unemployment rate was, you know, 8% or 9%. Right now it's below 4%. So I don't think this is something that's needed right now. But there is enough uncertainty in the economy that, who knows? Maybe six months from now, things will deteriorate and we might actually need it. CORNISH: The payroll tax is money that's deducted from our paychecks, right? That would go to Social Security and Medicare. Don't we need this money to fund those safety net programs? FURMAN: In the Obama administration, we set up a mechanism that the Social Security trust fund was repaid entirely for all of the payroll tax cut, and so it had no effect on Social Security solvency whatsoever. CORNISH: So basically the government filled in the gap while we took our pay cut. FURMAN: Right. It doesn't really have any effect at all on Social Security. It does increase our debt, and so there are consequences, but not consequences for Social Security or for senior citizens. CORNISH: People don't talk as much about deficits, but we're already looking at a trillion-dollar deficit, right? Could the U. S. afford to pay payroll taxes again? FURMAN: If we are in a decent shape, then I think it would be a wasteful addition to the debt. That would not be worth it. If the economy was turning down, then I would say we couldn't afford not to do a payroll tax cut or some other form of fiscal stimulus. CORNISH: But consumer spending has been strong, right? I mean, this is not the weak spot in the economy. FURMAN: Yeah. Consumer spending has been the most consistent, strong spot in the economy. And that's because employment levels are high. Wages are growing faster than inflation. And the types of worries we're seeing are in financial markets which are forward-looking and trying to think about what's going to happen next. But we're really not seeing it for consumers and in the labor market today as a problem. CORNISH: JPMorgan Chase came out with a forecast this week about the president's tariffs on products from China, and it said, if fully implemented, Trump's tariffs would cost the typical household a thousand dollars. So is that a reason to give ordinary Americans a break on their payroll tax? FURMAN: Well, that might be a reason to drop the tariffs. But yeah, if you did a 2% payroll tax cut, and you made $50,000 a year, you would get a thousand dollars off your taxes. So that would roughly cancel out with the full amount of the tariffs. CORNISH: What do you see as a possible alternative to this? I mean, some would say, look, there needs to be more business investment. Why not do an additional cut in the corporate tax rate? FURMAN: I think there's not a lot more room to stimulate the economy on the corporate side. I think if and when we need fiscal stimulus, we should have a comprehensive approach. Part of that is tax cuts for individuals. I would make them more progressive than a payroll tax cut, maybe give every household the same amount of money but phase it out for the most well-to-do households. But I'd also give fiscal relief to states and more money for things like unemployment insurance and nutrition assistance because if the economy turns down, those are the people that will be most hurt by it. CORNISH: That's Jason Furman. He served as chair of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. Thank you for explaining it to us. FURMAN: Thanks so much.

S. economy is fundamentally healthy, but the White House is now talking about doing some things that are often used to stoke an economy that's not doing so well. This week, President Trump talked about the possibility of implementing two different kinds of tax cuts, and he keeps yelling at the Federal Reserve on Twitter to cut interest rates. NPR's chief economics correspondent Scott Horsley is on the line. Good morning, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Noel. KING: OK. So the president is talking, first, about cutting payroll taxes, and that's something that would affect just about everyone who gets a paycheck in this country. Here's what President Trump said about that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Payroll tax is something that we think about and a lot of people would like to see that, and that very much affects the working - the workers of our country. KING: And he's right about that. So when, in the past, has the U. S. cut payroll taxes? HORSLEY: Congress authorized a temporary payroll tax cut back in 2011. And it's important to note that lawmakers did that as we were digging our way out of the Great Recession. The economy is a lot stronger now, and to the extent there has been a weak spot in the economy, it hasn't been consumer spending. It's really been business investment. But let's say that Congress were to do what they did back in 2011 and once again cut the payroll tax by, for example, two percentage points. That would balloon the deficit by another $150 billion a year. It would put about $800 in a typical worker's pockets over the course of a year, but a lot of that savings would then be eaten up by the president's own tariffs. JP Morgan Chase estimated this week that, if all the China tariffs go into effect, that'll cost the typical household about a $1,000 a year. KING: Interesting. So it could just be a wash regardless. The president's also talking about reducing the capital gains tax. Now, that is not something that would have any bearing on most Americans. Can you explain it? HORSLEY: This is an idea the administration has floated before. And you're right, this would overwhelmingly save money for the wealthy. More than three-quarters of all capital gains taxes are paid by people who make more than a million dollars a year. Capital gains are - capital gains taxes are taxes on investments, like real estate or stocks, that go up in value. And what the president's talking about doing here is eliminating taxes on that part of the gain that's eaten up by inflation over time. Now, one thing the White House likes about this is they argue that they could do this without Congress. They could do it through an IRS rulemaking process, although there's actually some question about that, and it would almost surely invite a legal challenge. KING: OK. President Trump also wants the Federal Reserve to help stoke the economy by cutting interest rates. He talks about this all the time. That's also something that we see when an economy is doing not so well or when it's expected to do not so well. Is the president getting any traction there? HORSLEY: The Fed did cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point last month, but Trump wants to see much bigger cuts. This week, he tweeted that the Fed should cut rates by a full percentage point. Now, that's sort of the economic equivalent of that hypodermic to the heart in \"Pulp Fiction. \" I mean, this is - to put it in perspective, back in 2008, when Bear Stearns collapsed and the economy was sliding off a cliff, the Fed cut rates by three-quarters of a percentage point. So Trump wants them to go even further now, even though his administration continues to insist the U. S. economy is solid. Here, for example, is Vice President Pence speaking this week in the swing state of Michigan. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)VICE PRESIDENT MICHAEL PENCE: Despite the wishful thinking of some naysayers in the media and in the Democratic Party, the American economy is strong. It's stronger than ever before. HORSLEY: If so, it's hard to imagine why the administration is calling for such aggressive stimulus. KING: Well, is it possible to say which it is - is the economy strong or does it need intervention - the way the president's been talking about it? HORSLEY: You know, we're still adding jobs. We're still growing. But it's definitely down-shifted. And some of the biggest slowdown has come in the parts of the economy that the administration likes to champion. Here's Vice President Pence again earlier this week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PENCE: I'm talking about people who make things, grow things, who spend their days building more than a Facebook page. HORSLEY: Manufacturing has been particularly affected by the slowdown, partly because of the president's trade war. Even industries that are supposed to benefit from protectionism, like steel, are suffering. Now, it's not a dramatic slowdown. We're not shifting into reverse. But for a president whose reelection chances may hinge on the economy, even a little slowdown can be scary. KING: NPR's chief economic correspondent, Scott Horsley. Thanks, Scott.

S. economy is showing signs of weakness, and we wondered if the financial system is strong enough to withstand another slowdown - or even a recession. Well, we've got NPR's Jim Zarroli on the line to consider this with us. Welcome back, Jim. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Hi. CORNISH: So first question out of the gate - is the financial system better prepared for a downturn this time around? ZARROLI: You know, it definitely is in some ways. After the subprime mortgage crisis, there was this big push to regulate the financial system and the investment banks and the mortgage lenders and insurance companies that control so much of the money that flows around the world. For instance, Congress passed laws that require banks to keep a bigger capital cushion. The idea is that would protect them if there's a downturn and people start defaulting on their loans. That was part of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law. But now the Trump administration has made no secret of the fact that it thinks these regulators went too far and that some of the rules need to be eased. And they've had some success. CORNISH: Give us an example. ZARROLI: Well, one example is the Volcker Rule. And remember a lot of banks were trading stocks and bonds and taking huge risks before the financial crisis. It was like a casino. The Volcker Rule put a stop to that. It said banks can't trade with their own money which is guaranteed by the federal government. They can't take those kinds of huge risks anymore. And after the Volcker Rule took effect, this kind of trading just, you know, fell off a cliff. Now, just this week, the Trump administration put out a new version of the rule. The new rule won't apply to as many banks as the old one did. So in effect, the administration is watering down the Volcker Rule. I spoke with Carter Dougherty of the group Americans for Financial Reform. And he says, you know, there's been a fair amount of this. I asked him whether he - this kind of tinkering would necessarily lead to another financial crisis. CARTER DOUGHERTY: No, and I would not make that case. Can you argue persuasively that they will make the next recession more painful than it should be? That is absolutely the case. CORNISH: All right. There are potential danger spots in the economy that we aren't paying enough to - paying enough attention to at this point. Right? I mean, is that what we're hearing? ZARROLI: Yeah. I think - you know, for instance, one area that is potentially risky is business lending. I mean, companies are borrowing huge amounts of money. They have been for a while. They take out enormous levels of debt so they can acquire companies - other companies. You know, the former Fed chair, Janet Yellen, said last October, if there is a downturn in the economy, a lot of firms will go bankrupt. She said it would probably worsen a downturn. And then here was the current Fed chair, Jerome Powell, giving a speech last May. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEROME POWELL: Business debt is at near-record levels, and recent issuance has been concentrated in the riskiest segments. As a result, some businesses may come under severe financial strain if the economy deteriorates. ZARROLI: And now, this - he said this isn't like the subprime mortgage crisis. It doesn't present the same kind of risk because business lending is just a much smaller part of the economy. CORNISH: We just heard Powell say, though, that business debt is at near-record levels. I mean, why do businesses need to borrow so much? ZARROLI: Well, you know, one reason is they're using it to buy back a lot of their own stock, which causes their share price to go up, makes shareholders happy. But all this borrowing is a problem because you don't normally expect businesses to cut down on their debt when times are good and they're doing well. And now the opposite is happening. And so if the economy keeps slowing, this is a big potential pitfall. CORNISH: That's NPR's Jim Zarroli. Jim, thanks for explaining it. ZARROLI: You're welcome.

The president announced on Twitter that he is ordering U. S. companies to find alternative suppliers outside of China. He can suggest they do that. He cannot, of course, order it. And his angry tweet sparked another sharp sell-off on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 600 points or 2 and a third percent. The S&P 500 fell for the fourth week in a row. And after the market closed, Mr. Trump announced he's ratcheting up tariffs. NPR's chief economic correspondent Scott Horsley joins us. Scott, thanks for being with us. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good to be with you. SIMON: What seemed to set off the tweet storm from the president? HORSLEY: China announced early yesterday that it is slapping tariffs on more U. S. exports - some $75 billion worth, including automobiles. So that was another escalation in the trade war. But to be clear, China was reacting to the president's tariffs which Trump had announced earlier this month. This is not the first time the administration has launched a protectionist volley and then seemed both surprised and hurt when a trading partner, like China, pushes back. That's when Trump angrily tweeted, our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China. And it was about that time that the stock market went off the edge. SIMON: And just to repeat, the president can't order a company to do anything like that, right? HORSLEY: I think you would search long and hard in Article II of the Constitution to find any authority for the president to dictate private supply chains. Now, overnight, President Trump was tweeting about the authority he has under the Emergency Economic Powers Act. And that authority is pretty sweeping, but it's also subject to congressional review. So that could be an interesting test. James Pethokoukis, who's an economic analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, says the kind of order that the president issued yesterday is unusual coming from the leader of a party that bills itself as the champions of capitalism. JAMES PETHOKOUKIS: You know, there's been a lot of debate about socialism where Republicans have been accusing Democrats of being socialists. But a president of the United States presuming to order the American private sector to leave one country, go to another country - it's what you would expect to see in a command-and-control economy. And this really has nothing to do with capitalism or free market economics. SIMON: And, Scott, the president also took on the Federal Reserve Chairman Powell. Not the first time he's done so. Tell us about their differences. HORSLEY: This is becoming a very routine thing. Jerome Powell has tried hard not to get into a war of words with the president, but the insults have been flying in one direction. Powell was at a conference of central bankers in Wyoming yesterday, and he said the Fed is facing some unusual challenges because of all the uncertainty surrounding trade policy. And last night, the White House added to that uncertainty. The president announced that he's raising the tariff rates on Chinese imports. Tariffs that were 10% are going to go to 15. Those that were 25% are going to go to 30. And that news came after the market closed. Had it come earlier, the sell-off on Wall Street might have been even worse. SIMON: And, of course, this comes after a week of mixed signals - I think it's fair to say - from the White House on the strength of the U. S. economy and how they might respond. HORSLEY: Yeah, the White House messaging has been all over the map. They've said the economy's great; they've said the economy needs an emergency rescue. They've said they're considering a tax cut; they've said a tax cut's off the table. Pethokoukis says there's very little in the last week that suggests any kind of long-term strategy from this White House. PETHOKOUKIS: A lot of the president's supporters, you know, they kind of think this is all strategic chaos. The president knows what he's doing; he's keeping his enemies off balance. Well, he's not supposed to be keeping investors and consumers and business off balance. I mean, that's us. HORSLEY: With signs the U. S. economy is slowing down, the president and his economic team are really being tested for the first time in the 2 1/2 years that Donald Trump's been in office. And so far, the markets are not terribly impressed with the way the White House has been handling this stress test. SIMON: NPR's Scott Horsley, thanks so much for being with us.

S. and China threatened each other with increasing tariffs, and President Trump ordered American companies to get out of China immediately. It isn't clear whether he has the authority to do that. The stock market took a plunge. And yet, after seeming to walk back his hard line on China, today, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said the president, quote, \"regrets not raising tariffs higher. \"So what do all these twists and turns mean? That's what we wanted to talk to Jennifer Rubin about. She's a conservative columnist for The Washington Post, and this morning, she published an op-ed entitled \"How To Respond To A Manic President Driving The Economy Into A Ditch. \" And Jennifer Rubin is with us now. Thank you for talking with us once again. JENNIFER RUBIN: My pleasure. MARTIN: So it's pretty clear from that title, from the headline of your piece, where you stand on all of this. But I just want to point out that you are not the only one to publish such a strongly-worded piece this weekend. I mean, your colleague, Megan McArdle, who's a self-described right-of-center columnist, a libertarian, wrote a piece titled, \"When Will Trump Supporters Finally Say, OK, This Is Not Normal? (ph)\" Michael Gerson is a former Republican speechwriter. He wrote a piece saying the Trump presidency is not just unfolding - it's unraveling. There was a similar piece by Max Boot, another former conservative writer. So what is it that all of you are responding to in this moment? RUBIN: I think in this particular episode, as opposed to some of the other ones, it was the frenetic zigzag back and forth on policy. One day, he was going to have a tax cut - the next day, he wasn't. One day, he was talking about Jews being disloyal - the next day he was calling himself the chosen one. It was this frenetic pace of kind of lashing out that seemed to be discombobulated. If you had a relative that was behaving this way, you'd maybe take them in or tell them to have a nice cup of tea and sit down. This is the president of the United States. And what we saw was what the market saw. And although I think presidents sometimes get too much blame and too much credit for the economy, here, I think there's a very real connection, which is businesspeople don't know what's coming next. MARTIN: The European Council President Donald Tusk said something that was widely believed to have been directed at Donald Trump yesterday when he said that, quote-unquote, \"senseless disputes with other countries are careening the global economy towards a recession,\" you pointed out in your piece that no congressional leader or presidential candidate in the United States has come out and said the same. One would think that they have at least as much stake in the American economy as Donald Tusk does. Why do you think that is? RUBIN: I attribute the Republican silence to their general strategy of not saying or doing anything to make him even madder at them. You can call it cowardice. You can call it avoidance. You can call it self-delusion. But they have really not stood up to this president, and I think they're hoping to just stay out of his way at this point. As far as the Democratic presidential candidates, it's a really good question, and I actually think they should. And I think there is that opportunity for Democrats to be the grown-ups here - to give a serious speech explaining the dangers of increasing tariffs, to explain the importance of an independent central bank and to lay out in their mind what would be a better strategy in terms of taking on the Chinese. I think it would make a really impressive contrast right now as the president is unspooling. And these people are running for the job, and it would be nice to hear, like, an audition. Well, if we had so-and-so, what would they sound like? MARTIN: You know, essentially, your colleagues at the - on the Post editorial page, Megan McArdle, also wrote a piece. Again, as I mentioned, it's called, you know, \"When Will Trump Supporters Finally Say, OK, This Is Not Normal? \" And she says that her task to this point has been to persuade people that even if this manner of governing has its appeals to people on the right, in the long run, it's not functional. The question I think - this question continues to be, you know, why is it that this argument does not seem to be persuasive to people on the right? You know, as I think many people have noted, the president's approval rating among Republicans, self-identified Republicans, remains quite high. RUBIN: I think what has gone on is that in the past, his crazy antics, his bigoted comments, his somewhat manic behavior didn't really seem to matter much. The economy was going strong. He wasn't slapping tariffs on people. So they got kind of into the habit of ignoring him. Now it's a whole different ballgame because what he is saying is, in fact, threatening that good economy, which was the one reason they were sticking with him in the first place. MARTIN: You know, finally, you've - in your column, you've just laid out some of your thoughts - a step-by-step plan of managing the economic damage that you attribute to President Trump and his style of governing. You said, you know, the Democrats should give a serious speech warning of the dangers of this escalating trade war. They should reaffirm the independence of the Fed and pledge to keep politics out of the central bank - and noting that Trump has been very critical and personally insulting toward the Fed chair, whom he appointed. You said that Democrats and the president - the presidential race should demand hearings when Congress reconvenes to analyze what's going on and explain where all this is headed, how this actually works. So your column is very much directed toward political elites and, like, what they should do. Is there something that you think citizens should be doing right now? RUBIN: Registering to vote, perhaps (laughter). You know, this is the problem - that an ordinary citizen doesn't have much leverage. But there are citizens who do, and that is the business community. And I think he does listen to them. And when you have someone like Josh Bolten, who was with the George Bush administration - Bush 43 - go on national television and essentially plead with the president to stop this kind of stuff, that may have some effect. So I think the people who have influence with Trump because he sees them as peers as opposed to political opponents and who make economic decisions - now would be a really good time for them to weigh in, either privately or publicly, and let him know exactly what's going on. It was interesting today that one of his closest international allies, Boris Johnson, weighed in and needled him just a little bit about these trade deals. And I actually think that's the right approach. It has to come from people who he thinks are like him and on his side for him to perhaps accept some guidance and to begin to calm things down and maybe even roll things back a bit. MARTIN: That is Jennifer Rubin, opinion writer at The Washington Post. Jennifer, thanks so much for talking with us once again. RUBIN: My pleasure. (SOUNDBITE OF FISHMANS' \"BABY BLUE\") MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  President Trump's comments at the G-7 come on the heels of an already chaotic week when the U.

The question I think - this question continues to be, you know, why is it that this argument does not seem to be persuasive to people on the right? You know, as I think many people have noted, the president's approval rating among Republicans, self-identified Republicans, remains quite high. RUBIN: I think what has gone on is that in the past, his crazy antics, his bigoted comments, his somewhat manic behavior didn't really seem to matter much. The economy was going strong. He wasn't slapping tariffs on people. So they got kind of into the habit of ignoring him. Now it's a whole different ballgame because what he is saying is, in fact, threatening that good economy, which was the one reason they were sticking with him in the first place. MARTIN: You know, finally, you've - in your column, you've just laid out some of your thoughts - a step-by-step plan of managing the economic damage that you attribute to President Trump and his style of governing. You said, you know, the Democrats should give a serious speech warning of the dangers of this escalating trade war. They should reaffirm the independence of the Fed and pledge to keep politics out of the central bank - and noting that Trump has been very critical and personally insulting toward the Fed chair, whom he appointed. You said that Democrats and the president - the presidential race should demand hearings when Congress reconvenes to analyze what's going on and explain where all this is headed, how this actually works. So your column is very much directed toward political elites and, like, what they should do. Is there something that you think citizens should be doing right now? RUBIN: Registering to vote, perhaps (laughter). You know, this is the problem - that an ordinary citizen doesn't have much leverage. But there are citizens who do, and that is the business community. And I think he does listen to them. And when you have someone like Josh Bolten, who was with the George Bush administration - Bush 43 - go on national television and essentially plead with the president to stop this kind of stuff, that may have some effect. So I think the people who have influence with Trump because he sees them as peers as opposed to political opponents and who make economic decisions - now would be a really good time for them to weigh in, either privately or publicly, and let him know exactly what's going on. It was interesting today that one of his closest international allies, Boris Johnson, weighed in and needled him just a little bit about these trade deals. And I actually think that's the right approach. It has to come from people who he thinks are like him and on his side for him to perhaps accept some guidance and to begin to calm things down and maybe even roll things back a bit. MARTIN: That is Jennifer Rubin, opinion writer at The Washington Post. Jennifer, thanks so much for talking with us once again. RUBIN: My pleasure.

Tax cuts and increased government spending, plus tariffs dragging down economic growth. Michael Peterson is CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a nonpartisan fiscal watchdog group. Welcome. MICHAEL PETERSON: Thank you very much. FADEL: So what does that mean for, for example, a young American just starting her career? How will a trillion-dollar deficit affect her? PETERSON: Well, the deficit places a burden on the next generation. So we already have $22 trillion of debt on our books today and this has driven - the most important being demographics. We have a very significant baby boom generation that's just beginning to enter retirement. And when they retire, they come out of the workforce and stop paying in and go into the retirement system and start taking out. So each one of them sort of is a double whammy. So what happens when you have a huge level of debt like this is that it comes with an interest burden. So today, we're paying a billion dollars a day in interest. FADEL: Oh, wow. PETERSON: And that's a billion dollars that can't go into something else. It can't go into a safety net program or an investment or international defense, or it's a billion dollars that we need to collect from our citizens that we wouldn't otherwise have had to. FADEL: Now, your work is really dedicated to getting politicians to pay attention to this debt. Is it working? PETERSON: Well, I would say they're certainly not paying enough attention. We're in this situation due to a significant lack of leadership and lack of fiscal responsibility. The truth is the vast majority of Democrats and the vast majority of Republicans want our politicians to spend more time addressing this issue because they may not understand all the effects and all the different numbers, but they know it's not a good thing for them and their future and their kids and grandkids. FADEL: These two parties have really different economic approaches. How do you talk to both parties and how do you appeal to them to focus on what you think is so important in this debt? PETERSON: This is too big a challenge for any one party to take and solve on their own. I don't think any party would ever do that. And even if they did, it probably wouldn't last. So it's the classic type of problem where we all need to come together and solve it. And I think there are strong arguments on both sides of the aisle in favor of addressing this. So if you're a progressive and you care about the safety net or you care about inequality or you care about climate change or infrastructure, having this debt burden makes it more difficult to tackle all of those issues because there's just less resources available for these programs. If you're on the conservative side and more for limited government, you know, we have a $365 billion interest tab this year - that's a billion dollars a day - will be exclusively used to pay interest. So that's theoretically more taxes than we would need to burden our citizens with. So, again, whether you're a Democrat or Republican, having more debt is not helpful. FADEL: That's Michael Peterson.

Import taxes are making Chinese goods more expensive in the United States. But finding alternative suppliers isn't that cheap either. NPR's Scott Horsley has the story. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Many American companies are facing rising costs because of the tariffs. But Robert D'Loren doesn't have to worry. D'Loren's CEO of the Xcel Brands company, which sells clothing under the Isaac Mizrahi and Halston labels, among others. He began moving out of China some time ago not because of tariffs but in order to find faster, more flexible suppliers who could jump on fashion trends and turn out clothes in just six weeks. D'Loren says Xcel now manufacturers in a variety of countries, including Indonesia, India and Sri Lanka and is exploring production in Central and South America. ROBERT D'LOREN: You never want to have all of your eggs in one basket in terms of supply. China was easy. In retrospect, probably, if you had 90% of your production in China, that wasn't good risk management planning. HORSLEY: D'Loren has gone from making 70% of his clothes in China to less than 20%. But it wasn't easy. He spent two years flying around the world, trying to line up factories. D'LOREN: It took us five deliveries to get it right. Everything that could go wrong did go wrong. HORSLEY: Clothes from the new factories didn't fit right at first or the fabric wasn't what he expected. Many companies are now going through a similar process of trial and error as they look for alternatives to Chinese factories in hopes of avoiding the president's tariffs. GERRY MATTIOS: The truth is that the trade war is a little bit of a wakeup call for many companies. HORSLEY: Gerry Mattios is a vice president with Bain & Company consultants based in Singapore. He says rising labor costs in China were already causing some companies to look elsewhere for suppliers, and the Trump tariffs have accelerated that. But other countries will need a lot of investment to match the expert manufacturing base and the robust shipping network that China's built up over the last two decades. A survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China, which represents U. S. business there, says most companies that do relocate look to Southeast Asia. Vietnam's exports to the U. S. jumped 33% in the first six months of this year. Mexico is another popular destination. Roberto Durazo works for a company there called IVEMSA that helps manufacturers set up shop in Mexico. Durazo held three conference calls with potential clients in a single day this week. But for now, he says most are keeping their options open. ROBERTO DURAZO: Not many of them are pulling the trigger. My feeling is that many of them are gathering information, and if the trade war continues for a long time, just making the decision of coming into Mexico. HORSLEY: Mexico offers the advantage of much shorter delivery time to the U. S. , but it has risks of its own. Just three months ago, President Trump was threatening tariffs on goods made there. Trump has urged companies worried about tariffs to move production back to the United States, but only about 6% of the American companies operating in China are considering that. Harry Moser, who runs the Reshoring Initiative, estimates 25% would find manufacturing in the U. S. competitive if they took tariffs, transportation and all other costs into account. HARRY MOSER: Probably, they made the right decision going to China when their wages were so low. Probably, they should have reevaluated it five years ago. But now that they feel they have to bring a lot of work out of China, now is the perfect time to reevaluate the U. S. as an alternative. HORSLEY: But some companies are staying put.

Bond manager PIMCO is not so sanguine. We're joined now by the U. S. economist Tiffany Wilding. Thanks very much for being with us. TIFFANY WILDING: Well, thanks for having me. SIMON: What do you see that concerns you? WILDING: I think one thing is that, you know, you have to look a little bit below the surface more recently on the economic data to really get a feel for what's going on because some of the things that the Trump administration is doing on trade policy is actually sort of artificially boosting growth. And that is to say that when you're putting on tariffs on imports, what tends to happen before that is that you get a boost of activity because, you know, consumers or businesses, they want to try to buy the things that they need ahead of those tariffs to try to minimize at least some of their costs, especially if they think the tariffs are going to be transitory. So I think that's what we've been seeing over the past couple of quarters. You know, so the growth, although - in the U. S. economy, although it's been stronger or above trend on a headline basis - I think 2. 5% - if you start to look under the surface, it looks a bit weaker. And a couple of things that I would just note there. You know, we are seeing a manufacturing recession, manufacturing sector recession in the U. S. The global - you know, global - our global peers, global trading partners are also looking quite weak in terms of their growth. But I think the most concerning thing for us, at least more recently, is that that weakness is actually starting to spill over into labor markets, which is important for the consumer. And, really, the consumer's the backbone of the U. S. economy. So if you start to see the consumer really stop spending or pull back, you know, that's when things can get a bit fragile. And that's what we worry about. SIMON: What - I gather you're concerned about aggregate hours, if you could explain that to us. WILDING: Yeah. So when you think about the building blocks of, you know, GDP growth - like, what really is that? - well, it's really how many hours do I work as a person, and then how productive am I during those hours at creating the things that we produce in the U. S. economy. You know, so when we track activity, aggregate hours is one very nice way or one real-time way that we do that. And what we've been seeing more recently is that indicators of aggregate economy-wide hours have been falling, and they've been falling faster than we kind of thought that they would. And I think the other important thing on this is that it's not just the manufacturing sector. So the manufacturing sector only makes up about 10% of the U. S. economy. So in and of itself, you know, it's not maybe enough to really push the U. S. into recession. But we're starting to see these aggregate hours decelerate in other services sectors. And that's why, you know, we've become more worried more recently, and we're starting to question whether, you know, the economy really is in a good place, as many have said. SIMON: Your firm's the biggest bond manager in the world. Do you hesitate a bit before making a call like this, knowing that a lot of people are going to take a cue from it? Does talking more about the possibility of a recession make a recession more likely? WILDING: Well, I mean, I think certainly uncertainty and rising uncertainty can exacerbate a downturn. And that's something that we worry about. You know, now, when you kind of think about how that plays out, one way that I think is really important is that you have, you know, investors, you know, that become more uncertain about the outlook are less likely to, for example, you know, buy corporate bonds or buy that new issuance. And in that kind of environment, borrowing costs rise. And when you have that, then that sort of helps to slow down the economy even more. You know, so economists like to use fancy words. We call this a financial accelerator effect, so where you're getting this uncertainty that kind of, you know, causes markets to become disorderly, causes credit creation to decelerate. And that exacerbates a recession. So I certainly think that that is possible. You know, and I think that's another reason in favor of the Federal Reserve cutting rates, you know, trying to be more preemptive in this situation to try to keep confidence not from deteriorating too dramatically.

Those are some of the thousands of items now being targeted by the Trump administration with a new 15% tariff. It's the latest salvo in the president's trade war with Beijing. China had threatened to retaliate but may hold off as the two countries prepare for what could be another round of trade negotiations. NPR's Scott Horsley is here to explain this. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning. FADEL: Good morning. The tariffs taking effect today cover more than $100 billion worth of Chinese imports, but other products were spared - at least for now. Explain what the administration is up to here. HORSLEY: Right. President Trump first announced these tariffs about a month ago out of frustration with the slow pace of trade talks with China. And at first, he called for tariffs on virtually everything the U. S. buys from China. But after a couple of weeks, he backed down a little bit and announced that some of the tariffs would be postponed to avoid disrupting the holiday shopping season. So a lot of popular consumer items, like smartphones and laptops, some toys, are getting a reprieve - at least until December 15. At the same time, there are still a lot of products that are facing tariffs starting today - a lot of apparel, some food products, certain spices we import from China and, oddly enough, American flags. Last year, we bought more than $6 million worth of American flags made in China. As of today, they'll be taxed at 15%. FADEL: So American flags are getting more expensive. So China said it was going to respond with tariffs of its own, but now it looks like Beijing may be hitting the pause button. Is the trade war heating up? Is it cooling off? HORSLEY: That's what businesspeople and investors have been trying to figure out. And you know, reading the tea leaves, it seems to change day by day. Just over a week ago, China announced retaliatory tariffs on some $75 billion worth of American products, including automobiles. That really got under President Trump's skin. He pushed back by raising tariffs. The day that happened, the stock market nosedived. The S&P 500 fell more than 2. 5%. But then, just a few days later, the president seemed to dial down the tensions. He told reporters that China had reached out and said it wanted to go back to the bargaining table. The stock market rallied. It's not actually clear that China had reached out. Maybe that was just a ruse from the president. But a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce did hint last Thursday that China might not go ahead with its own tariffs right now. Whatever's going on, the stock market seems to welcome this more conciliatory tone. This week, the S&P ended up about 2. 7%. FADEL: But the administration is still slapping new tariffs on China today. So what's going on? HORSLEY: That's right. Even as he says he's open to talking with China, the president has left in place this latest round of tariffs, and the tariff rate is still 15%. That's up from 10% when the tax was initially announced. Trump is also threatening to raise the tariff rate on another $250 billion worth of Chinese imports that are already being taxed at 25%. Trump wants to raise that to 30% on October 1 unless there's some kind of deal between now and then. U. S. and Chinese negotiators are supposed to meet here in Washington sometime this month in September, but we haven't seen a real date yet. FADEL: How is all this affecting businesses, consumers? HORSLEY: Consumers are still spending pretty freely. We got new numbers from the Commerce Department on Friday showing consumer spending grew at a solid pace in July. And that's encouraging because consumer spending has been the most durable pillar propping up the economy. Business investment, on the other hand, has been slumping, and trade tensions seem to be contributing to that. The president has told businesses they can avoid his tariffs by moving production out of China - maybe bringing it home to the United States - but a lot of companies are telling us that's not so easy. Some are exploring shifting production to other low-cost countries like Vietnam or Mexico. But two recent surveys found that the majority of American firms doing business in China have no plans to relocate. FADEL: NPR's Scott Horsley, thank you so much. HORSLEY: You're welcome. LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Black tea, cotton jumpsuits and snowblowers made in China are all getting more expensive today. Those are some of the thousands of items now being targeted by the Trump administration with a new 15% tariff. It's the latest salvo in the president's trade war with Beijing. China had threatened to retaliate but may hold off as the two countries prepare for what could be another round of trade negotiations. NPR's Scott Horsley is here to explain this. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning. FADEL: Good morning. The tariffs taking effect today cover more than $100 billion worth of Chinese imports, but other products were spared - at least for now. Explain what the administration is up to here. HORSLEY: Right. President Trump first announced these tariffs about a month ago out of frustration with the slow pace of trade talks with China. And at first, he called for tariffs on virtually everything the U. S. buys from China. But after a couple of weeks, he backed down a little bit and announced that some of the tariffs would be postponed to avoid disrupting the holiday shopping season. So a lot of popular consumer items, like smartphones and laptops, some toys, are getting a reprieve - at least until December 15. At the same time, there are still a lot of products that are facing tariffs starting today - a lot of apparel, some food products, certain spices we import from China and, oddly enough, American flags. Last year, we bought more than $6 million worth of American flags made in China. As of today, they'll be taxed at 15%. FADEL: So American flags are getting more expensive. So China said it was going to respond with tariffs of its own, but now it looks like Beijing may be hitting the pause button. Is the trade war heating up? Is it cooling off? HORSLEY: That's what businesspeople and investors have been trying to figure out. And you know, reading the tea leaves, it seems to change day by day. Just over a week ago, China announced retaliatory tariffs on some $75 billion worth of American products, including automobiles. That really got under President Trump's skin. He pushed back by raising tariffs. The day that happened, the stock market nosedived. The S&P 500 fell more than 2. 5%. But then, just a few days later, the president seemed to dial down the tensions. He told reporters that China had reached out and said it wanted to go back to the bargaining table. The stock market rallied. It's not actually clear that China had reached out. Maybe that was just a ruse from the president. But a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce did hint last Thursday that China might not go ahead with its own tariffs right now. Whatever's going on, the stock market seems to welcome this more conciliatory tone. This week, the S&P ended up about 2. 7%.

Manufacturing activity shrank last month for the first time in three years. Factories are particularly sensitive to slowing global demand, and the trade war with China isn't helping. While manufacturing is a relatively small part of the U. S. economy, its slump could be a warning sign for others, as NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: HM Manufacturing in Wauconda, Ill. , makes a wide variety of products for companies ranging from food makers to the aerospace industry. CEO Nicole Wolter says most of her business is holding up well, but she has seen a slump in demand for the kind of pulleys and gears she sells to the auto industry. NICOLE WOLTER: I can see that orders for that section have completely almost come to, like, a grinding halt. HORSLEY: And orders aren't the only indicator of factory activity that are dropping. According to the Institute for Supply Management, which tracks the sector, measures of output and employment also fell last month. Wolter's employees are still working overtime, but the average factory workweek has been slipping. WOLTER: People are laying off third and second shifts and going down to 32 hours or 34 hours. That doesn't seem so exciting. HORSLEY: This downward trend didn't start overnight. Factories have been tapping the brakes since April, but August was the first time in three years that the index showed the manufacturing sector actually shifting into reverse. Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics says the slump looks like more than a momentary blip. GREGORY DACO: Manufacturing activity is gradually not just cooling but also contracting. And if you look at some of the forward-looking components of the ISM index, businesses in general are not very optimistic about the outlook. HORSLEY: An index of new orders was the lowest since 2012. Factory job growth has also slumped to less than half what it was last year. Factories are feeling the effects of slower growth in countries like Germany and China. On top of that, there's the trade war, which has thrown a monkey wrench into both imported supplies and exported products. LISA WINTON: Manufacturing is definitely impacted tremendously through uncertainty. HORSLEY: Lisa Winton runs the Winton Machine Company in Suwanee, Ga. , which makes machines for fabricating metal tubes, the kind of things you might find in a refrigerator or outdoor furniture. WINTON: There's just so many different things that have small, bent tubes on them, and we build the machines that cut, bend, form that tubing. HORSLEY: Wolter says whenever the direction of the economy is uncertain, companies are reluctant to invest in that kind of equipment. WOLTER: When we are shipping capital equipment and it has a four-month lead time, people want to know in four months when they're paying for that product that they're not going to have an additional tariff because that's not in their budget. HORSLEY: The big question now is whether the slump in manufacturing will be confined to that sector. So far, the broader economy has held up pretty well, thanks in large part to robust consumer spending. But Daco says there's always a danger that factories' woes could spread. DACO: And the main channel is going to be via confidence that is gradually going to erode as well as via financial markets, which have already started to show some initial signs of worries as the trade tensions have increased. HORSLEY: A University of Michigan survey released last week showed tariffs had begun eating into consumers' confidence, and today the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled nearly 300 points.

Wyoming Public Radio's Cooper McKim reports. (SOUNDBITE OF DOGS BARKING)DARLENE REA: Oh, stop it. COOPER MCKIM, BYLINE: Darlene Rea calms down her three dogs outside Gillette, Wyo. , which calls itself the energy capital of the U. S. Until two months ago, Rea worked in Blackjewel's warehouse writing invoices, finding parts. But since the coal company's abrupt bankruptcy, she's been stuck looking for work. REA: Every day, every day, every day, you keep waiting and wondering if somebody is going to call you, if someone's going to set you up an interview, you know, and there's nothing. MCKIM: Rea has a medically retired husband and a mortgage. Worst comes to worst, she'll have to sell the house and move, a tough option with grandkids nearby. Rea says her positivity is fading with each passing day of a particularly prolonged bankruptcy. REA: I didn't think it was going to be this long, seriously. MCKIM: Gillette is used to bankruptcies. Blackjewel is the third one in Wyoming this year. But this one is more dramatic. Paychecks went unpaid. A CEO was pushed out. And most importantly, the gates of the mines here were locked, stopping coal production. Miners say that just doesn't happen. The move left 600 people out of work in the town. In two months, only a quarter of workers have found jobs, according to local management. Ty Cordingly is one of them. At a diner in Gillette, he says he's lucky. TY CORDINGLY: I got some co-workers that had to go to Nevada, Montana, South Carolina, you know, Arizona when there's not very many jobs. Our entire community is based around the energy industries. MCKIM: The town isn't just losing people, but money, too. Blackjewel owes the county $37 million, funds that support not only local services but state education. It's left local vendors unpaid. The company even owes the federal government more than $60 million. Cordingly thinks Wyoming relies too much on energy. CORDINGLY: This isn't a story about one individual or one generation. The state has always just counted on us being the cash cow for the state of Wyoming, and they didn't have to do any planning because the oil kept flowing and the trains kept rolling out with oil on it. MCKIM: Over the past year, Campbell County produced the most tax revenue for the state. Oil and gas is certainly still flowing. But coal isn't having as much luck. BILL FORTNER: It's the Stone Age of fossil fuels - coal is. It's done. MCKIM: That's Bill Fortner, who's driving me to his regular diner. His ancestors homesteaded here four generations ago. Fortner is a staunch Republican who's mined coal for much of his life. He says President Trump has been the best shot coal's had, but it hasn't been enough. Production in the Powder River Basin has declined by a third in the past decade. Fortner says the area needs to adapt - quick. FORTNER: Otherwise we're going to be sitting here looking at another ghost town. MCKIM: Local leaders say Gillette is already taking steps to diversify its economy.

HORSLEY: I think it's basically underscoring what we've been saying, which is that economic growth has downshifted. We've gone from adding about 230,000 jobs a month at the end of 2018 to now 130,000 jobs a month. And that number in August would have been lower still had it not been for the temporary hiring of some 25,000 census workers. In addition, the job gains for June and July were revised down by a total of 20,000 jobs. We're particularly seeing a slowdown in the factory sector. That's been a sector that the president likes to talk about, but it's been hard hit by his trade war as well as by the general slump in global demand. But we're also seeing that the slowdown's not limited to manufacturing. We've seen a general deceleration across the board. And even though consumer spending is still strong, a lot of that spending's happening in nontraditional stores now, so the retail sector continues to hemorrhage jobs. Retailers shed another 11,000 workers last month. KING: But - and this is the tricky thing. We've talked about this before. The unemployment rate is still low, right - about 3. 7%? KING: It is.

Attorneys general from several states have launched a formal investigation into the social media giant over anti-competitive practices. The New York attorney general's office confirmed this morning they are leading an investigation that will look at whether Facebook is hurting consumers. This is the latest move by federal and state government to get tough on big social media companies. We should note here Facebook is an NPR sponsor. We've got NPR's Aarti Shahani on the line to tell us more about this. Hi, Aarti. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Hi. MARTIN: What do you know about the investigation thus far? SHAHANI: So the New York state attorney general, Letitia James, announced she's leading a bipartisan investigation - you heard me right, bipartisan. MARTIN: (Laughter). SHAHANI: That's right. MARTIN: Hurray for that. SHAHANI: It is multipronged. First, has Facebook been negligent with consumer data? Two billion-plus users signed up for the service. That's about a quarter of the population on Earth entrusting the company. MARTIN: Wow. SHAHANI: And Facebook has then turned around and offered exclusive access to these stockpiles of data to partners who could maybe help Facebook grow even bigger and more powerful like Cambridge Analytica and also Airbnb. Another question that James and her colleagues will investigate is whether Facebook's growth is harming consumer choice. I'll give you an example here. Just this week, the company brought its matchmaking service to the U. S. , OK? Plenty of other dating apps already exist here. Facebook takes a lot of features from those apps and could easily drive the competitors out of business not because Facebook is offering a better service but because Facebook's so dominant, startups can't compete for attention. Some advertisers have expressed concern about how much control Facebook has over the market. The AGs will take a look into that, too. MARTIN: Is this just about Facebook? Or are there other companies targeted here? SHAHANI: So another set of AGs is looking at Google. And that's being led by the Texas attorney general, a Republican, Ken Paxton. He's leading a multi-state probe into Google, according to The Wall Street Journal. Back in June, Paxton raised the concern that information about how people spend their lives - GPS location data from Google Maps or Waze, what we search for, what we view on YouTube. This data, he said, has become extremely valuable, especially when aggregated into large sets and analyzed and packaged for targeted marketing. And he was concerned that the biggest platforms like Google's YouTube don't have an incentive to protect consumers. You know, just this week, Google settled a case for covertly and illegally tracking little kids as they're watching \"Peppa Pig. \" Paxton and 42 other AGs asked the Federal Trade Commission to work closely with them to look at predatory conduct and anti-competitive practices. So presumably, that's the effort he's leading. MARTIN: So, you know, consumers have been hearing these stories about Facebook or Google for a long time now, right? And I just wonder if you're seeing that take any - have any kind of effect because it seems to me every bad news story that comes out about these companies, consumers are, like, well, I get it. But it's just so integral in my life. It's convenient. It helps me keep in touch with family and friends. SHAHANI: Right. But I actually think that that picture is changing, particularly as we start to understand the real stakes of it, right? There was a school of thought that maybe is still out there a bit of, hey, it's free, so it can't be bad for me. I don't pay for Facebook or YouTube. But then we have to note, Rachel, that we're entering a new chapter in history, right? That chapter is the data economy. The companies that own information, which they will then sell to other businesses - they have a whole lot of control. They can set prices. They can wipe out entire sectors. They can control what we believe and think to be true. I mean, we've reported on this repeatedly. MARTIN: Right. SHAHANI: So while the individual consumer right now might not feel harm in the moment, pain in the moment, in the long run, there could be a massive transfer of wealth and power that hurts us all. So I think that the picture is changing there. I would add that Google says it's working with regulators, including AGs. MARTIN: All right. NPR's Aarti Shahani. Aarti, thanks. We appreciate it. SHAHANI: Thank you. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Facebook is under fire again. Attorneys general from several states have launched a formal investigation into the social media giant over anti-competitive practices. The New York attorney general's office confirmed this morning they are leading an investigation that will look at whether Facebook is hurting consumers. This is the latest move by federal and state government to get tough on big social media companies. We should note here Facebook is an NPR sponsor. We've got NPR's Aarti Shahani on the line to tell us more about this. Hi, Aarti. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Hi. MARTIN: What do you know about the investigation thus far? SHAHANI: So the New York state attorney general, Letitia James, announced she's leading a bipartisan investigation - you heard me right, bipartisan. MARTIN: (Laughter). SHAHANI: That's right. MARTIN: Hurray for that. SHAHANI: It is multipronged. First, has Facebook been negligent with consumer data? Two billion-plus users signed up for the service. That's about a quarter of the population on Earth entrusting the company. MARTIN: Wow. SHAHANI: And Facebook has then turned around and offered exclusive access to these stockpiles of data to partners who could maybe help Facebook grow even bigger and more powerful like Cambridge Analytica and also Airbnb. Another question that James and her colleagues will investigate is whether Facebook's growth is harming consumer choice. I'll give you an example here. Just this week, the company brought its matchmaking service to the U. S. , OK? Plenty of other dating apps already exist here. Facebook takes a lot of features from those apps and could easily drive the competitors out of business not because Facebook is offering a better service but because Facebook's so dominant, startups can't compete for attention. Some advertisers have expressed concern about how much control Facebook has over the market. The AGs will take a look into that, too. MARTIN: Is this just about Facebook? Or are there other companies targeted here? SHAHANI: So another set of AGs is looking at Google. And that's being led by the Texas attorney general, a Republican, Ken Paxton. He's leading a multi-state probe into Google, according to The Wall Street Journal. Back in June, Paxton raised the concern that information about how people spend their lives - GPS location data from Google Maps or Waze, what we search for, what we view on YouTube. This data, he said, has become extremely valuable, especially when aggregated into large sets and analyzed and packaged for targeted marketing. And he was concerned that the biggest platforms like Google's YouTube don't have an incentive to protect consumers. You know, just this week, Google settled a case for covertly and illegally tracking little kids as they're watching \"Peppa Pig. \" Paxton and 42 other AGs asked the Federal Trade Commission to work closely with them to look at predatory conduct and anti-competitive practices. So presumably, that's the effort he's leading. MARTIN: So, you know, consumers have been hearing these stories about Facebook or Google for a long time now, right? And I just wonder if you're seeing that take any - have any kind of effect because it seems to me every bad news story that comes out about these companies, consumers are, like, well, I get it. But it's just so integral in my life. It's convenient. It helps me keep in touch with family and friends. SHAHANI: Right. But I actually think that that picture is changing, particularly as we start to understand the real stakes of it, right? There was a school of thought that maybe is still out there a bit of, hey, it's free, so it can't be bad for me. I don't pay for Facebook or YouTube. But then we have to note, Rachel, that we're entering a new chapter in history, right? That chapter is the data economy. The companies that own information, which they will then sell to other businesses - they have a whole lot of control. They can set prices. They can wipe out entire sectors.

S. employers hired fewer workers last month. The Labor Department says employers added just 130,000 jobs in August, and that is fewer than forecasters were expecting. The number would have been even weaker had it not been for the hiring of 25,000 temporary census workers. That jobs report is another sign of an economy that's been tapping the brakes. NPR's Scott Horsley is here. Hey, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise. KELLY: So how should we square this? Slowdown in job growth - on the other hand, the unemployment rate is still very low - right? - 3. 7%. HORSLEY: That's right. So the slowdown in job growth could be a normal sign of an economy that's at or near full employment. We often hear from employers who say they're having trouble finding workers to fill the job openings. But it's also likely we're seeing some fallout from the ongoing trade war and the slowdown in global demand. The manufacturing sector in particular is vulnerable to that kind of fallout. And factories added only 3,000 jobs last month. The factory numbers for June and July were also revised down. Now that's consistent with some of the other economic indicators we got this week, which together paint a picture of a manufacturing sector that actually shrank last month for the first time in three years. KELLY: So if overall the economy is tapping the brakes, as we put it, does that mean a recession is looming? HORSLEY: Not necessarily. All indications are the U. S. economy is still growing. It's just growing more slowly than it was, say, a year ago. While the Trump administration talks a lot about manufacturing, it's important to keep in mind factories are a relatively small part of the overall economy. They represent about 8% of jobs, about 11% of GDP. Economist Jared Bernstein, who's with the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, says that's about a third of what factories represented a few decades ago. So a slowdown in manufacturing doesn't necessarily have to drag down the broader U. S. economy. JARED BERNSTEIN: It's not pretty, and it's not something I like to see. And it's a totally self-inflicted wound, so it's really dumb. But I don't know that it's recessionary at this point. HORSLEY: Now that said, we are also seeing some slowdown in the larger services side of the economy - things like health care and finance, radio reporters. The economy added less than two-thirds as many services jobs in August as in the two previous months. And what's more, we continue to see job losses in the retail sector. There were 11,000 fewer retail jobs in August. Even though consumers are still spending money, they're just not spending in a lot of traditional stores. KELLY: Was there anything good in this jobs report, Scott? HORSLEY: Yeah, there were some encouraging signs. The labor force participation rate ticked up. More than half a million new people came into the workforce. That's encouraging. It means people who've been on the sidelines are seeing opportunities in this tight job market. We've also seen some acceleration in wage growth and a very slight increase in the average workweek. So you've got more people working more hours and making more money. That means consumers will have some spending power. And because consumer spending is such a big part of the economy, that should keep things afloat even if we're growing more slowly. KELLY: All right, so we keep talking about growing more slowly, slowdown and so on. Does it follow that the Federal Reserve may roll into the rescue, cut interest rates in the coming days, months? HORSLEY: You know, the Fed was already expected to cut rates by a quarter point at its next meeting in less than two weeks. And I don't think anything in this report's going to change that expectation. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell admitted to an audience in Switzerland, though, today we are in a kind of gray area. And there is some disagreement among his colleagues about just how much medicine the U. S. economy needs. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEROME POWELL: There'll always be questions about how much to do and how fast to move and things like that. But sometimes, things are relatively clear. Other times, it's murky out there. There is a range of views, and I think this is one of those times. HORSLEY: Still, Powell stressed the central bank is committed to using its tools to prolong the now decade-old economic expansion. KELLY: Thank you, Scott. HORSLEY: You're welcome.

In the early 1950s, a young guy is working at a desk deep inside the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. It's not exactly a corner office. And he complains to his wife that he has no future there at the Fed. He's not a banker. He's not a lawyer. He is a lowly economist. That is what life is like for economists in the 1950s. BINYAMIN APPELBAUM: Nobody respects them, in part, just because economics was a new thing in the world. The idea that people could manage economic conditions, could improve economic conditions - these were new ideas in the world. I mean, it's just stunning to think about that era. It was so different. KING: That is Binyamin Appelbaum. He writes about economics for The New York Times, and he's written a new book, called, \"The Economists' Hour\" that traces what he calls a revolution in the way we think about economists. APPELBAUM: This quiet but really important revolution that happens, really, beginning in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, where economists begin to gain tremendous influence over public policy in the United States. KING: In fact, that young economist who told his wife he had no future at the Fed, that was Paul Volcker. He became one of a small group of economists who made themselves indispensable to U. S. presidents. Volcker rose to become the chairman of the Federal Reserve in the Carter and Reagan years. So I asked Appelbaum, how did a bunch of economists go from nobodies to being important people? And he said it's pretty simple. In an era of real economic problems, they promised solutions. APPELBAUM: By the early 1970s, it's really becoming clear that something is wrong with the American economy. People worry about their own future, their children's future. And economists are enormously successful in asserting that they can fix the problem. And their answer is basically that government needs to reduce its role in the economy, that bureaucrats need to take their hands off the economy and allow markets to allocate resources. Government needs to trust in markets. KING: And this idea came from many economists. But there was one economist in particular - in your book, you write about him a lot - and that's Milton Friedman. Milton Friedman had this very, very simple idea that proved to be enormously popular. And along the way, Milton Friedman became, like, kind of a household name. APPELBAUM: He's a remarkable person. He is this elfin libertarian who commands any room that he's in, even though he's often the smallest person in the room. And he's enormously successful essentially in proselytizing this idea that the solution to almost every public policy problem is for government to get out of the way. And it has enormous appeal, I think, in part, because of its modesty. He's not saying Milton Friedman should be in charge of the economy. He's saying, neither I nor anyone else should be in charge. And for a generation that is confronting the failure of the economy, this has enormous appeal. KING: So at the heart of your thesis is not necessarily that Milton Friedman was correct. You talk about these really negative unintended consequences that come from this idea that the market is always right. In 2019, when we look back at the legacy of Milton Friedman and others like him, with their faith in the markets, where does that leave us now? APPELBAUM: Economists really emphasized that there was a tradeoff between efficiency, meaning getting the economy to grow as quickly as possible, and equality, meaning that everybody shared in the rewards of prosperity. And they argued that government needed to focus on efficiency, that the goal of public policy should be to make the economy grow as fast as possible, get as big as possible, but by ignoring inequality, by deciding, basically, that government should stop trying to equalize the distribution of prosperity or the opportunities to prosper. It really contributed significantly to the rise of massive inequality in our society. KING: You've been writing about economics for years. And I wonder, when you were researching this book, were there any moments where you said, that's not what I thought it was? APPELBAUM: I'll tell you what I did not appreciate when I started this process. I did not understand the extent to which economists in the '70s were responding to real problems, to a real breakdown in our system of governance and economic policy, the extent to which these free-market ideas really gained prominence and popularity because of a broad perception that what we were doing had failed. KING: That is the thing, though, that makes me want to spring to the defense of economists. I mean, I was unaware, or only aware in a very vague sense, that in the '70s this country hit inflation at, like, 11%, 12%, which is unthinkable now. Right? We haven't seen inflation like that in years. Our money has been stable in this country. There are so many other countries that don't have that luxury. It makes me think, well, don't these guys deserve a lot of credit for the fact that my dollar is going to be worth, in a year, about a dollar, as opposed to 70 cents? APPELBAUM: I think they do deserve a lot of credit. I think it's a classic example of a revolution that went too far. The gains are real. The benefits are real. Economists brought a lot of discipline to policymaking. In a lot of ways, they improved the quality of public policy. But by sort of embracing that idea to the exclusion of any other priorities, by saying, we're just going to focus on efficiency. By advocating for economists to take the wheel and excluding other points of view, we ended up in a really problematic place. KING: What about the opening of markets worldwide, the phenomenon of globalization, the massive shifts that took place with globalization? I mean, don't those play a role in inequality? Can you really lay this at the feet of a handful of guys who influenced a handful of presidents? APPELBAUM: I don't mean to assign sole responsibility to economists. . . KING: OK. (Laughter). APPELBAUM: . . . But I do think they played an important role. There obviously were forces at work beyond the control of any policymaker. You know, manufacturing has spread much more evenly across the face of the globe. Prosperity has spread much more evenly across the face of the globe. And that's been a really good thing for billions - with a B - of people, and none of that should be minimized. But I do think it is the case that economists in the United States and in other developed nations made that process much more painful for the average American, that the policies that they implemented or convinced policymakers to implement had the effect on the whole of concentrating the benefits of globalization in relatively few hands and of leaving many Americans to suffer the consequences. KING: Well, what do you think should happen now? I mean, economists are pretty firmly installed where they are. They do have the ears of presidents. What do you think should happen? APPELBAUM: I'm not advocating for getting rid of economists. . . KING: OK. APPELBAUM: . . . To be clear. KING: (Laughter). Again, they'll be thrilled to know. APPELBAUM: Absolutely. I think that our problem is inequality. And the solution is to make inequality an explicit focus of public policy, not just, is this good for society as a whole, which is a meaningless abstraction, but who actually will be the beneficiaries? And if the answer is, you know, that wealth concentrates at the top, we ought to reconsider those policies. KING: Binyamin Appelbaum, thanks so much. APPELBAUM: Thank you.

Well, let's find out what Darius Rafieyan says. He is with NPR's daily economics podcast The Indicator from Planet Money. Hey, Darius. DARIUS RAFIEYAN, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise. KELLY: So what exactly does this bill do? And why are lawmakers taking it up now? RAFIEYAN: So this bill is pretty remarkable. This bill would place a cap on rent increases of 5% per year, plus inflation, across the entire state - so not just one city here or there. KELLY: OK. So no discretion left to landlords. That's the most you can hike it - 5%. RAFIEYAN: Right. And it's aimed at preventing these large, sudden rent increases. And this comes as California is struggling with a statewide housing crisis. Lots of people have been moving there for job opportunities; housing construction hasn't kept up. That means that housing prices have really skyrocketed. Homelessness is way up. Everyone across the political spectrum agrees that something needs to be done about housing in California. KELLY: I'm remembering Oregon passed something similar this year, right? How many states have a rent control law in the books? RAFIEYAN: Yeah, rent control is relatively rare in the U. S. As you mentioned, in February, Oregon became the first state to have statewide rent control. Other than that, you have three states - Maryland, New York and New Jersey, plus the District of Columbia - where there are any cities with any kind of rent control at all. So in the vast majority of states, this is still just left up to the market. KELLY: And I mentioned a lot of economists are skeptical about rent control and whether it does, in fact, work. What does the research say? RAFIEYAN: Many economists say that rent control actually ignores the main problem, which is not enough houses being built, and that rent control can actually discourage building. So there's a study by Rebecca Diamond, an economist at Stanford. She looked at the case of San Francisco, which put in place rent control policies back in the '90s. And what she found was because rent controls make it less profitable for a landlord to lease a building, many landlords were deciding to get out of the rental market, entirely, you know, by converting to condos or just bulldozing a building. She found that it actually resulted in a 25% drop in the number of rental units in the city. So basically, it can help renters in the short run. But in the long run, it can have some pretty severe unintended consequences. KELLY: Yeah, it sounds like it can have the unintended consequence of the exact opposite effect that legislators were trying to bring around. I mean, are there other policies out there that economists think might be worth trying if the goal is to bring down housing costs? RAFIEYAN: So if you ask economists, they agree that if you want to solve a housing shortage, you need to build more housing. So earlier this year, there was a bill working its way through the state legislature in California that would've forced cities to do more high-density construction. That ultimately died in committee. The governor, Gavin Newsom, has made this a central policy. Using the combination of grants and the threat of lawsuits, he's tried to encourage cities to do more building. That's had mixed results. There are some economists who say rather than using rent controls, which distort the housing market, the government could do something like fund rent insurance, which would compensate tenants who see sudden rent increases. KELLY: So given all that research you just shared - that rent control maybe has the opposite effect than what was intended - why does this seem to be a growing thing with Oregon and California bringing it back? RAFIEYAN: It can have very positive effects for a very narrow group of people. So if you are the kind of person who's going to be staying in your apartment for years and years and years, rent control is undeniably a good thing. And so the benefits are very easy to see, very easy to understand. It's a very clear, simple story. Some of the costs are more diffuse, a little more abstract and more in the long-term. So for a politician trying to sell a policy, something like a complicated rent insurance scheme or high-density zoning can be a tough sell. But capping rents - that's an easy sell. KELLY: Thank you, Darius. RAFIEYAN: Thank you, Mary Louise. KELLY: Darius Rafieyan - he's a producer on NPR's short daily podcast about economic issues that affect our lives.

President Trump came to office as a fierce critic of U. S. trade policy, saying it's cost jobs for American workers, and he has upended many of the most important U. S. trade relationships. That has left the Democrats running for president searching for ways to distinguish themselves, as NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: In their rhetoric on trade, it can be hard to tell the difference between President Trump and the Democrats running to replace him. Here's Trump during the Republican Convention. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers or that diminishes our freedom and our independence. We will never, ever sign bad trade deals. America first again. America first. ZARROLI: And here's Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders on MSNBC last spring. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BERNIE SANDERS: We have got to establish trade policies which do not allow corporate America to simply shut down in this country and refuse to pay workers here a decent wage and move to countries around the world, where they're paying people pennies an hour. ZARROLI: Democrats have traditionally been the party of the working class, of labor unions. Much more than Republicans, they have been skeptics of global trade. But Trump has been able to outflank Democrats, says Dan Ikenson of the Cato Institute. DAN IKENSON: It's pretty interesting because it's like Donald Trump has co-opted democratic trade policy. ZARROLI: At one time, voters were more open to the promise of global trade, and Democratic presidents, such as Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, could position themselves as free traders. But years of watching jobs flee overseas has soured many voters in both parties on trade pacts, such as NAFTA, says Elaine Kamarck of the Brookings Institution. ELAINE KAMARCK: Even before Trump, there was the beginning of a sort of left-right consensus that we needed to do something about trade and particularly something about China. ZARROLI: Front-runner Joe Biden once supported trade pacts, but he's been forced to soft-pedal his positions. Lori Wallach is founder of Global Trade Watch and a big critic of trade pacts, such as NAFTA. As she sees it, Democrats are finally returning to their roots as the party of labor. LORI WALLACH: The Democrats that are running for president are largely reflecting where Democrats in Congress have been for decades and the Democratic base. ZARROLI: But Wallach says Democrats have tried to differentiate themselves from Trump by saying he hasn't delivered on trade. Despite a chaotic trade war, for example, there's still no trade agreement with China. Again, Elaine Kamarck of Brookings. KAMARCK: He's been on and off and around and up and down. And nobody knows where the negotiations stand. And he says things that aren't true. And so I think on trade, this will come down to a matter of the president's competence. ZARROLI: To Dan Ikenson of the pro-trade Cato Institute, the political dynamic is disappointing. None of the front-runners is making a vigorous case for the economic benefits of trade, he says. Trump has launched a populist attack on trade. IKENSON: And the response we're getting from many of the leading candidates for the Democratic nomination is to go to the left. What happened to the abandoned center? That seems, to me, to be a place where a lot of good things can happen. ZARROLI: But as the election approaches, it's unlikely any candidate will be defending trade too aggressively. To win in 2020, candidates will have to make their case in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, and those are parts of the country that have seen a huge loss of manufacturing jobs over the years.

And Stephanie and I were just looking at each other, falling in love with the place. And then they handed us the pamphlet with the cost, and it was over $350 a week. And we looked at each other, didn't say a word. And we both knew exactly what was going to happen. We literally drove from the day care center to my parents' house. That's his day care situation. NOEL KING, BYLINE: Yeah, that's a struggle that a lot of parents have. You being a public figure, what are some of the more unusual events that you've taken Omar to? ELORZA: I mean, I don't do it every day. I can't do it every day. But there's been a good range. So if I give a speech early in the morning, sometimes I bring him to that. But I've taken him to events such as political fundraisers (laughter). So as you go around, and you kind of shake everyone's hands, you know, I've done it a couple of times with him in my arms. He actually took his first steps here in my office. And had I not had him with me, I would have missed that moment. KING: Some cities have rules where you can bring your child into work as long as they are under a certain age. Is Providence, the city, doing anything about this? ELORZA: So we've adopted a number of pilot programs, and we're testing it out. So for example, I have an employee that she also has a new child, and we let her work from home on a given day each week. We've also led the way here in the state with extending paid family leave to our employees here in Providence. KING: Does it get under your skin when people criticize you for bringing Omar places? ELORZA: I actually haven't heard a single criticism of me. So for example, people have criticized that there's a double standard. And I think that's true. I think there is a double standard. And I think the conclusion there is not we should criticize the mayor. It's women shouldn't be criticized when they do it as well.

And so sometimes when our employees, they bring their young kids in, they know that they can come and take the toy basket. But I'll tell you an interesting story. Just last Friday, I had a group of community members come in. And there was a woman with a 1-year-old child who had child care set up so that she can attend the meeting with me. That fell through at the last minute. And she told me that since she had heard that I bring my child into work and that I'm welcoming of kids here in City Hall, she felt comfortable bringing her 1-year-old child to the meeting with me. KING: You know, I don't have kids myself. But I was talking to a colleague earlier who has a daughter who's a little over 2.

Ever since the trade war between the U. S. and China started last year, economists have been warning that it is going to hit Americans in the wallet - that we're going to end up paying higher prices for some products. So did that end up happening? Since August 2018, NPR's Alina Selyukh has been tracking prices at a single Walmart in the state of Georgia, and she has this story. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: Left or right? CHARLOTTE NORSWORTHY, BYLINE: Let's go right. SELYUKH: OK. This was about a year ago. Producer Charlotte Norsworthy and I walked every aisle of a Walmart in Liberty County, Ga. Now let's go find some lamps. NORSWORTHY: Let's do it. SELYUKH: Our goal was to track how the trade war with China might trickle down to shoppers at America's biggest retail store chain. NORSWORTHY: Shoe laces. SELYUKH: OK. NORSWORTHY: Leather. SELYUKH: How much? NORSWORTHY: Four dollars. SELYUKH: Manila folder, Sharpie marker. NORSWORTHY: Orange juice is right behind you. SELYUKH: Scott toilet paper. NORSWORTHY: That's going to be on aisle 23. SELYUKH: We begin with the first tariffs the White House imposed last year on imports from China and some from Mexico and Canada. We started tracking prices of about 80 items at this Walmart. I don't think I've ever spent this much time in a grocery store ever in my life. NORSWORTHY: No - wait. SELYUKH: Now it's a year later, and here's what we found. Some prices in our shopping cart climbed significantly, at least in part because of the tariffs. A set of two table lamps by Better Homes and Gardens now costs 10% more. Sylvania light bulbs, fresh garlic and a Stanley screwdriver are more expensive, too. We've also been tracking a girl's bicycle, chosen with the help of an expert. How old are you? UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Six. SELYUKH: Which of these bikes do you like the most? UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: That one. SELYUKH: This one? UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Mm-hmm. SELYUKH: That bike, made by Kent, is now 6% more expensive. The makers of all these items did not comment on our specific products, but some of them confirmed that tariffs have pushed them to raise prices, though overall - and this is a big takeaway - the impact of tariffs proved uneven. Many of the prices did not change; a few actually went down. For example, the two most expensive things we tracked - a Vizio TV and a Hamilton Beach microwave - they are made in China, but they got cheaper. That's because TVs and electronics get cheaper every year. Tariffs are only part of the story. Prices go up and down for lots of reasons - for example, costs of transportation and labor. But overall, when we looked at the prices inside our tariff-inspired shopping cart, we found that, on average, the change we saw was an increase of more than 3%. That's almost double the current rate of inflation. EMILY WANG: These things really are pretty complex, and it's very hard to forecast how the prices will change. SELYUKH: Emily Wang is an economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. WANG: Let's say the tariff is $1. It doesn't necessarily mean that if you are purchasing, let's say, a piece of clothing that was, like, $29, now you're going to have to pay 30. It's even possible that it remains $29 or even go below. SELYUKH: That's because makers and sellers don't like raising prices. They want to get shoppers into stores, not scare them away. And retailers, like Walmart, are powerful. They get the final say on the prices that you see. And they're also big. They can spread the new costs around the whole store or absorb them and even pressure the brands and manufacturers to bear more of the burden. Every company that imports anything from China is now making this calculation. Take, for example, makers of pet products, like a dog leash in our NPR basket. MIKE BOBER: They don't want to have to pass these costs along to pet owners. But unfortunately, it's becoming more and more necessary. SELYUKH: Mike Bober is the head of the Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council. The plastic, fabric and metal that go into making pets crates, bowls and collars have been hit by new tariffs. BOBER: What we're finding is that, really, throughout the entire lifecycle of pet care products, everyone is feeling the pinch on this. And ultimately, prices are going to have to continue to go up. SELYUKH: In fact, shoppers are only starting to feel tariffs. In the first few waves, the Trump administration specifically targeted industrial materials and parts rather than consumer products to avoid shocking Americans with price hikes. To the White House, the goal of tariffs is to make Chinese imports more expensive so that American companies move production and jobs back to the U. S. But few companies have actually been able to do that. Many stay put or switch to other foreign countries. JOEL PRAKKEN: And that's, of course, one of the problems with bilateral trade battles, is it's like whack-a-mole. You know? (Laughter). SELYUKH: Joel Prakken is the chief U. S. economist at IHS market. PRAKKEN: For example, China and Vietnam both fish in the same waters for the fish that we get from that part of the world, and so Vietnam trade with the U. S. is booming right now. SELYUKH: This kind of reshuffling has been happening across many products, including clothes, pencils, furniture. In some cases, like with shoes, the vast majority have historically come from China. Now more tariffs are kicking in - this month, next month and in December. By the end of the year, almost everything imported from China - from apple juice to toys to laptops - will all have a new tax. And our shopping cart might get pricier. Alina Selyukh, NPR News. NORSWORTHY: Peanut butter and jelly. SELYUKH: Wait. That's creamy. Do we want crunchy? Are we going to start that debate? NORSWORTHY: Are you a crunchy peanut butter-eater? SELYUKH: Yeah. NORSWORTHY: What? They're both 2. 08. KING: You can see all of the prices that Alina and her team tracked at npr. org/shoppingcart. (SOUNDBITE OF CFCF'S \"AQUASCAPE\") NOEL KING, HOST:  All right. Ever since the trade war between the U. S. and China started last year, economists have been warning that it is going to hit Americans in the wallet - that we're going to end up paying higher prices for some products. So did that end up happening? Since August 2018, NPR's Alina Selyukh has been tracking prices at a single Walmart in the state of Georgia, and she has this story. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: Left or right? CHARLOTTE NORSWORTHY, BYLINE: Let's go right. SELYUKH: OK. This was about a year ago. Producer Charlotte Norsworthy and I walked every aisle of a Walmart in Liberty County, Ga. Now let's go find some lamps. NORSWORTHY: Let's do it. SELYUKH: Our goal was to track how the trade war with China might trickle down to shoppers at America's biggest retail store chain. NORSWORTHY: Shoe laces. SELYUKH: OK. NORSWORTHY: Leather. SELYUKH: How much? NORSWORTHY: Four dollars. SELYUKH: Manila folder, Sharpie marker. NORSWORTHY: Orange juice is right behind you. SELYUKH: Scott toilet paper. NORSWORTHY: That's going to be on aisle 23. SELYUKH: We begin with the first tariffs the White House imposed last year on imports from China and some from Mexico and Canada. We started tracking prices of about 80 items at this Walmart. I don't think I've ever spent this much time in a grocery store ever in my life. NORSWORTHY: No - wait. SELYUKH: Now it's a year later, and here's what we found. Some prices in our shopping cart climbed significantly, at least in part because of the tariffs. A set of two table lamps by Better Homes and Gardens now costs 10% more. Sylvania light bulbs, fresh garlic and a Stanley screwdriver are more expensive, too. We've also been tracking a girl's bicycle, chosen with the help of an expert. How old are you? UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Six. SELYUKH: Which of these bikes do you like the most? UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: That one. SELYUKH: This one? UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Mm-hmm. SELYUKH: That bike, made by Kent, is now 6% more expensive. The makers of all these items did not comment on our specific products, but some of them confirmed that tariffs have pushed them to raise prices, though overall - and this is a big takeaway - the impact of tariffs proved uneven. Many of the prices did not change; a few actually went down. For example, the two most expensive things we tracked - a Vizio TV and a Hamilton Beach microwave - they are made in China, but they got cheaper. That's because TVs and electronics get cheaper every year. Tariffs are only part of the story. Prices go up and down for lots of reasons - for example, costs of transportation and labor. But overall, when we looked at the prices inside our tariff-inspired shopping cart, we found that, on average, the change we saw was an increase of more than 3%. That's almost double the current rate of inflation. EMILY WANG: These things really are pretty complex, and it's very hard to forecast how the prices will change. SELYUKH: Emily Wang is an economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. WANG: Let's say the tariff is $1. It doesn't necessarily mean that if you are purchasing, let's say, a piece of clothing that was, like, $29, now you're going to have to pay 30.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell described the move as a kind of insurance policy to protect the economy from rising trade tensions and other global threats. The rate cut was widely anticipated, and the stock market took it in stride, but President Trump blasted the Fed for not acting more aggressively. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The U. S. economy still has a lot going for it. Consumers have been spending freely, and unemployment remains near a 50-year low. Still, there are some ominous signs of a slowdown. So Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues decided to cut interest rates today by a quarter of a percent to encourage more borrowing, lending and spending. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEROME POWELL: We took this step to help keep the U. S. economy strong in the face of some notable developments and to provide insurance against ongoing risks. HORSLEY: Chief among those risks are slowing growth in other countries, as well as the ongoing trade war, both of which have reduced exports and caused American business owners to think twice about spending money. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)POWELL: Our business contacts around the country have been telling us that uncertainty about trade policy has discouraged them from investing in their businesses. HORSLEY: The architect of that unnerving trade policy is President Trump, and he's been quick to blame the Federal Reserve for the economic slowdown. Trump, who wanted a more aggressive rate cut today, tweeted angrily after the Fed's announcement that Powell and his colleagues had failed again. No guts, the president wrote, no vision. And he called Powell a terrible communicator. The stock market took a kinder view. Stocks fell when the rate cut was first announced but rebounded during the Fed chairman's news conference. Powell says he thinks the economic slowdown can be navigated with modest adjustments to interest rates, but he was quick to add the central bank is ready to do more if necessary. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)POWELL: If, in fact, the economy weakens more, then we're prepared to be aggressive. HORSLEY: This was the second time in seven weeks the Fed has cut interest rates, but not everyone on the rate-setting committee agreed with the move. Two members of the committee voted to leave rates unchanged while a third voted to cut rates by half a percent. Powell says he and his colleagues will continue to monitor economic signals, which he's described in the past as murky. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)POWELL: Sometimes the path ahead is clear, and sometimes less so. So we're going to be looking carefully, meeting by meeting, as we go. And as I said, we will act as appropriate to sustain expansion. HORSLEY: Still, further cuts in already low interest rates may not be the best medicine for a slowing economy. Business owners, especially in the manufacturing sector, have been dialing back investments not because it's expensive to borrow money but because they're not sure they can sell their products. Matthew Luzzetti of Deutsche Bank says today's move by the Fed won't fix that. MATTHEW LUZZETTI: It'll help on the margin to keep financial conditions easy, keep mortgage rates low, help to support equities and keep pressure off the dollar a little bit. But the key driver for us is trade uncertainty. And cuts in the Fed funds rate is not going to be able to fully offset that. HORSLEY: Powell agreed there are limits to how much rate cuts can help. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)POWELL: It isn't precisely the right tool for every single possible negative thing that can happen to the economy, but, nonetheless, it broadly works. And, you know, we're going to use the tool we have. HORSLEY: Some forecasters are expecting more rate cuts from the Fed in the coming months.

SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The Fed will announce its decision on interest rates this afternoon. And economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics says financial markets will be both watching and listening - watching for the anticipated quarter-point rate cut and also listening for what Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has to say about it. KATHY BOSTJANCIC: Powell just has to be very clear that we are going to do whatever it takes to sustain the expansion. HORSLEY: Powell's been trying to send that message. He told an audience in Switzerland this month the Fed is not predicting a recession. But he acknowledged the economy could stall if the ongoing tariff war rattles enough businesspeople to the point where they stop spending. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEROME POWELL: Uncertainty around trade policy is causing some companies to hold back now on investment. And so our obligation is to use our tools to support the economy. And that's what we'll continue to do. HORSLEY: Powell and his colleagues also pointed to trade uncertainty back in July, when they cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade. The stock market wasn't satisfied, in part because Powell seemed to suggest at the time that might be the last rate cut for a while. Bostjancic says she's hoping for not only an additional rate cut today, but a signal about more cuts in the future. BOSTJANCIC: It will be clear it's not one and done. But he has to be careful that it's not two and done. He needs to leave the door open clearly to future rate cuts. HORSLEY: Bostjancic is actually predicting two more rate cuts in October and December. But even with that extra push from the Fed, she thinks economic growth will slow next year to just 1. 6%. The trade war isn't the only economic speed bump. You've also got slowing growth in other countries, the dwindling effects of the 2017 tax cut and, after the weekend attack in Saudi Arabia, uncertainty about oil prices. Nervous about a slowing economy, President Trump has been browbeating the Fed to cut interest rates more aggressively to zero or even lower. Others, including former New York Fed president Bill Dudley, have argued the central bank should stand pat and let Trump feel the political fallout from the trade war he started. Powell has repeatedly insisted the Fed will not be swayed by political pressure from either side. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)POWELL: Political factors play absolutely no role in our process. And my colleagues and I would not tolerate any attempt to include them. HORSLEY: The stock market is counting on a rate cut today and would likely suffer a sell-off if Powell and his colleagues don't deliver. But economist Matthew Luzzetti of Deutsche Bank says it's not clear lower interest rates will do much to help the nation's struggling factories. MATTHEW LUZZETTI: We see the driving force of the slowdown, certainly in manufacturing, as trade uncertainty. And cutting the Fed funds rate is not going to be able to fully alleviate that uncertainty. HORSLEY: Factories and others have cut back on investment, not because it's too expensive to borrow money, but because they're not sure they can sell their products. In that environment, Luzzetti says, cutting interest rates can only do so much. What would help is an end to the trade war. And in recent days, there have been signs of a possible thaw in U. S. -China trade relations. Still, Bostjancic says she's not convinced a trade truce is imminent. BOSTJANCIC: Right now, that's all talk. You know, we have seen that before. We've seen encouraging talk. And then, both the markets and business leaders - and consumers - everyone ends up being disappointed because not only is there no trade truce, it actually ends up being ratcheted higher.

The Labor Department today expanded the pool of workers eligible for overtime pay by about a million people. It's taken years to reach this point, and, NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports, many say the new rules still don't go far enough. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Chip Ahlgren took over the general manager's role at a Seattle Jiffy Lube last year. He went from making $16 an hour to an annual salary of $52,000 - something that seemed, at least at the time, like a step up. But he says his new store was chronically understaffed. Whatever work others couldn't finish fell to Ahlgren. CHIP AHLGREN: Yeah, having to run my shop no matter what - got to keep the doors open. NOGUCHI: He says his work week is usually 65 hours a week but sometimes runs over a hundred hours. But as a salaried manager, under law, he isn't entitled to overtime pay. Ahlgren says given how much he works, he'd earn more if he were paid the hourly minimum wage. AHLGREN: There's nothing protecting me if I have to work 100 hours a week from that happening, and I don't get any more money. NOGUCHI: Current federal law says most workers making about $24,000 a year are entitled to overtime pay. In other words, in order to be considered salaried, most workers need to make at least that. But that minimum salary threshold was set in 2004. Nowadays, that $24,000 salary falls below the poverty line for a family of four, and just about everyone agrees that needs updating. The Obama administration sought to expand the number of workers eligible for overtime pay by raising the salary threshold. It proposed more than doubling it to about $47,000. A Texas judge struck that down. Instead, the Trump Administration issued a new rule, setting the threshold at just over $35,000. As a result, 1. 3 million more workers will be eligible to earn overtime, but Heidi Shierholz argues the new rules fall short. HEIDI SHIERHOLZ: It's a missed opportunity in the sense that millions more could have been helped. NOGUCHI: Shierholz was chief economist at the Labor Department under Obama. She argues the new minimum salary cutoff won't be automatically updated with inflation, meaning it could be decades before it's reset again. SHIERHOLZ: So it'll be set at $35,000, and that's it. NOGUCHI: But employers are pleased with the lower threshold. Nancy Hammer is vice president of regulatory affairs for the Society for Human Resource Management. NANCY HAMMER: Overall, our feeling is that this is a more workable approach. NOGUCHI: And, she notes, many employers pay overtime, even if not required by law. Also, a growing number of states have or are looking to set their overtime rules above the new federal requirements. Paul Sonne is state policy director at the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group. PAUL SONNE: Workers, community groups and elected officials are all mobilizing around it as a paycheck fairness issue. If you're going to put in those long hours away from your community and your family, you should at least be paid for it. NOGUCHI: New York and California have already adopted new overtime rules that set their salary thresholds at around $50,000. A much longer list of states are considering similar proposals, including Colorado, Washington and Pennsylvania. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington.

He went from making $16 an hour to an annual salary of $52,000 - something that seemed, at least at the time, like a step up. But he says his new store was chronically understaffed. Whatever work others couldn't finish fell to Ahlgren. CHIP AHLGREN: Yeah, having to run my shop no matter what - got to keep the doors open. NOGUCHI: He says his work week is usually 65 hours a week but sometimes runs over a hundred hours. But as a salaried manager, under law, he isn't entitled to overtime pay. Ahlgren says given how much he works, he'd earn more if he were paid the hourly minimum wage. AHLGREN: There's nothing protecting me if I have to work 100 hours a week from that happening, and I don't get any more money. NOGUCHI: Current federal law says most workers making about $24,000 a year are entitled to overtime pay. In other words, in order to be considered salaried, most workers need to make at least that. But that minimum salary threshold was set in 2004. Nowadays, that $24,000 salary falls below the poverty line for a family of four, and just about everyone agrees that needs updating. The Obama administration sought to expand the number of workers eligible for overtime pay by raising the salary threshold. It proposed more than doubling it to about $47,000. A Texas judge struck that down. Instead, the Trump Administration issued a new rule, setting the threshold at just over $35,000. As a result, 1. 3 million more workers will be eligible to earn overtime, but Heidi Shierholz argues the new rules fall short. HEIDI SHIERHOLZ: It's a missed opportunity in the sense that millions more could have been helped. NOGUCHI: Shierholz was chief economist at the Labor Department under Obama. She argues the new minimum salary cutoff won't be automatically updated with inflation, meaning it could be decades before it's reset again. SHIERHOLZ: So it'll be set at $35,000, and that's it. NOGUCHI: But employers are pleased with the lower threshold. Nancy Hammer is vice president of regulatory affairs for the Society for Human Resource Management. NANCY HAMMER: Overall, our feeling is that this is a more workable approach. NOGUCHI: And, she notes, many employers pay overtime, even if not required by law. Also, a growing number of states have or are looking to set their overtime rules above the new federal requirements. Paul Sonne is state policy director at the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group. PAUL SONNE: Workers, community groups and elected officials are all mobilizing around it as a paycheck fairness issue. If you're going to put in those long hours away from your community and your family, you should at least be paid for it. NOGUCHI: New York and California have already adopted new overtime rules that set their salary thresholds at around $50,000. A much longer list of states are considering similar proposals, including Colorado, Washington and Pennsylvania.

Some unscrupulous business people are looking for a way around that; not by changing the products, just by changing the labels. This is an old scam that may be getting more prevalent as the trade war drags on. NPR's Scott Horsley reports on a hunt for tariff scofflaws that took the U. S. Customs cops all the way to a dusty factory in the Philippines. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: A few weeks ago, I spoke with a guy named Roberto Durazo, who helps companies setting up factories in Mexico. Lately, he told me he's been getting a lot of calls from Chinese business people eager to avoid the mounting tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. ROBERTO DURAZO: So they tell us, like, hey, I build a TV, and I want that TV to be made in Mexico so I cannot pay the duties. HORSLEY: Durazo told me if a company really wants to move their factory to Mexico, he's happy to help. But some don't want to go that far. They want to keep making TVs and other products in China but pretend they're made in Mexico just to avoid paying the tariffs. DURAZO: They just wanted to put it in the box, add labels and claim that it's made in Mexico. And we tell them that it doesn't work like that. HORSLEY: But sometimes, it does work like that because not everyone's as honest as Durazo is. Customs officials say there's a cottage industry devoted to avoiding a costly made-in-China label by falsely claiming products are manufactured elsewhere. Sometimes, the goods are actually shipped to that third country on their way to the United States. Attorney Benjamin Bucy says he's starting to see more of these cases as tariffs on Chinese imports mount. Bucy co-authored a law review article calling trade fraud the wild new frontier of white-collar crime. Often, he says, it's up to competitors to blow the whistle. BENJAMIN BUCY: If they're paying a 25% tariff and being undercut by someone where they know the export price and the tariff price and something isn't matching up, that's often the kind of knowledge that a competitor uses to build a case. HORSLEY: Dixon Ticonderoga built a case like that. The pencil maker suspected one of its competitors, Royal Brush Manufacturing, was buying cheap pencils from China but claiming the pencils were made in the Philippines to avoid paying an anti-dumping tariff that would have more than doubled the wholesale cost. Dixon filed a complaint with Customs and Border Protection. Investigators scoured records and even paid an unannounced visit to the purported factory in the Philippines. My NPR colleague reads from a public record of what their inspector found. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Reading) The manufacturing equipment that Royal Brush had represented as being in use at the Subic Bay facility appeared to have been covered in dust and cobwebs, indicating they had not been used for some time. HORSLEY: The inspector saw no evidence of manufacturing, but there were boxes and boxes of finished pencils made in China. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Reading) The attache witnessed staff repacking what appeared to be Chinese-origin products into boxes labeled made in the Philippines. HORSLEY: Bucy, the attorney, says it doesn't exactly take Sherlock Holmes to crack the case when the people doing the relabeling make little effort to cover their tracks. BUCY: They're not expecting to be investigated at all. HORSLEY: Customs officials say sometimes, they find a vacant lot where a factory is supposed to be. Royal Brush was ordered to pay back the avoided tariffs, and it stopped doing business with its Philippine supplier. The company's lawyer, Ron Oleynik, says Royal Brush is appealing the Customs ruling. RONALD OLEYNIK: This has been a costly, time-consuming, really psychologically painful process. And they're struggling to clear their name. HORSLEY: Oleynik concedes, though, his client may have been duped along with everyone else about the origin of those pencils. It's hard to know for certain when the factory is an ocean away. OLEYNIK: The Trump administration, I keep saying, doesn't have a trade war. It's, in some ways, got a war on trade. HORSLEY: With tariffs now hitting more than $360 billion worth of Chinese imports, Customs officials say it's only natural some production really does move to other countries. But if a company is buying all of its products from China on Monday and on Tuesday says they're all coming from Vietnam, for example, that can arouse suspicion, especially if a new tariff took effect against China overnight. Policing tariff fraud in far-flung countries is not easy or cheap. Even when Customs cops succeed in shutting down one fraudulent factory, another often pops up to take its place. University of North Carolina economist Patrick Conway likens tariff enforcement to a game of whack-a-mole. PATRICK CONWAY: There are no strong consequences, at least in their home country. So it is difficult to have a long-term impact even if you find evidence of an almost open-and-shut case. HORSLEY: And the higher Trump builds his tariff wall, the more incentive there is for unscrupulous business people to tunnel under. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)XI JINPING: (Foreign language spoken). CHANG: People are watching on their phones because most couldn't get up close to see the procession of tanks and soldiers. It was a show of military might on the same day as violent pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. Here, though, less than a mile away from Tiananmen Square, the atmosphere is joyous. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Foreign language spoken). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Foreign language spoken). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Foreign language spoken). UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Singing in foreign language). CHANG: We've spent the last week listening to people reflect on the promises the Chinese Communist Party made decades ago and whether it's lived up to those promises. First stop, a worksite on the outskirts of Beijing. It's a temple first built more than a thousand years ago called Hongluo Si. (SOUNDBITE OF GONG)CHANG: As you walk the grounds, you'll notice a group of bricklayers restoring one of the temple's walls. Cao Shuhao is 53. He arrived in Beijing from a rural town in Hebei province 30 years ago. He's part of a wave of hundreds of millions of migrant workers who have gushed into China's cities from the countryside. CAO SHUHAO: (Through interpreter) What I did wasn't unusual. Most people in my generation traveled to Beijing or somewhere else to work and feed their families. CHANG: When Cao was growing up, his parents couldn't even afford rice. Today he has a steady paycheck, enough money to send home to his family in Hebei. And migration to the cities has lifted hundreds of millions like Cao out of poverty. But at the same time, inequality has sharpened in China. CAO: (Foreign language spoken). CHANG: Oh, this is your bedroom? Cao takes me inside a tiny makeshift room just off the construction site. It has corrugated metal walls, a dirt floor and some bunk beds. Forty years ago, economic inequality was really low in China because most of the country was equally poor. Today China has more billionaires than anywhere except the U. S. When you look at the amount of wealth that China has amassed over the past decades, do you feel that you have gained from that wealth? CAO: (Through interpreter) Yes, of course I've gained. I've gained a lot. I feel that China has developed very quickly over these last years, and now China's national power is very strong. CHANG: One of the goals of the Chinese Communist Party was to create an equal society. Do you feel you have an equal chance to get ahead just as everyone else has? CAO: (Through interpreter) How should I say this? There are opportunities, but it all depends on whether you as an individual have seized those opportunities. CHANG: But no amount of individual initiative can eradicate certain inequities. LI MING-GUO: (Through interpreter) Twenty years ago, when we first came here, people looked at us as if we were beggars. CHANG: Li Ming-guo (ph) also came to Beijing from Hebei. He's 52 and has risen to team leader here. But he says a deep inequality persists. You see, there's a system here. It's called hukou, and it determines your access to all kinds of public benefits, like education, based entirely on where you were born. So most migrant workers in one of China's biggest, shiniest cities can't even send their kids to the good public schools here. LI: (Through interpreter) We're still not the same as real Beijingers. CHANG: Still, both Cao and Li believe they're living dramatically different lives than the ones they would have had in Hebei - even though they are working seven days a week, 10 hours a day. LI: (Through interpreter) If I compare my life to my parents' life, there's a huge difference. My quality of life now is much better than theirs. I'd say it's hundreds or even thousands of times better. CHANG: What do you want for your children? How do you want their future to be different from your own life now? LI: (Through interpreter) I hope they won't have just one option for work because of the pressures of life. I hope they can actually choose what they want to do in life. GRACE JIN: Right now I'm an architect. DELICIA KUANG: Film producer. KEVIN LEE: Consulting firm. WENDY WANG: Educational company. CHANG: We're now in a trendy neighborhood near the financial district of Beijing meeting with four young professionals at Meow Coffee. How do you get a cat to meow? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: (Imitating meow). (SOUNDBITE OF CATS MEOWING)CHANG: We are inside a cat cafe. It's close to where Grace Jin lives. She's 28, an architect - a profession she chose because it combined engineering with the painting classes she took as a child. Jin says this was a choice her mom never had. JIN: She wanted to learn dance, and she wanted to learn the piano. But these lessons are very expensive, and they cannot afford it. So when I was young, she used to think, what I cannot get, I can give it to my daughter. So I think I'm very grateful and thankful for the economic progress in China. CHANG: That economic progress accelerated when China's economy opened up in the late '70s. Party leaders said it would be OK for some people to achieve wealth before others, and now that wealth has sent many of the next generation to prestigious American universities, like Grace Jin and the three others with us - Wendy Wang (ph), Kevin Lee (ph) and Delicia Kuang. They all got graduate degrees from Columbia University. They represent what upward mobility looks like in China today for those who've had access to higher education. And access to education in America has meant access to new ideas. JIN: I don't care who is the leader in China. CHANG: Do you really not care, or you just know you can't choose anyway? JIN: Maybe both. But just in China, maybe we know the leader can make wise choice. CHANG: You have trust in the government here in China to make the correct wise decisions. . . JIN: Yeah. CHANG: . . . To ensure stability. . . JIN: Yeah. CHANG: . . . In a way that you saw was missing in the U. S. ? JIN: Yeah (laughter). Every fourth year, there would change the leader. It makes me feel unstable. I think the political theater in the U. S. is more like Frank Gehry, the form of the architecture. You don't know which choice they will make in next stage or next step. But in China, it's like classical building. It forms a logic that you would suspect they will make the wise choice. CHANG: I love these distinctions you are making by drawing on architectural metaphors. When you look back on the time you had in the U. S. , where there was a lot of room to access information, there was the freedom to criticize the government - would you want to see that kind of society develop in China one day? (SILENCE)CHANG: OK. In the U. S. , we talk a lot about freedoms. You know, we talk about individual rights, individual liberties. It's what our government was formed to protect. Can you tell me what you think the Chinese government is set up to protect? WANG: Yeah. I think it's definitely like prosperity and also stability because I think we Chinese like harmony. That is a very, very core value. Like, Chinese people really appreciate, like, stabilities so that we can, you know, do business. We can, like, pursue academics - being a very stable society. CHANG: That was Wendy Wang, 29 years old. And on this anniversary, President Xi Jinping is talking about those same ideas.

People age 65 and up are the fastest growing group of workers in the country. About a quarter of them are still in the workforce. But not all of them are working just because they want to, and many retirees were forced to leave work before they were ready. NPR's Ina Jaffe covers aging, and all this week she's bringing us a series of stories about how older Americans are navigating the new realities of work and retirement. Hi, Ina. INA JAFFE, BYLINE: Good morning. KING: OK, so you sent out a nationwide survey asking older adults what factors played into them either continuing to work or retiring. What did you find? JAFFE: Well, it wasn't a scientific survey - I should say that - but the results were still interesting. Nearly 700 people responded, and about two-thirds said they were still working at least part time. Now, obviously, that's a lot higher than national statistics. But most said it was both because they wanted to and because they needed the money. KING: What are the bigger trends we're looking at? JAFFE: Well, finances certainly do impact the way people actually live their lives. The pensions that were around when baby boomers were entering the workforce hardly exist anymore. Those are called defined benefit pensions, where you get a monthly stipend based on your salary and years on the job, and you get that for life. KING: We do not have anything like that at NPR. My mom is actually on a pension, and sometimes I give her the side eye - just like, oh, that stability must be great. (LAUGHTER)JAFFE: Yeah, we don't have anything like that, and most people - outside of people who have government jobs - most people don't have that, either. In the private sector, the most common retirement plan is a 401(k), and that's for contributions from employers and employees who are invested in the stock market. And it's the individual worker, though, that handles their investment, whether they want to or not. KING: So people are living longer these days, and I imagine, while you've been reporting, you've actually met a lot of people whose lives are defined by the kind of retirement plan that they have. JAFFE: I did, and we're going to meet some of them today. First are the Abrams, Andy and Ella, and they live in Bakersfield, Calif. And their hallway is lined with photos of their travels. ANDY ABRAMS: You know the - \"Get Your Kicks On Route 66? \" We went through every town on the song. ELLA ABRAMS: (Laughter) Yeah. Started in Chicago, ended in Santa Monica. A ABRAMS: And then we've also been to Alaska, Hawaii. E ABRAMS: This is our New England trip. JAFFE: They can afford this because they both have traditional defined benefit pensions. Ella is 72 and taught high school math for nearly four decades. Andy is 67 and sold electrical equipment. He was one of the last at his company to have a defined benefit pension instead of a 401(k). He retired a couple of years ago. A ABRAMS: When I got to 65, I think it's now time I'd qualify for Medicare, and I'd really like to go on vacation for more than two weeks at a time. JAFFE: Andy and Ella Abrams met and married in midlife. They don't have children. They do help out Andy's mother, but mainly they just have to take care of themselves and their two dogs, Huntley and Brinkley. Still, they are careful with their money. Ella Abrams says that they put some away every month. E ABRAMS: We started a bank account that we called the can't-see-it account. It's money you have, but if you see it, you know you'll spend it. So don't look. JAFFE: But Andy says they're not just careful; they also know they're lucky. A ABRAMS: You can't save enough for retirement if you're making two minimum wages and have kids. Forget about it. JAFFE: The Abrams' traditional pensions will last as long as they do, so they don't have to worry about outliving their money. But boomers with 401(k)-type plans, they do have to worry, says Teresa Ghilarducci, professor of economics at The New School in New York. That's because for 401(k)s rise and fall with the stock market. TERESA GHILARDUCCI: The problem is, is that the first boomers reached retirement age about the same time that we had a financial crash, the worst one since the Great Depression. And the fragility of that do-it-yourself system really exposed itself. JAFFE: And this is why a Maryland woman named Janet Sims-Wood is still working at the age of 74. She's been a part-time reference librarian at Prince George's Community College for nearly 20 years. JANET SIMS-WOOD: I'm glad to have a job because a lot of folks that retired fully wanted to come back to work. But jobs basically are for the younger market, so it's hard for an older person to get back into working, no matter what field you're in. JAFFE: Before Sims-Wood took this job, she'd worked 31 years in the research library at Howard University. That's where her retirement account is from, and it's taken hits in two recessions - one in the 1990s and again in 2008. Altogether, she lost about $100,000, and her house was underwater. SIMS-WOOD: It was scary. JAFFE: So she got out of the stock market a few years ago, opting to put her money in more conservative savings. SIMS-WOOD: It doesn't grow as fast, but I don't want to take any more hits like that ever again. JAFFE: Sims-Wood had big plans for retirement. She wanted to pursue her lifelong passion for African American history with an oral history project, maybe write a couple of books. But retirement never came. SIMS-WOOD: I've been so tired. And I said, you know, I don't want to start something and then not be able to finish it. JAFFE: So now she's focused on helping the next generation of scholars to complete the work that she dreamed of doing herself. KING: Man, Ina, that is a really heartbreaking story. Does Janet Sims-Woods think that she'll ever be able to retire? JAFFE: Yeah, she says she will. She has a car loan she wants to pay off first. KING: OK. JAFFE: And she thinks it will take a couple more years. KING: From what you found, are most baby boomers in that position? Are they that strapped? JAFFE: Well, you know, the statistics aren't encouraging. The median retirement savings for baby boomers is about $150,000. That's to fund a retirement that could last 30 years. And we shouldn't forget that about half of private sector workers don't have access to any retirement plan at their jobs. KING: Yeah, what happens to those people? JAFFE: Well, theoretically, people can save on their own. But here's a statistic that shows how hard that is - about a quarter of retired Americans live mainly on Social Security. KING: Ina Jaffe, thanks so much for your reporting. JAFFE: Thank you. KING: Ina's series on the new realities of work and retirement continues tomorrow night and all this week on NPR.

New Communities' land trust was created as a safe haven for black farmers during the civil rights movement. And today, it's helping rural black landowners profit from farming. NPR's Debbie Elliott has the story. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Just outside Albany, New Communities co-founder Shirley Sherrod stands on a dock overlooking a tranquil pond, moss-draped cypress trees reflecting on the water. SHIRLEY SHERROD: They're resilient. Whether you're in a drought or whether you in a flood, they last. And that's the way we feel we are - we will last. ELLIOTT: They're part of a 1,600-acre plantation once owned by one of Georgia's largest slave holders. SHERROD: It went from a bad beginning, which was slavery, to descendants of slaves. ELLIOTT: Sherrod's name might be familiar. She was Georgia state director for the USDA in the Obama administration but resigned in controversy when Breitbart News edited one of her speeches to misconstrue her remarks as racist. Out on the farm, Sherrod drives to a grove of satsumas, a type of mandarin. SHERROD: The trees are full of oranges. They're green right now. ELLIOTT: You don't find many African American farmers growing satsumas in southwest Georgia, Sherrod says. The land trust is trying to show that it is a profitable crop and find other ways to add value to local farms. On the other side of the farm, workers are vacuuming up the early pecan harvest. SHERROD: So what machines do you have out here now? ELLIOTT: The property includes cottages and a fully restored antebellum home used for retreats. SHERROD: We look at this as a place where we can also try to heal. ELLIOTT: The plantation is the modern iteration of a cooperative farm the New Communities' land trust first established in the 1960s, when Shirley Sherrod and her husband, Charles, were organizing for the civil rights movement. SHERROD: We would encounter people who were being asked to move off the land owned by white farmers if they participated in the movement or tried to exercise their rights in any way. ELLIOTT: So a group of activists went to Israel to study a kibbutz as a model for providing jobs and homes for displaced families. The idea was shared stewardship of the land. The nonprofit trust borrowed money to purchase a nearly 6,000-acre tract where they grow peanuts, corn, soybeans and vegetable crops. They also raised pigs and built a smokehouse to sell cured meats from a roadside stand to make money. About 10 families had long-term renewable leases for houses on the land, and dozens of others worked there. BUMMI ANDERSON: It really gave me a sense of I can do anything. ELLIOTT: Bummi Anderson and her twin sister, Femi, now 47, grew up as part of New Communities. Their parents ran the onsite print shop. Femi Anderson says they learned to be self-reliant using the farm and associated businesses to sustain one another. FEMI ANDERSON: You had people who farmed the land. You had people who did, you know, administrative stuff, people who did different things. And I think that's what made it more of a community. ELLIOTT: The sisters remain involved in the land trust. They say having a stake in the land stuck with them. Bummi Anderson. B ANDERSON: You know, you're talking about land for African Americans - for anybody. Land is power. F ANDERSON: Yeah. B ANDERSON: Land is equity. Land is. . . F ANDERSON: It's wealth. B ANDERSON: . . . It's wealth. ELLIOTT: In rural Doles, Ga. , Erma Young-Wilburn shows me a century-old wooden farmhouse that's starting to fall in. ERMA YOUNG-WILBURN: This is the Battle house. This is the - originally the Battle farm. ELLIOTT: The house once belonged to J. N. Battle (ph), a former slave known for amassing a large amount of land after the Civil War. YOUNG-WILBURN: And this is the last 70 acres of it. And we are holding on because we want it to continue to be the legacy of a black-owned land. ELLIOTT: In 1910, black farmers owned more than 15 million acres of land. In 2017, that number was down to 4 million according to the agriculture census. The Lawtons (ph) are produce farmers. They get technical assistance from the New Communities' land trust to improve their irrigation and build a cold storage facility. She was part of the original farm collective 50 years ago. LAWTON: It was empowering. It was unifying. ELLIOTT: A registered nurse by profession, Lawton says there's an independence in farming. And that's something she thinks New Communities can pass down to new generations. LAWTON: Knowing that, as black people, we - the way we survived coming out of slavery was our attachment to the land and knowing how to make that land work for us and produce and protect us, you know, from starvation and stuff. ELLIOTT: New Communities' land trust was almost a failed experiment. They were hit by drought but could not get an emergency loan from the Farmers Home Administration until it was too late to avoid foreclosure. They lost the farm in 1985. But the story didn't end there because decades later, the trust won a $12 million settlement in the federal government's deal to compensate black farmers for discrimination by the U. S. Department of Agriculture. New Communities used the money to buy the plantation it operates today. Back at the farm, Decton Hylton tends to the honeybees. He lights some pine straw in a smoker to keep them calm. DECTON HYLTON: This is a new comb that they have just built. And they're going to be storing honey inside of these cells. ELLIOTT: Hilton is an agronomist and serves as a technical advisor to New Communities. He's encouraging farmers in southwest Georgia to take up beekeeping and look for other ways to increase the moneymaking potential of their property. He's also trying to stem land loss by encouraging younger generations to keep their family farms. HYLTON: Because it's been - they have been learning from a long time that agriculture is in relation to slavery. And I'm showing them, no, we were doing farming long before slavery. ELLIOTT: Hylton says New Communities' land trust can play a part in making farming an economic engine for rural development. Debbie Elliott, NPR News, Albany, Ga.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than a thousand points in two days earlier this week, but today the market gained some of that back. In fact, the Dow surged more than 370 points after the Labor Department reported the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years. So the job market keeps chugging along despite signs that the overall economy is slowing. NPR's Scott Horsley is here to tease it out for us. Welcome back to the studio. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Audie. CORNISH: We've been talking about low unemployment for a long time, and today we learned it's even lower. So help us understand what's happening. HORSLEY: Audie, let me take you back to December 1969. That's how far back you'd have to go to find an unemployment rate as low as we've got right now. CORNISH: Oh, we're really going back. HORSLEY: Three and a half percent. That's right. Diana Ross and The Supremes were topping the charts. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SOMEDAY WE'LL BE TOGETHER\")DIANA ROSS AND THE SUPREMES: (Singing) Someday we'll be together. HORSLEY: Today's report was supremely good when it comes to the unemployment rate. But the jobs picture, Audie, that was a little bit less rosy. CORNISH: OK, so why? And what are we seeing on the jobs front? HORSLEY: Employers added 136,000 jobs in September. That's certainly not bad after nearly nine years of steady job growth. We also learned that job gains in July and August were a little bit stronger than initially reported. But Chief Economist Constance Hunter, who's with the big accounting firm KPMG, says even when you add in those extra jobs, we're still seeing a slower pace of hiring now than we were at this time last year. CONSTANCE HUNTER: A large number of people are employed, which is in part a function of the length of the expansion that we've had. But under the surface lurk some concerns. HORSLEY: Those concerns include not only slower job growth, but we also saw a bit of a slowdown in wage growth last month. Average wages rose just 2. 9% in September. And if you combine slower job growth with smaller pay raises, you could eventually see a slowdown in consumer spending. That would be worrisome because right now it's the U. S. consumer who's been the strongest pillar propping up the economy at a time when business investment and global demand has been waning. CORNISH: Now, we mentioned the big stock selloff earlier this week. What's triggered that? And don't set it to \"Old Town Road. \" We're here now. (LAUGHTER)HORSLEY: We got a report on Tuesday that showed manufacturing activity had shrunk for the second month in a row. Factories are definitely feeling the fallout of the president's trade war as well as slumping demand in other countries. We saw another 2,000 manufacturing jobs disappear last month. We're also seeing some signs of a slowdown in the services side of the economy which employs a lot more people, everybody from stockbrokers to nurses to truck drivers. Services are not contracting like factories are, but they are growing more slowly, and you can see that in the jobs numbers as well. CORNISH: What's behind the rebound in stocks then? HORSLEY: Some investors may be looking at this jobs report and breathing a sigh of relief that we're not slipping into a recession. Others could be betting that the Federal Reserve will look at this jobs report, see some weakness and decide it's time for another cut in interest rates. Either way, Wall Street wins. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell was speaking here in Washington earlier today. And while he didn't tip his hand on interest rates, he did say that he and his colleagues are committed to keeping this economic expansion alive as long as they can. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEROME POWELL: People from low and moderate income communities tell us that this long recovery - now into its 11th year - is benefiting them and their neighbors to a degree that has not been felt for many years. And people who have struggled to stay in the workforce in the past are getting new opportunities. HORSLEY: Strong job growth has been pulling people off the sidelines, including, Audie, people without a high school degree, for example, people who have a criminal record. That's encouraging. The White House says about three quarters of the people who found work last month had never worked before or had given up on the job market and are now coming back in. CORNISH: That's NPR's Scott Horsley. Scott, thanks for explaining it. HORSLEY: You're welcome. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:   It's been another wild week on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than a thousand points in two days earlier this week, but today the market gained some of that back. In fact, the Dow surged more than 370 points after the Labor Department reported the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years. So the job market keeps chugging along despite signs that the overall economy is slowing. NPR's Scott Horsley is here to tease it out for us. Welcome back to the studio. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Audie. CORNISH: We've been talking about low unemployment for a long time, and today we learned it's even lower. So help us understand what's happening. HORSLEY: Audie, let me take you back to December 1969. That's how far back you'd have to go to find an unemployment rate as low as we've got right now. CORNISH: Oh, we're really going back. HORSLEY: Three and a half percent. That's right. Diana Ross and The Supremes were topping the charts. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SOMEDAY WE'LL BE TOGETHER\") DIANA ROSS AND THE SUPREMES: (Singing) Someday we'll be together. HORSLEY: Today's report was supremely good when it comes to the unemployment rate. But the jobs picture, Audie, that was a little bit less rosy. CORNISH: OK, so why? And what are we seeing on the jobs front? HORSLEY: Employers added 136,000 jobs in September. That's certainly not bad after nearly nine years of steady job growth. We also learned that job gains in July and August were a little bit stronger than initially reported. But Chief Economist Constance Hunter, who's with the big accounting firm KPMG, says even when you add in those extra jobs, we're still seeing a slower pace of hiring now than we were at this time last year.

But why has the cost of health care and education risen far faster than things like TVs, cars and everyday consumer items? Well, you can trust economists to come up with a theory. They call it the Baumol effect. Cardiff Garcia and Danielle Kurtzleben from our daily economics podcast The Indicator From Planet Money explain how this works. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)CARDIFF GARCIA: Alex Tabarrok, an economist at George Mason University, is the co-author of a new book called \"Why Are The Prices So Damn High? \" And the answer, he says, starts with an economist named William Baumol. ALEX TABARROK: He says think about a string quartet in 1826. It takes four people 40 minutes to play this string quartet. Now, let's think about the same string quartet in 2019 - live performance, same four people. It still takes them 40 minutes to produce the music. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: But the price you pay to see that live string quartet has gone up way more than the price of everything else in the economy. The reason why is the Baumol effect. GARCIA: Some sectors of the economy get better at making stuff every year. In other words, productivity grows really fast in these sectors. KURTZLEBEN: For example, let's say an electronics company can make more flat-screen televisions this year with the same number of workers as last year, and those workers work the same number of hours. More is produced for each hour of work; maybe because there's better equipment for the workers to use or new technology that makes producing flat-screen TVs more efficient. GARCIA: When a sector of the economy has fast productivity growth, that means it can afford to raise the wages it pays to its workers without raising the prices of the goods they make. There are also some sectors that have very slow productivity growth. They do not become more efficient at producing their goods or services from year to year. Kind of like the musicians in a string quartet, these workers do not produce much more of the same product. KURTZLEBEN: The health care and education sectors fall into this category. Doctors, nurses, teachers, college professors - their productivity just doesn't go up much every year. GARCIA: The reason they don't get more efficient over time is largely because a big part of what their customers want from them is their time, their presence. KURTZLEBEN: The health care and education sectors still have to pay wages that can compete with other sectors of the economy that do have fast productivity growth because, otherwise, not enough people would become doctors, nurses, teachers, professors or play in string quartets. GARCIA: The way that the health care and education sectors pay those higher salaries is by raising the prices of what they sell. KURTZLEBEN: Since the workers in these sectors are not making more stuff to sell each year, the businesses that hire them - the schools, the colleges, the hospitals - they have to raise their prices so they can afford to pay those rising salaries. GARCIA: Yeah. And when Alex analyzed what was happening in the health care and education sectors, he found that not only had salaries for education and health care workers climbed year after year for decades, but also we have more of them than we used to. TABARROK: Because teachers are fairly well-educated and skilled, we have to pay them at least as much as they could earn elsewhere. GARCIA: The costs of health care and education would still rise faster than the costs in other parts the economy simply because productivity growth in health care and education is slower. That is the mechanical relationship explained by the Baumol effect. Cardiff Garcia. KURTZLEBEN: Danielle Kurtzleben, NPR News.

Developers around the country are building entire subdivisions of new single-family homes. These houses are not for sale. You can't buy them. That is because they are for rent. Homebuilders are discovering there are a lot of people right now who could afford to buy a house, but they would rather not. NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: A different sort of American Dream is under construction outside of Denver. One hundred thirty six homes are being framed and nail-gunned together. But there won't be any realtors staging open houses here. Instead of home ownership, this development is all about renting. JOSH HARTMANN: We got started in around 2010 after the housing crash. People were losing their homes. ARNOLD: Josh Hartmann is the CEO of NexMetro Communities, the company building these homes. And he says that the business idea was that all those families losing homes to foreclosure, they wouldn't want to go back to renting apartments. They'd want to rent single-family houses until they could get back on their feet financially. But that is not who kept walking into the sales office to rent the houses. HARTMANN: What we were shocked to find out was it was people that had great credit. They had money for down payments. They had great incomes, but they just didn't want to own a home. They were a lifestyle renter - renter by choice. ARNOLD: And there were a lot of them, so NexMetro kept building homes. It's built 2,800 so far in Colorado, Arizona and Texas. And they fill up quickly. Other builders are now doing this around the country, too. So if many of these people actually could buy a house, why are they deciding to rent one instead? LOU ANN ERWIN: This is perfect for me. I wanted the house feel but not the house payment and not the commitment of a 30-year mortgage. ARNOLD: A few miles away in a finished development, Lou Ann Erwin is showing me around the little cottage-type house that she's renting. Erwin just got divorced, and so she's not sure where she's going to want to live longer term. Her house here is not big, but it does have 10-foot-high ceilings and a pretty spacious-feeling kitchen and living area. The yard is definitely tiny, and the homes are packed tightly together, but that doesn't bother Erwin. ERWIN: I've got a gas grill out there. I've got a fire pit, and we sit out there at night. My neighbor next door came over the other night, and we just sat around, drank wine and just talked. It was - it felt like home to me. So this was just a real win-win for me. ARNOLD: There is also a nice pool for residents to share, complete with. . . (SOUNDBITE OF WATER BUBBLING)ARNOLD: OK, so this is my favorite thing so far. This is a nice, big, hot tub. HARTMANN: Yeah, this is the spot that our residents love to hang out in the evenings or on the weekends with their friends. ARNOLD: Josh Hartmann, the CEO, says there are basically three types of renters of these houses - people who recently got divorced, like Erwin, also aging baby boomers who don't want the headaches of owning a house anymore, and he says there are a lot of younger people, too. Twenty-five-year-old Itzel Alarcon just moved here with her husband. ITZEL ALARCON: We just got married actually two months ago as well, so as soon as we got married, we moved in. ARNOLD: Now, most millennials say that they want to own a house someday, but they're not buying as young as prior generations. For some, student loan debt is a factor. Alarcon says she saw relatives get hurt by the housing crash, and home prices have doubled in this area since then, so she's nervous that they might fall again. ALARCON: Yes, prices right now are extremely ridiculously high. And so we'll stay here at least for a year or two for sure. ARNOLD: And at $1,500 a month, she says the couple's one-bedroom cottage is cheaper than buying a house in the neighborhood she finds appealing. So for the people that we've just met, renting seems to make perfect sense. But if they stay here too long, would they be violating one of the fundamentals of good personal finance? Because owning a home and building equity in it is still the most powerful way that most Americans accumulate wealth. WILLIAM WHEATON: Owning still makes much more sense. ARNOLD: William Wheaton is a housing economist at MIT. He says these rental homes are fine short term, but he hopes the young people don't wait too long to buy into the housing market. WHEATON: I mean, if prices continue to rise like they have in Denver, buying in Denver will be a money tree. But even if you're very cautious and say, no, no, no, they're not going to continue to rise a lot, they'll, you know, inch up a few percentage points each year, over five or 10 years, that adds up to a sizable nest egg. And that's what you're giving up by renting. ARNOLD: Back at NexMetro's development, Josh Hartmann says he hopes that more young people buy homes, too, but until they're ready, he's got 3,000 more single-family rental houses under construction or in development. Over the past year, developers around the country built about 40,000 homes as rentals. And Lou Ann Erwin, for her part, thinks that her little cottage beats an apartment any day. ERWIN: I don't know if you noticed the patio, but I've got my own private patio, so I love this. I really do. I mean, you're not going to get a patio like this in an apartment. You're just not.

He was hoping that tariffs would inflict enough pain on the Chinese economy to extract concessions from the government. But more than a year and a half into the trade war, talks are still dragging on. They pick up today in Washington. And just how long this trade war will last hinges on how much pain China is actually feeling. And the best way to figure that out is to go to China, which is exactly what our co-host Ailsa Chang did. (SOUNDBITE OF VEHICLE HORNS)AILSA CHANG, BYLINE: We're at an outdoor market in this part of a sprawling city in southern China. Dongguan is often called the workshop of the world. It manufactures everything from shoes to power tools. The pulse of the city rises and falls with China's industrial economy, which is why we figured Dongguan was where to crack the question of how the trade war has been hitting China. We found our first clues at the barbecue stands, where factory workers flock during shift breaks. SONG GUANG-HUI: (Through interpreter) In a nutshell, there fewer and fewer people in Dongguan. CHANG: Song Guang-hui operates a beer and barbecue stand here, and he says he's noticed a dramatic shift over the last year. SONG: (Through interpreter) A year and a half ago, at the same spot, same time of day, the market would be so crowded you can't move. CHANG: His arm sweeps across the scene in front of him. It's dinner time for factory workers. And there are empty tables, barely any lines. Song says his business has tanked by more than half over the last year. SONG: (Through interpreter) I have thought about moving. It's hard to get enough business in Dongguan. We're all looking for better places, and for sure we would move if we find one. If it goes on like this, we won't be able to put food on the table. CHANG: It makes sense that Song is seeing fewer workers around these days because factory output growth in China is at its lowest level in 17 years, a reality that is hitting other parts of Dongguan's ecosystem. Next stop - a neighborhood bar. MARCUS HEMOPO: Like \"Cheers. \"CHANG: Like \"Cheers. \"Except it's called Irene's. It's a watering hole that's become a favorite among Western business types like product designers, engineers and manufacturing executives who work with Chinese factories. HEMOPO: From time to time, my band will play in here. CHANG: Marcus Hemopo is from Auckland, New Zealand. He and his wife, Irene Fong, have been operating the bar for nine years. Irene hand wraps a thousand dumplings a week here. IRENE FONG: Also, I'm making chimichanga, fajitas. CHANG: You make dumplings, chimichangas and fajitas? FONG: I like to cook all the food. CHANG: Oh, OK. Let me have a bite of the chimichanga. All right. I'm going to also put the whole thing in my mouth. It fits. It's delicious, Irene. But these days, Irene's is selling fewer chimichangas and dumplings. HEMOPO: Certainly, since the beginning of this year, things have dropped off. And hopefully, it will bounce back at some point. CHANG: What are you noticing? Are you seeing customers coming in less often who you used to see more regularly? HEMOPO: Yeah. A typical profile might have been four people to come on trips every couple of months. Well, instead of every couple of months, it might be every four months, or it might be that they've stopped coming altogether. CHANG: Why do you think that is? HEMOPO: Well, obviously because, you know, the guys - or the ladies, as the case may be - are off servicing products in other countries. CHANG: They've moved their manufacturing outside of China, outside of Dongguan. HEMOPO: Yeah, that would be true. Certainly the problems that exist in the trade situation for many companies have accelerated things. CHANG: There's no question - things are slowing down in Dongguan. Chinese exports to the U. S. dropped 12% this year, which China isn't exactly advertising right now. You see, the country states its national pride on its status as an economic superpower, and any sign of economic weakness hurts that image. It's why China massages official data and prevents people from speaking openly about the economy, which is why we had a lot of trouble getting into the next place we wanted to visit - a factory. Factory owners turned us down left and right. They told us the stakes were too high, the topic too sensitive. But then, after several weeks and dozens of phone calls, we finally got one yes. CHRISTOPHER DEVEREUX: We make 15 different doggie doo-da (ph) bags. CHANG: Doggie doo-da? I love that. (LAUGHTER)CHANG: Meaning dog poop bags - it's one of the products made by Fangjie, a printing and packaging company, a Chinese-owned factory in Dongguan. Christopher Devereux runs a firm that connects foreign companies with the Chinese factories that make their products. He says China has few rivals in the world when it comes to manufacturing prowess, and he wanted to show us what that looks like. That is after I suited up in a smock and booties and got sanitized. We are in a tight little closet, getting blown with air. Oh, my God. A blast of air ensures I am dust-free. As you walk the floor here, you see the factory's values emblazoned on these tall pillars next to the machines. They read hardworking, organized and practice. TSAO MAI-HWA: (Through interpreter) We see quality as our life. We think the survival of our enterprise depends on our quality, our efficiency, our service. CHANG: Tsao Mai-hwa is one of the people in charge here. She points to gigantic presses spitting out sheets and sheets of colorful plastic. TSAO: (Through interpreter) This machine prints at least 300,000 square meters a day. CHANG: A day? TSAO: Yeah, a day. CHANG: A day? TSAO: (Through interpreter) We survive by efficiency. CHANG: Wow. Then we stop at a cluster of machines that look remarkably brand new. DEVEREUX: These four machines over here they bought specially for us. CHANG: But those four machines are mostly idle now because of a decision Devereux made just this year. He pulled almost all of his business out of this factory and moved it to Vietnam. The economics of staying in China just didn't make sense anymore, and that is what I wanted to hear more about. But first, I had to de-robe. I am so ready to take off this smock. I am so sweaty. Tell me why you've decided to move a lot of the manufacturing - at least of these particular doggy poop bags - to Vietnam. DEVEREUX: Purely because of the tariffs. CHANG: The trade war between the U. S. and China? DEVEREUX: Yeah, the trade war. CHANG: But as you start to tease out exactly why Devereux blames the trade war, something interesting happens. He starts painting a much more complicated picture. Turns out, he had already been thinking about moving to Vietnam several years ago, way before the trade war even started. Wages were going up in China, environmental regulations were tightening. Doing business here just got more and more expensive. Those trends are part of the reason why China's economy has stalled over the past decade. And it's hard to disentangle the effects of that broader economic slowdown from the effects of the trade war. But talking about any of this stuff in China can get you into trouble. OK. Some state security officials have just arrived at the factory. We just finished our interview, and we've been ushered into a conference room to wait. It looks like the state security officials are talking to the officials at this factory about what happened during the interview, what we discussed. We wait in that conference room for almost an hour. Then one of the factory executives scrambles back in wearing an anxious smile, and she's trying to reassure us that everything's just fine. So everything OK? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: OK. CHANG: OK, great. Yay. It was strange. I mean, on the surface, everything went back to normal, but something had clearly shifted. The state security officials stuck around, chain smoking on the couch while we finished our interviews. And their presence underscored just how much China wants to control what people say about its economy and the trade war. I asked the factory's president about this, and I could hear Jerry Bao (ph) walk a careful line. Has the Chinese government encouraged you to keep sending an optimistic message about your outlook for the future here at this factory? JERRY BAO: (Through interpreter) Absolutely. They tell us that China is a vast country with abundant resources. Demand for products inside China is huge. CHANG: And how much do you personally believe that message is true? BAO: (Through interpreter) We will have to trust our government 100%. We trust our government to help us out and to solve all the problems. CHANG: Bao says the Chinese government has been really helpful in insulating the factory with things like tax reductions. And besides, he says the trade war hasn't hurt their company that much because they have been so resourceful in finding new business to replace clients like Devereux who want to leave China. The thing is, though, not that many companies can leave China right now even if the tariffs are denting their profits because China is simply irreplaceable for a lot of businesses. Other countries like Vietnam just don't stack up. They have a smaller labor force, not the right skills, underdeveloped infrastructure, lower quality control. And, Devereux says, there is another problem. DEVEREUX: Attitude. CHANG: What do you mean by that? DEVEREUX: I think that the Vietnamese - I mean, here you've got a work ethic, fantastic work ethic. In Vietnam, you've got almost negative attitude to work. CHANG: Is it a matter of people don't want to work, say, six days a week, which is very common here among manufacturers in China? DEVEREUX: Or seven days a week. CHANG: Or seven days a week. That's difficult to do in Vietnam. DEVEREUX: It's very difficult to do. CHANG: I see. So in your estimation, how long would it take to transform Vietnam so it's up and running at the level that China is right now? DEVEREUX: I don't think Vietnam will ever catch up. CHANG: Are there any other countries outside of Vietnam that you could foresee becoming the next China? DEVEREUX: Frankly, no. CHANG: And that is the problem for President Trump. The whole strategy behind starting a trade war was to inflict enough damage on the Chinese government for it to change its protectionist ways. But with so much of the global economy tied up with China, some short-term pain may not be enough to shake up the whole system. (SOUNDBITE OF KIDSWASTE'S \"ALONE\")SHAPIRO: That's our co-host Ailsa Chang reporting in Dongguan, China. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  President Trump started the trade war with China because he was sick of how China has been doing business. He was hoping that tariffs would inflict enough pain on the Chinese economy to extract concessions from the government. But more than a year and a half into the trade war, talks are still dragging on. They pick up today in Washington. And just how long this trade war will last hinges on how much pain China is actually feeling. And the best way to figure that out is to go to China, which is exactly what our co-host Ailsa Chang did. (SOUNDBITE OF VEHICLE HORNS) AILSA CHANG, BYLINE: We're at an outdoor market in this part of a sprawling city in southern China. Dongguan is often called the workshop of the world. It manufactures everything from shoes to power tools. The pulse of the city rises and falls with China's industrial economy, which is why we figured Dongguan was where to crack the question of how the trade war has been hitting China. We found our first clues at the barbecue stands, where factory workers flock during shift breaks. SONG GUANG-HUI: (Through interpreter) In a nutshell, there fewer and fewer people in Dongguan. CHANG: Song Guang-hui operates a beer and barbecue stand here, and he says he's noticed a dramatic shift over the last year. SONG: (Through interpreter) A year and a half ago, at the same spot, same time of day, the market would be so crowded you can't move. CHANG: His arm sweeps across the scene in front of him. It's dinner time for factory workers. And there are empty tables, barely any lines. Song says his business has tanked by more than half over the last year. SONG: (Through interpreter) I have thought about moving. It's hard to get enough business in Dongguan. We're all looking for better places, and for sure we would move if we find one. If it goes on like this, we won't be able to put food on the table. CHANG: It makes sense that Song is seeing fewer workers around these days because factory output growth in China is at its lowest level in 17 years, a reality that is hitting other parts of Dongguan's ecosystem. Next stop - a neighborhood bar. MARCUS HEMOPO: Like \"Cheers. \" CHANG: Like \"Cheers. \" Except it's called Irene's. It's a watering hole that's become a favorite among Western business types like product designers, engineers and manufacturing executives who work with Chinese factories. HEMOPO: From time to time, my band will play in here. CHANG: Marcus Hemopo is from Auckland, New Zealand. He and his wife, Irene Fong, have been operating the bar for nine years. Irene hand wraps a thousand dumplings a week here. IRENE FONG: Also, I'm making chimichanga, fajitas. CHANG: You make dumplings, chimichangas and fajitas? FONG: I like to cook all the food. CHANG: Oh, OK. Let me have a bite of the chimichanga. All right. I'm going to also put the whole thing in my mouth. It fits. It's delicious, Irene. But these days, Irene's is selling fewer chimichangas and dumplings. HEMOPO: Certainly, since the beginning of this year, things have dropped off. And hopefully, it will bounce back at some point. CHANG: What are you noticing? Are you seeing customers coming in less often who you used to see more regularly? HEMOPO: Yeah. A typical profile might have been four people to come on trips every couple of months. Well, instead of every couple of months, it might be every four months, or it might be that they've stopped coming altogether. CHANG: Why do you think that is? HEMOPO: Well, obviously because, you know, the guys - or the ladies, as the case may be - are off servicing products in other countries. CHANG: They've moved their manufacturing outside of China, outside of Dongguan. HEMOPO: Yeah, that would be true. Certainly the problems that exist in the trade situation for many companies have accelerated things. CHANG: There's no question - things are slowing down in Dongguan. Chinese exports to the U.

Now, the details of this deal still have to be written, but we're going to find out what we can from NPR's Jim Zarroli, who's in New York. Hi there, Jim. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise. KELLY: All right. What do we know about this phase one? What's actually been agreed? ZARROLI: Well, I think perhaps the most concrete thing here that's been agreed to involves the tariffs that were supposed to take effect on Tuesday. You know, the Trump administration has already put tariffs on a lot of the things that we import from China. They were supposed to go up on Tuesday. That will be suspended. That's the word that was used, but the tariffs that are already in place apparently will remain in place. And there are still additional tariffs that are supposed to take effect in December, and it's not really clear whether they will take effect. Also, China has agreed to buy more agricultural products from the United States. The president said 40 to $50 billion worth. You know, farmers, of course, have been really hurt by this trade war, and the president has been really anxious to help them out. KELLY: The president and his advisers have been clear they wanted a big deal, not something piecemeal. Does this count - phase one of a big deal? ZARROLI: You know, I think it's progress. It means, you know, this is - phase one means there's going to be a phase two and possibly a phase three, which means there's more work to do. I mean, one of - the important thing to point out here is that, apparently, this deal isn't written down on paper yet. That has to be done over, President Trump said, the next three weeks or four weeks or five weeks. And, of course, the devil is always in the details with things like this, in trade talks. KELLY: Right, and there's a history in this administration of the president coming out and saying something was agreed and then we hear from the other country that they had a different understanding that emerged. ZARROLI: Yeah, and actually, you know, there was a meeting in the spring, and President Trump came out and said he expected a deal in four weeks. That didn't happen, so - but, you know, the important thing here is that there - it seems like some of the animosity between the two countries has been lessened, and that's important. That's a first step. You know, I think both President Trump and the Chinese leader Xi Jinping feel - they want a deal here. They want a political victory, and that's important. It means that some progress is being made. KELLY: Do we know of the major outstanding issues? Are there any that we know that were not addressed in this phase one deal? ZARROLI: Yeah, quite a few. I mean, some of the very important structural issues still have to be addressed. You know, for instance, the United States wants China to crack down on intellectual property theft. The treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin said, you know, we're very, very close to a deal on that, but apparently, they don't have one yet. You know, and then there are other big issues that have just been a problem for a long time. China - the U. S. wants China to open up its markets, stop subsidizing state-owned companies. I mean, these are really tough issues, and they go to the very heart of the kind of economy China is. KELLY: And what about Huawei? That's been another major sticking point - the Chinese telecom giant. ZARROLI: Exactly. There's nothing on Huawei. You know, President Trump put Huawei on a Commerce Department blacklist in May. He then backtracked on that a little bit, but that's still in place. It hasn't been talked about today. It wasn't addressed in this deal, and it suggests they still have a long way to go. KELLY: So just very briefly, Jim, does this set a more positive tone? Are the trade tensions ratcheting down maybe a little bit? ZARROLI: Yeah, it certainly sets a different tone, but I have to say the stock market seemed somewhat underwhelmed by what came out today. The Dow right before the deal was announced was up 515 points, and then it fell back and finished up 319. KELLY: So we shall see where it goes from there on Monday morning.

Three economists trying to change that were recognized today with a Nobel Memorial Prize. The three helped pioneer a more rigorous scientific approach to evaluating efforts aimed at helping some of the world's neediest people. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: When doctors want to figure out the best way to fight a disease, they'll often set up a clinical trial testing one kind of medicine, for example, to see if it works better than a sugar pill. When it comes to fighting poverty, though, aid workers traditionally have not been so meticulous. Esther Duflo says that's been a drawback of even the most well-intentioned efforts. ESTHER DUFLO: Often, the poor are reduced to caricatures. Even people who try to help them do not actually understand what are the deep root of the problems that are addressing the poor. HORSLEY: Duflo and her husband, Abhijit Banerjee, who are both economists at MIT, set out to change that. In 2003, they established the Poverty Action Lab, a network of researchers around the world who try to measure what kinds of aid actually help poor people. Programs that work can be scaled up. Those that don't can be scrapped and the money and manpower shifted to other more productive programs. DUFLO: Let's try and unpack the problem one by one and address them as vigorously and scientifically as possible - what works, what doesn't work and why. HORSLEY: The committee behind the Nobel Memorial Prize said that approach has reshaped the way governments and nonprofit groups approach poverty. Duflo and Banerjee are sharing the prize with a fellow economist, Michael Kremer of Harvard. Speaking to NPR's Here & Now today, Kremer recalled how he helped organize randomized trials in Kenya decades ago to see if giving poor students more textbooks would help them do better in school. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)MICHAEL KREMER: Course, in some cases, it turns out that things that you thought would work don't work. And it's very important to have that information so that new approaches can be tried. HORSLEY: Kremer found extra textbooks were little help to students who'd missed classes and fallen behind. But those same students could make big gains if they got some remedial instruction. As Banerjee told Planet Money back in 2011, their approach is less concerned with sweeping theories of fighting poverty than figuring out what really works on the ground. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)ABHIJIT BANERJEE: We really operate at the level at which much of the actual effective policy discourse operates. HORSLEY: Duflo is only the second woman to receive the economics Nobel. At a time when the economics profession is doing some soul-searching about how welcoming it is to women, Duflo says she hopes today's recognition will help. DUFLO: I hope it's going to inspire many, many other women to continue working and many other men to give them the respect they deserve, like every single human being. HORSLEY: Duflo also suggests the same scientific approach she and others have used to fight extreme poverty in the developing world could be useful in rich countries, as well. Many workers in Europe and America have grown anxious about their place in an increasingly global economy, Duflo said, policymakers need a deeper understanding of how to make their lives better and more meaningful.

Speaking to NPR's Here & Now today, Kremer recalled how he helped organize randomized trials in Kenya decades ago to see if giving poor students more textbooks would help them do better in school. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) MICHAEL KREMER: Course, in some cases, it turns out that things that you thought would work don't work. And it's very important to have that information so that new approaches can be tried. HORSLEY: Kremer found extra textbooks were little help to students who'd missed classes and fallen behind. But those same students could make big gains if they got some remedial instruction. As Banerjee told Planet Money back in 2011, their approach is less concerned with sweeping theories of fighting poverty than figuring out what really works on the ground. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) ABHIJIT BANERJEE: We really operate at the level at which much of the actual effective policy discourse operates. HORSLEY: Duflo is only the second woman to receive the economics Nobel. At a time when the economics profession is doing some soul-searching about how welcoming it is to women, Duflo says she hopes today's recognition will help. DUFLO: I hope it's going to inspire many, many other women to continue working and many other men to give them the respect they deserve, like every single human being. HORSLEY: Duflo also suggests the same scientific approach she and others have used to fight extreme poverty in the developing world could be useful in rich countries, as well. Many workers in Europe and America have grown anxious about their place in an increasingly global economy, Duflo said, policymakers need a deeper understanding of how to make their lives better and more meaningful.

The GM strike, now in its sixth week, is one of the biggest in recent history, but it's not unique. Over the last two years, hundreds of thousands of teachers, nurses and factory workers have walked off the job, demanding higher pay and better working conditions. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting) CTU. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Who are we? SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Twenty-five thousand members of the Chicago Teachers Union are on strike this week, canceling classes for a fifth consecutive day. Union Vice President Stacy Davis Gates sums up the attitude of many frustrated workers around the country. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)STACY DAVIS GATES: We have given enough. It is time to get something back. HORSLEY: The U. S. is enjoying a record-long economic boom, but workers' slice of the pie has barely increased, and their complaints are getting louder. Last year, more workers went on strike than at any time since 1986. LAWRENCE MISHEL: Working people have taken it on the chin for four decades. HORSLEY: Lawrence Mishel is a labor economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute in Washington. He sees mounting job actions among teachers, hotel workers, even high-tech employees. MISHEL: The situation is that the workforce has been a tinderbox waiting to be lit. And if people see a way that they can solve their problems for themselves and their communities, they're going to take it. HORSLEY: In the 1950s, '60s and '70s, it was routine to see hundreds of big strikes every year, idling a million workers or more. But in recent decades, work stoppages like the one at General Motors have been much less common. Many say the turning point came in 1981 when President Reagan fired thousands of air traffic controllers who were conducting an illegal strike. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RONALD REAGAN: If they do not report for work within 48 hours, they have forfeited their jobs and will be terminated. HORSLEY: In the years that followed, private-sector employers often followed Reagan's example, firing striking workers. And with unemployment in the early '80s topping 10%, replacement workers were not hard to come by. Since then, the share of workers who are unionized has been cut by half to just over 10% last year. But with unemployment now near a 50-year low, there's less danger that striking workers can be quickly replaced. John Beck, a labor relations expert at Michigan State University, says emboldened workers at General Motors and elsewhere are asking themselves, if not now, when? JOHN BECK: People don't revolt when things are at their worst. They revolt when things are getting better but not fast enough. HORSLEY: Teachers have been leading this revolt, with walkouts from Arizona to Oklahoma and West Virginia to protest wages that have lost ground to inflation. Nurses have also been active on the picket lines. Like teachers, their jobs are not easily shipped overseas. Deborah Burger is president of the National Nurses United union, which led one-day walkouts last month at hospitals in several states. DEBORAH BURGER: We can't continue to work off the clock, work without breaks. We're trying to raise the awareness of the community. They understand that, and they support us. HORSLEY: A recent Gallup poll found public approval of organized labor near its highest level in 50 years. But Arthur Wheaton of the Industrial and Labor Relations school at Cornell says any big rebound in union membership is not likely, given the legal and cultural roadblocks. ARTHUR WHEATON: So it's very difficult to organize new members. A lot of companies are hiring what they call union avoidance law firms. And winning an election and getting the first contract negotiated is extremely difficult. HORSLEY: Twenty-seven states, including union strongholds like Michigan, now have right-to-work laws, which make union membership and dues-paying optional. Some unions are now paying more attention to improving pay and benefits for workers who don't belong to a union, campaigning, for example, for a higher minimum wage. If the UAW strike results in better pay for autoworkers, employees in other industries may be encouraged to demand their turn in the driver's seat. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington.

S. economy has been slowing down, but it got another push this afternoon from the Federal Reserve. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell announced that the central bank is cutting interest rates for the third time since July. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEROME POWELL: We took this step to help keep the U. S. economy strong in the face of global developments and to provide some insurance against ongoing risks. CHANG: The Fed's action comes on a day the Commerce Department reported that economic growth weakened in the summer and early fall to an annual rate of just 1. 9%. To explain what all of this means, we're joined now by NPR's Scott Horsley. Hey, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good to be with you. CHANG: Now, I understand the Fed's action today was widely anticipated, right? So how did the stock market react to all this? HORSLEY: There was no surprise in the rate cut itself, but what investors were watching for was how Powell would describe this. You know, was this all there is or is there likely more monetary juice to come later in the year? The official Fed statement seemed to suggest the former. Language that the Fed has used in the past about acting as appropriate to sustain the expansion was missing from today's statement, and one might read that as a hint that this is going to be the last rate cut for a while. But during his news conference, Powell did leave the door open to additional action should the economy weaken further. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)POWELL: Of course, if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly. Policy is not on a preset course. HORSLEY: And that seemed to be enough to reassure investors. All the major market indexes, which were kind of flat during the day, rose during Powell's news conference. The Dow ended the day up about 115 points. CHANG: All right. So the stock market is doing well, but the broader economy is losing steam. Can you just explain, how does that work? How can that be? How can both things be true? HORSLEY: For a while now, we've been seeing kind of a two-speed economy. On the consumer side, things have been going pretty well, which is not surprising. We've got a lot of people working. Their wages have been going up modestly, so consumers have money to spend, and they're spending it. Lower interest rates have encouraged that. We're finally seeing a pickup in the housing market thanks to lower mortgage rates. Consumers are buying more refrigerators and other big-ticket items. But business investment is weak and getting weaker. That is largely because of uncertainty in the global economy. And as a result of the president's trade war, Powell conceded cutting interest rates may not help that much. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)POWELL: I think interest rates are a factor in business investment, but I don't believe they're the main factor and main driver. HORSLEY: What would help, Powell said, would be a pickup in global demand and some resolution of the trade war. He pointed to some encouraging signs, the possibility, for example, of a mini deal between the U. S. and China. But he added there's still a lot of risk out there. CHANG: So is there a danger that this overall slowdown in business will spill over into the job market, which has been really strong lately? HORSLEY: It's certainly a possibility and one that Powell says the Fed is keeping an eye on. But they're not seeing that happen yet. There has been some slowdown in hiring this year, but that's to be expected when you've got a 3 1/2% unemployment rate. We do get another monthly jobs report this Friday, so we'll be watching that closely. But keep in mind, there's an asterisk on that report because it covers the period of the General Motors strike, which idled tens of thousands of autoworkers and others. Powell was careful not to comment on the GM settlement, but he did say that it's good to have that strike resolved. CHANG: That's NPR's Scott Horsley. Thanks, Scott. HORSLEY: You're welcome.

But new numbers from the Commerce Department this morning show the economy lost steam during the summer and early fall. GDP grew at an annual pace of just 1. 9% in the third quarter, well below the White House target. Here's NPR's Scott Horsley. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Weak economic growth in the third quarter follows a sluggish second quarter, when the economy grew at an annual pace of just 2%. At this point, it would take an economic miracle to achieve the 3. 2% growth rate for the full year predicted in the president's budget. DIANE SWONK: We won't get a three-plus percent growth rate for the year. That's not going to happen. HORSLEY: Chief economist Diane Swonk of Grant Thornton says third-quarter growth was hobbled in part by temporary factors, including the strike at General Motors and the continued grounding of Boeing 737 MAX jets. But the slowdown also reflects a steady decline in business investment. The GOP tax cut was supposed to promote a surge in business spending, and the White House promised that would supercharge economic growth. But Swonk says many businesses have grown skittish in the face of weak demand overseas and the president's trade war. SWONK: The uncertainty tax that we're paying with regard to trade - businesses don't know where to place their bets and don't know where to invest when they don't know where the next tariffs are going to come from. And so that's been one of the biggest weights on the U. S. economy. HORSLEY: Despite the flashing warning signs, the president continues to boast about the economy, telling reporters during a Cabinet meeting last week it's his ticket to a second term. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Look, I have the strongest economy ever. It's the economy's stupid, right? I have the strongest economy in the history of our country. HORSLEY: To be sure, the nation's unemployment rate is near a 50-year low. And as Trump noted earlier this week, the S&P 500 stock index just hit an all-time high. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Does anybody have a 401(k) that's up? (CHEERING)TRUMP: Everybody. HORSLEY: Other presidents have been wary of hitching their political fortunes to a volatile stock market, but economist Mark Zandi says Trump shows no such reservations. MARK ZANDI: Of course, he only focuses when the market's up. But nonetheless, he's got his finger on something. The market matters a lot. It's a real-time barometer of how the economy is doing, and people perceive it that way. HORSLEY: Zandi and his colleagues at Moody's Analytics have built a model that uses a variety of economic indicators, including the stock market, household income, unemployment and gasoline prices, to help predict the outcome of next year's presidential race. For now, Zandi says the economy is working in Trump's favor. ZANDI: If the economy is performing a year from now roughly like it is today and his approval rating is roughly the same and, of course, if turnout is typical, then given the economics, he will win. He will win the presidency in 2020. HORSLEY: Zandi says that could change, though, if the economic slowdown triggers a drop in the stock market or a jump in unemployment. A spike in voter turnout could also help Democrats, especially in the key battlegrounds of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Zandi notes all three of those states have a lot of factories and farms, businesses in the crosshairs of the president's trade war. ZANDI: Those are the industries that are actually suffering the most right now. So ironically, the president's trade war is doing the most damage to the economies of those states that will matter most to his reelection bid. HORSLEY: If Trump's paying attention to that, Zandi thinks the president will find a face-saving way to avoid escalating the trade war. If not, he says Trump's own political stock could suffer as well. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington.

HORSLEY: Zandi and his colleagues at Moody's Analytics have built a model that uses a variety of economic indicators, including the stock market, household income, unemployment and gasoline prices, to help predict the outcome of next year's presidential race. For now, Zandi says the economy is working in Trump's favor. ZANDI: If the economy is performing a year from now roughly like it is today and his approval rating is roughly the same and, of course, if turnout is typical, then given the economics, he will win. He will win the presidency in 2020. HORSLEY: Zandi says that could change, though, if the economic slowdown triggers a drop in the stock market or a jump in unemployment. A spike in voter turnout could also help Democrats, especially in the key battlegrounds of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Zandi notes all three of those states have a lot of factories and farms, businesses in the crosshairs of the president's trade war. ZANDI: Those are the industries that are actually suffering the most right now. So ironically, the president's trade war is doing the most damage to the economies of those states that will matter most to his reelection bid. HORSLEY: If Trump's paying attention to that, Zandi thinks the president will find a face-saving way to avoid escalating the trade war. If not, he says Trump's own political stock could suffer as well. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington.

S. stock market is still humming, despite the ongoing trade war and some temporary setbacks like the General Motors strike. Employers added 128,000 jobs in October, and that's more than forecasters were expecting. Job gains for both August and September were also revised upwards. President Trump celebrated the good news, tweeting, quote, \"USA rocks. \" NPR's Scott Horsley joins me to talk about this. Hi there, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, David. GREENE: OK, so this was a surprisingly strong report from the Labor Department. What is it - exactly is it saying here? HORSLEY: It was a surprisingly strong report. Forecasters were bracing for a really weak jobs report - partly because of that GM strike but also because we've seen signals the overall economy has been shifting to a lower gear. In general, forecasters were expecting to see job gains of 75,000 to 100,000 in October. This beats that by a good margin. And the job gains for August and September were also revised up by a total of 95,000. What this is telling us is that the U. S. job market is remarkably resilient despite headwinds like a slowing global economy and all the uncertainty that surrounds the president's trade war. Now, all the job gains in October and the vast majority of job gains in August and September were on the services side. There were big gains in things like hospitality and health care. Those are things you tend to consume locally, so they're less affected by global headwinds. GREENE: Did the good news extend to the manufacturing sector? Because I know that's been a real weak spot. HORSLEY: And it continues to be a weak spot. We're going to get some more information about manufacturing later this morning. But factories, along with farms, have taken the biggest hit so far because of the trade war. According to the Labor Department, there were 36,000 fewer manufacturing jobs in October than the month before. But some of that is a temporary slowdown because of that GM strike. Of course, that strike's settled now, and that means tens of thousands of auto workers are back on the job after 40 days on the picket lines. I talked to Randy Freeman. He's the president of UAW Local 652 in Lansing, Mich. RANDY FREEMAN: They were starting to feel a little bit of a pinch, but they're glad to be back. They're glad to be working and having this behind them and going into the holiday season. HORSLEY: And, of course, now the UAW has reached a tentative agreement with Ford, as well, so that's good news for auto employment. GREENE: How about the unemployment rate? I mean, that's something we always look to. HORSLEY: Yeah. It's still really low, but it did inch up by a tenth of a percent to 3. 6%. That's because the job market's been so strong, a lot of people who were on the sidelines are now coming back into the workforce. So that's encouraging. We also saw a slight acceleration in wages. Over the last year, average hourly wages have increased by about 3%. GREENE: All right - largely good news. At a moment like this, we always look to the stock market to see if investors are reacting, and I guess the market's open. Are we seeing anything? HORSLEY: Yes. The markets like what they're seeing in this jobs report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up about 160 points at this moment, little over half a percent. You know, earlier this week, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point. The market also liked that. But the Fed signaled that could be the last rate cut for a while unless the economy turns south. The overall pace of economic growth has been slowing, and there's a chance that the manufacturing problems could spill over into the job market. But Fed Chairman Jerome Powell says he and his colleagues aren't worried about that just yet. Right now the job market and consumer spending is holding up really well. And that's certainly underscored by this better-than-expected report from the Labor Department. GREENE: All right. Talking through these new jobs numbers with NPR's Scott Horsley.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. We begin today with a story of an economic bubble, or, to be more precise, a mania. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Foreign language spoken). VEDANTAM: This mania took place in Amsterdam in the 1630s. Picture a city of canals, elegant townhouses and a populace obsessed with one thing. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Foreign language spoken). VEDANTAM: . . . Tulips. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Foreign language spoken). ROBERT SHILLER: Amsterdam was the site of a big flowers market; it still is. People would trade tulips. And there were some tulips that were especially beautiful, they thought. And so people wanted those, and the price started going up. VEDANTAM: This is economist Robert Shiller. And when he says prices started going up, what he means is they started going up a lot. SHILLER: People were getting rich trading in tulips. One tulip would be the same value as a whole house. VEDANTAM: One tulip could hold as much value as a house. Now, historians say they've only found a few examples of this, but even more modestly priced tulips could sell for what would today be thousands of dollars. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Foreign language spoken). VEDANTAM: From a distance of nearly 400 years, the Dutch tulip mania of the 1630s might seem absurd, but the flowers were a way for the residents of Amsterdam to convey that they were cultured and influential. The tulips had great symbolic value. They told an amazing story. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This week on HIDDEN BRAIN - the powerful way in which stories and psychology shape our economic lives, how narratives affect not just the purchases we make as individuals but the fate of our entire economic system. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Most people think of the economy as following a set of fairly scientific principles. I buy more if things are cheap. I buy less if they're expensive. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: The nation's gross domestic product, or GDP, grew at a stronger than expected rate of 2 1/2%. VEDANTAM: Or say I run a company. I hire people if it looks like the economy is growing. I cut back if it looks like things are going to tank. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Delayed hiring, 4% accelerated hiring. You can see there mostly just going down. VEDANTAM: If I run the Federal Reserve, economic indicators tell me whether to raise or lower interest rates. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)AILSA CHANG: The central bank is cutting interest rates for the third time since July. VEDANTAM: It all looks very rational, very mathematical. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: But this picture neglects a fundamental aspect of economic life. We live in a world of stories. The stories that we tell in news reports, around the water cooler, in conversations with friends and family, these stories profoundly shape the trajectory of the economy. Economist Robert Shiller's new book explores this idea. It's called \"Narrative Economics. \" The winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize in economics, Robert Shiller says his interest in the relationship between stories and the economy goes all the way back to his early college days. He was an economics major, but he took a history course that examined the Great Depression. He was struck by the disconnect between the economic ideas he was learning about and the stories he read about how people behaved in the real world. SHILLER: People didn't sound like the people described in my economic theory. They seemed to be faddish and vulnerable to crazes and new ideas, and then they'd drop them and forget them. It just seemed like there was a note of reality that has been lost when we separate out departments. A history department has something to offer; so does the psych and sociology department, et cetera. But we tend to be - in academia, we tend to be polarized or more than polarized. We tend to compartmentalize. And I've, all my life ever since, thought that I wanted to read what these other people were saying as well as what my economist people are saying. VEDANTAM: Because, of course, they're all just different ways to understand the human condition, right? I mean, psychologists and anthropologists and sociologists and economists, I mean, they're all basically trying to understand why people do what they do. They're just using different tools. SHILLER: And political scientists. VEDANTAM: Yeah, yeah. SHILLER: Yeah. So we need all these perspectives. Don't be too compartmentalized. It may carry you for a while, but if you don't know what's happening in other realms of thought, you might miss the big picture. VEDANTAM: Robert says these realms of thought can help us decode things that otherwise seem puzzling about the economy. Take for example the story of a paper written by a mysterious mathematician in 2008. The author went by a pseudonym. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Satoshi Nakamoto. VEDANTAM: Satoshi Nakamoto. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Who is Satoshi Nakamoto? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Satoshi Nakamoto is a fake name for somebody. NEHA NARULA: He's a myth. I mean, he doesn't - no one knows who he is. Some people have claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, but we have not seen any definitive proof. ANDY COURT: When you ask about the creator - who created this? Who invented this? They must be a real genius. Everyone's like, we have no idea. VEDANTAM: The reason Satoshi Nakamoto created such a stir - this person, whose identity is still unknown, came up with a new type of currency - bitcoin. SHILLER: The first successful cryptocurrency. The story was that Nakamoto was able to invent a currency that could function without the help of any government, even against the opposition of any government. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Bitcoin emerged as the digital currency that in theory could not be manipulated by a central authority. SHILLER: And it would be smart, young, cosmopolitan people all over the world who would secure this decentralized system. It's a wonderful story and especially wonderful since nobody could figure out who Satoshi Nakamoto really was. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). SHILLER: He never - can't be found. No one has met him. How did he do that? That's an amazing story. VEDANTAM: Robert makes the case that bitcoin spread because it was a tale with surprise and intrigue. A genius mathematician invents a cryptocurrency and becomes a billionaire. It sounds like the plot of a movie. If I was making that movie, one subplot I would include is the story of the singer Lily Allen. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THE FEAR\")LILY ALLEN: (Singing) I want to be rich and I want lots of money. I don't care about clever. I don't care about funny. VEDANTAM: Lily Allen received an offer to get paid for a performance in bitcoin. SHILLER: She turned it down. That was the most momentous error you can imagine because she would be a billionaire if she had taken that bitcoin. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) And, you know, you hear the story and even if you don't know anything about cryptocurrencies, you ask yourself, am I missing out by not getting in on this? I mean, the story induces FOMO. SHILLER: That's exactly right, and that's a strong emotion, fear. It's regret theory. People are fearful of being regretful that they miss something. It hurts. You don't want to look forward to that pain in the future, so you might as well try. That's the thinking. VEDANTAM: What's astonishing is that the craze over bitcoin spread even though very few people actually understand what a cryptocurrency is or understand its underlying blockchain technology. But these terms very quickly became buzzwords. Here's comedian John Oliver on \"Last Week Tonight. \"(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LAST WEEK TONIGHT WITH JOHN OLIVER\")JOHN OLIVER: The problem is there is now enough excitement around the very word blockchain that it's become a magnet for investment. Reuters found that the existing companies that merely added the word blockchain to their name saw their stock price on average increase more than threefold. And one of them was particularly dumb. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Long Island Iced Tea renamed themselves Long Blockchain. And guess what happened. Yeah, their stock tripled. VEDANTAM: Robert, so you write at one point that the total value of bitcoin exceeded $300 billion, but bitcoin has no value unless people think it has value. So something that existed purely in people's heads went from being worth $0 to $300 billion? SHILLER: Yes, it can easily happen if the viral effect is strong enough. Now, bitcoin enthusiasts will say, well, what about gold? Gold has no real value. It's just a shiny metal that's pretty to look at. And yet it has tremendous value, and it has for thousands of years. But I have to say there are some differences. Gold is scarce - inherently scarce. Anybody can start a new cryptocurrency. Gold is in the Bible. It's mentioned over 300 times in the Holy Bible. VEDANTAM: You know, I was thinking about this as I was reading the book. You know, when I think about real money, obviously, real money, you know, has on many occasions bought me real things. But at some level, doesn't real money function a little bit like bitcoin in that it requires you and I to both agree that the notes that I have in my wallet have real value, that in some ways we both agree on the story of what the notes mean and the story is what gives the notes their power? SHILLER: That's right. That's - you've spoken just perfectly about narrative economics. I'll give you another example - banks. Why don't banks fail? All it takes is a story. If someone says the bank is going to be bankrupt soon, everybody will rush in and try to take their money out. And the banks can't - they don't have it on hand. They can't pay it out. So that's another example of how, yes, our whole banking system is built on a narrative. VEDANTAM: Yeah. Because at any given point, the bank might have enough money cash on hand to basically pay out, you know, five or 10% of what its total assets are. It's investing the rest of the money in other projects. So if everyone asks for their money back at the same time, the bank would simply not be able to deliver. SHILLER: And it happens, and it's supported by visual imagery. Photographers go to the bank, and they take a photograph of the big crowd clamoring to get in to get their money out. This has happened so many times that the FDIC - Federal Deposit Insurance Company - has a gallery of photos in one of their residences. And so it's become a narrative in itself that we have to watch out for that it doesn't come back. It's a perennial narrative. VEDANTAM: So bitcoin was not just a mysterious new scheme. It tapped into many deep and ancient narratives about ordinary people and elites, about anarchy, about populism. Talk to me about those larger themes that it tapped into. SHILLER: Well, there was a movement that began in the 19th century with the philosopher Proudhon called anarchism, which took an extreme statement that we don't need any government. If we just leave the people alone with no government, they will do much better. People are naturally inclined, many people, to anarchism, and so they're so happy to hear of bitcoin. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SHILLER: . . . Which was claimed can't be controlled by the government because bitcoin is for the whole world. It just sounds so enlightened and brilliant. VEDANTAM: And in some ways, if you feel like you are part of the large number of people who doesn't have power, who doesn't have a voice and you feel like powerful elites are running your life, as many people do, in some ways, bitcoin is - you know, it's sort of - you're throwing a rock against the edifice of the elites. You're basically fighting back in some ways. SHILLER: Right. And when you buy bitcoin, you feel like you're on the bright side of things. You're an owner of some of this fancy computer stuff in a sense. VEDANTAM: Yeah. SHILLER: And you're part of it. VEDANTAM: Yeah, you're one of the disruptors; you're not the ones being disrupted. SHILLER: That's the hope that it gives you. Yes. VEDANTAM: Robert says these underlying currents help explain why a story like bitcoin took off. If psychology and sociology explain the origins of economic fads, Robert draws in ideas from another field - medicine - to understand how such fads spread and when they die. Stories, he says, function like viruses or parasites. They spread only when they have a receptive host. SHILLER: It is really important to understand that things that are popular are the result of contagion. There is a contagion rate which varies through time. There's also a recovery rate - how soon people forget about the narrative. This is just straight out of medical epidemiology. The contagion rate has to be higher than the recovery rate and then the epidemic will take off. It'll start small, but it will get bigger and bigger until the contagion rate falls down below the recovery rate, and then it starts to recede. It's mysterious because we don't normally think about the contagion rate and the recovery rate for stories. But that, in fact, are basic parameters that explain when they get strong and when they fade away. VEDANTAM: And, of course, for the people who haven't invested in bitcoin, who didn't get in on the craze, you know, those people might listen to this and say, hang on a second, I wasn't affected by the story. But in some ways, that's not different from an epidemic. Not everyone falls sick when an epidemic is raging. SHILLER: Yeah. So if you have not invested in bitcoin, that's not necessarily a sign of your common sense. It's just that you never encountered a contagious person who is spreading the word. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Bitcoin is a single story. When we come back, Robert Shiller makes the case that narrative economics can explain larger phenomena, including shifts in the entire economy. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Robert, in your book, you write, when we choose to tell a story to others, we base that choice on our perceptions of how people will react to that story in their own minds. We will likely spread a story, whether it is a story about boom-time thinking or about economic despair, if we think that others will like the story enough to want to spread it further. Talk about this idea that part of the reason stories spread - and some stories spread more than others - is that we are actually, each of us, gauging whether if we tell the story to somebody else, they, in turn, would want to pass it on. SHILLER: Right. It's what psychologists call theory of mind. That is, we are always thinking about what we imagine other people are thinking. That's because understanding other people's thinking is very important for success in human society. People enjoy conversation. It's part of our species. It's everywhere in the world. Everywhere you go, you'll see people standing facing each other engaged in conversation. And if you get a translation of what they're saying, they're telling stories (laughter). And people, when they hear a story, they turn it over in their mind and say, maybe I could use this story in another conversation. So people evaluate them based on their apparent success in motivating other people. So yeah, it's as if people are all trying to go viral. It's not a new thing with the Internet. They were going viral thousands of years ago. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Nearly a century ago, a powerful story swept the country. It's a story that has echoes in our own time, and the lessons from history are instructive. In the 1920s and '30s, many people feared that technological innovations were going to disrupt the economy and put lots of people out of work. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: For the majority, it means the interminable line outside factory gates, desperately hoping for a job that rarely comes. SHILLER: It explains some things that got out of hand and bad. The Great Depression of the 1930s came shortly after the term technological unemployment became popular in the late 1920s about machines replacing jobs. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #5: Machines replaced hands. New machines replaced old machines. New inventions - the electric light, automobile, telephone - started as luxuries, then, as they were made better and cheaper, became commonplace. SHILLER: And when the unemployment rate got high after 1930, people started to think, this is it. It's robots replacing our jobs. And you may think, it's pretty strange that people thought about robots in 1930. That sounds like long before they had computers. But they did think they had robots. I'll give you an example of what they called a robot. (SOUNDBITE OF ROTARY PHONE DIAL SPINNING)SHILLER: It's the dial telephone. Before that when you picked up a phone, there was no dial, no keypad. You had to just - there was an operator there and it would say, number, please. UNIDENTIFIED OPERATOR: Number, please. SHILLER: They replaced that operator with a machine. That's called a robot. And it scared people then. And they thought that, maybe we better fall back and save some more money. When everybody does that, it makes the depression worse. VEDANTAM: So one of the interesting points you make is that stories vanish and resurface, like the story you were just telling about technological innovation displacing workers. And sometimes these stories vanish and come back over decades or even centuries. And that really is analogous to what happens with pathogens that go dormant and then they reemerge sometimes decades later as epidemics. SHILLER: That's right. And a pathogen can reemerge because of a mutation. Like, influenza mutates quite regularly, and we have to get inoculated imperfectly against those mutations. Or it can change because of some change in our practices. If there's some event that brings people closer together in an enclosed space, it can spread much more rapidly and the contagion rate goes up. So these are fundamental lessons that I don't hear very often from most economists. They don't talk in these terms, and they don't see the causal impact from narratives to the economy. VEDANTAM: So it's interesting. When we think about stories - and if you draw the analogy with pathogens, perhaps then modifications to stories or tweaks in an underlying story might be necessary for a dormant story to come back and become dominant again. SHILLER: Yes. And so sometimes the tweaks are just frivolous sounding. I'll give an example from my book. The idea of trickle-down economics where you cut taxes on the rich on the theory that they will raise GDP and, ultimately, enrich the poorer people was starting to look pretty old by the 1970s. But then a new narrative appeared that was really written by a writer Jude Wanniski about the Laffer curve. And it was basically the same theory that if you cut taxes, GDP will go up and tax revenues will even go up. You just have to cut taxes. That was a lovely story, and it was embellished by details, visual images. Like, it was said that Arthur Laffer, the economist, presented his idea - new idea about taxes in the form of a diagram which he drew on a napkin at a fancy restaurant with Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and future Vice President Dick Cheney. Putting these names at a visual image of a diagram drawn on a napkin was all that that narrative needed to get epidemic again. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). SHILLER: And that led to, I would say, Margaret Thatcher's ascendance to the prime minister in Britain in '79 and then Ronald Reagan, president of the United States - both tax cutters. VEDANTAM: So the diagram drawn on that napkin eventually came to be called the Laffer curve. Explain what that curve is. Explain what the very simple intuition is behind that curve that eventually led to fairly significant policy changes on both sides of the Atlantic. SHILLER: Yeah. It's almost - the Laffer curve story, it's almost like a joke with a punchline. So what Laffer said is, if we have a 0% tax rate on incomes, how much will we collect? Zero, obviously. But what if we have a 100% tax rate on incomes, what will we collect? Well, it'll be zero again because nobody's going to work if the government takes all of it. So in between, the revenue has to be positive. So connect the dots and you have a hump-shaped curve. That means that to raise any given amount of revenue, there are always two tax rates - a low one and a high one. You can picture that on my diagram, which I'm asking you to make a mental image of. And so that's a new idea. Nobody has been talking about two tax rates to raise the same revenue. It's clever. It's like a - it's a stunt, a trick. It's a magic trick. It's fun. You can have - you'll know that you'll get a rise out of people if you explain it well enough and tell such a story. So it went absolutely viral - not just in the United States, it spread all over the world. VEDANTAM: It might be hard to visualize this curve, but think about it this way. As Robert says, the government raises $0 in taxes where the taxation rate is zero but also when it is 100%. Think of what would happen if the tax rate was 1% or 99%. In both cases, the government would raise only a small amount of money. When it's 1%, a lot of people would go to work, but the government would get only a small portion of their income. When it's 99%, the government would also get very little because only a few people would work when 99 cents of every dollar are taken away from them. You can imagine the same dynamic playing out at other levels of taxation. The intuitive idea here is that there can be two levels of taxation that produce the same amount of revenue. If that's the case, you can make everyone happy by taxing people at a lower rate. SHILLER: You've got to give Art Laffer credit for that - seems obvious now. And it had big, profound effects. It was a big epidemic in the '70s and early '80s, but it's coming back now. Arthur Laffer is still there and he's still gloating in his great success. That was the best thing he ever did in terms of narrative quality. VEDANTAM: So is it true that Art Laffer himself has debunked the story about the napkin and the story with Don Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney in the restaurant in Washington? SHILLER: Well, the National Museum of American History in Washington was designing an exhibit on business history. And they had the idea that it would be good to get the napkin. And maybe - well, Jude Wanniski, the author of the story, had died. They called his widow and asked her, we're looking for a napkin with a diagram drawn on it. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). SHILLER: . . . Can you look around his things? And she - then she called back and said, yes, I found a napkin with a diagram. So she gave it to them and they proudly put it in their display. You can find it searching on the web. And they tell you it's - they tell you they're very proud to have this exhibit. But there is one problem with it. That a reporter later called Art Laffer and asked him about it and he said, I don't believe that story. He said, I don't remember writing on a napkin. And moreover, my mother taught me - it would be a cloth napkin at a fine restaurant. My mother taught me not to do such things. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) Well, I mean, what's fascinating, of course, is that's such a good story and it's such a fun story that it almost feels a pity to apply the facts to it and debunk it. SHILLER: And that applies to conversation, generally. Yeah. How many people actually fact-check their stories when they tell them? VEDANTAM: The Laffer curve is still being debated by economists. While the curve might make sense at the ends of the taxation spectrum, it might not describe what people do at realistic levels of taxation. Most governments aren't choosing between a tax rate of 10% and a tax rate of 90%. They're choosing between 25% and 30%. That means drawing implications from the Laffer curve might not make much sense. But in the 1980s, the story of the Laffer curve proved irresistible. Calls to reduce taxation were buttressed by other stories like this one from President Ronald Reagan. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RONALD REAGAN: They only know how many checks they're sending out. VEDANTAM: . . . To showcase wasteful government spending. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)REAGAN: In Chicago, they found a woman who holds the record. She used 80 names, 30 addresses, 15 telephone numbers to collect food stamps, Social Security, veterans benefits for four nonexistent deceased veterans husbands as well. . . VEDANTAM: So, Robert, tell me how Reagan's stories about so-called welfare queens intersected with these ideas from the Laffer curve and eventually changed federal policy. SHILLER: Yeah. Well, Reagan was a good storyteller by the way. So he had a great deal of power from that. That kind of story elicits anger, and anger is a strong emotion. But the problem with that story is it's not a statistic. It's just a - in fact, it's the record holder, so, I mean, there's only one like her. And - but storytellers don't care. They tell anomalous and rare events as if they're common. And if it's contagious like that, it generates fake news. VEDANTAM: You were talking a second ago about how President Reagan, in some ways, was a marvelous storyteller. One of his stories affected not just how individuals and companies act but perhaps even how nations act. He liked to tell a story about the failures of communism in Soviet Russia where people had to wait for years to get routine household services. In one joke he told to many audiences, he described a man who goes to buy a car and is told he has to wait for 10 years. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)REAGAN: But this man, he laid down his money and then the fellow who was - that was in charge said to him, OK, come back in 10 years and get your car. And he said, morning or afternoon? (LAUGHTER)REAGAN: And the fellow behind the counter said, well, 10 years from now, what difference does it make? And he said, well, the plumber's coming in the morning. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: And what is so effective here, Robert, is that Reagan is not saying explicitly communism doesn't work. That message is embedded inside the joke, and that's the power of the story. SHILLER: Yeah. And it also shows an example of the tendency for stories to go viral that are associated with a celebrity. The real author of that story is someone living in Russia, I suppose, who gets no credit for it. It really goes viral when it's connected with someone that we know. And that's just the way we are. Lots of famous quotes in history turn out not to have been first said by the famous person. The famous person was quoting somebody else that he doesn't care about. VEDANTAM: Yeah. And isn't it also the case that sometimes the stories might not even be true? I mean, we don't even know whether there actually was a specific person in the Soviet Union who came up with this. There have been questions raised about the welfare queen story that Reagan told, for example. And in some ways, once a story is traveling and it's embedded, the truth is often not sufficient to demolish it. SHILLER: Yes, and this is not a new problem. It goes way back. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: If you turn on the news these days, there is a powerful story that's in circulation that tells us that a long period of economic expansion is soon going to be over. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #6: Although things may look good for now, many Wall Street analysts are concerned about the warning signs ahead. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #7: Red recession warning light now flashing for the first time since 2007. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #8: As a key predictor of recession is now flashing. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #9: Bond markets once again flashing that ominous recession warning signal. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #10: The economy could be headed for turmoil. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)CHANG: Falling 800 points, losing 3% of its value. VEDANTAM: What do you tell people when they ask you to predict the next recession? And by the way, that's me indirectly asking you to predict the next recession. SHILLER: My feeling is that we are at a heightened risk of a recession and having a recession before the 2020 elections in the U. S. might might even be 50%. You'll see clear evidence of a recession coming. But I can't go above that. There will be another recession. We know that. But the other question that - people tend to talk about all or nothing. Will we or will we not have a recession? The question is if there is - another question, which I like to entertain, if there is a recession, is there a chance that it will develop into a severe recession? And I'm worried about that, even though I can't tell you precisely whether we'll be in a recession. And I think there are narratives today that might worsen a recession, notably the artificial intelligence narrative, which in an earlier form in the Great Depression really did heighten the impact of the Depression. We can see that again people becoming conservative in their expenditure because they're afraid of losing their jobs. It's already going on in some parts of the country, but it could become big. VEDANTAM: One point that Robert makes is that the veracity of economic narratives is not the point. Stories can invent their own reality. One example he gives is the narrative around Japan's Lost Decade, a period of economic stagnation during the 1990s and early 2000s. SHILLER: The Lost Decade story for Japan was particularly impactful since it followed the 1980s when Japan was considered the economic powerhouse of the world. People were saying that nobody can compete with Japan. They've pushed out Western makers of cameras, stereo equipment. They're hammering away at their sales of cars. There were books written back then about the Japanese miracle, and then suddenly it went sour in the 1990s. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering if President Donald Trump might be a fan of your book, whether or not he's actually read it, because he clearly also believes in the power of stories. Here he is talking down the risks of an impending recession. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't think we're having a recession. We're doing tremendously well. Our consumers are rich. I gave a tremendous tax cut. And they're loaded up with money. They're buying. I saw the Walmart numbers. They were through the roof just two days ago. That's better than any poll. That's better than any economist. VEDANTAM: So, Robert, given what you say about how talk can shape economic reality, is President Trump absolutely right to be spinning a positive story? SHILLER: Well, I wouldn't use the word absolutely right. That's a little strong. But he is having an impact, I believe. It's not just his current spinning of the story. He's written many books with co-authors. These books have advice to be like him. He tells you how he did it. He tells you, for example, don't be afraid to boast about yourself because, you know, people are maybe a little resentful about boasting people, but in the long run, they believe in them because they - if you don't boast, nobody will hear about your successes. This is Donald Trump talking. He's telling you to spread your personal narrative aggressively, and he's been doing that for himself for 50 years. And it's worked.

We begin today with a story of an economic bubble, or, to be more precise, a mania. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Foreign language spoken). VEDANTAM: This mania took place in Amsterdam in the 1630s. Picture a city of canals, elegant townhouses and a populace obsessed with one thing. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Foreign language spoken). VEDANTAM: . . . Tulips. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Foreign language spoken). ROBERT SHILLER: Amsterdam was the site of a big flowers market; it still is. People would trade tulips. And there were some tulips that were especially beautiful, they thought. And so people wanted those, and the price started going up. VEDANTAM: This is economist Robert Shiller. And when he says prices started going up, what he means is they started going up a lot. SHILLER: People were getting rich trading in tulips. One tulip would be the same value as a whole house. VEDANTAM: One tulip could hold as much value as a house. Now, historians say they've only found a few examples of this, but even more modestly priced tulips could sell for what would today be thousands of dollars. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Foreign language spoken). VEDANTAM: From a distance of nearly 400 years, the Dutch tulip mania of the 1630s might seem absurd, but the flowers were a way for the residents of Amsterdam to convey that they were cultured and influential. The tulips had great symbolic value. They told an amazing story. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This week on HIDDEN BRAIN - the powerful way in which stories and psychology shape our economic lives, how narratives affect not just the purchases we make as individuals but the fate of our entire economic system. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Most people think of the economy as following a set of fairly scientific principles. I buy more if things are cheap. I buy less if they're expensive. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: The nation's gross domestic product, or GDP, grew at a stronger than expected rate of 2 1/2%. VEDANTAM: Or say I run a company. I hire people if it looks like the economy is growing. I cut back if it looks like things are going to tank. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Delayed hiring, 4% accelerated hiring. You can see there mostly just going down. VEDANTAM: If I run the Federal Reserve, economic indicators tell me whether to raise or lower interest rates. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) AILSA CHANG: The central bank is cutting interest rates for the third time since July. VEDANTAM: It all looks very rational, very mathematical. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: But this picture neglects a fundamental aspect of economic life. We live in a world of stories. The stories that we tell in news reports, around the water cooler, in conversations with friends and family, these stories profoundly shape the trajectory of the economy. Economist Robert Shiller's new book explores this idea. It's called \"Narrative Economics. \" The winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize in economics, Robert Shiller says his interest in the relationship between stories and the economy goes all the way back to his early college days. He was an economics major, but he took a history course that examined the Great Depression. He was struck by the disconnect between the economic ideas he was learning about and the stories he read about how people behaved in the real world. SHILLER: People didn't sound like the people described in my economic theory. They seemed to be faddish and vulnerable to crazes and new ideas, and then they'd drop them and forget them. It just seemed like there was a note of reality that has been lost when we separate out departments. A history department has something to offer; so does the psych and sociology department, et cetera. But we tend to be - in academia, we tend to be polarized or more than polarized. We tend to compartmentalize. And I've, all my life ever since, thought that I wanted to read what these other people were saying as well as what my economist people are saying. VEDANTAM: Because, of course, they're all just different ways to understand the human condition, right? I mean, psychologists and anthropologists and sociologists and economists, I mean, they're all basically trying to understand why people do what they do. They're just using different tools. SHILLER: And political scientists. VEDANTAM: Yeah, yeah. SHILLER: Yeah. So we need all these perspectives. Don't be too compartmentalized. It may carry you for a while, but if you don't know what's happening in other realms of thought, you might miss the big picture. VEDANTAM: Robert says these realms of thought can help us decode things that otherwise seem puzzling about the economy. Take for example the story of a paper written by a mysterious mathematician in 2008. The author went by a pseudonym. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Satoshi Nakamoto. VEDANTAM: Satoshi Nakamoto. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Who is Satoshi Nakamoto? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Satoshi Nakamoto is a fake name for somebody. NEHA NARULA: He's a myth. I mean, he doesn't - no one knows who he is. Some people have claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, but we have not seen any definitive proof. ANDY COURT: When you ask about the creator - who created this? Who invented this? They must be a real genius. Everyone's like, we have no idea. VEDANTAM: The reason Satoshi Nakamoto created such a stir - this person, whose identity is still unknown, came up with a new type of currency - bitcoin. SHILLER: The first successful cryptocurrency. The story was that Nakamoto was able to invent a currency that could function without the help of any government, even against the opposition of any government. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Bitcoin emerged as the digital currency that in theory could not be manipulated by a central authority. SHILLER: And it would be smart, young, cosmopolitan people all over the world who would secure this decentralized system. It's a wonderful story and especially wonderful since nobody could figure out who Satoshi Nakamoto really was. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). SHILLER: He never - can't be found. No one has met him. How did he do that? That's an amazing story. VEDANTAM: Robert makes the case that bitcoin spread because it was a tale with surprise and intrigue. A genius mathematician invents a cryptocurrency and becomes a billionaire. It sounds like the plot of a movie. If I was making that movie, one subplot I would include is the story of the singer Lily Allen. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THE FEAR\") LILY ALLEN: (Singing) I want to be rich and I want lots of money. I don't care about clever. I don't care about funny. VEDANTAM: Lily Allen received an offer to get paid for a performance in bitcoin. SHILLER: She turned it down. That was the most momentous error you can imagine because she would be a billionaire if she had taken that bitcoin. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) And, you know, you hear the story and even if you don't know anything about cryptocurrencies, you ask yourself, am I missing out by not getting in on this? I mean, the story induces FOMO. SHILLER: That's exactly right, and that's a strong emotion, fear. It's regret theory. People are fearful of being regretful that they miss something. It hurts. You don't want to look forward to that pain in the future, so you might as well try. That's the thinking. VEDANTAM: What's astonishing is that the craze over bitcoin spread even though very few people actually understand what a cryptocurrency is or understand its underlying blockchain technology. But these terms very quickly became buzzwords. Here's comedian John Oliver on \"Last Week Tonight. \" (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LAST WEEK TONIGHT WITH JOHN OLIVER\") JOHN OLIVER: The problem is there is now enough excitement around the very word blockchain that it's become a magnet for investment. Reuters found that the existing companies that merely added the word blockchain to their name saw their stock price on average increase more than threefold. And one of them was particularly dumb. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Long Island Iced Tea renamed themselves Long Blockchain. And guess what happened. Yeah, their stock tripled. VEDANTAM: Robert, so you write at one point that the total value of bitcoin exceeded $300 billion, but bitcoin has no value unless people think it has value. So something that existed purely in people's heads went from being worth $0 to $300 billion? SHILLER: Yes, it can easily happen if the viral effect is strong enough. Now, bitcoin enthusiasts will say, well, what about gold? Gold has no real value. It's just a shiny metal that's pretty to look at. And yet it has tremendous value, and it has for thousands of years. But I have to say there are some differences. Gold is scarce - inherently scarce. Anybody can start a new cryptocurrency. Gold is in the Bible. It's mentioned over 300 times in the Holy Bible. VEDANTAM: You know, I was thinking about this as I was reading the book. You know, when I think about real money, obviously, real money, you know, has on many occasions bought me real things. But at some level, doesn't real money function a little bit like bitcoin in that it requires you and I to both agree that the notes that I have in my wallet have real value, that in some ways we both agree on the story of what the notes mean and the story is what gives the notes their power? SHILLER: That's right. That's - you've spoken just perfectly about narrative economics. I'll give you another example - banks. Why don't banks fail? All it takes is a story. If someone says the bank is going to be bankrupt soon, everybody will rush in and try to take their money out. And the banks can't - they don't have it on hand. They can't pay it out. So that's another example of how, yes, our whole banking system is built on a narrative. VEDANTAM: Yeah. Because at any given point, the bank might have enough money cash on hand to basically pay out, you know, five or 10% of what its total assets are. It's investing the rest of the money in other projects. So if everyone asks for their money back at the same time, the bank would simply not be able to deliver. SHILLER: And it happens, and it's supported by visual imagery. Photographers go to the bank, and they take a photograph of the big crowd clamoring to get in to get their money out. This has happened so many times that the FDIC - Federal Deposit Insurance Company - has a gallery of photos in one of their residences. And so it's become a narrative in itself that we have to watch out for that it doesn't come back. It's a perennial narrative. VEDANTAM: So bitcoin was not just a mysterious new scheme. It tapped into many deep and ancient narratives about ordinary people and elites, about anarchy, about populism. Talk to me about those larger themes that it tapped into. SHILLER: Well, there was a movement that began in the 19th century with the philosopher Proudhon called anarchism, which took an extreme statement that we don't need any government. If we just leave the people alone with no government, they will do much better. People are naturally inclined, many people, to anarchism, and so they're so happy to hear of bitcoin. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SHILLER: . . . Which was claimed can't be controlled by the government because bitcoin is for the whole world. It just sounds so enlightened and brilliant. VEDANTAM: And in some ways, if you feel like you are part of the large number of people who doesn't have power, who doesn't have a voice and you feel like powerful elites are running your life, as many people do, in some ways, bitcoin is - you know, it's sort of - you're throwing a rock against the edifice of the elites. You're basically fighting back in some ways. SHILLER: Right. And when you buy bitcoin, you feel like you're on the bright side of things. You're an owner of some of this fancy computer stuff in a sense. VEDANTAM: Yeah. SHILLER: And you're part of it. VEDANTAM: Yeah, you're one of the disruptors; you're not the ones being disrupted. SHILLER: That's the hope that it gives you. Yes. VEDANTAM: Robert says these underlying currents help explain why a story like bitcoin took off. If psychology and sociology explain the origins of economic fads, Robert draws in ideas from another field - medicine - to understand how such fads spread and when they die. Stories, he says, function like viruses or parasites. They spread only when they have a receptive host. SHILLER: It is really important to understand that things that are popular are the result of contagion. There is a contagion rate which varies through time. There's also a recovery rate - how soon people forget about the narrative. This is just straight out of medical epidemiology. The contagion rate has to be higher than the recovery rate and then the epidemic will take off. It'll start small, but it will get bigger and bigger until the contagion rate falls down below the recovery rate, and then it starts to recede. It's mysterious because we don't normally think about the contagion rate and the recovery rate for stories. But that, in fact, are basic parameters that explain when they get strong and when they fade away. VEDANTAM: And, of course, for the people who haven't invested in bitcoin, who didn't get in on the craze, you know, those people might listen to this and say, hang on a second, I wasn't affected by the story. But in some ways, that's not different from an epidemic. Not everyone falls sick when an epidemic is raging. SHILLER: Yeah. So if you have not invested in bitcoin, that's not necessarily a sign of your common sense. It's just that you never encountered a contagious person who is spreading the word. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Bitcoin is a single story. When we come back, Robert Shiller makes the case that narrative economics can explain larger phenomena, including shifts in the entire economy. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Robert, in your book, you write, when we choose to tell a story to others, we base that choice on our perceptions of how people will react to that story in their own minds. We will likely spread a story, whether it is a story about boom-time thinking or about economic despair, if we think that others will like the story enough to want to spread it further. Talk about this idea that part of the reason stories spread - and some stories spread more than others - is that we are actually, each of us, gauging whether if we tell the story to somebody else, they, in turn, would want to pass it on. SHILLER: Right. It's what psychologists call theory of mind. That is, we are always thinking about what we imagine other people are thinking. That's because understanding other people's thinking is very important for success in human society. People enjoy conversation. It's part of our species. It's everywhere in the world. Everywhere you go, you'll see people standing facing each other engaged in conversation. And if you get a translation of what they're saying, they're telling stories (laughter). And people, when they hear a story, they turn it over in their mind and say, maybe I could use this story in another conversation. So people evaluate them based on their apparent success in motivating other people. So yeah, it's as if people are all trying to go viral. It's not a new thing with the Internet. They were going viral thousands of years ago. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Nearly a century ago, a powerful story swept the country. It's a story that has echoes in our own time, and the lessons from history are instructive. In the 1920s and '30s, many people feared that technological innovations were going to disrupt the economy and put lots of people out of work. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: For the majority, it means the interminable line outside factory gates, desperately hoping for a job that rarely comes. SHILLER: It explains some things that got out of hand and bad. The Great Depression of the 1930s came shortly after the term technological unemployment became popular in the late 1920s about machines replacing jobs. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #5: Machines replaced hands. New machines replaced old machines. New inventions - the electric light, automobile, telephone - started as luxuries, then, as they were made better and cheaper, became commonplace. SHILLER: And when the unemployment rate got high after 1930, people started to think, this is it. It's robots replacing our jobs. And you may think, it's pretty strange that people thought about robots in 1930. That sounds like long before they had computers. But they did think they had robots. I'll give you an example of what they called a robot. (SOUNDBITE OF ROTARY PHONE DIAL SPINNING) SHILLER: It's the dial telephone. Before that when you picked up a phone, there was no dial, no keypad. You had to just - there was an operator there and it would say, number, please. UNIDENTIFIED OPERATOR: Number, please. SHILLER: They replaced that operator with a machine. That's called a robot. And it scared people then. And they thought that, maybe we better fall back and save some more money. When everybody does that, it makes the depression worse. VEDANTAM: So one of the interesting points you make is that stories vanish and resurface, like the story you were just telling about technological innovation displacing workers. And sometimes these stories vanish and come back over decades or even centuries. And that really is analogous to what happens with pathogens that go dormant and then they reemerge sometimes decades later as epidemics. SHILLER: That's right. And a pathogen can reemerge because of a mutation. Like, influenza mutates quite regularly, and we have to get inoculated imperfectly against those mutations. Or it can change because of some change in our practices. If there's some event that brings people closer together in an enclosed space, it can spread much more rapidly and the contagion rate goes up. So these are fundamental lessons that I don't hear very often from most economists. They don't talk in these terms, and they don't see the causal impact from narratives to the economy. VEDANTAM: So it's interesting. When we think about stories - and if you draw the analogy with pathogens, perhaps then modifications to stories or tweaks in an underlying story might be necessary for a dormant story to come back and become dominant again. SHILLER: Yes. And so sometimes the tweaks are just frivolous sounding. I'll give an example from my book. The idea of trickle-down economics where you cut taxes on the rich on the theory that they will raise GDP and, ultimately, enrich the poorer people was starting to look pretty old by the 1970s. But then a new narrative appeared that was really written by a writer Jude Wanniski about the Laffer curve. And it was basically the same theory that if you cut taxes, GDP will go up and tax revenues will even go up. You just have to cut taxes. That was a lovely story, and it was embellished by details, visual images. Like, it was said that Arthur Laffer, the economist, presented his idea - new idea about taxes in the form of a diagram which he drew on a napkin at a fancy restaurant with Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and future Vice President Dick Cheney. Putting these names at a visual image of a diagram drawn on a napkin was all that that narrative needed to get epidemic again. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). SHILLER: And that led to, I would say, Margaret Thatcher's ascendance to the prime minister in Britain in '79 and then Ronald Reagan, president of the United States - both tax cutters. VEDANTAM: So the diagram drawn on that napkin eventually came to be called the Laffer curve. Explain what that curve is. Explain what the very simple intuition is behind that curve that eventually led to fairly significant policy changes on both sides of the Atlantic. SHILLER: Yeah. It's almost - the Laffer curve story, it's almost like a joke with a punchline. So what Laffer said is, if we have a 0% tax rate on incomes, how much will we collect? Zero, obviously. But what if we have a 100% tax rate on incomes, what will we collect? Well, it'll be zero again because nobody's going to work if the government takes all of it. So in between, the revenue has to be positive. So connect the dots and you have a hump-shaped curve. That means that to raise any given amount of revenue, there are always two tax rates - a low one and a high one. You can picture that on my diagram, which I'm asking you to make a mental image of. And so that's a new idea. Nobody has been talking about two tax rates to raise the same revenue. It's clever. It's like a - it's a stunt, a trick. It's a magic trick. It's fun. You can have - you'll know that you'll get a rise out of people if you explain it well enough and tell such a story. So it went absolutely viral - not just in the United States, it spread all over the world. VEDANTAM: It might be hard to visualize this curve, but think about it this way. As Robert says, the government raises $0 in taxes where the taxation rate is zero but also when it is 100%. Think of what would happen if the tax rate was 1% or 99%. In both cases, the government would raise only a small amount of money. When it's 1%, a lot of people would go to work, but the government would get only a small portion of their income. When it's 99%, the government would also get very little because only a few people would work when 99 cents of every dollar are taken away from them. You can imagine the same dynamic playing out at other levels of taxation. The intuitive idea here is that there can be two levels of taxation that produce the same amount of revenue. If that's the case, you can make everyone happy by taxing people at a lower rate. SHILLER: You've got to give Art Laffer credit for that - seems obvious now. And it had big, profound effects. It was a big epidemic in the '70s and early '80s, but it's coming back now. Arthur Laffer is still there and he's still gloating in his great success. That was the best thing he ever did in terms of narrative quality. VEDANTAM: So is it true that Art Laffer himself has debunked the story about the napkin and the story with Don Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney in the restaurant in Washington? SHILLER: Well, the National Museum of American History in Washington was designing an exhibit on business history. And they had the idea that it would be good to get the napkin. And maybe - well, Jude Wanniski, the author of the story, had died. They called his widow and asked her, we're looking for a napkin with a diagram drawn on it. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). SHILLER: . . . Can you look around his things? And she - then she called back and said, yes, I found a napkin with a diagram. So she gave it to them and they proudly put it in their display. You can find it searching on the web. And they tell you it's - they tell you they're very proud to have this exhibit. But there is one problem with it. That a reporter later called Art Laffer and asked him about it and he said, I don't believe that story. He said, I don't remember writing on a napkin. And moreover, my mother taught me - it would be a cloth napkin at a fine restaurant. My mother taught me not to do such things. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) Well, I mean, what's fascinating, of course, is that's such a good story and it's such a fun story that it almost feels a pity to apply the facts to it and debunk it. SHILLER: And that applies to conversation, generally. Yeah. How many people actually fact-check their stories when they tell them? VEDANTAM: The Laffer curve is still being debated by economists. While the curve might make sense at the ends of the taxation spectrum, it might not describe what people do at realistic levels of taxation. Most governments aren't choosing between a tax rate of 10% and a tax rate of 90%. They're choosing between 25% and 30%. That means drawing implications from the Laffer curve might not make much sense. But in the 1980s, the story of the Laffer curve proved irresistible. Calls to reduce taxation were buttressed by other stories like this one from President Ronald Reagan. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RONALD REAGAN: They only know how many checks they're sending out. VEDANTAM: . . . To showcase wasteful government spending. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) REAGAN: In Chicago, they found a woman who holds the record. She used 80 names, 30 addresses, 15 telephone numbers to collect food stamps, Social Security, veterans benefits for four nonexistent deceased veterans husbands as well. . . VEDANTAM: So, Robert, tell me how Reagan's stories about so-called welfare queens intersected with these ideas from the Laffer curve and eventually changed federal policy. SHILLER: Yeah. Well, Reagan was a good storyteller by the way. So he had a great deal of power from that. That kind of story elicits anger, and anger is a strong emotion. But the problem with that story is it's not a statistic. It's just a - in fact, it's the record holder, so, I mean, there's only one like her. And - but storytellers don't care. They tell anomalous and rare events as if they're common. And if it's contagious like that, it generates fake news. VEDANTAM: You were talking a second ago about how President Reagan, in some ways, was a marvelous storyteller. One of his stories affected not just how individuals and companies act but perhaps even how nations act. He liked to tell a story about the failures of communism in Soviet Russia where people had to wait for years to get routine household services. In one joke he told to many audiences, he described a man who goes to buy a car and is told he has to wait for 10 years. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) REAGAN: But this man, he laid down his money and then the fellow who was - that was in charge said to him, OK, come back in 10 years and get your car. And he said, morning or afternoon? (LAUGHTER) REAGAN: And the fellow behind the counter said, well, 10 years from now, what difference does it make? And he said, well, the plumber's coming in the morning. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: And what is so effective here, Robert, is that Reagan is not saying explicitly communism doesn't work. That message is embedded inside the joke, and that's the power of the story. SHILLER: Yeah. And it also shows an example of the tendency for stories to go viral that are associated with a celebrity. The real author of that story is someone living in Russia, I suppose, who gets no credit for it. It really goes viral when it's connected with someone that we know. And that's just the way we are. Lots of famous quotes in history turn out not to have been first said by the famous person. The famous person was quoting somebody else that he doesn't care about. VEDANTAM: Yeah. And isn't it also the case that sometimes the stories might not even be true? I mean, we don't even know whether there actually was a specific person in the Soviet Union who came up with this. There have been questions raised about the welfare queen story that Reagan told, for example. And in some ways, once a story is traveling and it's embedded, the truth is often not sufficient to demolish it. SHILLER: Yes, and this is not a new problem. It goes way back. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: If you turn on the news these days, there is a powerful story that's in circulation that tells us that a long period of economic expansion is soon going to be over. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #6: Although things may look good for now, many Wall Street analysts are concerned about the warning signs ahead. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #7: Red recession warning light now flashing for the first time since 2007. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #8: As a key predictor of recession is now flashing. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #9: Bond markets once again flashing that ominous recession warning signal. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #10: The economy could be headed for turmoil. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) CHANG: Falling 800 points, losing 3% of its value. VEDANTAM: What do you tell people when they ask you to predict the next recession? And by the way, that's me indirectly asking you to predict the next recession. SHILLER: My feeling is that we are at a heightened risk of a recession and having a recession before the 2020 elections in the U. S. might might even be 50%. You'll see clear evidence of a recession coming. But I can't go above that. There will be another recession. We know that. But the other question that - people tend to talk about all or nothing. Will we or will we not have a recession? The question is if there is - another question, which I like to entertain, if there is a recession, is there a chance that it will develop into a severe recession? And I'm worried about that, even though I can't tell you precisely whether we'll be in a recession. And I think there are narratives today that might worsen a recession, notably the artificial intelligence narrative, which in an earlier form in the Great Depression really did heighten the impact of the Depression. We can see that again people becoming conservative in their expenditure because they're afraid of losing their jobs. It's already going on in some parts of the country, but it could become big. VEDANTAM: One point that Robert makes is that the veracity of economic narratives is not the point. Stories can invent their own reality. One example he gives is the narrative around Japan's Lost Decade, a period of economic stagnation during the 1990s and early 2000s. SHILLER: The Lost Decade story for Japan was particularly impactful since it followed the 1980s when Japan was considered the economic powerhouse of the world. People were saying that nobody can compete with Japan. They've pushed out Western makers of cameras, stereo equipment. They're hammering away at their sales of cars. There were books written back then about the Japanese miracle, and then suddenly it went sour in the 1990s. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering if President Donald Trump might be a fan of your book, whether or not he's actually read it, because he clearly also believes in the power of stories. Here he is talking down the risks of an impending recession. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't think we're having a recession. We're doing tremendously well. Our consumers are rich. I gave a tremendous tax cut. And they're loaded up with money. They're buying. I saw the Walmart numbers. They were through the roof just two days ago. That's better than any poll. That's better than any economist. VEDANTAM: So, Robert, given what you say about how talk can shape economic reality, is President Trump absolutely right to be spinning a positive story? SHILLER: Well, I wouldn't use the word absolutely right. That's a little strong. But he is having an impact, I believe. It's not just his current spinning of the story. He's written many books with co-authors. These books have advice to be like him. He tells you how he did it. He tells you, for example, don't be afraid to boast about yourself because, you know, people are maybe a little resentful about boasting people, but in the long run, they believe in them because they - if you don't boast, nobody will hear about your successes. This is Donald Trump talking. He's telling you to spread your personal narrative aggressively, and he's been doing that for himself for 50 years. And it's worked.

The company says the result was a big spike in productivity. Joining me to talk about it is NPR's Bill Chappell. Hi, Bill. BILL CHAPPELL, BYLINE: Hello. KELLY: How did this work exactly? CHAPPELL: Well, Microsoft's division in Japan gave about 2,300 employees every Friday off last August. The company says its productivity went up 40%. KELLY: Forty percent for working one fewer day - OK, go on. CHAPPELL: And electricity costs fell by 23%. So they saw gains in a lot of different ways - efficiency and productivity. KELLY: And they tried some other things. What else were they doing to make this work? CHAPPELL: They kind of went on a time diet. They said all the meetings have to be shorter. They need to be 30 minutes not an hour. No meetings should have more than five employees. And they actually said people should get in touch with each other directly and not use what they called wasteful emails and meetings. KELLY: All right, I'm loving this so far. I'm abandoning journalistic neutrality (laughter). CHAPPELL: (Laughter) Yes, right. KELLY: I'm in. Are they going to roll this out on a wider basis? CHAPPELL: Well, when I asked Microsoft about that, a spokesperson got back and said, you know, this is a pilot project, not to get too excited and for Microsoft employees not to get too excited. They said they are interested in some of these changes, but it's still at the pilot phase. KELLY: What is the takeaway for other workplaces? CHAPPELL: You know, I talked to workplace analyst Dan Schawbel. And he says for the time being in the U. S. , employees are more likely to focus on a perk that we all might know more about. It's flexibility in their schedules. DAN SCHAWBEL: Younger people actually choose work flexibility over health care coverage, even though that expense in America is pretty high. KELLY: So, Bill, what is the downside to this? Why shouldn't every company be trying this? CHAPPELL: Well, I mean, you could say they - maybe they should try it, but there are huge cultural barriers to this. I mean, in Japan and in the U. S. , where people are known for their really intense workplace culture of putting in a lot of hours, the idea of idling people for an extra day just might not be a good look. When Dan Schawbel spoke to some HR department heads recently at a conference, he said his only real pushback that he heard was people saying, you know, what if people don't take the same day off? KELLY: About predictability and being able to reach your co-workers. CHAPPELL: Yeah. KELLY: Are there other places, though, experimenting with ideas along these lines? CHAPPELL: Well, I mean, this made big news last year when a company in New Zealand called Perpetual Guardian saw their productivity go up 20% when they tried a trial like this. And in the U. K. , the Labor Party just recently made the 40 workweek part of its official platform. So I mean, backers are saying the workweek had been shrinking since the 1860s.

NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Anyone hoping for a clear signal about the direction of U. S. -China trade talks didn't get much this afternoon from President Trump. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're close. A significant phase one trade deal with China could happen - could happen soon. But we will only accept a deal if it's good for the United States and our workers and our great companies. HORSLEY: It's been a month since the U. S. and China announced a handshake agreement, but nailing down the details has proven difficult. Trump, who fancies himself a master dealmaker, continues to insist he has the upper hand in negotiations and that China needs a deal more than he does. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Their supply chains are cracking very badly, and they are dying to make a deal. We're the ones that are deciding whether or not we want to make a deal. HORSLEY: Of course, it's Trump not Chinese President Xi Jinping who has to campaign for reelection next year. Trump's speech today was a sort of dress rehearsal for the economic piece of that campaign. In an effort to command the spotlight, Trump painted a dark picture of the economy he inherited almost three years ago. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: At that time, America was stuck in a failed recovery and saddled with a bleak economic future. And it was bleak. HORSLEY: In fact, job growth in the last 33 months of the Obama administration was stronger than it's been in the first 33 months of the Trump administration. GDP growth did accelerate last year, but that sugar high has quickly worn off. And while the unemployment rate is close to a 50-year low, Trump's boast of exceeding economic expectations got only tepid applause from his New York audience.

Meanwhile, the president's own trade policies have cast a shadow over the economy. John Hess, who runs a big oil and chemical company, pressed Trump during his New York appearance about the price tag of those tariffs. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHN HESS: There's a growing consensus that the trade war has a cost. A number of industrial sectors have recently been hurt. HORSLEY: Manufacturing has been in a slump for the last three months. Farm exports have taken a beating. China shows little sign of giving ground on the practices that sparked the trade war, such as intellectual property theft. But Trump insists it's all been worth it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: The real cost, John, would be if we did nothing. HORSLEY: There's also a political cost. New research suggests the trade war cost Trump's fellow Republicans as many as five House seats in last year's midterm elections. Dartmouth economist Emily Blanchard and her colleagues found GOP candidates lost support in parts of the country hurt by retaliatory tariffs. What's more, they got no offsetting benefit in areas where Trump's tariffs might have given a boost to local industries. EMILY BLANCHARD: It was all pain and no gain, and we were sort of surprised by this. HORSLEY: Blanchard says the hit to Republicans was strongest in the most competitive districts, where opposition to the trade war rivaled health care as a politically powerful issue.

The S&P 500 hit another record high this week. It's up almost 25% for the year. But - but - the S&P is index of oil and gas stocks is down more than 20%. It's a sign of trouble for this country's oil industry. Darius Rafieyan has the story. DARIUS RAFIEYAN, BYLINE: Some of the most successful companies in the oil business are household names - think Exxon Mobil or Chevron. But the boom in shale drilling that has helped turn the U. S. into the world's largest oil producer, that has been driven by smaller, independent operators, companies that have pushed the limits of drilling technology and taken big risks on unproven oil fields. Today, shale accounts for about two-thirds of U. S. oil production and nearly all of the industry's growth. But many of the companies that made that growth possible are now struggling to stay afloat. David Deckelbaum, an analyst at investment bank Cowen, says that has a lot to do with the business model of U. S. shale. DAVID DECKELBAUM: This is an industry that, you know, for every dollar that they brought in, they would spend two. RAFIEYAN: For years, operators focused on drilling lots of new wells very fast, prioritizing explosive growth over profitability. And until now, they've been able to rely on deep-pocketed investors who were willing to pour fresh capital into the industry despite years of lackluster returns. It's a story that may be familiar to anyone who's been following the tech industry in recent years. Deckelbaum compares it to a kind of prospector mentality. DECKELBAUM: There's a lot of romance, I think, because there's always this idea of this brand-new play that's going to have billions of barrels of upside. And if, you know, you can just get in early, then it'll pay off in the long run. RAFIEYAN: Of course, oil has always been a boom-and-bust industry. In 2014, for instance, a catastrophic price crash left the industry reeling. But even then, billions in new investment flowed into U. S. shale. Today, shrinking global demand for oil is driving the price down once again. What's different this time around? Investors no longer seem willing to write the industry a blank check. DECKELBAUM: I think now you've seen a lot of pressure of, we want you to be a real business. Your cost structure is too high. You have too much debt. I'm not funding your drilling anymore with external capital. You have to live within your own means. RAFIEYAN: Without access to fresh cash, many producers are pulling back on new exploration. The number of rigs drilling for new oil is at its lowest point in two years. That's bad news for people like Ron Fountain, who works on a drilling rig in the Bakken shale of North Dakota. He thinks back to a few years ago when the price of oil was over $100 a barrel, and companies were drilling with abandon. RON FOUNTAIN: That's when we were still booming. There was rigs coming out every month. We couldn't keep up, there was so much work going on. RAFIEYAN: Today, though, with more and more rigs sitting idle, life has become uncertain for Fountain and his fellow drillers. FOUNTAIN: We went from having, you know, a three-year contract to well-to-well contracts, which means you drill one hole. And if you did a good job, then they'll give you another one, or they drop you, and you've got to figure it out from there. RAFIEYAN: And he's not the only one feeling the pinch. Halliburton, one of the biggest players in U. S. shale drilling, has laid off nearly 3,000 workers. In the Permian Basin, the country's most prolific oil field, employment has almost completely stalled out. That's after growing more than 11% last year. Meanwhile, many of the smaller producers who loaded up on debt are struggling to pay it back, leading to a wave of bankruptcies, more than three dozen so far this year. All of this is adding up to slower oil output. Data from the Department of Energy shows that production was flat in the first half of 2019 after growing more than 20% last year. In theory, as production slows and supply shrinks, the price of oil should go back up, which could provide a much-needed boost. The question, says Ron Fountain, is how many companies will be able to survive until then. FOUNTAIN: I think, as an industry, we're going to be OK. But I think there's a lot of people that are kind of holding their breath. RAFIEYAN: Darius Rafieyan, NPR News, Washington. NOEL KING, HOST:  All right. The S&P 500 hit another record high this week. It's up almost 25% for the year. But - but - the S&P is index of oil and gas stocks is down more than 20%. It's a sign of trouble for this country's oil industry. Darius Rafieyan has the story. DARIUS RAFIEYAN, BYLINE: Some of the most successful companies in the oil business are household names - think Exxon Mobil or Chevron. But the boom in shale drilling that has helped turn the U. S. into the world's largest oil producer, that has been driven by smaller, independent operators, companies that have pushed the limits of drilling technology and taken big risks on unproven oil fields. Today, shale accounts for about two-thirds of U. S. oil production and nearly all of the industry's growth. But many of the companies that made that growth possible are now struggling to stay afloat. David Deckelbaum, an analyst at investment bank Cowen, says that has a lot to do with the business model of U. S. shale. DAVID DECKELBAUM: This is an industry that, you know, for every dollar that they brought in, they would spend two. RAFIEYAN: For years, operators focused on drilling lots of new wells very fast, prioritizing explosive growth over profitability. And until now, they've been able to rely on deep-pocketed investors who were willing to pour fresh capital into the industry despite years of lackluster returns. It's a story that may be familiar to anyone who's been following the tech industry in recent years. Deckelbaum compares it to a kind of prospector mentality. DECKELBAUM: There's a lot of romance, I think, because there's always this idea of this brand-new play that's going to have billions of barrels of upside. And if, you know, you can just get in early, then it'll pay off in the long run. RAFIEYAN: Of course, oil has always been a boom-and-bust industry. In 2014, for instance, a catastrophic price crash left the industry reeling. But even then, billions in new investment flowed into U. S. shale. Today, shrinking global demand for oil is driving the price down once again. What's different this time around? Investors no longer seem willing to write the industry a blank check. DECKELBAUM: I think now you've seen a lot of pressure of, we want you to be a real business. Your cost structure is too high. You have too much debt. I'm not funding your drilling anymore with external capital. You have to live within your own means. RAFIEYAN: Without access to fresh cash, many producers are pulling back on new exploration. The number of rigs drilling for new oil is at its lowest point in two years. That's bad news for people like Ron Fountain, who works on a drilling rig in the Bakken shale of North Dakota. He thinks back to a few years ago when the price of oil was over $100 a barrel, and companies were drilling with abandon. RON FOUNTAIN: That's when we were still booming. There was rigs coming out every month. We couldn't keep up, there was so much work going on. RAFIEYAN: Today, though, with more and more rigs sitting idle, life has become uncertain for Fountain and his fellow drillers. FOUNTAIN: We went from having, you know, a three-year contract to well-to-well contracts, which means you drill one hole. And if you did a good job, then they'll give you another one, or they drop you, and you've got to figure it out from there. RAFIEYAN: And he's not the only one feeling the pinch.

HORSLEY: Now it's actually a pretty limited trade agreement that's being discussed at this point, but this is typical of Trump's very transactional approach to foreign policy, where he's less interested in promoting democracy or high-minded idealism and more focused on the deal. SHAPIRO: Why, after months of protests in Hong Kong, did Congress pass this bill? And it was such an overwhelming margin. HORSLEY: Yeah, it really was. It was unanimous in the Senate.

Congress is really trying to show support for Hong Kong's pro-democracy demonstrators.

Under this bill, the State Department would have to report each year on whether China's measuring up to those promises. And if it's not, Hong Kong could be stripped of its special trading status. The bill also authorizes the president to impose sanctions against Chinese officials for any harsh crackdown on Hong Kong protesters. But in both cases, the administration would have some discretion to cut China some slack if it wanted to. SHAPIRO: Over these last six months, the people in Hong Kong have been protesting. What, if anything, has President Trump said about China's reaction to these protests and the protests themselves? HORSLEY: He's been pretty quiet on the subject, at least in public. Trump rarely criticizes authoritarian governments. Instead, it has fallen to Vice President Pence to play the bad cop here and deliver warnings to Beijing. In his interview with Fox News, though, Trump did claim credit for discouraging a tougher crackdown on the demonstrators. He says that's a tribute to his relationship with President Xi.

HORSLEY: Meanwhile, the trade talks continue to grind along in low gear. And the clock is ticking, Ari. Unless there's a deal in about three weeks, the U.

This week, the Census Bureau released new data that shows that fewer than 10% of Americans moved this year. That is the lowest percentage since the census started collecting this information in the 1940s. To help us better understand what this means, we've called on demographer William Frey. He's a senior fellow in the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. It's a research institute here in Washington, D. C. He's with us from their studios. Mr. Frey, welcome back to the program. Thanks so much for joining us. WILLIAM FREY: Oh, good to be with you, Michel. MARTIN: So let's start with the basics. This data is mostly about people moving within the country. Why is that that important thing to keep track of? FREY: Well, it's a measure of how mobile we are, how much robustness we have in our economy. People think of a country that has a lot of mobility is where the economy is booming along, and people are following those jobs or getting new houses. Doesn't directly measure economics, but it's an indirect measure of how well we're doing, I guess. And here in the United States, we've always been thought of as a very mobile nation compared to countries around the world. MARTIN: And the big takeaway here is that this is the lowest migration rate since the end of World War II. Why? FREY: You know, that's a pretty good question. I mean, we need to look at it in perspective. There's been a gradual but consistent decline in migration in the United States, really since the late 1940s. The 1950s and 1960s, we had a robust economy. We had a lot of consumerism. We had a younger population. And all of that goes hand in hand with migration. And so about a fifth of the population moved every year back in the 1950s and early 1960s. And as we got into the '70s and into the '80s, the migration rate went down sort of gradually but consistently over time. Households became dual-earner households. When you have two people working, it's hard to sort of everybody pick up stakes. The population got older. Older people don't move as much as younger people, so that helped to bring the rates down. And the labor markets around the country became a little bit more homogeneous, so you could probably find a job locally where you wouldn't have to move very long distances. So that - kind of all those kind of gradual explanations continued. But then we had the Great Recession in 2007, and coupled with a housing bust - the movement rates are going down anyway, but both of those things helped to put the damper even further on the movement rates, especially for young people, millennials. The first millennial turned age 27 in 2007 - the first year of the recession. So as that group moved in and beyond those ages - ages where you would buy homes where you would start families, where you would have children - they were putting all of that stuff off, and the migration rates came down as well. So there has been a continued movement downward, especially for local moves. And that's where we're down to 9. 8% compared to 20% in the 1950s and 1960s. MARTIN: Well, you were telling me, though, that you keep expecting the numbers to tick back up, and they never do. And the reason that this is striking is that, you know, the recession has been over - at least, according to, you know, the numbers - for quite some time now. So why do you think it is that the numbers still haven't changed? FREY: You know, I think that's a very good question, and there are a lot of smart people trying to figure out the answer to that (laughter). But my view of it as a demographer is that these millennials, you know, are reaching a stage where they are making these decisions about having kids and getting married. They're not going to be single and living in their parents' basements forever. And as the economy is getting better, we may not go back to the '50s level of migration but maybe to like the early 2000s (laughter) - instead of 9. 8%, maybe 12% a year or something like that. That hasn't happened, and that's what surprised me. Some of these other indicators show that they're doing a little better on these other economic measures and family measures, but not on this migration. And so that's, I think, a little bit of a puzzle. MARTIN: I take it that you think this is a worrisome sign - that if fewer people are moving within the United States, that that's sort of an indicator of sort of a lack of dynamism. But I wonder whether it speaks to something else - that people feel that they're valuing other things. FREY: Well, it could very well be. I mean, maybe because this migration rate has continued to go down over time and now is kind of stuck at even lower levels, it may be just the new normal. I mean (laughter), as young people get into their 20s and so forth, which are the - typically the high-migration years, you know, they're a little more resistant to make those kinds of moves, and they're happy where they're living now. Even though they might be able to find a job somewhere else that might pay a little bit more, they're maybe not as prone to take advantage of those decisions. I'm still not giving up on the idea that migration's going to tick up a little bit again. But there's the other issue sort of maybe broader look down the road - is that people may not move as much for jobs. I mean, they may telecommute more than they did in the past. The kinds of jobs that may be available to people, they can do at home. And that may change in the future, too. So it's possible we're moving to a new normal. But I think this has gone down so strongly that I'm expecting a little bit of an uptick in the next couple of years. I still haven't given up hope on that. MARTIN: That is demographer William Frey. He's a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Mr. Frey, thanks so much for talking to us. FREY: Sure. I enjoyed it.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ELIZABETH WARREN: Our housing problem in America is a problem on the supply side. And that means that the federal government stopped building new housing a long time ago, affordable housing. SIMON: That's Senator Elizabeth Warren, of course. Democrats spent several minutes debating housing affordability and what they might do about it. Nobel laureate economist Robert Shiller joins us. He's co-creator of the widely used Case Shiller Home Price Index. He's been studying housing for decades. Professor, thanks so much for being with us. ROBERT SHILLER: My pleasure. SIMON: Housing affordability is a big issue in many major cities certainly, but is it just in high-tech commercial centers like Boston, San Francisco and New York? SHILLER: It is especially in the high-tech centers. But overall for the whole country, it's getting worse, gradually through time. SIMON: What are some of the factors that have made housing more difficult for many people to afford in this country? SHILLER: For buyers, we've seen a home price boom since 2012, which has pushed home prices up quite a bit. For renters, rents have gone up kind of steadily and smoothly, not as much as home prices. But the wages haven't kept up that they earn to pay the rent. So in either case, there is some suggestion of a problem. SIMON: During the debate this week, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said gentrification was a problem and it puts many low-income workers a lot farther away from where they earn a living. Here's what he suggests. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CORY BOOKER: And my plan is very simple. If you're a renter who pays more than a third of your income in rent, then you will get a refundable tax credit between the amount you're paying in the area median rent. That empowers people in the same way we empower homeowners. SIMON: Of course, the government gives homeowners a mortgage interest deduction. But what about specifically Senator Booker's idea about a refundable tax credit? How do you feel about that? SHILLER: Well, we already have refundable Earned Income Tax Credit. This is tying it to the price of housing. People who live in cities where rent and home prices are heavily pushed up by zoning regulations that try to keep people out, they deserve some compensation. SIMON: And what about the argument that some people have made that landlords would simply charge more money because they know they could get it from a government guaranteed program? SHILLER: There is some truth to that. But on the other hand, if people are actually paying more in rent, that encourages a supply increase. SIMON: Another bit from the debate here we want to play, something here from Senator Elizabeth Warren. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)WARREN: So I've got a plan for 3. 2 million new housing units in America. Those are housing units for working families, for the working poor, for the poor poor. Housing is how we build wealth in America. SIMON: Senator Warren didn't have a chance to say this in the debate, but she has a plan on her website that calls for $500 billion in federal housing investment over the next 10 years. Does that strike you as wise? SHILLER: If she has 3 million new units, that will make a 1 or 2% increase in the housing stock. And it will deal with the problem somewhat. It sounds to me - right - that we should aim for doing something like that, at least. SIMON: Now the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson has had a proposal that would look at using federal funds to try and induce cities to overhaul zoning rules, which he says could lead to the construction of affordable homes. Does that strike you as a good idea? SHILLER: Yeah, something like that. Part of the reason prices are elevated is that local zoning boards are deliberately trying to keep people out that don't meet up to their standards. On the other hand, we do have to preserve zoning restrictions because you don't want a coal-burning burning power plant right next door to your house. SIMON: You've been looking at housing markets for so many decades now. Could you name any one, two or three policies you think could help immediately? SHILLER: Well, one thing that I've been working on over the years is redesigning mortgages to help prevent the disaster of foreclosure and mortgages that have a automatic workout attached to them if home prices fall. Another thing that comes to my mind is the home equity insurance that was first issued by Oak Park, Ill. , in the 1970s. It was a program to protect homeowners against declining home prices, which often destroy neighborhoods. And I think there's a lesson there. SIMON: Nobel laureate Robert Shiller, Sterling professor of economics at Yale. Thanks so much for being with us, sir. SHILLER: My pleasure. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  This week's Democratic presidential debate touched on a topic that usually doesn't get much attention in these forums. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ELIZABETH WARREN: Our housing problem in America is a problem on the supply side. And that means that the federal government stopped building new housing a long time ago, affordable housing. SIMON: That's Senator Elizabeth Warren, of course. Democrats spent several minutes debating housing affordability and what they might do about it. Nobel laureate economist Robert Shiller joins us. He's co-creator of the widely used Case Shiller Home Price Index. He's been studying housing for decades. Professor, thanks so much for being with us. ROBERT SHILLER: My pleasure. SIMON: Housing affordability is a big issue in many major cities certainly, but is it just in high-tech commercial centers like Boston, San Francisco and New York? SHILLER: It is especially in the high-tech centers. But overall for the whole country, it's getting worse, gradually through time. SIMON: What are some of the factors that have made housing more difficult for many people to afford in this country? SHILLER: For buyers, we've seen a home price boom since 2012, which has pushed home prices up quite a bit. For renters, rents have gone up kind of steadily and smoothly, not as much as home prices. But the wages haven't kept up that they earn to pay the rent. So in either case, there is some suggestion of a problem. SIMON: During the debate this week, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said gentrification was a problem and it puts many low-income workers a lot farther away from where they earn a living. Here's what he suggests. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CORY BOOKER: And my plan is very simple. If you're a renter who pays more than a third of your income in rent, then you will get a refundable tax credit between the amount you're paying in the area median rent. That empowers people in the same way we empower homeowners. SIMON: Of course, the government gives homeowners a mortgage interest deduction. But what about specifically Senator Booker's idea about a refundable tax credit? How do you feel about that? SHILLER: Well, we already have refundable Earned Income Tax Credit. This is tying it to the price of housing. People who live in cities where rent and home prices are heavily pushed up by zoning regulations that try to keep people out, they deserve some compensation. SIMON: And what about the argument that some people have made that landlords would simply charge more money because they know they could get it from a government guaranteed program? SHILLER: There is some truth to that. But on the other hand, if people are actually paying more in rent, that encourages a supply increase. SIMON: Another bit from the debate here we want to play, something here from Senator Elizabeth Warren. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WARREN: So I've got a plan for 3. 2 million new housing units in America. Those are housing units for working families, for the working poor, for the poor poor. Housing is how we build wealth in America. SIMON: Senator Warren didn't have a chance to say this in the debate, but she has a plan on her website that calls for $500 billion in federal housing investment over the next 10 years. Does that strike you as wise? SHILLER: If she has 3 million new units, that will make a 1 or 2% increase in the housing stock. And it will deal with the problem somewhat. It sounds to me - right - that we should aim for doing something like that, at least. SIMON: Now the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson has had a proposal that would look at using federal funds to try and induce cities to overhaul zoning rules, which he says could lead to the construction of affordable homes. Does that strike you as a good idea? SHILLER: Yeah, something like that. Part of the reason prices are elevated is that local zoning boards are deliberately trying to keep people out that don't meet up to their standards. On the other hand, we do have to preserve zoning restrictions because you don't want a coal-burning burning power plant right next door to your house. SIMON: You've been looking at housing markets for so many decades now. Could you name any one, two or three policies you think could help immediately? SHILLER: Well, one thing that I've been working on over the years is redesigning mortgages to help prevent the disaster of foreclosure and mortgages that have a automatic workout attached to them if home prices fall.

Their concerns about pay are an eerie parallel to complaints from Uber drivers and others making living in the app-driven economy. NPR's Alina Selyukh reports. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: At first, Instacart was fun. Michaellita Fortier says it felt like her dream of being on a speed-shopping TV show. And she could make 16- or $20 per delivery in West Michigan. MICHAELLITA FORTIER: My mindset was, I'm helping a family, or, I'm helping a customer 'cause they can't go out. SELYUKH: But then she kept getting offered 7- or $9 per order, meaning go to the store, shop for someone's groceries and drive maybe 10 or 15 miles. FORTIER: Like, I'm looking at a order right now. It was $8. 19 with zero tip. Once I kept seeing those come through, I thought, now, listen; this is less than minimum wage you want me to drive. SELYUKH: Fortier quit last month, but millions of Americans like her still count on apps - Instacart, DoorDash, Uber, Lyft - not just as a service, but a job. These workers find themselves at the mercy of an algorithm, no assurance of a minimum wage, rules and pay that constantly change, the smallest tweak of the app capable of upending their livelihood. Here's Liz Temkin, who's delivered groceries for Instacart in Los Angeles for over four years. LIZ TEMKIN: It was extremely clear before how much you would be paid per item, per order. And then they came up with a completely different what we call block-box algorithm. SELYUKH: Instacart has recently faced a strike over pay. The app relies on more than 130,000 contractors, most of them women. NPR connected with more than 40 of them, and their grievances are extensive. The strike was over changes to tipping, a hefty chunk of workers' income. Instacart used to set a default tip of 10% per order. Now it's half that, and it's on top of two other fees that go straight to Instacart. These days, Instacart has new minimum pay - 7- to $10 per gig. Sometimes a gig means two or three orders and multiple deliveries - several payments to Instacart, one to the worker - though Instacart says its pay does account for the total, size, distance and other factors. If all this sounds overwhelming, a lot of workers feel that way. MERCEDES MALTESE: We used to get $10 to go to the store and 40 cents an item. Now, no matter how many items and how many units we get, they pay us $7. Maybe there's a tip; maybe there's not. SELYUKH: Mercedes Maltese says she took up Instacart in a Detroit suburb after losing a full-time and a part-time job in succession. She says her options are other minimum wage jobs. And with Instacart, she can at least try to work as many hours as possible, though much of her shift is often just sitting in her car, unpaid, waiting for a decent order. MALTESE: And I work 15 hours a day, seven days a week. I just have to work and live in my car like a homeless person in some kind of hopes of scraping up some kind of money in order to pay my bills. SELYUKH: Right after the recent strike, Instacart made another change. It stopped paying a quality bonus, $3 for each five-star review from a customer. The strikers claim retaliation. Instacart says not at all. The $3 bonus was a test, and it did not meaningfully improve the quality of work. These tests and sudden changes are the reality of modern gig work. In August, a study that surveyed almost a thousand food delivery workers found Instacart stood out among the apps for just how much it pushed people to commit long hours and accept lower-paying gigs. The researchers called it algorithmic despotism. Here's lead author Kathleen Griesbach of Columbia University. KATHLEEN GRIESBACH: Instacart, we found in particular, really did control the labor process or control workers' experiences and limited their autonomy over their time and over the work they could do in a significant way. SELYUKH: The study received some union funding and surveyed workers at apps like Instacart, DoorDash and GrubHub. Instacart dismissed the research. It argued the study used an outdated version of the app, which has since added a more flexible option for workers. Instead of having to sign up for two-hour shifts, now workers can also grab assignments whenever as orders come in in real time. Most of the 40-plus workers I contacted said they worked both the old way and the new way. And either way, being a faster, nicer, more experienced worker did not guarantee better pay. Their bottom line - they are the face of the company but feel disposable. Alina Selyukh, NPR News. AILSA CHANG, HOST:  Instacart, the grocery delivery app, has a lot of unhappy workers.

Warren's plan would forgive up to $50,000 for most people, and Sanders' would go further. So suppose that happened - what would suddenly freeing millions of Americans from student debt mean for the economy? NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: An entire generation of Americans is making major life decisions differently because of student loans - whether and when to buy a house or start a family. LAURA GREENWOOD: Children - it's not about if you want them, it's about, can you afford them? ARNOLD: Laura Greenwood works for the state education agency in Montpelier, Vt. GREENWOOD: Well, I make $63,000. I'm 30 years old. And I make probably a better salary than a lot of my peers. ARNOLD: But between her college and grad school, Greenwood owes $96,000 in student loans, and she says that's got her and her partner feeling kind of frozen. GREENWOOD: Yeah. It's always - we're interested in having kids, but just cost of living and all our other bills and then the student loans is just, like, the final straw. ARNOLD: So if people like Greenwood suddenly had this millstone of debt lifted from their necks, it stands to reason that that would unleash pent-up desires and spending that would be good for the economy. A lot more people would probably have kids or start businesses or buy houses. LAWRENCE YUN: In the short term, it would be very positive for the housing market. ARNOLD: Lawrence Yun is the National Association of Realtors' chief economist. And he says his group's survey showed that student debt has people delaying homeownership by five to seven years. He's not endorsing any particular plan, but he estimates that broad loan forgiveness would push up the number of home sales quite a bit. YUN: Home sales could be, say, 300,000 higher annually if people were not saddled with large student - a boost to the housing sector, as well as to the economy. ARNOLD: Just how much would it help the economy? William Foster is a vice president with Moody's, which just did a report on student debt forgiveness. WILLIAM FOSTER: There've been some estimates that U. S. real GDP could be boosted on average by $86 billion to $108 billion per year, which is quite a bit. That's if you had total loan forgiveness. ARNOLD: Foster says it wouldn't have to be total forgiveness to see significant results, and he says it could also help address rising income inequality. FOSTER: Student loans are now contributing to what's perceived as lower economic prospects for younger Americans. ARNOLD: After all, all those millions of people are delaying homeownership, and that's the most powerful way for most working- and middle-class people to build wealth. Lawrence Yun. YUN: A typical homeowner has net worth of about $230,000, while a typical renter has only $5,000. ARNOLD: But while the idea of loan forgiveness is popular among voters, it would not be free. And this is a big reason that plenty of politicians and policy experts are not on board. This would be expensive. Foster says Americans owe a lot of money on those student loans. FOSTER: About $1. 5 trillion. And that's more than auto loans and credit cards. They're the second biggest debt item for households. ARNOLD: Foster says most of these loans are from the federal government, and it could forgive them, but that would mean giving up the $85 billion in annual revenue that it's currently collecting on these loans. FOSTER: And that would result in a wider fiscal deficit. ARNOLD: Also, taxing people to make up the difference would be a drag on the economy. And there are other issues. Many people would oppose a giveaway to, say, lawyers and doctors, who stand to make a lot of money later but happen to have a lot of student loan debt. Also, you wouldn't want to tax the working class to pay for higher-income college graduates' loan forgiveness. That's why presidential candidates are proposing to tax the wealthy to pay for it. And Foster says there could be what's called a moral hazard factor here for future students. FOSTER: Those students might expect future loan forgiveness, and therefore they'll take out even more money than they might have otherwise. ARNOLD: And that could create even greater levels of student debt. So plenty of potential pitfalls, but policymakers who are pushing for loan forgiveness say that they have plans to make it both fair and good for the economy and to do it in a way to make education more affordable for future students so they wouldn't have to take on so much debt.

But if Black Friday doesn't mean much to you, you are not alone. Here's NPR's Alina Selyukh. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: Black Friday shopping is not something Chris Ott grew up doing, but he married into a family who never missed the occasion. CHRIS OTT: We'd have Thanksgiving dinner as a big family, and then we'd sit around looking at the ads for Black Friday shopping. And we would develop this really fun, strategic plan, pick the store that we were going to wait outside of. We would divide and conquer. SELYUKH: He's now a youth pastor and cybersecurity engineer in the Denver area, and though Ott says at first he found the whole Black Friday deal-hunting a little crazy, let's just say he got really into it. OTT: It was so extreme for us that we would - we'd be on vacation with family in Florida over Thanksgiving, and we would wait outside the Best Buy in Orlando and see what we could get there. SELYUKH: But in the past few years, this family tradition has fizzled out to a point that last year. . . OTT: We decided we'd rather just put up Christmas decorations and didn't even go. SELYUKH: Ott is far from alone. This year only 36% of people said they planned to shop on Black Friday, down from 51% just three years ago. That's according to a survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers, or PwC, where Steve Barr leads the consumer markets practice. STEVE BARR: Black Friday is still a very major event, both for retailers and for shopping. But historically, it's been the major event, and now it's just a part of the overall season. SELYUKH: Barr says people know that great discounts no longer just happen on Black Friday. Retailers have made up more shopping holidays like Cyber Monday or Prime Day. Stores now open for doorbuster sales on Thanksgiving Thursday or even Wednesday. This year, lots of sales started a whole month earlier in October. BARR: Retailers have permanently conditioned consumers to believe that there will be promotional events throughout the entire season and not through a single day. SELYUKH: To be clear, Black Friday is still the busiest shopping day of the year, and compared to the rest of the year, Black Friday does better at attracting shoppers to malls and all kinds of stores. But every year, the number of people joining the tradition is slightly lower, and some experts say it's not necessarily a bad thing. (SOUNDBITE OF CROWD SCREAMING)SELYUKH: Scenes of crowds lining up overnight, stampeding inside, fighting over televisions and toys - for years, retail companies have tried to tame the crowds and make doorbusters a more pleasant experience. In the most infamous incident in 2008, a Wal-Mart worker got trampled to death when 2,000 riled-up shoppers literally busted through the door. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Police say what happened here this morning was utter chaos. SELYUKH: And if you think about it, the doorbuster culture had stores fighting over shoppers who are chasing stuff that's cheap, says Peter Fader, professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. PETER FADER: Customer who hasn't been with us since last Black Friday and is unlikely to come again until next year. . . SELYUKH: Fader says more and more companies are realizing the real value is in loyal shoppers who are there all year, not fair-weather shoppers from one weekend in November. FADER: There's always the chance that we could turn that ugly duckling into a beautiful swan, but it's not that common. And you'd start to say, whoa. Wait a minute. Why are we paying people double overtime to be here to serve these not-so-great customers? SELYUKH: And that's one of the reasons why a few stores now outright close on Black Friday. Many more offer deals on their websites just as good as in stores. In fact, this year, PwC found for the first time, the majority of people plan to do their holiday shopping online rather than busting through any doors. Alina Selyukh, NPR News.

(SOUNDBITE OF CROWD SCREAMING) SELYUKH: Scenes of crowds lining up overnight, stampeding inside, fighting over televisions and toys - for years, retail companies have tried to tame the crowds and make doorbusters a more pleasant experience. In the most infamous incident in 2008, a Wal-Mart worker got trampled to death when 2,000 riled-up shoppers literally busted through the door. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Police say what happened here this morning was utter chaos. SELYUKH: And if you think about it, the doorbuster culture had stores fighting over shoppers who are chasing stuff that's cheap, says Peter Fader, professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. PETER FADER: Customer who hasn't been with us since last Black Friday and is unlikely to come again until next year. . . SELYUKH: Fader says more and more companies are realizing the real value is in loyal shoppers who are there all year, not fair-weather shoppers from one weekend in November. FADER: There's always the chance that we could turn that ugly duckling into a beautiful swan, but it's not that common. And you'd start to say, whoa. Wait a minute. Why are we paying people double overtime to be here to serve these not-so-great customers? SELYUKH: And that's one of the reasons why a few stores now outright close on Black Friday. Many more offer deals on their websites just as good as in stores. In fact, this year, PwC found for the first time, the majority of people plan to do their holiday shopping online rather than busting through any doors. Alina Selyukh, NPR News.

Manufacturing activity has slumped in recent months, and analysts say the ongoing tariff battle between the U. S. and China is partly to blame. NPR's Scott Horsley reports on how the trade war is affecting one manufacturing company in Minnesota. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The Misco speaker company in St. Paul, Minn. , is celebrating its 70th anniversary this year. Dan Digre's dad started the company after serving in World War II. DAN DIGRE: He was a B-17 radio operator and came back to the United States and married a woman with a bad radio. Turned out the radio wasn't bad but the speaker was bad, so he started his own speaker repair business. HORSLEY: In its early days, Misco made rugged outdoor sound systems, like these. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Good evening, folks, and a hearty welcome to our drive-in theater. HORSLEY: Today the company employs about a hundred people in a state-of-the-art factory near the Minnesota State Fairgrounds. They assemble a wide variety of speakers for musicians, home theater buffs, even restaurant drive-throughs. Digre says there used to be a big speaker industry in the United States. But over the last two decades, most companies moved offshore. And their suppliers moved with them. DIGRE: Either suppliers went to China or they probably went out of business. HORSLEY: Digre kept his factory in Minnesota, but he relies on some components imported from China. Since last fall, he's had to pay tariffs on those components, which are now at 25%. If he built the whole speaker in China, like some of his competitors, he'd pay less. Digre's tried to pass some of the tariff bill onto customers. He's also asked his Chinese suppliers for a tariff discount. But his company has had to absorb most of the extra cost. DIGRE: It comes out of our bottom line. And that's the money that we need to be reinvesting in new technology, in new products - all of the things that makes your business competitive in a global economy. HORSLEY: Every time Digre imports components from China, he gets a bill from U. S. Customs saying how much he owes in tariffs. He's surprised how many Americans mistakenly believe that China is footing the bill. Maybe that's because President Trump keeps insisting that China's paying the tariffs. Recently, Trump told Fox News he's in no hurry to make a deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FOX AND FRIENDS\")PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He wants to make it much more than I want to make it. I'm not anxious to make it. We're taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs. We never took in 10 cents. HORSLEY: The actual tariff bill is tens of billions of dollars, not hundreds of billions. For China to foot that bill, researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York said last week Chinese suppliers would have to cut their prices by about 20%. So far, the price of Chinese imports has fallen just 2%. Tennessee Congressman Jim Cooper complained at a hearing last month - Americans are paying the rest. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JIM COOPER: This is a tax that is not on foreigners. This is a tax on our own people. HORSLEY: At his speaker factory in Minnesota, Dan Digre says the higher cost of components is not the only problem. DIGRE: A tweet could come out this afternoon that could dramatically change a tariff rate. HORSLEY: Economists say that uncertainty has many business owners holding their breath, reluctant to make decisions or investments. DIGRE: And that's, I think, one of the drags that American businesses are feeling right now. None of us know what it's going to look like in a year, in two years, even two weeks. HORSLEY: This week, Digre's traveling to the Philippines to look for alternative components he could buy without having to pay a tariff. DIGRE: We're trying to keep building speakers here in the U. S. , but there's only a couple of us left in the country to do it. And you know, if these tariffs go on a lot longer, I don't know if there'll be anybody left in this country to do it. HORSLEY: Ultimately, Digre says, he might have to move his whole factory overseas, cutting those 100 jobs - exactly the opposite of what the president said he wanted when he started this trade war.

SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Investors who've been hoping for a holiday reprieve from trade tensions are suddenly worried there may be no Christmas truce. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 280 points today after President Trump suggested even a mini-trade agreement with China could still be a year away. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: In some ways, I like the idea of waiting till after the election for the China deal, but they want to make a deal now. And we'll see whether or not the deal's going to be right. It's got to be right. HORSLEY: Speaking to reporters at the NATO summit in London, Trump said he has no deadline for reaching an agreement with China, but others are urging the president to make a deal as quickly as possible. David French of the National Retail Federation says the trade battle with Beijing is already hurting U. S. farmers and manufacturers. And in less than two weeks, a new round of tariffs is set to hit popular consumer items, including cellphones and laptop computers. DAVID FRENCH: And the longer these tariffs stay in place and the more uncertainty is baked into the system, the harder it is to keep the consumer from feeling the full brunt of the pain. HORSLEY: With China talks up in the air, the administration is also threatening a new tariff battle with France. Trump complains that a new French tax on digital advertising unfairly targets U. S. tech giants such as Google, Facebook and Amazon. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: They're American companies. I'm not going to let people take advantage of American companies because if anyone's going to take advantage of the American companies, it's going to be us. HORSLEY: In retaliation for the French tax, the administration has proposed tariffs on nearly 2 1/2 billion dollars' worth of French goods, including champagne and blue cheese. Those tariffs could run as high as 100%. PHILIP MARFUGGI: That would be devastating. HORSLEY: Philip Marfuggi is president of the Cheese Importers Association of America. France sells nearly $200 million worth of cheese to this country each year. Marfuggi warns, if the price of that cheese doubles because of a tariff, a lot of the market would dry up, and a lot of U. S. jobs could be lost. MARFUGGI: It's a trickle-down effect. You got the truckers bringing the product in from the ports. Then you have cutting and wrapping facilities. Just because we import European cheeses - we're all American companies. I mean, my company's been around for 98 years. HORSLEY: Marfuggi says it's hard to understand why American cheese sellers should pay such a price to defend the profits of tech giants worth billions. If that's not enough, the administration said this week its earlier tariffs on European exports could go even higher. And just yesterday, Trump ordered new import taxes on steel and aluminum from Brazil and Argentina. SCOTT LINCICOME: We've really come to this point where the president has the tariff hammer, and all he sees out there is nails. HORSLEY: Veteran trade lawyer Scott Lincicome says while the administration has repeatedly used tariffs to bring other countries to the bargaining table, it's yet to produce a major trade deal. And the cost of the levies is largely borne by American businesses and consumers.

I'm Terry Gross. After you clean out your closets and drawers or downsize to a smaller home, what happens to the clothes, furniture and electronics you drop off at the Goodwill or your neighborhood thrift store? More specifically, what happens to the stuff they can't sell? And there's plenty of it. My guest Adam Minter has tried to find out the answer by traveling to the places where secondhand goods are collected, bought, repurposed, repaired and sold in the U. S. , Asia and Africa. He's the author of the new book \"Secondhand: Travels In The New Global Garage Sale. \" His previous book, \"Junkyard Planet,\" was about the recycling industry. Three generations of his family were in the junk business. He's reported on the waste and recycling industries for nearly two decades. He's now a columnist for Bloomberg Opinion and is based in Malaysia. Adam Minter, welcome back to FRESH AIR. I interviewed you after your previous book, \"Junkyard Planet,\" was published. And in preparing for the interview today, I read that your mother died two weeks after publication of that book. So I don't know; I think I probably spoke to you before that. Anyways, I'm sorry. You talk about this in the book, in the way that it's relevant to the book, in that you were living in a small apartment in Shanghai at the time, and after your mother died, like, you couldn't take her stuff to your home. There was no room. It was too far away. And that was one of the things that got you thinking a lot about reuse. ADAM MINTER: Yeah, it was - I remember it quite clearly. She was at the reading that we had in St. Paul, and a few days later, she passed away. And you know, what happened is what happens to a lot of American families. There's sort of two periods of grieving, in a way. There was the grieving of my mother passing, but then you're sort of left with the material legacy of her life - you know, her property, the things that were in her small apartment, the things that we found out were stored in relatives' basements. And it became the responsibility of my sister and I to figure out what to do with those things. And neither of us really were in a position to take anything. She lived in a small apartment in New York. As you said, I was in Shanghai. And so it took over a year of us coming in and out of town, occasionally, you know, giving things away, maybe taking a piece or, you know, something - a picture - out of the boxes. And finally, we got to the end of it, and we were left staring at her china. And neither of us wanted to let it go because we knew she loved that china. And it was sort of a, you take it; no, you take it; no, you take it. And finally, we said, let's take it to the Goodwill. And when we were, you know, waiting to drop that off in the drive-through drop-off at the Goodwill in Hopkins, Minn. , it occurred to me that this is probably the start of a book. GROSS: Do you know what happened to the china? MINTER: Well, I didn't. I was sitting there thinking, you know, I don't know what happens to this. I follow waste and recycling all over the world. That's what I've been covering for years. But I don't know actually what happens once that china goes through that door. And so it occurred to me, this is a very interesting subject, and I'm probably the person to do it. And so I started talking to people about, you know, if they knew what happened to that stuff. And nobody really knew what happened beyond the donation door at Goodwill. GROSS: Yeah. And I just want to say about that, for - I think for all of us who have somebody in the family who died, you know, you go through their stuff. The stuff that you give away, you want to really believe that, like, it's going to find a good home, (laughter) you know? MINTER: Yeah. GROSS: Get to - you feel like your parent or, you know, whoever cared about it; it was a part of their lives. You don't want to just, like, put it in the trash. And on the other hand, what are you going to do with it? So yeah, you give it to the thrift store, and then, like, you never know. But it has a special meaning, and you want it - you want to think it found a good home. So as part of your research for this book, you went to a Goodwill in Arizona where people were bringing in carloads of stuff from the flea market because they couldn't sell it at the flea market. So these are the things that, like - nobody really wanted to buy them. MINTER: Right. GROSS: (Laughter) Now they're all at the Goodwill. So what are the standards at Goodwill and Salvation Army and, you know, private thrift stores that you went to? MINTER: Sure. GROSS: . . . Because they don't keep everything that we give them. MINTER: No. And that's exactly what I did. I literally sat on a chair sometimes at the donation door at Goodwill in Tucson, Ariz. , and watched the stuff come through the door. And it's amazing the things that come through the door at Goodwill. And I would literally follow it, walk with it, you know, to the sorting areas, and it was really surprising to me. I didn't know what I was expecting, but I didn't expect the level of sophistication of sorting that you find at a Goodwill. You know, I think we just sort of think of it as, well, whatever's trash, they'll throw in the trash, and then the rest of it gets put on the shelves. But they're very sophisticated about how they price these things for the community that surrounds the particular Goodwills. They, you know, look at the quality of the objects, decide if certain things belong at their boutiques. Goodwill increasingly has sort of a higher-end secondhand outlet, you know, within their system, and so they can maybe price the stuff higher and make more money from it. So it - they really know what they're doing, and the level of knowledge of what we throw away is extraordinary. I mean, they're - I think of them almost as anthropologists, the sorters in those rooms. But the astonishing thing to me was, even with all that sophistication of sorting, your average thrift store in the United States only sells about one-third of the stuff that ends up on its shelves, and the rest of the stuff ends up somewhere else. Now, it may not end up in the trash. In fact, more often than not, it doesn't. There's other outlets - literally, outlets where - for example, at Goodwill, they'll send them to what's called an outlet center and sell that stuff by the pound rather than individually priced, or it goes into the export markets, in many cases, and goes overseas. GROSS: I was surprised to read about some of the things that don't sell at thrift stores, things that you'd think - at least that I'd think - had value. Like, the examples you give are, like, oak dining room sets, exercise equipment. A big old oak dining room set has very little resale value in a thrift store. MINTER: Well, there's a couple problems with a big oak dining room set. One, it's really, really heavy, and it's really hard to move. And people walk in, and they may say, well, you're going to give me that oak dining room set for, say, $25, and it might have cost hundreds, if not thousands, years before, but I'm going to actually have to put that in my car or in my pickup truck and move it. And, you know, in contemporary America, a lot of the people who are shopping these thrift stores and buying, you know, furniture out of them are people who move a lot. So, you know, someone who moves a lot isn't going to necessarily want to be moving, constantly, a 300-pound oak dining room table. GROSS: And what about exercise equipment, used exercise equipment? MINTER: For some reason, people just don't like to move it. One, it's really kind of awkward. A treadmill is not an easy thing to put in the back of your car unless it's one of those ones that you collapse. GROSS: So true (laughter). Yeah. MINTER: You know? GROSS: So what happens to the oak dining room set and the old exercise equipment that the thrift store cannot sell? MINTER: So the exercise equipment, a lot of that stuff ends up - if it's - if there's a lot of metal in it, it might go to a recycler, and they'll break it apart and at least get some of the metals out of it. Sometimes that stuff may, though, end up in a dumpster, and it's just going to end up in the landfill. The oak dining room set, depending on where you are, it may then move to another charity. And that's something that surprised me as well, is that we think of, you know, a Goodwill or a Salvation Army as the final destination, but in some cases, there are other destinations beyond them. There are, for example - you know, here in the Twin Cities, there is a charity called Bridging, which will actually take furniture - heavy furniture from other thrift stores, thrift operations, and then give it away or help, you know, immigrant families or destitute families furnish their homes with it. But it is the case - and I really looked into this - that you will see some of this very nice oak furniture - if it can't be sold, it will end up in the landfill. GROSS: Wow. So, you know, we started off talking about clearing your mother's home of her possessions after her death and how kind of challenging and emotionally fraught that was. So many people are in that situation, and a whole industry has developed out of that and also out of people moving a lot and they can't or don't want to take everything with them. So why don't you describe this new clean-out industry that's developed? MINTER: Sure. And it's not just in the United States; it's international. But it's been driven by two factors, really - demographics and affluence. So as populations age and children move away from home, you have an increasingly elderly population in the United States, for example, that wants to downsize for whatever reason, you know, into retirement housing or some other kind of senior housing. And that means that they need to get rid of their stuff that they've accumulated for a lifetime. So this profession has existed for centuries in a sense. There's always been scavengers going to people's homes as they leave them, but now it's taken on sort of a new tint. And what they do is they sort of counsel people on helping them get rid of the things, sometimes encourage them, sometimes nudge them, and then help them make the move. So in the United States, there's actually a association, the Association of - National Association of Move Managers with over 600 members, companies, that belong to it. And they are constantly helping people reduce their stuff and encouraging them to do it. And I also document a similar phenomenon in Japan where you have thousands of these companies, and it's slightly different there because Japan's population is shrinking so there aren't necessarily even heirs for this stuff. So it's a - it's an even more pressing duty, if you will. And in some cases, they're hired by governments to just help clean-out these apartments and figure out where to put this stuff. GROSS: So do people in the clean-out industry decide for you what you should keep and what you should throw away? MINTER: Well, no. I mean, in the back of their minds, they certainly do. I mean, they'll walk into a home and they've seen a lot of these and they'll say, you know, you don't need your grandmother's china and your mother's china and probably you don't need yours. But the challenges in many cases with seniors as they downsize is sort of convincing them of that fact. And so, you know, one of the things you see happen during these kinds of clean-outs is sort of nudging them along, you know, telling them that, hey, we can bring this somewhere where it will get reused. And over and over you get the sense, if you're around clean-outs and you're around move managers, and you're around people who are downsizing, or in many cases, if they're downsizing what was left behind by their parents after they've passed away, there's almost this primal need to feel that your stuff or your parent's stuff or your grandparent's stuff is wanted and used. And so part of - I wouldn't say the - I would say it's not a trick, it's more technique - is to, you know, sort of nudge people along and say, yes, there is somewhere for this stuff to be used. We can take it somewhere. I'll ensure you that somebody will want this, and that's a really big part of it. GROSS: So the clean-out industry is basically like, I'm moving, I'm downsizing, whatever. Here's all the stuff I don't need, I don't want. I don't want to have the burden of figuring out what to do with it or taking it someplace. I'll hire you; you deal with it. MINTER: Yeah, in many respects, that's true. But you'll deal with it. But sometimes, you're going to come in and deal with it with me and you're almost like a counselor. I mean, the very best of the clean-out professionals that I spent time with, they kind of reminded me of therapists, you know. And again, it was, you know, having to sit with somebody and explain to them, you know, you don't need this. And that person explaining to the clean-out professional, you know, this wedding china, you know, when it was given to me 50, 60 years ago I was going to keep it forever, you know. And now I'm downsizing and you're asking me to let go of this wedding china, which, you know, isn't just this material thing that I put in a cabinet and looks pretty, but it's really a part of my identity. And what's so emotionally jarring and I found myself many times in the course of these clean-outs that I witnessed, you know, feeling emotional as well, is that you see people really taking apart their identities. Because, you know, in contemporary America, you know, in Japan, where I spent a bunch of time, I mean, we increasingly sort of build up who we are on the basis of the things that we have owned and acquired over the years. So that's why you sort of need this counselor, this therapist, in many cases, to help you do this or to help your parents or grandparents do this. GROSS: There's also the whole Marie Kondo phenomenon where, like, you're supposed to keep what brings you joy and discard everything else so that you can downsize. Do you think that that whole - that whole approach is having an effect on the reused business? MINTER: Well, you've certainly heard from Goodwills in particular that when the Marie Kondo television show was very popular, you know, back in January I believe it was, that they saw a surge in donations and that's continued. But sort of anecdotally, what I think has happened is, you know, people have decluttered, but it's more often than not just given them more room to acquire more stuff. And, you know, and that's very interesting because I think some folks sort of embraced Marie Kondo as almost a sustainable movement, an ecological movement - downsize your stuff. But interestingly, she's never been somebody who's sort of embraced that view of what she does. In fact, it's just in recent weeks that she's announced her own product line of organizing, you know, materials, boxes, et cetera, et cetera. She's always been more about sort of personal edification and, you know, and in these contemporary consumer societies, you know, personal edification is often revolves around consumption and so I don't think it's helped. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Adam Minter. He's the author of the new book \"Secondhand: Travels In The New Global Garage Sale. \" He's also the author of the earlier book \"Junkyard Planet. \" We'll be right back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF DAN AUERBACH SONG, \"HEARTBROKEN, IN DISREPAIR\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Adam Minter. He's been covering waste and recycling for nearly two decades. He's the author of the new book, \"Secondhand: Travels In The New Global Garage Sale. \" So one of the things you point out in your book is that as of 2017, there were 54,000 mini storage sites in the U. S. And I know just driving around Philadelphia, there are these storage sites, like, all over. And I think that's in part because so many of us live in apartments or homes, you know, that are just really too small for our needs, and there's no closet space. So you rent a closet space. I think a lot of people know this drill. Or, you know, you've just moved to town and you need a place to store your stuff until you actually find a place to live. But what impact is that having, all these mini storage sites, on what you're looking at, which is the reuse industry? MINTER: Yeah, well, it's - there's sort of a - you know, the mini storage sites are sort of a symptom of this metastasizing accumulation that we do. And that's why you see them continue to sprout up. And I actually went on clean-outs that were in storage units. After we finished, you know, cleaning out the house, then you go to the storage units. And I opened the book with one of these storage unit clean-outs. And it's really troubling, in some ways, because depending on where you are, people can actually pay more per square foot for a storage unit than they would for residential rental space. So we're actually paying more to store our stuff than we are sort of to store ourselves. You know, for the reuse industry, it's sort of a mixed blessing. I mean, the reuse industry thrives on having access to stuff, in particular, good stuff. But increasingly, what we see in the United States in particular is that the quality of the stuff that people are acquiring - because we're acquiring more every year - is declining. So all that stuff that's filling up these storage units isn't necessarily what my grandmother would call merchandise. It's stuff that's going to go in the donation door at a thrift store and ultimately going to find its way, you know, into a dumpster or a recycling bin. It's not going to be reused. GROSS: Because the quality isn't good enough to be reusable? MINTER: Exactly. I mean, it's just - it's a decline in quality overall. I mean, if you think back, you know, say 20, 25 years ago, a television that was 10 years old was something that could be reused, it could be refurbished and reused because those were tube televisions, CRTs, as they're called in the industry. They were, you know, they were very heavy, but they were also very robust. But these days, you can go and you can buy yourself a flat panel television at an electronics retailer - I saw it over, you know, the recent Black Friday period - and you can buy that flat-panel for $150. But in a sense, you get what you pay for. You get a cheap television that maybe will last three years. So, you know, when you go into storage units and see these flat-panel TVs, you know, sitting in them, somebody may have thought, well, I'm just going to store it here for a couple of years. By the time it's opened up and people say, it's time to donate this stuff, that's not merchandise. That's something that's going to go to an electronics recycler. And that kind of phenomenon is increasing. The volume of stuff is increasing, but the volume of good stuff amongst the stuff, if you will, is declining. GROSS: OK. So let's get back to the thrift stores. How do they sort to decide what's going to the trash or the landfill and what's happening to the rest of it? MINTER: Sure. Well, if - let's use apparel as an example. If you go to the donation rooms and sorting rooms that I spent time in in Tucson, you know, there'll be, you know, large carts full of clothing, and they will go to sorters who, first of all, sort of have almost like a flow chart. It's a list of brands. There'll be some, I think it's around 85 to 90 brands on there. And they will tell the sorters how to price those. But on top of that, they go through and they feel the fabric. You know, is it thin? Does it feel like something that's going to fall apart after one to five washes? And that's really important because you can tell these sorters there's a brand here and it should be priced $2. 99, but the sorters will tell you, you know, these brands are declining in quality, and I had that conversation over and over. They would refer to a brand and say, well, it used to be a pretty good $2. 99 brand, meaning we'd price it at $2. 99, but we really feel it now because it's not as good as it was when it was first labeled $2. 99. And when that happens, it'll go into perhaps a bin that isn't designed to go out to the store, but it might go to what is called an as-is bin, which would be something that's sold to a rag maker, or maybe sold as stuffing, recycled in that sense. It's not recycled for use. And then you will go through there, and you will find garments that simply don't even belong going to the rag makers or the stuffing. That may be something like undergarments, that may be something that's just so badly soiled that, you know, you couldn't in good conscience send it to anybody, so it would go into the trash bin. So it's a very - you know, there's an objective side to it, but there's also sort of the subjective side that requires the sorters in these rooms just talking about apparel to use their subjective knowledge that they've acquired as they've spent time with thousands and thousands of garments over periods of time, you know, to make that call. GROSS: My guest is journalist Adam Minter, author of the new book \"Secondhand. \" After a break, we'll talk more about the afterlife of the stuff you donate to thrift stores. We'll talk about recycling and about growing up in a family that owned a junkyard. And Ken Tucker will review the comeback album by Hootie & the Blowfish. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF THOMAS NEWMAN SONG, \"WALL-E\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with journalist Adam Minter, who covers the waste and recycling industries and is a columnist for Bloomberg Opinion. His new book, \"Secondhand,\" is about what happens to your clothes, furniture and electronics after you've donated them to the Goodwill or thrift store, with an emphasis on what happens to the stuff no one wants to buy. His previous book, \"Junkyard Planet,\" was about the recycling industry. When we left off, we were talking about the sorters, the professionals who sort through thrift store donations to determine what can be sold and what can't. The garments that are too stained or worn to be sold can often be recycled into rags. So if a sorter determines that an article of clothing or a blanket or whatever is no longer usable but it can be recycled for, like, rags or stuffing, does the fabric make a difference in what the afterlife is going to be? Is cotton going to be recycled differently than polyester or vegan leather? MINTER: The answer to that is yes. I always have wanted to report on what's called the rag industry. And it's - I call them the original recyclers, and they've existed for a couple hundred years as an industrial enterprise. These are companies that take old clothes, old hospital gowns, old bed sheets, and they cut them up into rags that are then sold to everyone from hotels and bars to wipe down counters to car washes to wipe down your windshield. And it's usually the last use of a garment or a bedsheet. And historically, they haven't really had to worry that much about the quality of the fabric coming through their doors - fabric that may be bought from thrift stores, may be bought from hospitals, may be bought from hotels. But in the last few years, that's changed, and it's changed because clothing became cheaper. And the way it became cheaper, one of the ways it became cheaper, is that manufacturers started weaving polyester into the cotton. And if you talk to rag-makers - and it's a really big industry in the United States and around the world. It handles probably one-third of the clothing that's tossed out every year. If you talk to them, they'll tell you it used to be that you get something labeled 100% cotton and it really was 100% cotton. But increasingly, 100% cotton doesn't mean 100% cotton, and that has a real impact on the recycling. So if you make a rag that, say, has some polyester in it with that cotton and you sell it to, say, an oil and gas company to wipe down leaks, as we all know, polyester picks up static electricity, and so that becomes an explosion risk. GROSS: Wow. And I guess a more obvious problem about polyester is that it's not absorbent for a rag. MINTER: Right. Exactly. And, you know - and the rag industry, again, it sounds like it's sort of this, you know, very rudimentary - I don't want to say primitive - but very basic kind of industry. But it's not. There's a level of sophistication there. Again, a rag, as Todd Wilson of Star Wipers - that's the company I spent time with for the book. He told me it's a tool, and you need to be able to customize that tool for its use. And so if you're looking to create an absorbent rag, no, I mean, polyester doesn't absorb anything. And that gets really interesting. So one of the things I saw when I was with Star Wipers - they're based in Newark, Ohio - is they were actually importing castoffs from textile T-shirt factories in Bangladesh. And I believe they were getting a load every couple weeks. And so these are cuttings from factories in Bangladesh. And they come in, and they were cotton T-shirts - maybe they had some poly in them. I'm not exactly sure. But, you know, when you buy a new T-shirt, you know, it feels kind of rough. And a new T-shirt doesn't absorb really well. The best T-shirts are the ones you've run through the wash over and over and over. So one of things that Star Wipers will do that I found fascinating is they actually have their own laundry. It's an incredible laundry machine. It's like a giant caterpillar. And they will wash these new textiles so they become soft like an old T-shirt, and then they are more absorbent, and they can sell them as merchandise. GROSS: So what happens to all the polyester clothes? How are they recycled? Are they used for stuffing? MINTER: So in many cases, yeah, they're used for stuffing. And there is - you know, that's another side of, you could say, the rag industry, is there is a large stuffing industry. And so polyester clothes can, you know, serve as great stuffing material, you know, like chairs and sofas. GROSS: So every step along the way in the world of recyclables, stuff is weeded out for use, and other stuff is sent to the next destination because nobody in the previous destination could figure out a use for it. So where do the goods go to die at the end of (laughter) this long run? MINTER: Yeah. I mean, they end up in the landfill or the incinerator. I mean, there is no green heaven, if you will (laughter). Everything wears out eventually, and everything gets tossed out. I mean, you know, we don't have many artifacts and many things that have - you know, were - you know, from the Colonial period in the United States that are in daily use anymore. They're in museums or they're in, you know, Colonial landfills, if you will. And that's you know, and that's the fate of stuff. That's the fate of our consumer societies. You know, if we spend our time thinking, you know, this is going to be used perpetually, forever - even the best-made garment, you know, the most robust smartphone - we're deluding ourselves a bit. Eventually, everything has to die, and that's sort of the dark side of consumerism. Certainly, metals can be recycled over and over, but you even lose a little bit of metal every time in the recycling process. So it's sort of the ultimate story of consumerism, and it's the dark side. We can't really delude ourselves into thinking everything lasts forever. GROSS: Does it make environmental sense that the goods that can't be sold in the thrift stores in the U. S. , many of them get exported to distant countries and they might get exported yet again to another country after that? I mean, when you think of all of the fuel being used to transport these possessions - well, former possessions (laughter), this stuff - I mean, does that make sense? MINTER: It does. And there's a couple reasons for that. One is we know just from doing what is called a life cycle assessment of products. A life cycle assessment is basically where somebody goes and looks at the full environmental impact of a product - say, a smartphone - from manufacturing to disposal, and, you know, looks at what the air pollution impacts are, the mining impacts, the carbon impacts. And the one thing we do know is that the biggest impact of most products is the manufacturing side. And so if you want to reduce the environmental impact of your consumption, the best way to do that is to not manufacture more stuff. In that sense, the best thing you can do is not buy more stuff. And so the longer that your product lasts, the longer that you use that smartphone, the less likely it is that you're going to be buying a new one. So the goal really should be to keep your stuff in use for as long as possible, whether it's by you or somebody in Ghana or somebody in Cambodia. So in that sense, it's a really good thing because if somebody in Cambodia is using your phone, they're probably not buying a new cheap handset there. In terms of the shipping, that's a really interesting story. And one of the reasons why you've seen globalization of recycling and reuse work over the years is because people are buying so much new stuff. Let me give China as an example. You know, during the boom years of sort of the China-U. S. recycling trade, you saw so much U. S. recycling moved to China in part because China was sending so many boxes, so many shipping containers of new stuff to the United States, and they wanted to get those containers back to China so they could send Americans more new stuff. So what would happen is the shipping companies would massively discount those containers to sometimes around 10% of what it would cost to send something from China to the U. S. So it made it very cheap to send stuff there, but in a sense, it was a free ride because those containers were going back anyway. So many of the places that are buying used goods from developed countries sort of have that same relationship. Japan and Malaysia - Malaysia exports a lot of new stuff to Japan. Those containers need to get back to Malaysia, so why not fill them with new stuff? It's kind of - I always think of it as kind of almost like a carbon-free free ride. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Adam Minter. He's the author of the new book \"Secondhand: Travels In The New Global Garage Sale. \" Let's take a short break, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF ALLEN TOUSSAINT'S \"EGYPTIAN FANTASY\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Adam Minter, author of the new book \"Secondhand: Travels In The New Global Garage Sale. \" And he's been covering the waste and recycling industries for nearly two decades. So your family - you had, like, three generations of people in the junk business? MINTER: Yeah, dating back to my great grandfather. GROSS: Who came here and was a rag picker. What did that mean then? MINTER: Sure. Well, when he arrived in Galveston, Texas, from Russia, he didn't speak English, didn't have any skills. He did what, you know, so many immigrants did - they literally started looking for value where no one else did, and that meant walking down the streets of Galveston looking for, you know, pieces of clothing that he could sell to a recycler. And as you, you know, get a few pennies in your pocket, then maybe you start going door to door and asking people, you know, at their doors, do you have some, you know, old clothes that you'd like to sell that I could buy? And then he would go and he would upsell those. If you're good at it, go from, you know, carrying around rags in a backpack to carrying them on a handcart to carrying them on a horse-drawn cart to a truck and maybe, at some point, acquiring a piece of land where you can do this business. He eventually made his way up to Minneapolis. You know, he would deal in anything used, anything that other people didn't see value in but he knew he could upsell in some way. And he ultimately started specializing in scrap metal, and so he founded a scrap metal business up in the Twin Cities. GROSS: And your family had a junkyard, too? Was that the scrap metal junkyard? MINTER: Yeah. The family junkyard, dating back to my great-grandfather, sort of split, and there were two. There's one still there. And my father - we actually had to sell off the old junkyard in Minneapolis because the city wanted the land. But my father, who just turned 78, he's in the business still, sort of still growing it. GROSS: And the scrap metal junk business, was there, like, a car flattener to junk cars? MINTER: Oh, sure. So we - Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, a scrap yard is - (laughter) you know, the - OSHA's probably going to hate this, but a scrap yard is a wonderful thing for a small child to grow up in (laughter). You know, it's a wonderland, if you will. I loved, as a kid, watching our car flattener. You know, we were in the junk car business. And the cars would come in, and people - you know, we'd pull out the motors, and then it would go into a flattener, and you'd see these cars flattened. And then they'd be piled up on trucks and driven, you know, to the steel mill, where they'd be, you know, melted into new steel. We had a warehouse, which I loved to walk around in. You know, I have very clear memories as a toddler walking around that warehouse and looking into boxes and barrels. And, you know, there'd be plumber scrap, or there would be electrician scrap, or there would be, you know, defective molds from a factory that was making, you know, it could be, you know, figurines, brass figurines. And so it was a real wonderland. And as a child, it really impresses upon you that there is so much value out there in the world that other people don't see, and that value is an opportunity for yourself and your family. GROSS: Are there objects you've saved from your childhood, when you were roaming through the junkyard? MINTER: Oh, absolutely. You know, the - one of the great treasures I have - and I still can't believe I have it - is a sign from the Great Northern Railway, which is now a defunct railway. And there are railway collectors out there all over the world, and something like that is a real treasure. I have little animal figurines, brass figurines. We used to get a lot of those for some reason, and so we would always want to grab those. And, you know, oftentimes the best stuff, you know, was stuff that I would find with my grandmother, who would take me out into the warehouse, and she would go snooping in the boxes, often much to the chagrin of my father, and he would worry about her out there. And we would find all kinds of - you know, of great things. Oftentimes just figurines and - or, you know, bits of toys or just interesting - even - I can remember just interesting brass plumbing scrap. You know, there'd be an odd-shaped pipe, and we'd grab it out of there just because we thought it'd be interesting to put on a shelf. GROSS: So I've watched too many movies, but did you ever find a dead body? MINTER: We did not find a dead body. But I remember very clearly - soon as you brought that up (laughter) - one Halloween - seriously, one Halloween, the Minneapolis Police Department towed in a car in which there had been a shooting in the back seat, and it was a bloody, bloody mess. It was exactly what you expected to turn up at your scrap yard on a Halloween. And then we flattened it. And, you know, we didn't get much of that business. But I've talked to other scrap yard owners over the years who, you know, have recycled that kind of thing over and over. It exists and people don't want to keep those cars. GROSS: What was your reaction when you saw it as a kid? MINTER: I was fascinated, you know, as an 8, 9-year-old child would often be. It didn't scare me, I think, or upset me. I think it would upset me a lot if I saw something like that now. GROSS: So I have a recycling question for you. MINTER: Sure. GROSS: I am really confused right now about what's happening to the plastics and paper that I recycle. I've heard that China isn't accepting our recycling anymore, at least not as much as they used to. I don't know where it's going instead. I'm not even sure which plastics are considered recyclable anymore and what kind of paper is going to not be recyclable because if it has certain finishes on it, it won't be recyclable. So I just feel like I'm going through the motions and I don't know if I'm really accomplishing anything, so help me out. MINTER: Sure. Well, you are definitely accomplishing something and recycling is still a very good thing to do. Metals and paper are still widely recycled. There are still markets for them. They are not as strong as they used to be, and that's in large part because the global economy and especially China's economy has slowed down. And they were really the engine for buying that stuff and using it in new goods. But if you put, you know, a piece of paper, a piece of cardboard in your recycling bin, it's going to be recycled in some form, in some place. Some of it will be recycled in the United States and there's more and more recycling capacity being built, you know, as we speak in the United States and that's really exciting. And in terms of paper, I mean, I just, you know, I always recommend people follow the guidelines from your municipality or whoever runs your recycling program. You know, everybody has different markets, every municipality has different markets. And they will tell you what they are capable of selling, you know, to mills and to, you know, whether they're domestic or overseas. Plastics, in some sense is the same thing. You know, if they don't have markets for these kinds of plastics that you are generating at home, they're going to tell you whether or not that they can recycle it. And there are, you know, recycling programs in the United States who have started, you know, limiting the amount of plastics, the types of plastics, that they will be willing to recycle. In terms of plastics that can be really easily recycled, the one that is easiest and there is always going to be some kind of robust market for is PET. So that's, you know, the bottles you get, whether it be a water bottle, a Coke bottle. And that can be used in any number of different applications from, you know, bottle to bottle recycling, if you will. It's also used in clothing. PET is, you know, is a type of polyester in a sense and so it can be woven into clothing. GROSS: If you're unsure about a plastic, should you recycle it or not? If you recycle it and they can't use it, are you going to be ruining that whole batch? MINTER: So it depends on where you are. But generally, if you're unsure, I would say put it in the trash. And I know some of your listeners are going to hate hearing that. But the worst thing you can do to sort of your recycling program is to contribute what's known in the industry as contamination. So contamination just means it's a type of material that is not like the other materials. You have to think of recycling - ultimately, your recycling is it's not an environmental good, it's a commodity. And, you know, you're recycling program is all about creating a commodity that it can sell to manufacturers. So if somebody is buying, you know, pure wood pulp to make into cardboard boxes, they certainly don't want a bunch of, you know, M&M wrappers in it. Not to pick on M&Ms, but they don't want plastics in it. It makes it harder to manufacture, it may lower the quality of that wood pulp. And the same goes for, you know, a bunch of cardboard boxes, you know, that you may put into your recycling bin. The last thing you want is to have, you know, plastic wrappers in there that will make it harder to make a quality product from that cardboard. So, you know, in the first book, I describe, you know, household recycling. It's not really recycling. Recycling is what happens at the paper mill. What you're doing in your home is harvesting. You're harvesting the stuff for the people who are actually doing the recycling. And so in a sense, to be a good harvester of your recycling, you want to make things as clean and pure as you can. GROSS: Well, Adam Minter, I want to thank you so much for talking with us. MINTER: Thank you for having me. GROSS: Adam Minter is the author of the new book \"Secondhand. \"After a break, rock critic Ken Tucker will review the new comeback album by Hootie & the Blowfish. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF JAMES HUNTER BAND'S \"I WANNA GET OLD WITH YOU\") TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. After you clean out your closets and drawers or downsize to a smaller home, what happens to the clothes, furniture and electronics you drop off at the Goodwill or your neighborhood thrift store? More specifically, what happens to the stuff they can't sell? And there's plenty of it. My guest Adam Minter has tried to find out the answer by traveling to the places where secondhand goods are collected, bought, repurposed, repaired and sold in the U. S. , Asia and Africa. He's the author of the new book \"Secondhand: Travels In The New Global Garage Sale. \" His previous book, \"Junkyard Planet,\" was about the recycling industry. Three generations of his family were in the junk business. He's reported on the waste and recycling industries for nearly two decades. He's now a columnist for Bloomberg Opinion and is based in Malaysia. Adam Minter, welcome back to FRESH AIR. I interviewed you after your previous book, \"Junkyard Planet,\" was published. And in preparing for the interview today, I read that your mother died two weeks after publication of that book. So I don't know; I think I probably spoke to you before that. Anyways, I'm sorry. You talk about this in the book, in the way that it's relevant to the book, in that you were living in a small apartment in Shanghai at the time, and after your mother died, like, you couldn't take her stuff to your home. There was no room. It was too far away. And that was one of the things that got you thinking a lot about reuse. ADAM MINTER: Yeah, it was - I remember it quite clearly. She was at the reading that we had in St. Paul, and a few days later, she passed away. And you know, what happened is what happens to a lot of American families. There's sort of two periods of grieving, in a way. There was the grieving of my mother passing, but then you're sort of left with the material legacy of her life - you know, her property, the things that were in her small apartment, the things that we found out were stored in relatives' basements. And it became the responsibility of my sister and I to figure out what to do with those things. And neither of us really were in a position to take anything. She lived in a small apartment in New York. As you said, I was in Shanghai. And so it took over a year of us coming in and out of town, occasionally, you know, giving things away, maybe taking a piece or, you know, something - a picture - out of the boxes. And finally, we got to the end of it, and we were left staring at her china. And neither of us wanted to let it go because we knew she loved that china. And it was sort of a, you take it; no, you take it; no, you take it. And finally, we said, let's take it to the Goodwill. And when we were, you know, waiting to drop that off in the drive-through drop-off at the Goodwill in Hopkins, Minn. , it occurred to me that this is probably the start of a book. GROSS: Do you know what happened to the china? MINTER: Well, I didn't. I was sitting there thinking, you know, I don't know what happens to this. I follow waste and recycling all over the world. That's what I've been covering for years. But I don't know actually what happens once that china goes through that door. And so it occurred to me, this is a very interesting subject, and I'm probably the person to do it. And so I started talking to people about, you know, if they knew what happened to that stuff. And nobody really knew what happened beyond the donation door at Goodwill. GROSS: Yeah. And I just want to say about that, for - I think for all of us who have somebody in the family who died, you know, you go through their stuff. The stuff that you give away, you want to really believe that, like, it's going to find a good home, (laughter) you know? MINTER: Yeah. GROSS: Get to - you feel like your parent or, you know, whoever cared about it; it was a part of their lives. You don't want to just, like, put it in the trash. And on the other hand, what are you going to do with it? So yeah, you give it to the thrift store, and then, like, you never know. But it has a special meaning, and you want it - you want to think it found a good home. So as part of your research for this book, you went to a Goodwill in Arizona where people were bringing in carloads of stuff from the flea market because they couldn't sell it at the flea market. So these are the things that, like - nobody really wanted to buy them. MINTER: Right. GROSS: (Laughter) Now they're all at the Goodwill. So what are the standards at Goodwill and Salvation Army and, you know, private thrift stores that you went to? MINTER: Sure. GROSS: . . . Because they don't keep everything that we give them. MINTER: No. And that's exactly what I did. I literally sat on a chair sometimes at the donation door at Goodwill in Tucson, Ariz. , and watched the stuff come through the door. And it's amazing the things that come through the door at Goodwill. And I would literally follow it, walk with it, you know, to the sorting areas, and it was really surprising to me. I didn't know what I was expecting, but I didn't expect the level of sophistication of sorting that you find at a Goodwill. You know, I think we just sort of think of it as, well, whatever's trash, they'll throw in the trash, and then the rest of it gets put on the shelves. But they're very sophisticated about how they price these things for the community that surrounds the particular Goodwills. They, you know, look at the quality of the objects, decide if certain things belong at their boutiques. Goodwill increasingly has sort of a higher-end secondhand outlet, you know, within their system, and so they can maybe price the stuff higher and make more money from it. So it - they really know what they're doing, and the level of knowledge of what we throw away is extraordinary. I mean, they're - I think of them almost as anthropologists, the sorters in those rooms. But the astonishing thing to me was, even with all that sophistication of sorting, your average thrift store in the United States only sells about one-third of the stuff that ends up on its shelves, and the rest of the stuff ends up somewhere else. Now, it may not end up in the trash. In fact, more often than not, it doesn't. There's other outlets - literally, outlets where - for example, at Goodwill, they'll send them to what's called an outlet center and sell that stuff by the pound rather than individually priced, or it goes into the export markets, in many cases, and goes overseas. GROSS: I was surprised to read about some of the things that don't sell at thrift stores, things that you'd think - at least that I'd think - had value. Like, the examples you give are, like, oak dining room sets, exercise equipment. A big old oak dining room set has very little resale value in a thrift store. MINTER: Well, there's a couple problems with a big oak dining room set. One, it's really, really heavy, and it's really hard to move. And people walk in, and they may say, well, you're going to give me that oak dining room set for, say, $25, and it might have cost hundreds, if not thousands, years before, but I'm going to actually have to put that in my car or in my pickup truck and move it. And, you know, in contemporary America, a lot of the people who are shopping these thrift stores and buying, you know, furniture out of them are people who move a lot. So, you know, someone who moves a lot isn't going to necessarily want to be moving, constantly, a 300-pound oak dining room table. GROSS: And what about exercise equipment, used exercise equipment? MINTER: For some reason, people just don't like to move it. One, it's really kind of awkward. A treadmill is not an easy thing to put in the back of your car unless it's one of those ones that you collapse. GROSS: So true (laughter). Yeah. MINTER: You know? GROSS: So what happens to the oak dining room set and the old exercise equipment that the thrift store cannot sell? MINTER: So the exercise equipment, a lot of that stuff ends up - if it's - if there's a lot of metal in it, it might go to a recycler, and they'll break it apart and at least get some of the metals out of it. Sometimes that stuff may, though, end up in a dumpster, and it's just going to end up in the landfill. The oak dining room set, depending on where you are, it may then move to another charity. And that's something that surprised me as well, is that we think of, you know, a Goodwill or a Salvation Army as the final destination, but in some cases, there are other destinations beyond them. There are, for example - you know, here in the Twin Cities, there is a charity called Bridging, which will actually take furniture - heavy furniture from other thrift stores, thrift operations, and then give it away or help, you know, immigrant families or destitute families furnish their homes with it. But it is the case - and I really looked into this - that you will see some of this very nice oak furniture - if it can't be sold, it will end up in the landfill. GROSS: Wow. So, you know, we started off talking about clearing your mother's home of her possessions after her death and how kind of challenging and emotionally fraught that was. So many people are in that situation, and a whole industry has developed out of that and also out of people moving a lot and they can't or don't want to take everything with them. So why don't you describe this new clean-out industry that's developed? MINTER: Sure. And it's not just in the United States; it's international. But it's been driven by two factors, really - demographics and affluence. So as populations age and children move away from home, you have an increasingly elderly population in the United States, for example, that wants to downsize for whatever reason, you know, into retirement housing or some other kind of senior housing. And that means that they need to get rid of their stuff that they've accumulated for a lifetime. So this profession has existed for centuries in a sense. There's always been scavengers going to people's homes as they leave them, but now it's taken on sort of a new tint. And what they do is they sort of counsel people on helping them get rid of the things, sometimes encourage them, sometimes nudge them, and then help them make the move. So in the United States, there's actually a association, the Association of - National Association of Move Managers with over 600 members, companies, that belong to it. And they are constantly helping people reduce their stuff and encouraging them to do it. And I also document a similar phenomenon in Japan where you have thousands of these companies, and it's slightly different there because Japan's population is shrinking so there aren't necessarily even heirs for this stuff. So it's a - it's an even more pressing duty, if you will. And in some cases, they're hired by governments to just help clean-out these apartments and figure out where to put this stuff. GROSS: So do people in the clean-out industry decide for you what you should keep and what you should throw away? MINTER: Well, no. I mean, in the back of their minds, they certainly do. I mean, they'll walk into a home and they've seen a lot of these and they'll say, you know, you don't need your grandmother's china and your mother's china and probably you don't need yours. But the challenges in many cases with seniors as they downsize is sort of convincing them of that fact. And so, you know, one of the things you see happen during these kinds of clean-outs is sort of nudging them along, you know, telling them that, hey, we can bring this somewhere where it will get reused. And over and over you get the sense, if you're around clean-outs and you're around move managers, and you're around people who are downsizing, or in many cases, if they're downsizing what was left behind by their parents after they've passed away, there's almost this primal need to feel that your stuff or your parent's stuff or your grandparent's stuff is wanted and used. And so part of - I wouldn't say the - I would say it's not a trick, it's more technique - is to, you know, sort of nudge people along and say, yes, there is somewhere for this stuff to be used. We can take it somewhere. I'll ensure you that somebody will want this, and that's a really big part of it. GROSS: So the clean-out industry is basically like, I'm moving, I'm downsizing, whatever. Here's all the stuff I don't need, I don't want. I don't want to have the burden of figuring out what to do with it or taking it someplace. I'll hire you; you deal with it. MINTER: Yeah, in many respects, that's true. But you'll deal with it. But sometimes, you're going to come in and deal with it with me and you're almost like a counselor. I mean, the very best of the clean-out professionals that I spent time with, they kind of reminded me of therapists, you know. And again, it was, you know, having to sit with somebody and explain to them, you know, you don't need this. And that person explaining to the clean-out professional, you know, this wedding china, you know, when it was given to me 50, 60 years ago I was going to keep it forever, you know. And now I'm downsizing and you're asking me to let go of this wedding china, which, you know, isn't just this material thing that I put in a cabinet and looks pretty, but it's really a part of my identity. And what's so emotionally jarring and I found myself many times in the course of these clean-outs that I witnessed, you know, feeling emotional as well, is that you see people really taking apart their identities. Because, you know, in contemporary America, you know, in Japan, where I spent a bunch of time, I mean, we increasingly sort of build up who we are on the basis of the things that we have owned and acquired over the years. So that's why you sort of need this counselor, this therapist, in many cases, to help you do this or to help your parents or grandparents do this. GROSS: There's also the whole Marie Kondo phenomenon where, like, you're supposed to keep what brings you joy and discard everything else so that you can downsize. Do you think that that whole - that whole approach is having an effect on the reused business? MINTER: Well, you've certainly heard from Goodwills in particular that when the Marie Kondo television show was very popular, you know, back in January I believe it was, that they saw a surge in donations and that's continued. But sort of anecdotally, what I think has happened is, you know, people have decluttered, but it's more often than not just given them more room to acquire more stuff. And, you know, and that's very interesting because I think some folks sort of embraced Marie Kondo as almost a sustainable movement, an ecological movement - downsize your stuff. But interestingly, she's never been somebody who's sort of embraced that view of what she does. In fact, it's just in recent weeks that she's announced her own product line of organizing, you know, materials, boxes, et cetera, et cetera. She's always been more about sort of personal edification and, you know, and in these contemporary consumer societies, you know, personal edification is often revolves around consumption and so I don't think it's helped. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Adam Minter. He's the author of the new book \"Secondhand: Travels In The New Global Garage Sale. \" He's also the author of the earlier book \"Junkyard Planet. \" We'll be right back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF DAN AUERBACH SONG, \"HEARTBROKEN, IN DISREPAIR\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Adam Minter. He's been covering waste and recycling for nearly two decades. He's the author of the new book, \"Secondhand: Travels In The New Global Garage Sale. \" So one of the things you point out in your book is that as of 2017, there were 54,000 mini storage sites in the U. S. And I know just driving around Philadelphia, there are these storage sites, like, all over. And I think that's in part because so many of us live in apartments or homes, you know, that are just really too small for our needs, and there's no closet space. So you rent a closet space. I think a lot of people know this drill. Or, you know, you've just moved to town and you need a place to store your stuff until you actually find a place to live. But what impact is that having, all these mini storage sites, on what you're looking at, which is the reuse industry? MINTER: Yeah, well, it's - there's sort of a - you know, the mini storage sites are sort of a symptom of this metastasizing accumulation that we do. And that's why you see them continue to sprout up. And I actually went on clean-outs that were in storage units. After we finished, you know, cleaning out the house, then you go to the storage units. And I opened the book with one of these storage unit clean-outs. And it's really troubling, in some ways, because depending on where you are, people can actually pay more per square foot for a storage unit than they would for residential rental space. So we're actually paying more to store our stuff than we are sort of to store ourselves. You know, for the reuse industry, it's sort of a mixed blessing. I mean, the reuse industry thrives on having access to stuff, in particular, good stuff. But increasingly, what we see in the United States in particular is that the quality of the stuff that people are acquiring - because we're acquiring more every year - is declining. So all that stuff that's filling up these storage units isn't necessarily what my grandmother would call merchandise. It's stuff that's going to go in the donation door at a thrift store and ultimately going to find its way, you know, into a dumpster or a recycling bin. It's not going to be reused. GROSS: Because the quality isn't good enough to be reusable? MINTER: Exactly. I mean, it's just - it's a decline in quality overall. I mean, if you think back, you know, say 20, 25 years ago, a television that was 10 years old was something that could be reused, it could be refurbished and reused because those were tube televisions, CRTs, as they're called in the industry. They were, you know, they were very heavy, but they were also very robust. But these days, you can go and you can buy yourself a flat panel television at an electronics retailer - I saw it over, you know, the recent Black Friday period - and you can buy that flat-panel for $150. But in a sense, you get what you pay for. You get a cheap television that maybe will last three years. So, you know, when you go into storage units and see these flat-panel TVs, you know, sitting in them, somebody may have thought, well, I'm just going to store it here for a couple of years. By the time it's opened up and people say, it's time to donate this stuff, that's not merchandise. That's something that's going to go to an electronics recycler. And that kind of phenomenon is increasing. The volume of stuff is increasing, but the volume of good stuff amongst the stuff, if you will, is declining. GROSS: OK. So let's get back to the thrift stores. How do they sort to decide what's going to the trash or the landfill and what's happening to the rest of it? MINTER: Sure. Well, if - let's use apparel as an example. If you go to the donation rooms and sorting rooms that I spent time in in Tucson, you know, there'll be, you know, large carts full of clothing, and they will go to sorters who, first of all, sort of have almost like a flow chart. It's a list of brands. There'll be some, I think it's around 85 to 90 brands on there. And they will tell the sorters how to price those. But on top of that, they go through and they feel the fabric. You know, is it thin? Does it feel like something that's going to fall apart after one to five washes? And that's really important because you can tell these sorters there's a brand here and it should be priced $2. 99, but the sorters will tell you, you know, these brands are declining in quality, and I had that conversation over and over. They would refer to a brand and say, well, it used to be a pretty good $2. 99 brand, meaning we'd price it at $2. 99, but we really feel it now because it's not as good as it was when it was first labeled $2. 99. And when that happens, it'll go into perhaps a bin that isn't designed to go out to the store, but it might go to what is called an as-is bin, which would be something that's sold to a rag maker, or maybe sold as stuffing, recycled in that sense. It's not recycled for use. And then you will go through there, and you will find garments that simply don't even belong going to the rag makers or the stuffing. That may be something like undergarments, that may be something that's just so badly soiled that, you know, you couldn't in good conscience send it to anybody, so it would go into the trash bin. So it's a very - you know, there's an objective side to it, but there's also sort of the subjective side that requires the sorters in these rooms just talking about apparel to use their subjective knowledge that they've acquired as they've spent time with thousands and thousands of garments over periods of time, you know, to make that call. GROSS: My guest is journalist Adam Minter, author of the new book \"Secondhand. \" After a break, we'll talk more about the afterlife of the stuff you donate to thrift stores. We'll talk about recycling and about growing up in a family that owned a junkyard. And Ken Tucker will review the comeback album by Hootie & the Blowfish. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF THOMAS NEWMAN SONG, \"WALL-E\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with journalist Adam Minter, who covers the waste and recycling industries and is a columnist for Bloomberg Opinion. His new book, \"Secondhand,\" is about what happens to your clothes, furniture and electronics after you've donated them to the Goodwill or thrift store, with an emphasis on what happens to the stuff no one wants to buy. His previous book, \"Junkyard Planet,\" was about the recycling industry. When we left off, we were talking about the sorters, the professionals who sort through thrift store donations to determine what can be sold and what can't. The garments that are too stained or worn to be sold can often be recycled into rags. So if a sorter determines that an article of clothing or a blanket or whatever is no longer usable but it can be recycled for, like, rags or stuffing, does the fabric make a difference in what the afterlife is going to be? Is cotton going to be recycled differently than polyester or vegan leather? MINTER: The answer to that is yes. I always have wanted to report on what's called the rag industry. And it's - I call them the original recyclers, and they've existed for a couple hundred years as an industrial enterprise. These are companies that take old clothes, old hospital gowns, old bed sheets, and they cut them up into rags that are then sold to everyone from hotels and bars to wipe down counters to car washes to wipe down your windshield. And it's usually the last use of a garment or a bedsheet. And historically, they haven't really had to worry that much about the quality of the fabric coming through their doors - fabric that may be bought from thrift stores, may be bought from hospitals, may be bought from hotels. But in the last few years, that's changed, and it's changed because clothing became cheaper. And the way it became cheaper, one of the ways it became cheaper, is that manufacturers started weaving polyester into the cotton. And if you talk to rag-makers - and it's a really big industry in the United States and around the world. It handles probably one-third of the clothing that's tossed out every year. If you talk to them, they'll tell you it used to be that you get something labeled 100% cotton and it really was 100% cotton. But increasingly, 100% cotton doesn't mean 100% cotton, and that has a real impact on the recycling. So if you make a rag that, say, has some polyester in it with that cotton and you sell it to, say, an oil and gas company to wipe down leaks, as we all know, polyester picks up static electricity, and so that becomes an explosion risk. GROSS: Wow. And I guess a more obvious problem about polyester is that it's not absorbent for a rag. MINTER: Right. Exactly. And, you know - and the rag industry, again, it sounds like it's sort of this, you know, very rudimentary - I don't want to say primitive - but very basic kind of industry. But it's not. There's a level of sophistication there. Again, a rag, as Todd Wilson of Star Wipers - that's the company I spent time with for the book. He told me it's a tool, and you need to be able to customize that tool for its use. And so if you're looking to create an absorbent rag, no, I mean, polyester doesn't absorb anything. And that gets really interesting. So one of the things I saw when I was with Star Wipers - they're based in Newark, Ohio - is they were actually importing castoffs from textile T-shirt factories in Bangladesh. And I believe they were getting a load every couple weeks. And so these are cuttings from factories in Bangladesh. And they come in, and they were cotton T-shirts - maybe they had some poly in them. I'm not exactly sure. But, you know, when you buy a new T-shirt, you know, it feels kind of rough. And a new T-shirt doesn't absorb really well. The best T-shirts are the ones you've run through the wash over and over and over. So one of things that Star Wipers will do that I found fascinating is they actually have their own laundry. It's an incredible laundry machine. It's like a giant caterpillar. And they will wash these new textiles so they become soft like an old T-shirt, and then they are more absorbent, and they can sell them as merchandise. GROSS: So what happens to all the polyester clothes? How are they recycled? Are they used for stuffing? MINTER: So in many cases, yeah, they're used for stuffing. And there is - you know, that's another side of, you could say, the rag industry, is there is a large stuffing industry. And so polyester clothes can, you know, serve as great stuffing material, you know, like chairs and sofas. GROSS: So every step along the way in the world of recyclables, stuff is weeded out for use, and other stuff is sent to the next destination because nobody in the previous destination could figure out a use for it. So where do the goods go to die at the end of (laughter) this long run? MINTER: Yeah. I mean, they end up in the landfill or the incinerator. I mean, there is no green heaven, if you will (laughter). Everything wears out eventually, and everything gets tossed out. I mean, you know, we don't have many artifacts and many things that have - you know, were - you know, from the Colonial period in the United States that are in daily use anymore. They're in museums or they're in, you know, Colonial landfills, if you will. And that's you know, and that's the fate of stuff. That's the fate of our consumer societies. You know, if we spend our time thinking, you know, this is going to be used perpetually, forever - even the best-made garment, you know, the most robust smartphone - we're deluding ourselves a bit. Eventually, everything has to die, and that's sort of the dark side of consumerism. Certainly, metals can be recycled over and over, but you even lose a little bit of metal every time in the recycling process. So it's sort of the ultimate story of consumerism, and it's the dark side. We can't really delude ourselves into thinking everything lasts forever. GROSS: Does it make environmental sense that the goods that can't be sold in the thrift stores in the U. S. , many of them get exported to distant countries and they might get exported yet again to another country after that? I mean, when you think of all of the fuel being used to transport these possessions - well, former possessions (laughter), this stuff - I mean, does that make sense? MINTER: It does. And there's a couple reasons for that. One is we know just from doing what is called a life cycle assessment of products. A life cycle assessment is basically where somebody goes and looks at the full environmental impact of a product - say, a smartphone - from manufacturing to disposal, and, you know, looks at what the air pollution impacts are, the mining impacts, the carbon impacts. And the one thing we do know is that the biggest impact of most products is the manufacturing side. And so if you want to reduce the environmental impact of your consumption, the best way to do that is to not manufacture more stuff. In that sense, the best thing you can do is not buy more stuff. And so the longer that your product lasts, the longer that you use that smartphone, the less likely it is that you're going to be buying a new one. So the goal really should be to keep your stuff in use for as long as possible, whether it's by you or somebody in Ghana or somebody in Cambodia. So in that sense, it's a really good thing because if somebody in Cambodia is using your phone, they're probably not buying a new cheap handset there. In terms of the shipping, that's a really interesting story. And one of the reasons why you've seen globalization of recycling and reuse work over the years is because people are buying so much new stuff. Let me give China as an example. You know, during the boom years of sort of the China-U. S. recycling trade, you saw so much U. S. recycling moved to China in part because China was sending so many boxes, so many shipping containers of new stuff to the United States, and they wanted to get those containers back to China so they could send Americans more new stuff. So what would happen is the shipping companies would massively discount those containers to sometimes around 10% of what it would cost to send something from China to the U. S. So it made it very cheap to send stuff there, but in a sense, it was a free ride because those containers were going back anyway. So many of the places that are buying used goods from developed countries sort of have that same relationship. Japan and Malaysia - Malaysia exports a lot of new stuff to Japan. Those containers need to get back to Malaysia, so why not fill them with new stuff? It's kind of - I always think of it as kind of almost like a carbon-free free ride. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Adam Minter. He's the author of the new book \"Secondhand: Travels In The New Global Garage Sale. \" Let's take a short break, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF ALLEN TOUSSAINT'S \"EGYPTIAN FANTASY\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Adam Minter, author of the new book \"Secondhand: Travels In The New Global Garage Sale. \" And he's been covering the waste and recycling industries for nearly two decades. So your family - you had, like, three generations of people in the junk business? MINTER: Yeah, dating back to my great grandfather. GROSS: Who came here and was a rag picker. What did that mean then? MINTER: Sure. Well, when he arrived in Galveston, Texas, from Russia, he didn't speak English, didn't have any skills. He did what, you know, so many immigrants did - they literally started looking for value where no one else did, and that meant walking down the streets of Galveston looking for, you know, pieces of clothing that he could sell to a recycler. And as you, you know, get a few pennies in your pocket, then maybe you start going door to door and asking people, you know, at their doors, do you have some, you know, old clothes that you'd like to sell that I could buy? And then he would go and he would upsell those. If you're good at it, go from, you know, carrying around rags in a backpack to carrying them on a handcart to carrying them on a horse-drawn cart to a truck and maybe, at some point, acquiring a piece of land where you can do this business. He eventually made his way up to Minneapolis. You know, he would deal in anything used, anything that other people didn't see value in but he knew he could upsell in some way. And he ultimately started specializing in scrap metal, and so he founded a scrap metal business up in the Twin Cities. GROSS: And your family had a junkyard, too? Was that the scrap metal junkyard? MINTER: Yeah. The family junkyard, dating back to my great-grandfather, sort of split, and there were two. There's one still there. And my father - we actually had to sell off the old junkyard in Minneapolis because the city wanted the land. But my father, who just turned 78, he's in the business still, sort of still growing it. GROSS: And the scrap metal junk business, was there, like, a car flattener to junk cars? MINTER: Oh, sure. So we - Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, a scrap yard is - (laughter) you know, the - OSHA's probably going to hate this, but a scrap yard is a wonderful thing for a small child to grow up in (laughter). You know, it's a wonderland, if you will. I loved, as a kid, watching our car flattener. You know, we were in the junk car business. And the cars would come in, and people - you know, we'd pull out the motors, and then it would go into a flattener, and you'd see these cars flattened. And then they'd be piled up on trucks and driven, you know, to the steel mill, where they'd be, you know, melted into new steel. We had a warehouse, which I loved to walk around in. You know, I have very clear memories as a toddler walking around that warehouse and looking into boxes and barrels. And, you know, there'd be plumber scrap, or there would be electrician scrap, or there would be, you know, defective molds from a factory that was making, you know, it could be, you know, figurines, brass figurines. And so it was a real wonderland. And as a child, it really impresses upon you that there is so much value out there in the world that other people don't see, and that value is an opportunity for yourself and your family. GROSS: Are there objects you've saved from your childhood, when you were roaming through the junkyard? MINTER: Oh, absolutely. You know, the - one of the great treasures I have - and I still can't believe I have it - is a sign from the Great Northern Railway, which is now a defunct railway. And there are railway collectors out there all over the world, and something like that is a real treasure. I have little animal figurines, brass figurines. We used to get a lot of those for some reason, and so we would always want to grab those. And, you know, oftentimes the best stuff, you know, was stuff that I would find with my grandmother, who would take me out into the warehouse, and she would go snooping in the boxes, often much to the chagrin of my father, and he would worry about her out there. And we would find all kinds of - you know, of great things. Oftentimes just figurines and - or, you know, bits of toys or just interesting - even - I can remember just interesting brass plumbing scrap. You know, there'd be an odd-shaped pipe, and we'd grab it out of there just because we thought it'd be interesting to put on a shelf. GROSS: So I've watched too many movies, but did you ever find a dead body? MINTER: We did not find a dead body. But I remember very clearly - soon as you brought that up (laughter) - one Halloween - seriously, one Halloween, the Minneapolis Police Department towed in a car in which there had been a shooting in the back seat, and it was a bloody, bloody mess. It was exactly what you expected to turn up at your scrap yard on a Halloween. And then we flattened it. And, you know, we didn't get much of that business. But I've talked to other scrap yard owners over the years who, you know, have recycled that kind of thing over and over. It exists and people don't want to keep those cars. GROSS: What was your reaction when you saw it as a kid? MINTER: I was fascinated, you know, as an 8, 9-year-old child would often be. It didn't scare me, I think, or upset me. I think it would upset me a lot if I saw something like that now. GROSS: So I have a recycling question for you. MINTER: Sure. GROSS: I am really confused right now about what's happening to the plastics and paper that I recycle. I've heard that China isn't accepting our recycling anymore, at least not as much as they used to. I don't know where it's going instead. I'm not even sure which plastics are considered recyclable anymore and what kind of paper is going to not be recyclable because if it has certain finishes on it, it won't be recyclable. So I just feel like I'm going through the motions and I don't know if I'm really accomplishing anything, so help me out. MINTER: Sure. Well, you are definitely accomplishing something and recycling is still a very good thing to do. Metals and paper are still widely recycled. There are still markets for them. They are not as strong as they used to be, and that's in large part because the global economy and especially China's economy has slowed down. And they were really the engine for buying that stuff and using it in new goods. But if you put, you know, a piece of paper, a piece of cardboard in your recycling bin, it's going to be recycled in some form, in some place. Some of it will be recycled in the United States and there's more and more recycling capacity being built, you know, as we speak in the United States and that's really exciting. And in terms of paper, I mean, I just, you know, I always recommend people follow the guidelines from your municipality or whoever runs your recycling program. You know, everybody has different markets, every municipality has different markets. And they will tell you what they are capable of selling, you know, to mills and to, you know, whether they're domestic or overseas. Plastics, in some sense is the same thing. You know, if they don't have markets for these kinds of plastics that you are generating at home, they're going to tell you whether or not that they can recycle it. And there are, you know, recycling programs in the United States who have started, you know, limiting the amount of plastics, the types of plastics, that they will be willing to recycle. In terms of plastics that can be really easily recycled, the one that is easiest and there is always going to be some kind of robust market for is PET. So that's, you know, the bottles you get, whether it be a water bottle, a Coke bottle. And that can be used in any number of different applications from, you know, bottle to bottle recycling, if you will. It's also used in clothing. PET is, you know, is a type of polyester in a sense and so it can be woven into clothing. GROSS: If you're unsure about a plastic, should you recycle it or not? If you recycle it and they can't use it, are you going to be ruining that whole batch? MINTER: So it depends on where you are. But generally, if you're unsure, I would say put it in the trash. And I know some of your listeners are going to hate hearing that. But the worst thing you can do to sort of your recycling program is to contribute what's known in the industry as contamination. So contamination just means it's a type of material that is not like the other materials. You have to think of recycling - ultimately, your recycling is it's not an environmental good, it's a commodity. And, you know, you're recycling program is all about creating a commodity that it can sell to manufacturers. So if somebody is buying, you know, pure wood pulp to make into cardboard boxes, they certainly don't want a bunch of, you know, M&M wrappers in it. Not to pick on M&Ms, but they don't want plastics in it. It makes it harder to manufacture, it may lower the quality of that wood pulp. And the same goes for, you know, a bunch of cardboard boxes, you know, that you may put into your recycling bin. The last thing you want is to have, you know, plastic wrappers in there that will make it harder to make a quality product from that cardboard. So, you know, in the first book, I describe, you know, household recycling. It's not really recycling. Recycling is what happens at the paper mill. What you're doing in your home is harvesting. You're harvesting the stuff for the people who are actually doing the recycling. And so in a sense, to be a good harvester of your recycling, you want to make things as clean and pure as you can. GROSS: Well, Adam Minter, I want to thank you so much for talking with us. MINTER: Thank you for having me. GROSS: Adam Minter is the author of the new book \"Secondhand. \" After a break, rock critic Ken Tucker will review the new comeback album by Hootie & the Blowfish. This is FRESH AIR.

The unemployment rate is as low as it's been in a half-century. But men in their prime working years are much more likely to be unemployed than they once were. Ten years after the Great Recession, many men have fallen through the cracks of the labor force, especially in rural areas. Here's NPR's Jim Zarroli. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: It's mid-afternoon on a sunny autumn day. But David Pierce is doing what he often does, sitting inside at his dining room table. He lives in the sleepy New York town of Apalachin. Until a few years ago, Pierce was busy and active. He worked as a chef and caterer. He did community theater. Then, in his mid-50s, he was sidelined by diabetes. He had to have part of a foot removed. DAVID PIERCE: My health just went - got really downhill. It really took a turn for the worse. I was just - I couldn't maintain even a part-time schedule. ZARROLI: Now he spends his days listening to classical music and surfing the net. LONNA: Yeah. He's changed a lot. Well, we can't do what we did together, that's the thing that makes it the harder. And of course, it's wearing on, you know, on a marriage when you're not doing things together. And that's sad, you know. I mean, obviously, that's why you get married, you want to have a partner. ZARROLI: And with David not working, money's tight. Lonna is a retired school librarian, but she's gone back to work temporarily. They're having to sell a rental house they own. A year ago, Pierce went on disability, officially leaving the workforce for good. He's got plenty of company. The job market has rebounded sharply from a decade ago. But economist Melissa Kearney of the University of Maryland says men ages 25 to 54 are still less likely to be employed than they once were. MELISSA KEARNEY: The employment rate among these prime age men is still far below what it was in the '80s and '70s. ZARROLI: In 1968, about 95% of men in their prime years were working. Today, even in a tight labor market, it's just 86%. Kearney says this decline has been almost entirely among those with a high school diploma or less or maybe a bit of college. These men once worked at the same rate as college graduates. Jonathan DeMarco hasn't had full-time work since 2006, when he was let go from a metal fabricating plant. He still looks for a regular job. JONATHAN DEMARCO: Last one, Lowe's down in Oneonta, I told them right out. I was honest, said I have problems reading and writing. And they - I think that's the reason why they didn't hire me. ZARROLI: DeMarco has leathery skin and thick gray hair that stands up like a rooster's coxcomb. He concedes he's not well-suited to today's workplace. He doesn't like email. He can't understand why they won't let you smoke at work anymore. So he picks up odd jobs whenever he can find them. Like a lot of men in his situation, he depends on his wife to get by. She works in a factory. DEMARCO: Her health is not the greatest. She was out of work the end of last year, the beginning of this year for four or five months. That put us way behind in the bills. You know, it's really hard. ZARROLI: DeMarco lives in Schoharie County in the hilly farm country of upstate New York. The county's unemployment rate is a very low 3. 8%. But Gail Breen, executive director of a local employment office, says the numbers mask a larger problem. Factories have closed over the years. Many men stopped looking for work a long time ago, which means the government doesn't even count them as part of the workforce anymore. GAIL BREEN: There are a lot of hidden people in those numbers that don't have jobs. ZARROLI: Like a lot of rural places, this part of New York state doesn't have much public transportation. So even if you find a job, it can be tough to get to work. Forty-year-old Frank Altieri lives in Owego, a quaint, Victorian town along the Susquehanna River. He hasn't worked full-time since he got out of prison four years ago. FRANK ALTIERI: Well, today, it's pretty much dead around here. There's no - hardly no work around here. One restaurant that's sitting up here on North Ave. , he told me if I can get a car, I can do deliveries for him, and I'd get, like, 20% of that. ZARROLI: But he has no car, and he's not likely to get one anytime soon. Altieri points out that if he works, he and his wife could lose their food stamps and monthly disability check. So unless the pay is decent, it doesn't make much sense to get a job. In the past, men like Altieri could move to big cities to find work. They'd make more money there. But economist Melissa Kearney says that's not true anymore. KEARNEY: The wage premium for cities that everyone used to get, even that's disappeared for the non-college-educated. ZARROLI: Kearney says a high school graduate in New York City or Boston doesn't earn much more than someone in a rural area. And the city's a lot more expensive, so it doesn't make sense to move. On the other hand, having a job is not just about making money. Back in his dining room, David Pierce says that, as a chef, he used to spend all day on his feet cooking. Now he barely has the energy to make breakfast. And he's not really trained for office work. He's struggled with depression. He doesn't sleep well. PIERCE: I think, you know, for a man, it was disabling in the fact that my career is my identity, who I am. And to lose that really affected me. I no longer could identify as, you know, the guy that was a wonder with food. ZARROLI: The job market may be booming in much of the country right now, but a growing number of men in the prime of their lives have stopped working, and that can take a psychic toll.

This change could cut nearly 700,000 people from the Federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP. This new rule makes it more difficult for states to waive a requirement that able-bodied adults without children work at least 20 hours a week or else lose their benefits. Elaine Waxman has been researching the possible impact this could have across the country. She's a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and joins us this morning. Thanks for coming on. ELAINE WAXMAN: Good morning. Thanks for having me. GREENE: So what kind of impact should we expect from this? WAXMAN: Well, I think it could be really significant. As you noted, the administration itself suggests that about 700,000 adults are likely to lose benefits as a result of this change, and they don't expect them to actually find employment. So that's very concerning because we know that SNAP is a very effective program. It reduces food insecurity. It reduces poverty. It improves health outcomes. And so all else being equal, when fewer people are on SNAP who need it, we would expect more negative outcomes. GREENE: Just, you know, listening to the administration announce this yesterday, the agricultural secretary, Sonny Perdue, said, quote, \"we need to encourage people by giving them a helping hand but not allowing it to become an indefinitely giving hand. \" I mean, Purdue is making the point that, you know, that the role of Congress, the role of American taxpayers is to help people through difficult times, but that it's not open-ended. Is it unreasonable at some point to ask able-bodied adults to work 20 hours a week to keep these benefits? WAXMAN: I don't think anybody on SNAP would think it was unreasonable either. The bigger question is whether people are able to maintain stable work at a regular number of hours. It's true that the economy overall has greatly improved and - but that sort of general rate masks a lot of variation among counties and cities and states. And in addition, we have to remember that not all people face the same unemployment rate. So a number of people in this category may have fairly limited education. They may have less than a high school diploma. They may be unstably housed. Many of them have mental health or physical health conditions that interfere with work. And what we know from data is that when SNAP participants are able to work, they frequently do. So the characterization that somehow it's a way of life, I think was the phrase that was used, is just not borne out by the data. GREENE: Well, you mentioned that a lot of people find it hard to find stable work. I mean, what are the requirements? I mean, could you volunteer for a certain number of hours a week and keep another job for some hours and build up to 20 hours and use that as a justification for benefits if you need to? WAXMAN: Well, you can meet it in a couple of different ways. It's true that it's about 80 hours a month. And, you know, what we often see is that some people have no trouble meeting that at certain parts of the year. For example, they might have seasonal work, but other weeks they might not get any hours. One of the things that people can do is enroll in a SNAP employment and training program. The problem is that there are many more people who would benefit from that program than there are available slots. And the other thing that we know about those programs is that the number one activity that's usually supported is job referral or resume enhancement. And those are not things that necessarily connect people directly to stable employment. GREENE: So it sounds like there's some other - I mean, if this does go through - and we should say it's - you know, this could face litigation. It's not 100% clear that this rule will go in. But there are other things that people like you might lobby the government to do to help people if this rule goes into place. WAXMAN: Yes, I think that's a really good point. When we focus on work rules, we're not focusing on, really, the first part of that question which is work and the nature of work in the 21st century. So a lot more focus needs to be on the quality of that work and in helping people connect with stable work. GREENE: Elaine Waxman with the Urban Institute, thanks so much for joining us this morning.

U. S. employers added a whopping 266,000 jobs last month. That is the biggest jump since the beginning of the year. The jobs report was an early Christmas gift for Wall Street, where stock indexes jumped sharply. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 330 points. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The U. S. economy has now been adding jobs for a record 110 months in a row. At this point, it would not be surprising to see some drop-off in hiring, but that's not what the Labor Department found in November. TOM PHILIPSON: That's a tremendous report. HORSLEY: White House economist Tom Philipson notes job gains for the two previous months were also revised up by a total of 41,000. Since September, American employers have created an average of 205,000 jobs every month. Philipson says that's a marked increase from earlier this year. PHILIPSON: It's really picking up relative to what we've seen so far this year. So obviously, it's something we're very happy about. HORSLEY: The vast majority of November's jobs gains were in service industries, such as health care and restaurants. Economist Nick Bunker of the Indeed Hiring Lab says these are businesses that tend to be insulated from global shocks, like the president's trade war. NICK BUNKER: Their customers are here in the U. S. , and the U. S. consumer is still strong, and that's feeding into steady and stable employment growth for those industries. HORSLEY: Manufacturers, on the other hand, are not so immune to global forces. Other surveys have shown manufacturing to be slumping in recent months. BUNKER: These are industries that are more exposed to the global economy, which has slowed down considerably this year. HORSLEY: The jobs report showed a jump in manufacturing employment last month, but three-quarters of that was auto workers who'd been temporarily idled the month before by the UAW strike at General Motors. The unemployment rate dropped in November to just 3. 5%, matching its lowest level in nearly 50 years. Despite that low unemployment rate, Bunker says wage gains remain fairly modest. Average wages have risen just 3. 1% over the last year. BUNKER: Wage growth definitely continues to be the disappointment of jobs reports. HORSLEY: Wage growth was somewhat higher earlier in the year, but Philipson says even a 3% pay raise is more than enough to outpace inflation. PHILIPSON: We are actually seeing stronger real wage growth last year than we've seen before because inflation is ticking down. If you look at the purchasing power of that wage, it has increased the last year because prices have come down. HORSLEY: What's more, Philipson says, wage growth has been strongest at the bottom of the income ladder. PHILIPSON: Prior to Trump, workers' wages were growing slower than managers'. Now it's the exact opposite - that the disadvantaged groups are growing faster. HORSLEY: One factor that may be keeping a lid on wages is the steady flow of new workers entering or reentering the labor force. Bunker says that means the job market may not be quite so tight as the rock-bottom unemployment rate would indicate. BUNKER: As the labor market has gotten stronger, it's been pulling workers off the sideline. And that's one of the great trends of this recovery, is people, particularly in groups that are historically disadvantaged in the labor market, are getting more opportunities as employers are looking to fill positions, and they're going out and pulling workers in. HORSLEY: Hundreds of thousands of new workers joined the labor force in October, for example. But last month, that flow of new workers dropped off sharply. That could be just a temporary lull or a sign that, after more than nine years of job gains, the U. S. economy really is nearing full employment. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington. AILSA CHANG, HOST:  The American job market shows no sign of slowing; if anything, it's picking up steam. U. S. employers added a whopping 266,000 jobs last month. That is the biggest jump since the beginning of the year. The jobs report was an early Christmas gift for Wall Street, where stock indexes jumped sharply. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 330 points. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The U. S. economy has now been adding jobs for a record 110 months in a row. At this point, it would not be surprising to see some drop-off in hiring, but that's not what the Labor Department found in November. TOM PHILIPSON: That's a tremendous report.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)VEDANTAM: The week has just begun in Keystone, Iowa. We are here to bear witness to a family meeting - an intervention, if you will. RACHEL KRUSE: It got kind of rough towards the end of the week, didn't it? We didn't feel like such a family, did we? VEDANTAM: Rachel Kruse is running this meeting. The other participants are gathered around her in a circle. A couple of them fidget, but most listen attentively. KRUSE: So on Friday, we decided that today we needed to have a family meeting, all right? So this weekend, I found this book, and it's called \"It's Mine! \" So when I read this book, I want you to think about how last week went and how this week could go. VEDANTAM: This family meeting is taking place in a kindergarten classroom in a rural part of eastern Iowa. Rachel is the teacher, and the lesson she wants to share is one that could have a lasting impact on her students. The story is set on an island. KRUSE: (Reading) On the island lived three quarrelsome frogs named Milton, Rupert and Lydia. They quarreled and quibbled from dawn to dusk. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: They said, mine, mine. . . KRUSE: (Reading) Stay out of the pond, yelled Milton. The water is mine. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: That's not nice. KRUSE: (Reading) Get off the island, shouted Rupert. The Earth is mine. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: That's not nice. KRUSE: It's not, is it? VEDANTAM: Then, a flood swallows up the island. KRUSE: (Reading) There was only one rock left. And there the frogs huddled, trembling from cold and fright. But they felt better now that they were together, sharing the same fears and hopes. VEDANTAM: Eventually, the sky clears. The frogs swim together, hop after butterflies and rest in the weeds. KRUSE: Right, we can work together, can't we? Because at the beginning of the story, when they were saying, it's mine, it's mine, was anybody having fun? UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: No. KRUSE: No. VEDANTAM: The kids get it. The frogs are happier when they stop being selfish. This is what it looks like to teach what are sometimes called soft skills, the kind of skills that kids don't get asked about on tests. Of course, Rachel teaches the other things you'd expect - counting. . . KRUSE: Four, five. . . UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Four, five. . . VEDANTAM: . . . Reading and pronunciation. . . KRUSE: Fish. Fish. UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Fish. Fish. VEDANTAM: But lessons like this one about the selfish frogs might have the greatest impact. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: In fact, this impact can actually be quantified in dollars. Today, we ask some questions with big implications. Can you put an economic value on a great kindergarten teacher? How is it that two children living just a few blocks from each other can have radically different chances in life? What is it that gives Salt Lake City an edge over Cleveland when it comes to offering people a better life than their parents? The state of your American dream - this week on HIDDEN BRAIN. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: The stories we tell about ourselves, stories of success and stories of failure, often have their beginnings in the distant past - sometimes in our childhoods, sometimes before we were even born. My guest today has explored this idea using hard data drawn from tens of millions of people. It's difficult to describe the range of things he does, except to say that Raj Chetty, an economist at Harvard University, might be the foremost authority today on the state of the American dream. Raj, welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. RAJ CHETTY: Thank you, Shankar. It's a pleasure to be here. VEDANTAM: I want to begin by looking at snapshots in time, Raj. And these are moments from your own life that I think explain a great deal about your work. The first snapshot is when you're living in New Delhi in India, and you go to see the Taj Mahal. It's a few hours from your home in Delhi. What do you see? CHETTY: Well, it was the first time I'd been to the Taj Mahal. And, you know, of course, like everyone, it's overwhelming in its beauty and how impressive of a monument it is. But I think what I was most struck by is after then coming back out of the monument, which was very immaculately kept and maintained, seeing the abject poverty outside the Taj Mahal - people begging for money, kids who don't have clothes, who are on the street, you know, don't have adequate food. Certainly, I was exposed to inequality, you know, throughout childhood, but I think this was just such a vivid version of it that stuck in my mind for many years. VEDANTAM: A couple of years after you visit Taj Mahal, your family immigrates to the United States. You are in a private school in Milwaukee. You play tennis and chess, and so you visit other schools in the area for competitions. What do you see? CHETTY: So a similar experience, actually. So I went to a private school on the north side of Milwaukee called University School. And we'd compete with other schools in, as you said, in tennis and chess. And you'd just see, again, the remarkable differences in the physical structure of these schools. So the school that I went to was on something like a 150-acre campus with lots of college-level classes. And in contrast, you know, the schools we'd visit were public schools in the city of Milwaukee, which, as you might know, these are schools that have faced a lot of challenges. And that was just evident, you know, as a child, seeing the opportunities kids there had, talking to them about the types of classes they could take - again, just really seeing a world with tremendous inequity and wondering, you know, how did I end up in this position? And how did these kids, who, at some level, were very similar - we're sitting on different sides of the chessboard - how did they end up in a different position in terms of what they had and opportunities? VEDANTAM: So let's take these ideas from these snapshots - you know, questions related to inequality, to segregation and to opportunity - and dive into some of the research that you've conducted. You once did a study that determined the precise value of having a great kindergarten teacher. Tell me about that study and what the value is that you computed. CHETTY: Yeah. So social scientists have, for a long time, been studying and been interested in understanding how education affects kids' outcomes. Most prior studies that have been done look at impacts on outcomes like test scores. So if you have a better teacher, for instance, or if you're in a smaller classroom, do you do better as measured by standardized tests? Now, one of the puzzling findings from that earlier work is that you tend to find that if you're in what you might think of as a better classroom - let's take, as a concrete example, classroom with a smaller number of kids - you tend to see that kids in those types of classes tend to have higher test scores at the end of that school year, but those gains quickly fade away. So that is if I was in a better kindergarten classroom, I'm doing better at the end of kindergarten but only a little better at the end of first grade. And by the time I'm in second or third grade, my performance on standardized tests basically looks comparable to other kids who were in different classes. So that - I think that fade-out pattern, led to a lot of discouragement among education researchers, saying, oh, it looks like these interventions that we're all studying - reducing class size, trying to improve teacher quality, so forth - they seem to have some impacts, but these impacts don't seem to last. So, you know, is this kind of a losing cause in the long run? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: The fade-out effect was discouraging. But Raj had a hunch that maybe the long-term research had not tracked the kids long enough. He found data from an older experiment from Tennessee. The students in this experiment had been randomly assigned to different kindergarten classrooms within their schools. Some had small class sizes of about 15 students. Others were placed in classes that had about 25 students. Raj and his colleagues did something novel with the data to discover the long-term - the really long-term - effects of kindergarten classrooms on students. CHETTY: We take kind of a big-data approach and link the school district records for those 12,000 kids to income tax records and Social Security records many years later that basically allow us to ask, how did your earnings when you're, say, 25 or 30 years old, vary depending upon which kindergarten classroom you were assigned to? So what this allows you to do is go beyond asking, what are the impacts of these interventions on test scores? - and ask, what are the impacts on things we actually care about at the end of the day? - the types of jobs people end up getting, how much they're earning, whether they go to college or not, and so forth. And what you end up finding, in a nutshell, is actually quite striking, which is even though you see this fade-out pattern that I was describing in terms of test score achievement, the gains actually reemerge in adulthood. The children who were assigned to better teachers, to smaller classes, are doing significantly better as adults, showing that early childhood education does, in fact, have lasting impacts, even though, curiously, those impacts don't seem to last in terms of test scores. VEDANTAM: I mean, it's a remarkable finding because I think when most of us think about it, we sort of say, well, schooling is important. But if you were to ask me, does what happen in kindergarten affect you when you're 30 years old? - I would have to say it's probably really marginal. But that's not what you're finding. CHETTY: Yeah. And so, to be clear, it is one of many, many different things that matters, right? So I would not say the kindergarten classroom that you're in sort of determines your fate. It's one of a hundred things that influences your outcomes. However, if, on average, you're assigned to a better teacher or to a smaller class, we see measurable improvements in children's outcomes on the order of thousands of dollars of earnings per year. And so the kind of quantification of that, that we put out in that paper, is you can think of having a better kindergarten teacher as being worth something like $300,000 for a classroom of students. VEDANTAM: That $300,000 figure is an estimate of how much more the kids in the class would earn over their lifetimes. It's the difference between the earnings from a class with a high-quality kindergarten teacher and a class with an average teacher. While Raj has found a way to quantify the economic value of a great kindergarten teacher, he has found it harder to identify what exactly makes a great kindergarten teacher. It turns out that credentials, like where a teacher went to college, are not very helpful in predicting whether someone's going to be a good teacher. So Raj looked instead at how teachers taught their students. CHETTY: It's less about, you know, you're very good at explaining certain mathematical concepts and something a little bit more nebulous about how well, for instance, you're able to manage a classroom of small children, some of whom might end up being disruptive. Are you able to keep people focused? Are you able to inspire people? How you go about measuring those things systematically, I think, is a very interesting question. And even more importantly, how can we then, perhaps, train teachers to do better on those dimensions? That would be incredibly valuable. But at the moment, I think the best summary is we don't quite know yet. VEDANTAM: Let's stick with this theory that in some ways, what's happening - the difference between the great teacher and the not-so-great teacher might not necessarily be, you know, is one teacher better at teaching the alphabet or teaching the children to count numbers? - but is communicating something else, something else that actually has, you know, not necessarily immediate benefits in the next year or two, but actually has potentially large benefits over the course of a lifetime. What kind of skills might those be? CHETTY: Yeah, so I think, you know, examples of those kinds of skills might be what we'd call noncognitive skills. Or sometimes they're called soft skills - so not the, you know, are you able to do what's measured commonly on standardized tests? But rather, how well do you get along with others? And how disciplined are you? How focused are you? So that's not just speculation. In fact, as part of this study, we have some evidence that supports exactly that kind of reasoning. So it turns out in this Tennessee STAR experiment, they took these students in eighth grade and had their teachers rate them on 28 different measures of noncognitive skills - so asking them, the teacher, does this student get along well with his or her peers? Is the student able to concentrate and so forth? And what's really interesting is that the students who had better kindergarten classrooms, they score significantly higher on these noncognitive measures. So you're seeing persistent gains that last for at least eight years on these noncognitive dimensions. And moreover, if you look at what correlates more strongly with later outcomes in adulthood, like earnings, employment rates, college attendance, it's actually these noncognitive measures that are more predictive than the traditional cognitive skills that we tend to focus on. That is, if I ask, which is more predictive of how much you will earn, someone who gets along well with their peers or someone who scores very high on math tests? - it's the person who gets along with other people that, on average, is doing better in adulthood. You know, putting all those pieces of evidence together, my reading is that early environments and classrooms, teachers and so on, matter not because of the technical skills you're learning but because of this broader set of skills that have big payoffs in the labor market. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: When we come back, we move from classrooms to neighborhoods, how the neighborhood you live in could be an engine for success or a brake on your ambitions. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)VEDANTAM: There's a core belief that's embedded in the story of America. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH MONTAGE)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The idea that if you're willing to work hard, it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from or what you look like. PRESIDENT GEORGE W BUSH: And together we will create an America that is open, so every citizen has access to the American dream. VEDANTAM: The American dream, this idea that it's possible for anyone to climb the economic ladder and have a stable, prosperous life, this idea has endured across generations. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH MONTAGE)PRESIDENT LYNDON B JOHNSON: A dream of a place where a free man could build for himself and raise his children to a better life. PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN: That dream is the heart and soul of America. It's the promise that keeps our nation forever good and generous. VEDANTAM: But increasingly, many people have come to question whether this dream is possible anymore. Both Republicans and Democrats have argued the American dream is unraveling. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH MONTAGE)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The American dream is dead. ELIZABETH WARREN: You and I may be the first generation in American history to see our kids do worse than we did. VEDANTAM: Raj Chetty says economic mobility has fallen in the U. S. compared to 50 years ago. Far fewer people today are doing better than their parents. But when you take a close look at the data, the picture that emerges is much more nuanced. CHETTY: So think about upward mobility in the context of the classic rags-to-riches kind of notion. Suppose you're a kid growing up in a low-income family, say, the bottom fifth of the income distribution. What are your odds of reaching the top fifth of the income distribution, making THAT leap from the bottom to the top? So it turns out, if you look at the U. S. as a whole, that number is 7. 5%. Seven-and-a-half percent of kids who start out in a relatively low-income family will end up reaching the top fifth on average. But if you then break that data down and ask, how does that vary depending upon which state or which county you're growing up in? - you see that it actually varies dramatically. So in certain parts of the U. S. - for example, in rural Iowa or much of the Great Plains or certain cities like Salt Lake City or San Francisco, for example - your odds of rising from the bottom fifth to the top fifth are something like 14 or 15 percent, twice as high as the national average. In contrast, if you look at the other end of the spectrum - look at cities like Charlotte, N. C. , Atlanta, Ga. , or more generally, much of the southeastern United States or places in the industrial Midwest, like Detroit or Cleveland - your odds of rising from the bottom to the top are below 5 percent, sometimes even only 3. 5 or 4 percent. Now, those differences that I just mentioned, they're quite substantial. They're basically saying that for a given child, your odds of making it to the middle class or to the upper-middle class are two or three times higher if you happen to be growing up in one place relative to another. And so what I often say is people ask, you know, is the American dream alive or not today? And I actually think the question itself is sort of ill-posed. The term the American dream - really, we should think of it as the Iowa dream or the Atlanta dream or the California dream because there's so much variation within this country. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: So one of the big insights of this work in some ways is that rather than looking at the nation as a whole, it's actually useful to look at these, you know, metropolitan areas or cities because in some ways, they paint very different pictures. But in your most recent work, you've actually taken this a step further and said you can actually look within cities and find even more granular details about the state of upward mobility. Talk to me about this work. CHETTY: Yeah, that's exactly right. So as we've been proceeding on this work, we've been taking the approach of kind of going to finer and finer levels of geography. So the Atlanta versus Salt Lake City or San Francisco contrast, I think, is interesting. But what was even more surprising to us is if I look within Atlanta or I look within Los Angeles, turns out you can essentially see the same amount of variation that you see in the U. S. as a whole when you look within a few miles in a given city. So to give you some specific examples again, let's focus on the city of Los Angeles, to take one case. So many people are familiar with certain neighborhoods in Los Angeles, like Compton and Watts, which have been known for many decades to be tough areas with high rates of crime, high rates of poverty and adverse outcomes due to various structural factors. Now, we showed that kids who grow up in those specific neighborhoods - so, for instance, kids who grow up in Watts, and black men in particular who grow up in that area - have very adverse outcomes. So for example, black men who grow up in low-income families in Watts on average have earnings of only $7,000 a year in their mid-30s. And that is the average, right? So that means that the vast majority of these men have incomes very close to zero. They're nonworking and so forth. Another somewhat shocking statistic - black men growing up in that particular census tract have something like a 45% chance of being incarcerated on any given day, which means that their lifetime chance of ever being incarcerated is much higher, you know, could well be something like 70 or 80%. VEDANTAM: Did you say on any given day? CHETTY: On a given day. On a given day - the date of the 2010 census, 45% of the black men who grew up in this tract in Watts - it's called the Nickerson Gardens public housing project. Forty-five percent of them are incarcerated. It's a shocking statement about, I mean, the United States, I think, that we have such high levels of incarceration in certain cases. But that is a fact about that tract. Now, you know, at some level, for people living in LA - maybe shocked by that magnitude, but maybe not surprised by the fact that there are very adverse outcomes for kids growing up in that area. Here's maybe something you didn't know, though. If you go a mile or two away, to Compton, you see that rates of incarceration for black men growing up there in families of comparable income are something like 6%. So still actually high - 6% is not a small number. But relative to 45%, it's dramatically lower. And so that's the sense in which when you look at these maps, which we've put out in the form of an interactive tool where you can look at your own address, look at any neighborhood in the United States - 70,000 different neighborhoods splitting up each of these cities into different areas - you see this tremendous variation across very short distances. For kids who grow up in families with comparable income, same racial background, where you're growing up really seems to matter. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Where you grow up really seems to matter. The question is, why? What explains the difference between Salt Lake City and Charlotte? CHETTY: So we don't know yet exactly what is the recipe to produce better outcomes in one place relative to another. But we've looked at a variety of different factors that economists and sociologists have talked about over the years as potentially driving differences in outcomes. And we've identified five or six different things that really seem like strong predictors of these differences. So the first is segregation. So cities that are more segregated by race or by income, where blacks and whites are not interacting as much or where low-income and high-income families are living separated from each other - segregated places like that tend to have much worse outcomes for people of all racial and ethnic groups. So that's one strong pattern in the data. VEDANTAM: Raj has found that upward mobility is less common in places that have a smaller middle class. He's also noticed some other patterns. CHETTY: We find that there's a very strong association between these outcomes and measures of family structure in a neighborhood. So in particular, one of the strongest patterns in the data is that areas where more kids are raised by two-parent families tend to have higher rates of upward mobility. Now, in interpreting that correlation, it's very important to note that it's not mechanically driven by the fact that growing up yourself in a two-parent family leads to better outcomes for a given kid. What we find is even if your own parents are married, if you grow up in an area where a lot of kids are being raised by single parents, you are less likely to climb the income ladder. So what that shows you is this is not the direct effect of your own parents' marital status. It's again something about community-level factors that are associated with the fraction of single parents in an area that's predictive of kids' outcomes. Now, somewhat related to that is the idea of social capital, a concept popularized by my Harvard colleague Bob Putnam. I think of the old adage that it takes a village to raise a child as a way to think about what social capital is. Will someone else help you out even if you're not doing well? Salt Lake City, with the Mormon Church, is thought to be a canonical example of a city with a lot of social capital and correspondingly has high rates of upward mobility. And so as best we can measure it, we find that places with higher levels of social capital tend to have higher levels of upward mobility. And then finally, I'll mention one last one. Coming back to our discussion about schools, as you might expect intuitively, places that have better schools tend to have higher rates of upward mobility. And I think that connection is particularly important to note because schools are something that I think fall clearly in the policy domain where we might be able to figure out how to make changes to improve the quality of schools. Some of the other factors I've been describing, while I think they're very important to study and interesting to understand, it's harder to figure out, what do you do to try to change social capital or family structures in an area? That's, I think, a little bit more complicated, at least to figure out from a policy point of view. VEDANTAM: So Raj established that where you grow up and the kind of school you attend can make a big difference in your life. So the obvious policy implication is move people from areas where outcomes are worse to places where outcomes are better. In the 1990s, the federal government tested this very idea with a program called Moving to Opportunity. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)BOB EDWARDS: This is Morning Edition. I'm Bob Edwards. The federal government is conducting an experiment. It's helping poor people from five cities move into middle-class neighborhoods. Volunteer families were transferred out of troubled sections of Los Angeles, Boston, New York, Chicago and Baltimore. With the help of rent subsidies, the families move to more affluent areas, often in the suburbs. VEDANTAM: Very much like the studies on the effects of great kindergarten teachers, the results from the Moving to Opportunity experiment were underwhelming. But Raj did exactly what he had done with the classroom studies. He asked whether researchers had studied the effects of this program long enough. CHETTY: The Moving to Opportunity study was, in some ways, a landmark study in this field because it said, let's take the perspective of a scientific experiment. We have some evidence where it looks like outcomes vary across these neighborhoods. And let's just go out there and really randomly assign families, effectively, by giving them vouchers to different neighborhoods and see if outcomes differ. And I think everyone who was involved in that study at that point was expecting to see that you'd find really big and immediate impacts on people's outcomes, and this would show that environment really matters. And we would go from there in developing affordable housing policy and so forth. And very disappointingly, the initial studies - and there were many of these - almost uniformly showed that Moving to Opportunity had no real detectable economic impact. There were, to be clear, improvements in the health of adults and other dimensions that we care about - you know, reports of how depressed people were feeling or even indicators of rates of diabetes, things like that. You did see changes there. But in terms of economic outcomes - employment rates, earnings and so forth - didn't find much of an effect. Now, all of those initial studies were looking at the impacts of Moving to Opportunity on adults or kids who were relatively old. They were in their teens at the point of the move. And there was a very simple reason for that. People were eager to evaluate the results of the intervention. And, of course, you couldn't look at young kids' outcomes very quickly after the point of the experiment in the mid-1990s because it would take time for the kids to grow up and then see their earnings in adulthood and so forth. So what we did is echoing, you know, some of the themes, actually, of what we talked about earlier with the Tennessee STAR experiment. We went back to the Moving to Opportunity data, linked that to tax records in order to be able to track people over a longer period of time. And we had a very clear hypothesis going into the study that maybe the reason people hadn't found effects in the Moving to Opportunity data is that it takes time for environment to have an impact. It's not that I just help you move to a different neighborhood, and tomorrow, you end up having completely different outcomes. Rather, it's related to exposure. You have to spend a lot of time, perhaps, growing up in a given place in order to see - really see measurable changes. And so what we found when we went back to the data is remarkably that that's exactly what's going on. If you look at kids who were relatively young - say, below age 12 at the point that they moved as part of this experiment - you see quite substantial gains as a result of moving to a lower-poverty, middle-class neighborhood - something like a 30% increase in earnings, 30% increase in college attendance rates, 25% reduction in the rate of having a teenage birth. So on a variety of outcomes, quite substantial gains. But if you do the exact same analysis for kids who moved at older ages, you see essentially no gain at all. And if you look at adults who moved as part of the experiment, verifying what earlier studies found, we see no gains at all. And so what that's very consistent with is the idea that there's sort of a dosage effect. Or every extra year you spend growing up in a better neighborhood helps you in the long run. But those effects really cumulate to something we're able to detect in the data only if people move young enough. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: If there is one theme that emerges from this kind of analysis, it is about the value of nuances. It is true that geography and education matter. But there are also social factors that have independent effects - a big one, race. CHETTY: Neighborhoods matter, but they're certainly not everything. I mean, I want to be very clear about that. And so race is a very good example where it illustrates that you shouldn't think about neighborhoods as being an environmental set of factors that applies to everyone equally. When we break the data down by race, we find very stark differences, in particular between black and white men growing up in a given neighborhood. For women, there actually aren't very large differences in rates of upward or downward mobility between black and white women. But for black versus white men, you see really stark differences in rates of mobility. A black man and a white man who grow up in families with comparable income, living on the same block, both two-parent families, similar levels of education, similar levels of wealth - so basically, control for all the family-level factors that you can sort of think of. You still see that the black man has much lower chances of climbing the income ladder than white men. And perhaps even more alarmingly, black men have much higher rates of downward mobility than white men. If you're born to an affluent family as a black man, you are much more likely to fall down the income ladder than white men are, who tend to persist near the top of the income distribution. The way I like to think about it is, if you think about upward mobility as climbing an income ladder for white men, it's more like being on a treadmill for black men. Even after you climb up in one generation, you tend to fall back down in the next generation. And that's true even among two kids who grow up in the same neighborhood, who go to the same school and so forth. VEDANTAM: So this presents, obviously, a puzzle. If you have two families, one black, one white - they both have, you know, a son and a daughter. What you're saying is, on average, the white boy is going to do significantly better than the black boy. But the white girl isn't going to do significantly better than the black girl. How do you explain this? CHETTY: You know, again, I think the explanation is something that remains to be fully resolved. But I can give you some sense of what we think might be going on. So when we then use this neighborhood-level data, this granular information, you can go and ask, are there some places in America where we actually see black men doing relatively well? And what might we be able to learn from those examples? So it turns out you can look at certain places - Silver Spring in Maryland, for example. More generally, there are a scattered set of areas across the United States where you see relatively good outcomes for black men. And they tend to have three characteristics, which I think shed some light on why these gaps prevail for men rather than women. So first, we find that these places tend to have relatively low poverty rates. So they have good resources. Second, as you might expect intuitively, they have low levels of racial bias among whites. We find that places with less racial bias have relatively good outcomes for black men relative to white men. And then the third factor we identify is that areas with high rates of father presence, where lots of kids again are being raised in two-parent families and, in particular, black kids are being raised in two-parent families, they tend to have particularly good outcomes for black boys relative to white boys. Now, importantly, that last correlation that I mentioned - that's true only for black boys. When black girls grow up in an area with greater presence of fathers, their outcomes look pretty similar. And so coming back to your question, what is driving these gender disparities? - my sense from this data, while it's not conclusive, it suggests that environmental factors are amplifying these disparities for black men in particular. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: When we come back, how Raj's insights can be applied to policy. You're listening to HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. This is NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)VEDANTAM: Raj Chetty has spent years mining vast troves of data to understand economic mobility and inequality in the United States. Increasingly, Raj and his team are moving from analysis to action. They are asking how the insights they have generated might improve, for example, the quality of education. CHETTY: My big-picture take is we should be doing everything we can to try to have the best teachers in American classrooms. And I think the systems that we currently have in place, for various reasons, don't really achieve that goal. So in most professions in the United States, if you're generating a lot of value for your company, people are going to be able to make changes to try to keep you, right? So you might get a pay raise. You might get a different portfolio of what you have to manage. You might get a promotion in various ways. In most schools, salaries are basically set in lockstep to experience, with no ability for the principals to have discretion to give teachers a bonus if they're doing extremely well or try to, you know, give a retention package to a teacher who has a really attractive offer from a private school or from a totally different employer. And so I think creating a little bit more of that flexibility to retain and recruit top talent in teaching, just like we do in the rest of the economy in the United States, could be incredibly valuable. But I think, you know, more broadly, what I see as the broader problem is teaching is often not viewed as the first profession you'd choose to pursue if you're a really talented kid in the United States. And I think that's really not a good state of affairs. Countries that have excellent educational systems that people point to - Finland, for example - you often hear that kids' aspiration, if they're doing really well in school, is to become a teacher. And so given the importance of teaching, as we've established, for kids' long-term outcomes broadly, I think it's extremely important that it's viewed as a high-status, very desirable profession to go into. VEDANTAM: I want to spend a moment just talking about the caution that might be needed in terms of sort of applying policy solutions. So for example, you'll find that when really good teachers move into some schools, they have measurable effects. They raise the test scores of students. And over time, this has measurable effects on the long-term outcomes of those students. So you would say, we should actually try and get the teachers who can boost test scores. But, of course, if you actually implemented that as policy, you would have schools and teachers now focused on just boosting test scores and teaching to the test. And presumably, you might not actually get the benefit of what you were hoping to get, which is great teaching, not just great test scores. CHETTY: No, that's quite right. And I mean, I think that's an important caution that you have to think about in this context. So if you use test-score-based measures to evaluate teachers, it's possible that you will get a lot of teaching to the test. Now, the way I view it, again, from a scientific point of view, is it's an empirical question. To what extent - when you have incentive systems where you reward teachers based on their productivity, as measured by tests, to what extent do you get unproductive behavior? And if you do, can you do things to combat that? So - give you a very simple example - if we're worried that teachers do things that lead to unproductive teaching to the test in the short run that just artificially boosts your test scores at the end of the current year but doesn't lead to persistent learning, one thing we might be able to do is look at your test scores then in the next grade or the year after and ask, does it seem like these students are continuing to do better, even in the years after they leave your classroom? And if they are, then maybe, you know, you are actually teaching them something that's valuable, and so we're going to reward the teachers who have these persistent impacts rather than the teachers who only have short-term impacts. All of that said, I don't think the policy solution here is some kind of, you know, algorithmic thing, where we just say, we're going to look at your students' test scores and determine your employment and promotion outcomes purely based on that. I view this more as useful information that principals or other managers - that they should incorporate into decisions that they're making and give them the leeway to do that. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Another policy domain that I asked Raj about is housing. For example, if younger kids do better than older kids when they move to new neighborhoods, should housing vouchers be focused on families with the youngest children? CHETTY: We are using our data to identify neighborhoods that would be affordable to low-income families but deliver much better outcomes for their kids. So think of these as places that are basically opportunity bargains. They are places that have good outcomes yet are still affordable. And so what we're doing is providing families, when they come in to apply for a housing voucher, information about these opportunity bargain areas. We're providing assistance to those families in the form of rental brokers - basically, helping them go to those places, look for housing in those places. And we're recruiting landlords in those areas to encourage them to rent their houses to tenants, simplifying the inspection process, simplifying the paperwork and so forth. And the whole goal of this is, without spending any extra money on the vouchers, try to basically achieve more bang for the buck by helping families move to those places. So, you know, the idea is to use the research to try to then make policy changes that will allow us to achieve better outcomes. Just one other, you know, angle on that which is important - this whole study is focused on families with young kids, given our finding that helping people move when they're much older really doesn't have much of an impact - and so another way in which you can see the research directly informing policy design. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering if one concern that is sometimes raised, in terms of sort of the geographic distribution of mobility and the policy solutions that might follow from it, is - you know, so let's say, for example, you look at the Los Angeles data you told me, and one of the policy implications that comes from this is, can we get the kid who's growing up in Watts to move a couple of miles to be growing up in Compton and potentially have better outcomes? And let's assume for a second that you actually had empirical data that showed you that this was actually possible to do, and the outcomes actually would be better. Is that actually solving the problem? Because it doesn't actually solve the problem of what's happening in Watts. It's great for the kids whom you're moving out, but what about for the kids who are left behind? CHETTY: So let me say - that's an excellent point. Let me say a few things on that. So first, I think we actually don't just need to assume that it would lead to better outcomes for the kids. We have direct data now looking at exactly those types of moves that shows very clearly the earlier a child moves from an environment like Watts to the nearby place with lower rates of incarceration, they're going to have a much lower probability of getting incarcerated themselves. Now, is that really solving the problem? Of course, it's solving the problem for that given child, but are you solving a problem societally? So I look at it in two steps. So first of all, many low-income families already move across neighborhoods in a given year. Something like 1 in 5 low-income families moves houses in a given year. So the way we should think about this is not so much that we're going to take a family that was going to stay in a given place permanently, uproot them and move them somewhere else. But rather, at the point that they're moving for whatever other reason, let's potentially encourage them to make a more informed choice that might improve their kids' outcomes in the long run. That, to me, seems like a natural thing to do, just enable people to make the best choices possible. But then the deeper problem you point to is that, are you really solving anything in places like Watts, where you have very adverse outcomes, simply by helping people move around? And I think the answer to that is, of course, no. The solution, at the end of the day - it's not a scalable solution to just move everyone. You're never going to move everyone out of Watts or, you know, a given city to another place. Nor should you try to. Ultimately, of course, you have to think about what you can do in a given place to improve outcomes. And so this is where a lot of where we're headed in the policy domain is not just the Moving to Opportunity approach that I described but actually partnerships with other organizations to evaluate and scale up programs that might improve outcomes in a given area. We're in conversations with groups that provide mentoring services. So think of programs like Big Brothers Big Sisters or My Brother's Keeper, which, specifically for black men, try to provide role models and mentoring. And there's a question of whether you can scale up and design those programs in a way that will really change outcomes in those particular areas. A third potential policy domain, given we're talking about incarceration, is changes in criminal justice that could potentially have significant effects in places like this. So I absolutely agree. You need to think about policy solutions both in place, in tandem with potentially giving families better opportunities to choose where to live. VEDANTAM: When it comes to higher education, which is, of course, where you work, you've found that some universities tend to be better than others in increasing income mobility amongst their students. Which schools are these, and what can we learn from them? Is there a policy prescription here? CHETTY: Yeah. So higher education, I think, is another domain. So just to connect these various pieces, the way I look at mobility is kind of a pipeline from birth to adulthood. And so we've spent a lot of time focusing on elementary education, kindergarten, neighborhood experiences as you grow up. And then, of course, you get to college. And college is a place where a lot of us, I think, have the intuition that it's this domain where you're going to mix with a new group of people. It's going to be a lot more diverse than the neighborhood in which you grow up and so forth. And so the starting point to note here is that that actually is not true in the United States. So colleges are just as segregated by income as the neighborhood in which you grow up is. That is, your chances of meeting someone from a different socio-economic background in your college are just about the same as your chances of meeting someone from a different socio-economic background in the high school that you go to. So certain colleges in America, especially the elite, private institutions, have a very high representation of extremely high-income students in their student body. Now, the consequence of that - coming back to the question about mobility - is you can't, in a mechanical sense, contribute a lot to upward mobility if you don't have a lot of low-income kids to begin with, right? Harvard, mechanically, cannot be helping a lot of low-income kids climb the income ladder because there aren't that many low-income kids at Harvard, Stanford, Princeton, Yale, et cetera to begin with. In contrast, if you look at a set of mid-tier public schools - think of places like the City University of New York or California state colleges - we find that these colleges, in an accounting (ph) sense, actually have the highest rates of socio-economic mobility. And as a result, if you ask how many kids are starting out in a poor family and moving up the income distribution, it's these mid-tier public schools where you see a lot of that happening. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: We began this conversation, Raj, by talking about your own life. And I actually want to end the conversation by going back to your own life, as well, because I think your own life story, in some ways, is very instructive about many of the ideas we've talked about today. You know, as I was preparing for the interview and I was reading up some things about your life, I remembered a story about the philosopher Bertrand Russell. He grew up in a family of writers, and he assumed when he was a kid that everyone wrote books. At one point, Russell meets someone. And if I'm remembering the story correctly, I think it's a gardener. And he's astonished to find the man is not an author. And I thought of that story when I heard that as prolific as you are, you were the last person in your family to get an academic paper published. Is that actually true? CHETTY: Yes, that is actually true. And I actually think I remember my father telling me the story about Bertrand Russell when I was a kid. So I come from a family of academics. I have two older sisters, both of whom are researchers, as well. And so I was the last one in my family to get a Ph. D. and publish a paper. And so it was definitely in the air, in the water, so to speak, around me. And as I've talked about, through various examples empirically, I think exposure, environment plays a huge role. And I absolutely see that in the work that I'm doing. VEDANTAM: And I think that is the deeper truth to the story - your own life story but also the work that you've been doing. You know, when we think about excellence, we think of, you know, Raj Chetty, MacArthur genius. We imagine the lonely climber on top of the mountain. But in reality, the story you're painting is much closer, you know, to the ideal - you know, Isaac Newton's ideal - if I've seen further, it's because I stand on the shoulders of giants. CHETTY: That's absolutely right. And I think, Shankar, that was made most evident to me, actually, in thinking about my extended family, where I see, you know, the many different experiences that we've had as a result of the environments in which we grew up. So in particular, as you might know, in Indian families, growing up - especially in villages in poverty, families often chose one child to educate. And so it so happened to be, in my father's family, he was the one who ended up getting higher education, ended up coming to the United States to University of Wisconsin-Madison to get a Ph. D. And my mom was one of the first women to become a doctor in our community in South India - again, the only person in her family to get a higher education. And what I've seen is how those decisions have manifested themselves through the generations in our family. So my cousins, many of whom actually have the same name as me - Raj, you know, named after my maternal grandfather - while they all are happy in their own ways and are leading fulfilling lives, the opportunities they've had have been dramatically different, with one of them living in Singapore to support his family in India and, you know, not able to be with his kids as they're growing up, another in - working in kind of a, you know, difficult job in New York City in kind of a manual-labor sort of position. And so again, I think the opportunities I've had - exactly as you said - are entirely a function of the environment that I happen to have been lucky to grow up in - and, you know, I think more broadly, have been studying how to replicate those opportunities for others. VEDANTAM: Raj Chetty is an economist at Harvard University. Raj, thank you for joining me today on HIDDEN BRAIN. CHETTY: My pleasure. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This week's episode was produced by Rhaina Cohen and edited by Tara Boyle and Camila Vargas Restrepo. Our team includes Jenny Schmidt, Parth Shah, Thomas Lu and Laura Kwerel. Special thanks to Katelyn Harrop (ph), who recorded the kindergarten class you heard at the top of the show. Raj mentioned a tool that tracks economic mobility neighborhood by neighborhood. You can put in your address at opportnityatlas. org. Once again, that's opportunityatlasorg. Our unsung hero this week is principal Ryan Junge at Keystone Elementary School in Iowa. When we were trying to figure out which kindergarten classroom we wanted to visit, we looked for a school in a part of the country that has one of the best records of upward mobility. That's how we found Keystone Elementary in a rural part of eastern Iowa. Principal Junge allowed us to hang out in one of his kindergarten classrooms. Now, it takes a lot to run a school. And having an audio producer running about isn't high on your list of priorities. But he got on board very quickly and figured out a way to make it possible. We are grateful.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) VEDANTAM: The week has just begun in Keystone, Iowa. We are here to bear witness to a family meeting - an intervention, if you will. RACHEL KRUSE: It got kind of rough towards the end of the week, didn't it? We didn't feel like such a family, did we? VEDANTAM: Rachel Kruse is running this meeting. The other participants are gathered around her in a circle. A couple of them fidget, but most listen attentively. KRUSE: So on Friday, we decided that today we needed to have a family meeting, all right? So this weekend, I found this book, and it's called \"It's Mine! \" So when I read this book, I want you to think about how last week went and how this week could go. VEDANTAM: This family meeting is taking place in a kindergarten classroom in a rural part of eastern Iowa. Rachel is the teacher, and the lesson she wants to share is one that could have a lasting impact on her students. The story is set on an island. KRUSE: (Reading) On the island lived three quarrelsome frogs named Milton, Rupert and Lydia. They quarreled and quibbled from dawn to dusk. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: They said, mine, mine. . . KRUSE: (Reading) Stay out of the pond, yelled Milton. The water is mine. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: That's not nice. KRUSE: (Reading) Get off the island, shouted Rupert. The Earth is mine. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: That's not nice. KRUSE: It's not, is it? VEDANTAM: Then, a flood swallows up the island. KRUSE: (Reading) There was only one rock left. And there the frogs huddled, trembling from cold and fright. But they felt better now that they were together, sharing the same fears and hopes. VEDANTAM: Eventually, the sky clears. The frogs swim together, hop after butterflies and rest in the weeds. KRUSE: Right, we can work together, can't we? Because at the beginning of the story, when they were saying, it's mine, it's mine, was anybody having fun? UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: No. KRUSE: No. VEDANTAM: The kids get it. The frogs are happier when they stop being selfish. This is what it looks like to teach what are sometimes called soft skills, the kind of skills that kids don't get asked about on tests. Of course, Rachel teaches the other things you'd expect - counting. . . KRUSE: Four, five. . . UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Four, five. . . VEDANTAM: . . . Reading and pronunciation. . . KRUSE: Fish. Fish. UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Fish. Fish. VEDANTAM: But lessons like this one about the selfish frogs might have the greatest impact. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: In fact, this impact can actually be quantified in dollars. Today, we ask some questions with big implications. Can you put an economic value on a great kindergarten teacher? How is it that two children living just a few blocks from each other can have radically different chances in life? What is it that gives Salt Lake City an edge over Cleveland when it comes to offering people a better life than their parents? The state of your American dream - this week on HIDDEN BRAIN. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: The stories we tell about ourselves, stories of success and stories of failure, often have their beginnings in the distant past - sometimes in our childhoods, sometimes before we were even born. My guest today has explored this idea using hard data drawn from tens of millions of people. It's difficult to describe the range of things he does, except to say that Raj Chetty, an economist at Harvard University, might be the foremost authority today on the state of the American dream. Raj, welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. RAJ CHETTY: Thank you, Shankar. It's a pleasure to be here. VEDANTAM: I want to begin by looking at snapshots in time, Raj. And these are moments from your own life that I think explain a great deal about your work. The first snapshot is when you're living in New Delhi in India, and you go to see the Taj Mahal. It's a few hours from your home in Delhi. What do you see? CHETTY: Well, it was the first time I'd been to the Taj Mahal. And, you know, of course, like everyone, it's overwhelming in its beauty and how impressive of a monument it is. But I think what I was most struck by is after then coming back out of the monument, which was very immaculately kept and maintained, seeing the abject poverty outside the Taj Mahal - people begging for money, kids who don't have clothes, who are on the street, you know, don't have adequate food. Certainly, I was exposed to inequality, you know, throughout childhood, but I think this was just such a vivid version of it that stuck in my mind for many years. VEDANTAM: A couple of years after you visit Taj Mahal, your family immigrates to the United States. You are in a private school in Milwaukee. You play tennis and chess, and so you visit other schools in the area for competitions. What do you see? CHETTY: So a similar experience, actually. So I went to a private school on the north side of Milwaukee called University School. And we'd compete with other schools in, as you said, in tennis and chess. And you'd just see, again, the remarkable differences in the physical structure of these schools. So the school that I went to was on something like a 150-acre campus with lots of college-level classes. And in contrast, you know, the schools we'd visit were public schools in the city of Milwaukee, which, as you might know, these are schools that have faced a lot of challenges. And that was just evident, you know, as a child, seeing the opportunities kids there had, talking to them about the types of classes they could take - again, just really seeing a world with tremendous inequity and wondering, you know, how did I end up in this position? And how did these kids, who, at some level, were very similar - we're sitting on different sides of the chessboard - how did they end up in a different position in terms of what they had and opportunities? VEDANTAM: So let's take these ideas from these snapshots - you know, questions related to inequality, to segregation and to opportunity - and dive into some of the research that you've conducted. You once did a study that determined the precise value of having a great kindergarten teacher. Tell me about that study and what the value is that you computed. CHETTY: Yeah. So social scientists have, for a long time, been studying and been interested in understanding how education affects kids' outcomes. Most prior studies that have been done look at impacts on outcomes like test scores. So if you have a better teacher, for instance, or if you're in a smaller classroom, do you do better as measured by standardized tests? Now, one of the puzzling findings from that earlier work is that you tend to find that if you're in what you might think of as a better classroom - let's take, as a concrete example, classroom with a smaller number of kids - you tend to see that kids in those types of classes tend to have higher test scores at the end of that school year, but those gains quickly fade away. So that is if I was in a better kindergarten classroom, I'm doing better at the end of kindergarten but only a little better at the end of first grade. And by the time I'm in second or third grade, my performance on standardized tests basically looks comparable to other kids who were in different classes. So that - I think that fade-out pattern, led to a lot of discouragement among education researchers, saying, oh, it looks like these interventions that we're all studying - reducing class size, trying to improve teacher quality, so forth - they seem to have some impacts, but these impacts don't seem to last. So, you know, is this kind of a losing cause in the long run? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: The fade-out effect was discouraging. But Raj had a hunch that maybe the long-term research had not tracked the kids long enough. He found data from an older experiment from Tennessee. The students in this experiment had been randomly assigned to different kindergarten classrooms within their schools. Some had small class sizes of about 15 students. Others were placed in classes that had about 25 students. Raj and his colleagues did something novel with the data to discover the long-term - the really long-term - effects of kindergarten classrooms on students. CHETTY: We take kind of a big-data approach and link the school district records for those 12,000 kids to income tax records and Social Security records many years later that basically allow us to ask, how did your earnings when you're, say, 25 or 30 years old, vary depending upon which kindergarten classroom you were assigned to? So what this allows you to do is go beyond asking, what are the impacts of these interventions on test scores? - and ask, what are the impacts on things we actually care about at the end of the day? - the types of jobs people end up getting, how much they're earning, whether they go to college or not, and so forth. And what you end up finding, in a nutshell, is actually quite striking, which is even though you see this fade-out pattern that I was describing in terms of test score achievement, the gains actually reemerge in adulthood. The children who were assigned to better teachers, to smaller classes, are doing significantly better as adults, showing that early childhood education does, in fact, have lasting impacts, even though, curiously, those impacts don't seem to last in terms of test scores. VEDANTAM: I mean, it's a remarkable finding because I think when most of us think about it, we sort of say, well, schooling is important. But if you were to ask me, does what happen in kindergarten affect you when you're 30 years old? - I would have to say it's probably really marginal. But that's not what you're finding. CHETTY: Yeah. And so, to be clear, it is one of many, many different things that matters, right? So I would not say the kindergarten classroom that you're in sort of determines your fate. It's one of a hundred things that influences your outcomes. However, if, on average, you're assigned to a better teacher or to a smaller class, we see measurable improvements in children's outcomes on the order of thousands of dollars of earnings per year. And so the kind of quantification of that, that we put out in that paper, is you can think of having a better kindergarten teacher as being worth something like $300,000 for a classroom of students. VEDANTAM: That $300,000 figure is an estimate of how much more the kids in the class would earn over their lifetimes. It's the difference between the earnings from a class with a high-quality kindergarten teacher and a class with an average teacher. While Raj has found a way to quantify the economic value of a great kindergarten teacher, he has found it harder to identify what exactly makes a great kindergarten teacher. It turns out that credentials, like where a teacher went to college, are not very helpful in predicting whether someone's going to be a good teacher. So Raj looked instead at how teachers taught their students. CHETTY: It's less about, you know, you're very good at explaining certain mathematical concepts and something a little bit more nebulous about how well, for instance, you're able to manage a classroom of small children, some of whom might end up being disruptive. Are you able to keep people focused? Are you able to inspire people? How you go about measuring those things systematically, I think, is a very interesting question. And even more importantly, how can we then, perhaps, train teachers to do better on those dimensions? That would be incredibly valuable. But at the moment, I think the best summary is we don't quite know yet. VEDANTAM: Let's stick with this theory that in some ways, what's happening - the difference between the great teacher and the not-so-great teacher might not necessarily be, you know, is one teacher better at teaching the alphabet or teaching the children to count numbers? - but is communicating something else, something else that actually has, you know, not necessarily immediate benefits in the next year or two, but actually has potentially large benefits over the course of a lifetime. What kind of skills might those be? CHETTY: Yeah, so I think, you know, examples of those kinds of skills might be what we'd call noncognitive skills. Or sometimes they're called soft skills - so not the, you know, are you able to do what's measured commonly on standardized tests? But rather, how well do you get along with others? And how disciplined are you? How focused are you? So that's not just speculation. In fact, as part of this study, we have some evidence that supports exactly that kind of reasoning. So it turns out in this Tennessee STAR experiment, they took these students in eighth grade and had their teachers rate them on 28 different measures of noncognitive skills - so asking them, the teacher, does this student get along well with his or her peers? Is the student able to concentrate and so forth? And what's really interesting is that the students who had better kindergarten classrooms, they score significantly higher on these noncognitive measures. So you're seeing persistent gains that last for at least eight years on these noncognitive dimensions. And moreover, if you look at what correlates more strongly with later outcomes in adulthood, like earnings, employment rates, college attendance, it's actually these noncognitive measures that are more predictive than the traditional cognitive skills that we tend to focus on. That is, if I ask, which is more predictive of how much you will earn, someone who gets along well with their peers or someone who scores very high on math tests? - it's the person who gets along with other people that, on average, is doing better in adulthood. You know, putting all those pieces of evidence together, my reading is that early environments and classrooms, teachers and so on, matter not because of the technical skills you're learning but because of this broader set of skills that have big payoffs in the labor market. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: When we come back, we move from classrooms to neighborhoods, how the neighborhood you live in could be an engine for success or a brake on your ambitions. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) VEDANTAM: There's a core belief that's embedded in the story of America. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH MONTAGE) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The idea that if you're willing to work hard, it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from or what you look like. PRESIDENT GEORGE W BUSH: And together we will create an America that is open, so every citizen has access to the American dream. VEDANTAM: The American dream, this idea that it's possible for anyone to climb the economic ladder and have a stable, prosperous life, this idea has endured across generations. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH MONTAGE) PRESIDENT LYNDON B JOHNSON: A dream of a place where a free man could build for himself and raise his children to a better life. PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN: That dream is the heart and soul of America. It's the promise that keeps our nation forever good and generous. VEDANTAM: But increasingly, many people have come to question whether this dream is possible anymore. Both Republicans and Democrats have argued the American dream is unraveling. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH MONTAGE) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The American dream is dead. ELIZABETH WARREN: You and I may be the first generation in American history to see our kids do worse than we did. VEDANTAM: Raj Chetty says economic mobility has fallen in the U. S. compared to 50 years ago. Far fewer people today are doing better than their parents. But when you take a close look at the data, the picture that emerges is much more nuanced. CHETTY: So think about upward mobility in the context of the classic rags-to-riches kind of notion. Suppose you're a kid growing up in a low-income family, say, the bottom fifth of the income distribution. What are your odds of reaching the top fifth of the income distribution, making THAT leap from the bottom to the top? So it turns out, if you look at the U. S. as a whole, that number is 7. 5%. Seven-and-a-half percent of kids who start out in a relatively low-income family will end up reaching the top fifth on average. But if you then break that data down and ask, how does that vary depending upon which state or which county you're growing up in? - you see that it actually varies dramatically. So in certain parts of the U. S. - for example, in rural Iowa or much of the Great Plains or certain cities like Salt Lake City or San Francisco, for example - your odds of rising from the bottom fifth to the top fifth are something like 14 or 15 percent, twice as high as the national average. In contrast, if you look at the other end of the spectrum - look at cities like Charlotte, N. C. , Atlanta, Ga. , or more generally, much of the southeastern United States or places in the industrial Midwest, like Detroit or Cleveland - your odds of rising from the bottom to the top are below 5 percent, sometimes even only 3. 5 or 4 percent. Now, those differences that I just mentioned, they're quite substantial. They're basically saying that for a given child, your odds of making it to the middle class or to the upper-middle class are two or three times higher if you happen to be growing up in one place relative to another. And so what I often say is people ask, you know, is the American dream alive or not today? And I actually think the question itself is sort of ill-posed. The term the American dream - really, we should think of it as the Iowa dream or the Atlanta dream or the California dream because there's so much variation within this country. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: So one of the big insights of this work in some ways is that rather than looking at the nation as a whole, it's actually useful to look at these, you know, metropolitan areas or cities because in some ways, they paint very different pictures. But in your most recent work, you've actually taken this a step further and said you can actually look within cities and find even more granular details about the state of upward mobility. Talk to me about this work. CHETTY: Yeah, that's exactly right. So as we've been proceeding on this work, we've been taking the approach of kind of going to finer and finer levels of geography. So the Atlanta versus Salt Lake City or San Francisco contrast, I think, is interesting. But what was even more surprising to us is if I look within Atlanta or I look within Los Angeles, turns out you can essentially see the same amount of variation that you see in the U. S. as a whole when you look within a few miles in a given city. So to give you some specific examples again, let's focus on the city of Los Angeles, to take one case. So many people are familiar with certain neighborhoods in Los Angeles, like Compton and Watts, which have been known for many decades to be tough areas with high rates of crime, high rates of poverty and adverse outcomes due to various structural factors. Now, we showed that kids who grow up in those specific neighborhoods - so, for instance, kids who grow up in Watts, and black men in particular who grow up in that area - have very adverse outcomes. So for example, black men who grow up in low-income families in Watts on average have earnings of only $7,000 a year in their mid-30s. And that is the average, right? So that means that the vast majority of these men have incomes very close to zero. They're nonworking and so forth. Another somewhat shocking statistic - black men growing up in that particular census tract have something like a 45% chance of being incarcerated on any given day, which means that their lifetime chance of ever being incarcerated is much higher, you know, could well be something like 70 or 80%. VEDANTAM: Did you say on any given day? CHETTY: On a given day. On a given day - the date of the 2010 census, 45% of the black men who grew up in this tract in Watts - it's called the Nickerson Gardens public housing project. Forty-five percent of them are incarcerated. It's a shocking statement about, I mean, the United States, I think, that we have such high levels of incarceration in certain cases. But that is a fact about that tract. Now, you know, at some level, for people living in LA - maybe shocked by that magnitude, but maybe not surprised by the fact that there are very adverse outcomes for kids growing up in that area. Here's maybe something you didn't know, though. If you go a mile or two away, to Compton, you see that rates of incarceration for black men growing up there in families of comparable income are something like 6%. So still actually high - 6% is not a small number. But relative to 45%, it's dramatically lower. And so that's the sense in which when you look at these maps, which we've put out in the form of an interactive tool where you can look at your own address, look at any neighborhood in the United States - 70,000 different neighborhoods splitting up each of these cities into different areas - you see this tremendous variation across very short distances. For kids who grow up in families with comparable income, same racial background, where you're growing up really seems to matter. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Where you grow up really seems to matter. The question is, why? What explains the difference between Salt Lake City and Charlotte? CHETTY: So we don't know yet exactly what is the recipe to produce better outcomes in one place relative to another. But we've looked at a variety of different factors that economists and sociologists have talked about over the years as potentially driving differences in outcomes. And we've identified five or six different things that really seem like strong predictors of these differences. So the first is segregation. So cities that are more segregated by race or by income, where blacks and whites are not interacting as much or where low-income and high-income families are living separated from each other - segregated places like that tend to have much worse outcomes for people of all racial and ethnic groups. So that's one strong pattern in the data. VEDANTAM: Raj has found that upward mobility is less common in places that have a smaller middle class. He's also noticed some other patterns. CHETTY: We find that there's a very strong association between these outcomes and measures of family structure in a neighborhood. So in particular, one of the strongest patterns in the data is that areas where more kids are raised by two-parent families tend to have higher rates of upward mobility. Now, in interpreting that correlation, it's very important to note that it's not mechanically driven by the fact that growing up yourself in a two-parent family leads to better outcomes for a given kid. What we find is even if your own parents are married, if you grow up in an area where a lot of kids are being raised by single parents, you are less likely to climb the income ladder. So what that shows you is this is not the direct effect of your own parents' marital status. It's again something about community-level factors that are associated with the fraction of single parents in an area that's predictive of kids' outcomes. Now, somewhat related to that is the idea of social capital, a concept popularized by my Harvard colleague Bob Putnam. I think of the old adage that it takes a village to raise a child as a way to think about what social capital is. Will someone else help you out even if you're not doing well? Salt Lake City, with the Mormon Church, is thought to be a canonical example of a city with a lot of social capital and correspondingly has high rates of upward mobility. And so as best we can measure it, we find that places with higher levels of social capital tend to have higher levels of upward mobility. And then finally, I'll mention one last one. Coming back to our discussion about schools, as you might expect intuitively, places that have better schools tend to have higher rates of upward mobility. And I think that connection is particularly important to note because schools are something that I think fall clearly in the policy domain where we might be able to figure out how to make changes to improve the quality of schools. Some of the other factors I've been describing, while I think they're very important to study and interesting to understand, it's harder to figure out, what do you do to try to change social capital or family structures in an area? That's, I think, a little bit more complicated, at least to figure out from a policy point of view. VEDANTAM: So Raj established that where you grow up and the kind of school you attend can make a big difference in your life. So the obvious policy implication is move people from areas where outcomes are worse to places where outcomes are better. In the 1990s, the federal government tested this very idea with a program called Moving to Opportunity. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) BOB EDWARDS: This is Morning Edition. I'm Bob Edwards. The federal government is conducting an experiment. It's helping poor people from five cities move into middle-class neighborhoods. Volunteer families were transferred out of troubled sections of Los Angeles, Boston, New York, Chicago and Baltimore. With the help of rent subsidies, the families move to more affluent areas, often in the suburbs. VEDANTAM: Very much like the studies on the effects of great kindergarten teachers, the results from the Moving to Opportunity experiment were underwhelming. But Raj did exactly what he had done with the classroom studies. He asked whether researchers had studied the effects of this program long enough. CHETTY: The Moving to Opportunity study was, in some ways, a landmark study in this field because it said, let's take the perspective of a scientific experiment. We have some evidence where it looks like outcomes vary across these neighborhoods. And let's just go out there and really randomly assign families, effectively, by giving them vouchers to different neighborhoods and see if outcomes differ. And I think everyone who was involved in that study at that point was expecting to see that you'd find really big and immediate impacts on people's outcomes, and this would show that environment really matters. And we would go from there in developing affordable housing policy and so forth. And very disappointingly, the initial studies - and there were many of these - almost uniformly showed that Moving to Opportunity had no real detectable economic impact. There were, to be clear, improvements in the health of adults and other dimensions that we care about - you know, reports of how depressed people were feeling or even indicators of rates of diabetes, things like that. You did see changes there. But in terms of economic outcomes - employment rates, earnings and so forth - didn't find much of an effect. Now, all of those initial studies were looking at the impacts of Moving to Opportunity on adults or kids who were relatively old. They were in their teens at the point of the move. And there was a very simple reason for that. People were eager to evaluate the results of the intervention. And, of course, you couldn't look at young kids' outcomes very quickly after the point of the experiment in the mid-1990s because it would take time for the kids to grow up and then see their earnings in adulthood and so forth. So what we did is echoing, you know, some of the themes, actually, of what we talked about earlier with the Tennessee STAR experiment. We went back to the Moving to Opportunity data, linked that to tax records in order to be able to track people over a longer period of time. And we had a very clear hypothesis going into the study that maybe the reason people hadn't found effects in the Moving to Opportunity data is that it takes time for environment to have an impact. It's not that I just help you move to a different neighborhood, and tomorrow, you end up having completely different outcomes. Rather, it's related to exposure. You have to spend a lot of time, perhaps, growing up in a given place in order to see - really see measurable changes. And so what we found when we went back to the data is remarkably that that's exactly what's going on. If you look at kids who were relatively young - say, below age 12 at the point that they moved as part of this experiment - you see quite substantial gains as a result of moving to a lower-poverty, middle-class neighborhood - something like a 30% increase in earnings, 30% increase in college attendance rates, 25% reduction in the rate of having a teenage birth. So on a variety of outcomes, quite substantial gains. But if you do the exact same analysis for kids who moved at older ages, you see essentially no gain at all. And if you look at adults who moved as part of the experiment, verifying what earlier studies found, we see no gains at all. And so what that's very consistent with is the idea that there's sort of a dosage effect. Or every extra year you spend growing up in a better neighborhood helps you in the long run. But those effects really cumulate to something we're able to detect in the data only if people move young enough. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: If there is one theme that emerges from this kind of analysis, it is about the value of nuances. It is true that geography and education matter. But there are also social factors that have independent effects - a big one, race. CHETTY: Neighborhoods matter, but they're certainly not everything. I mean, I want to be very clear about that. And so race is a very good example where it illustrates that you shouldn't think about neighborhoods as being an environmental set of factors that applies to everyone equally. When we break the data down by race, we find very stark differences, in particular between black and white men growing up in a given neighborhood. For women, there actually aren't very large differences in rates of upward or downward mobility between black and white women. But for black versus white men, you see really stark differences in rates of mobility. A black man and a white man who grow up in families with comparable income, living on the same block, both two-parent families, similar levels of education, similar levels of wealth - so basically, control for all the family-level factors that you can sort of think of. You still see that the black man has much lower chances of climbing the income ladder than white men. And perhaps even more alarmingly, black men have much higher rates of downward mobility than white men. If you're born to an affluent family as a black man, you are much more likely to fall down the income ladder than white men are, who tend to persist near the top of the income distribution. The way I like to think about it is, if you think about upward mobility as climbing an income ladder for white men, it's more like being on a treadmill for black men. Even after you climb up in one generation, you tend to fall back down in the next generation. And that's true even among two kids who grow up in the same neighborhood, who go to the same school and so forth. VEDANTAM: So this presents, obviously, a puzzle. If you have two families, one black, one white - they both have, you know, a son and a daughter. What you're saying is, on average, the white boy is going to do significantly better than the black boy. But the white girl isn't going to do significantly better than the black girl. How do you explain this? CHETTY: You know, again, I think the explanation is something that remains to be fully resolved. But I can give you some sense of what we think might be going on. So when we then use this neighborhood-level data, this granular information, you can go and ask, are there some places in America where we actually see black men doing relatively well? And what might we be able to learn from those examples? So it turns out you can look at certain places - Silver Spring in Maryland, for example. More generally, there are a scattered set of areas across the United States where you see relatively good outcomes for black men. And they tend to have three characteristics, which I think shed some light on why these gaps prevail for men rather than women. So first, we find that these places tend to have relatively low poverty rates. So they have good resources. Second, as you might expect intuitively, they have low levels of racial bias among whites. We find that places with less racial bias have relatively good outcomes for black men relative to white men. And then the third factor we identify is that areas with high rates of father presence, where lots of kids again are being raised in two-parent families and, in particular, black kids are being raised in two-parent families, they tend to have particularly good outcomes for black boys relative to white boys. Now, importantly, that last correlation that I mentioned - that's true only for black boys. When black girls grow up in an area with greater presence of fathers, their outcomes look pretty similar. And so coming back to your question, what is driving these gender disparities? - my sense from this data, while it's not conclusive, it suggests that environmental factors are amplifying these disparities for black men in particular. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: When we come back, how Raj's insights can be applied to policy. You're listening to HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. This is NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) VEDANTAM: Raj Chetty has spent years mining vast troves of data to understand economic mobility and inequality in the United States. Increasingly, Raj and his team are moving from analysis to action. They are asking how the insights they have generated might improve, for example, the quality of education. CHETTY: My big-picture take is we should be doing everything we can to try to have the best teachers in American classrooms. And I think the systems that we currently have in place, for various reasons, don't really achieve that goal. So in most professions in the United States, if you're generating a lot of value for your company, people are going to be able to make changes to try to keep you, right? So you might get a pay raise. You might get a different portfolio of what you have to manage. You might get a promotion in various ways. In most schools, salaries are basically set in lockstep to experience, with no ability for the principals to have discretion to give teachers a bonus if they're doing extremely well or try to, you know, give a retention package to a teacher who has a really attractive offer from a private school or from a totally different employer. And so I think creating a little bit more of that flexibility to retain and recruit top talent in teaching, just like we do in the rest of the economy in the United States, could be incredibly valuable. But I think, you know, more broadly, what I see as the broader problem is teaching is often not viewed as the first profession you'd choose to pursue if you're a really talented kid in the United States. And I think that's really not a good state of affairs. Countries that have excellent educational systems that people point to - Finland, for example - you often hear that kids' aspiration, if they're doing really well in school, is to become a teacher. And so given the importance of teaching, as we've established, for kids' long-term outcomes broadly, I think it's extremely important that it's viewed as a high-status, very desirable profession to go into. VEDANTAM: I want to spend a moment just talking about the caution that might be needed in terms of sort of applying policy solutions. So for example, you'll find that when really good teachers move into some schools, they have measurable effects. They raise the test scores of students. And over time, this has measurable effects on the long-term outcomes of those students. So you would say, we should actually try and get the teachers who can boost test scores. But, of course, if you actually implemented that as policy, you would have schools and teachers now focused on just boosting test scores and teaching to the test. And presumably, you might not actually get the benefit of what you were hoping to get, which is great teaching, not just great test scores. CHETTY: No, that's quite right. And I mean, I think that's an important caution that you have to think about in this context. So if you use test-score-based measures to evaluate teachers, it's possible that you will get a lot of teaching to the test. Now, the way I view it, again, from a scientific point of view, is it's an empirical question. To what extent - when you have incentive systems where you reward teachers based on their productivity, as measured by tests, to what extent do you get unproductive behavior? And if you do, can you do things to combat that? So - give you a very simple example - if we're worried that teachers do things that lead to unproductive teaching to the test in the short run that just artificially boosts your test scores at the end of the current year but doesn't lead to persistent learning, one thing we might be able to do is look at your test scores then in the next grade or the year after and ask, does it seem like these students are continuing to do better, even in the years after they leave your classroom? And if they are, then maybe, you know, you are actually teaching them something that's valuable, and so we're going to reward the teachers who have these persistent impacts rather than the teachers who only have short-term impacts. All of that said, I don't think the policy solution here is some kind of, you know, algorithmic thing, where we just say, we're going to look at your students' test scores and determine your employment and promotion outcomes purely based on that. I view this more as useful information that principals or other managers - that they should incorporate into decisions that they're making and give them the leeway to do that. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Another policy domain that I asked Raj about is housing. For example, if younger kids do better than older kids when they move to new neighborhoods, should housing vouchers be focused on families with the youngest children? CHETTY: We are using our data to identify neighborhoods that would be affordable to low-income families but deliver much better outcomes for their kids. So think of these as places that are basically opportunity bargains. They are places that have good outcomes yet are still affordable. And so what we're doing is providing families, when they come in to apply for a housing voucher, information about these opportunity bargain areas. We're providing assistance to those families in the form of rental brokers - basically, helping them go to those places, look for housing in those places. And we're recruiting landlords in those areas to encourage them to rent their houses to tenants, simplifying the inspection process, simplifying the paperwork and so forth. And the whole goal of this is, without spending any extra money on the vouchers, try to basically achieve more bang for the buck by helping families move to those places. So, you know, the idea is to use the research to try to then make policy changes that will allow us to achieve better outcomes. Just one other, you know, angle on that which is important - this whole study is focused on families with young kids, given our finding that helping people move when they're much older really doesn't have much of an impact - and so another way in which you can see the research directly informing policy design. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering if one concern that is sometimes raised, in terms of sort of the geographic distribution of mobility and the policy solutions that might follow from it, is - you know, so let's say, for example, you look at the Los Angeles data you told me, and one of the policy implications that comes from this is, can we get the kid who's growing up in Watts to move a couple of miles to be growing up in Compton and potentially have better outcomes? And let's assume for a second that you actually had empirical data that showed you that this was actually possible to do, and the outcomes actually would be better. Is that actually solving the problem? Because it doesn't actually solve the problem of what's happening in Watts. It's great for the kids whom you're moving out, but what about for the kids who are left behind? CHETTY: So let me say - that's an excellent point. Let me say a few things on that. So first, I think we actually don't just need to assume that it would lead to better outcomes for the kids. We have direct data now looking at exactly those types of moves that shows very clearly the earlier a child moves from an environment like Watts to the nearby place with lower rates of incarceration, they're going to have a much lower probability of getting incarcerated themselves. Now, is that really solving the problem? Of course, it's solving the problem for that given child, but are you solving a problem societally? So I look at it in two steps. So first of all, many low-income families already move across neighborhoods in a given year. Something like 1 in 5 low-income families moves houses in a given year. So the way we should think about this is not so much that we're going to take a family that was going to stay in a given place permanently, uproot them and move them somewhere else. But rather, at the point that they're moving for whatever other reason, let's potentially encourage them to make a more informed choice that might improve their kids' outcomes in the long run. That, to me, seems like a natural thing to do, just enable people to make the best choices possible. But then the deeper problem you point to is that, are you really solving anything in places like Watts, where you have very adverse outcomes, simply by helping people move around? And I think the answer to that is, of course, no. The solution, at the end of the day - it's not a scalable solution to just move everyone. You're never going to move everyone out of Watts or, you know, a given city to another place. Nor should you try to. Ultimately, of course, you have to think about what you can do in a given place to improve outcomes. And so this is where a lot of where we're headed in the policy domain is not just the Moving to Opportunity approach that I described but actually partnerships with other organizations to evaluate and scale up programs that might improve outcomes in a given area. We're in conversations with groups that provide mentoring services. So think of programs like Big Brothers Big Sisters or My Brother's Keeper, which, specifically for black men, try to provide role models and mentoring. And there's a question of whether you can scale up and design those programs in a way that will really change outcomes in those particular areas. A third potential policy domain, given we're talking about incarceration, is changes in criminal justice that could potentially have significant effects in places like this. So I absolutely agree. You need to think about policy solutions both in place, in tandem with potentially giving families better opportunities to choose where to live. VEDANTAM: When it comes to higher education, which is, of course, where you work, you've found that some universities tend to be better than others in increasing income mobility amongst their students. Which schools are these, and what can we learn from them? Is there a policy prescription here? CHETTY: Yeah. So higher education, I think, is another domain. So just to connect these various pieces, the way I look at mobility is kind of a pipeline from birth to adulthood. And so we've spent a lot of time focusing on elementary education, kindergarten, neighborhood experiences as you grow up. And then, of course, you get to college. And college is a place where a lot of us, I think, have the intuition that it's this domain where you're going to mix with a new group of people. It's going to be a lot more diverse than the neighborhood in which you grow up and so forth. And so the starting point to note here is that that actually is not true in the United States. So colleges are just as segregated by income as the neighborhood in which you grow up is. That is, your chances of meeting someone from a different socio-economic background in your college are just about the same as your chances of meeting someone from a different socio-economic background in the high school that you go to. So certain colleges in America, especially the elite, private institutions, have a very high representation of extremely high-income students in their student body. Now, the consequence of that - coming back to the question about mobility - is you can't, in a mechanical sense, contribute a lot to upward mobility if you don't have a lot of low-income kids to begin with, right? Harvard, mechanically, cannot be helping a lot of low-income kids climb the income ladder because there aren't that many low-income kids at Harvard, Stanford, Princeton, Yale, et cetera to begin with. In contrast, if you look at a set of mid-tier public schools - think of places like the City University of New York or California state colleges - we find that these colleges, in an accounting (ph) sense, actually have the highest rates of socio-economic mobility. And as a result, if you ask how many kids are starting out in a poor family and moving up the income distribution, it's these mid-tier public schools where you see a lot of that happening. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: We began this conversation, Raj, by talking about your own life. And I actually want to end the conversation by going back to your own life, as well, because I think your own life story, in some ways, is very instructive about many of the ideas we've talked about today. You know, as I was preparing for the interview and I was reading up some things about your life, I remembered a story about the philosopher Bertrand Russell. He grew up in a family of writers, and he assumed when he was a kid that everyone wrote books. At one point, Russell meets someone. And if I'm remembering the story correctly, I think it's a gardener. And he's astonished to find the man is not an author. And I thought of that story when I heard that as prolific as you are, you were the last person in your family to get an academic paper published. Is that actually true? CHETTY: Yes, that is actually true. And I actually think I remember my father telling me the story about Bertrand Russell when I was a kid. So I come from a family of academics. I have two older sisters, both of whom are researchers, as well. And so I was the last one in my family to get a Ph. D. and publish a paper. And so it was definitely in the air, in the water, so to speak, around me. And as I've talked about, through various examples empirically, I think exposure, environment plays a huge role. And I absolutely see that in the work that I'm doing. VEDANTAM: And I think that is the deeper truth to the story - your own life story but also the work that you've been doing. You know, when we think about excellence, we think of, you know, Raj Chetty, MacArthur genius. We imagine the lonely climber on top of the mountain. But in reality, the story you're painting is much closer, you know, to the ideal - you know, Isaac Newton's ideal - if I've seen further, it's because I stand on the shoulders of giants. CHETTY: That's absolutely right. And I think, Shankar, that was made most evident to me, actually, in thinking about my extended family, where I see, you know, the many different experiences that we've had as a result of the environments in which we grew up. So in particular, as you might know, in Indian families, growing up - especially in villages in poverty, families often chose one child to educate. And so it so happened to be, in my father's family, he was the one who ended up getting higher education, ended up coming to the United States to University of Wisconsin-Madison to get a Ph. D. And my mom was one of the first women to become a doctor in our community in South India - again, the only person in her family to get a higher education. And what I've seen is how those decisions have manifested themselves through the generations in our family. So my cousins, many of whom actually have the same name as me - Raj, you know, named after my maternal grandfather - while they all are happy in their own ways and are leading fulfilling lives, the opportunities they've had have been dramatically different, with one of them living in Singapore to support his family in India and, you know, not able to be with his kids as they're growing up, another in - working in kind of a, you know, difficult job in New York City in kind of a manual-labor sort of position. And so again, I think the opportunities I've had - exactly as you said - are entirely a function of the environment that I happen to have been lucky to grow up in - and, you know, I think more broadly, have been studying how to replicate those opportunities for others. VEDANTAM: Raj Chetty is an economist at Harvard University. Raj, thank you for joining me today on HIDDEN BRAIN. CHETTY: My pleasure. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This week's episode was produced by Rhaina Cohen and edited by Tara Boyle and Camila Vargas Restrepo. Our team includes Jenny Schmidt, Parth Shah, Thomas Lu and Laura Kwerel. Special thanks to Katelyn Harrop (ph), who recorded the kindergarten class you heard at the top of the show. Raj mentioned a tool that tracks economic mobility neighborhood by neighborhood. You can put in your address at opportnityatlas. org. Once again, that's opportunityatlasorg. Our unsung hero this week is principal Ryan Junge at Keystone Elementary School in Iowa. When we were trying to figure out which kindergarten classroom we wanted to visit, we looked for a school in a part of the country that has one of the best records of upward mobility. That's how we found Keystone Elementary in a rural part of eastern Iowa. Principal Junge allowed us to hang out in one of his kindergarten classrooms. Now, it takes a lot to run a school. And having an audio producer running about isn't high on your list of priorities. But he got on board very quickly and figured out a way to make it possible. We are grateful.

MIKE CALHOUN: We projected over 2 million subprime mortgage foreclosures, and the response was we were ridiculed by the industry. CORNISH: As we know now, Calhoun was right. The wave of foreclosures was even bigger than he predicted, and it drove the economy into the Great Recession. These days, Calhoun is warning about student loans, and he sees a lot of parallels. NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Mike Calhoun is a man on a mission. He's flying around the country, warning state lawmakers and prosecutors, sharing his worries at conferences and with members of Congress. He's saying, just like with the housing crisis, student loans are given out without considering whether the borrower will be able to pay the money back. CALHOUN: Once again, it's the mismatch between the debt and the borrower's income, their ability to repay. ARNOLD: Calhoun's the president of the nonprofit Center for Responsible Lending, and he says the amount of money that people owe on student loans is growing very fast. CALHOUN: Absolutely explosive growth in the amount of student debt. In about a dozen years, it's gone from $300 billion to now $1. 6 trillion. ARNOLD: This time around, it's the government making the vast majority of the loans. That's effectively turned the Education Department into the largest consumer lending bank in the country. And, Calhoun says, more and more people can't pay. CALHOUN: Already in the student loan world, we are seeing default levels that approach what there was in the subprime mortgage world. ARNOLD: Wearing a no-nonsense blue blazer with his gray mustache and spectacles, Calhoun could pass for a banker himself. But for decades, he has actually been keeping watch over the banks. In his office in Washington, Calhoun pulls up a slide at his computer monitor and shows me another parallel. In the subprime mortgage mess, minority groups were hit the hardest. And now. . . CALHOUN: As we sit here and talk today, over a fifth of black college graduates are in default on their student loans because of the amount of debt they took on and the fact that they typically still earn less in the job market. ARNOLD: Still, some people say talk of a student loan crisis is overblown. Mike McPherson is an economist and former college president who studies higher ed financing. MIKE MCPHERSON: I think of a crisis as being a situation which is getting rapidly worse. ARNOLD: And he says, actually, that's not what's happening with student loans. He says the total amount borrowed in new loans each year has been declining since the peak in 2010. And he says most people with a college or advanced degree, of course, are much better off financially, even if they have student loans. Also. . . MCPHERSON: A lot of people borrow a small amount of money, so a third of all the people owe less than $10,000. ARNOLD: Calhoun acknowledges that this time around, this is a different kind of lending debacle. It's not going to implode the banking system. But he says there are so many people now with student loans, and many owe a lot more money and are running into serious problems. CALHOUN: The student loan crisis will affect tens of millions of families. ARNOLD: Calhoun says their credit scores are getting messed up or they're missing out on homeownership because they can't qualify for a mortgage. And this albatross of debt hanging around the necks of so many Americans is now a central issue in the presidential election. So where is all this headed? CALHOUN: Hopefully, it ends in a couple ways - that for some borrowers, you will need to write down some part of what they owe. They simply don't have the capacity to repay that based upon their earning capacity. ARNOLD: And Calhoun says the government needs to fix existing programs that could help millions of people. One in particular has promised to forgive large amounts of student loan debt for public service workers, like police and teachers, but it's been badly mismanaged. Also, many people don't get enrolled in repayment plans that could make their loans affordable. Calhoun says until such problems get fixed, it may not wreck the economy, but it will be a drag on it.

Paul Volcker served as Federal Reserve chairman to Presidents Carter and Reagan and later as an adviser to President Obama. Volcker was perhaps the closest thing to a rock star economist as this country has ever seen. NPR's Yuki Noguchi has this remembrance. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Paul Volcker was a man of stature - literally. He stood over 6-foot-7 and towered over all the presidents he served under. His looming presence included a booming voice. Robert Kavesh, a longtime professor at New York University, befriended Volcker in 1949. ROBERT KAVESH: The economic hero of post-World War II America - I would have to say that the biggest hero was Paul Volcker, and that's saying something. NOGUCHI: Paul Volcker's biggest leadership moment came shortly after President Carter appointed him chairman of the Fed in 1979. The U. S. economy was in crisis. Stagflation, a highly unusual combination of both high inflation and low growth, gripped the nation. To address spiraling inflation, Volcker dramatically constricted the nation's money supply and let interests rise, which they did. The interest rates on a conventional mortgage soared to 17. 5%. Within two years, his plan worked. But it's hard to overstate how much the public reviled Volcker at the time. Unemployment increased, and Volcker was blamed for plunging the country into recession deliberately. Friends say Volcker privately worried about the impact of his policies, yet never wavered in his convictions. Here he is at a Senate Banking Committee hearing in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PAUL VOLCKER: Ultimately, the only way that interest rates are going to be brought down and stay down over a period of time is to get the inflation rate down. NOGUCHI: Paul Volcker was born in Cape May, N. J. , and grew up in Teaneck, a well-off community where his father was city manager. Volcker believed that times of crisis give leaders more freedom to enact change. Here he was in a 1992 interview with NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)P VOLCKER: Well, when you've been in government and public life a long time, you begin realizing there's something to the comment that many people make that it takes a crisis to move the United States government, and other governments aren't all that different. NOGUCHI: As the recession deepened in the early 1980s, Volcker received death threats, so he had Secret Service protection. His son, James Volcker, reflected on that time. JAMES VOLCKER: We read the papers at the time, and we knew that what he was doing and trying to do was not popular, obviously. And it - I think the entire family knew that this was one of the things that comes with public service. NOGUCHI: Paul Volcker went back to Wall Street, then later came back to Washington as an adviser to President Obama during the Great Recession and during a time of great anger against big banks. The Volcker Rule, as it became known, eventually passed, restricting certain trades made by banks. If Volcker was the nation's most powerful moneyman for a number of years, his lifestyle was one that spoke of neither wealth nor power. As chairman of the Fed, he lived in a tiny Washington apartment. He wore flimsy suits and smoked cheap cigars. His son says one of his greatest pleasures was making Thanksgiving dinner every year. In a 1982 People Magazine profile, his late wife Barbara joked that his government job as chairman of the Fed could no longer afford them nights out. Broadway tickets for two, at $20 apiece, were not in the budget. She took a bookkeeping job to make ends meet. When it came to household purchases, James Volcker recalls his father's bouts with buyer's remorse. J VOLCKER: He agonized for a month after they bought the sofa that he could have gotten a better deal on another sofa, and it kind of drove my mom crazy, in a way. And she told me more than once, when you grow up, don't be a Volcker. NOGUCHI: It was only after his 60th birthday that Volcker took his first big Wall Street salary. Volcker left public life for some time to care for his wife of four decades, Barbara Volcker, who suffered from diabetes. She died in 1998.

His public service spanned six decades, including some difficult economic times. In the 1980s, he was chairman of the Federal Reserve. He died yesterday at the age of 92, and NPR's Yuki Noguchi has this remembrance. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Paul Volcker was best known for his leadership in times of crisis and for taking unpopular stands that later proved him right. First, in the early 1980s, as chair of the Fed, Volcker thought rising inflation.

Volcker received death threats, but stood firm. Jeffrey Bergstrand was an economist with the Fed at the time. JEFFREY BERGSTRAND: It took an immense amount of courage to stay the course to raise interest rates, knowing really in the back of his mind this has got to cause a recession. NOGUCHI: Within a few years, Volcker's plan worked. Inflation fell. And in the process, Bergstrand says, Volcker and the Fed became known for their independence and for taking tough-but-necessary stands, a legacy that endures today. Volcker had a towering persona, quite literally, standing tall at 6-foot-7. But for a man who devoted so much of his time thinking about money, he led a famously modest life.

NOGUCHI: Raskin followed him into the field. She hoped to emulate his understanding of how economic policies affect real life. Later, Raskin worked with Volcker during the financial crisis. During that time and following the Great Recession, Volcker proposed restricting certain risky trades to make the banking system safer, something now known as the Volcker Rule. BLOOM RASKIN: And it was not popular. And again, it would take somebody like Paul Volcker to put it forward. NOGUCHI: Paul Volcker is survived by his second wife and two children. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  For an economic rock star, there was nothing flashy about Paul Volcker. His public service spanned six decades, including some difficult economic times. In the 1980s, he was chairman of the Federal Reserve. He died yesterday at the age of 92, and NPR's Yuki Noguchi has this remembrance. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Paul Volcker was best known for his leadership in times of crisis and for taking unpopular stands that later proved him right. First, in the early 1980s, as chair of the Fed, Volcker thought rising inflation. He took the unprecedented step of jacking up interest rates as high as 20%, a move that put houses and cars out of reach for many. This made him profoundly unpopular. Volcker received death threats, but stood firm. Jeffrey Bergstrand was an economist with the Fed at the time.

The two countries confirmed yesterday they'll sign what they're calling the first phase of an agreement that addresses some of the trade frictions between them. NPR's Jim Zarroli has more. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: The Trump administration was set to raise tariffs on more Chinese imports this Sunday. Now that won't happen. In the new deal, the administration says China has agreed to buy some $200 billion in additional goods and services from the United States over two years, including $50 billion in farm products. Economist Mary Lovely of Syracuse University says the agreement should bring a truce in the bitter trade war between the two countries. MARY LOVELY: We basically, in some sense, stopped slapping ourselves, stopped slapping them. I think that's good. I'm happy to see it. ZARROLI: But there are still a lot of questions about the agreement. U. S. officials say China has promised to address some of the long-standing issues between them, such as forced technology transfers and the theft of U. S. intellectual property by Chinese companies. China has made such promises before without much follow through, and because neither country released the text of yesterday's agreement it's hard to say whether this time will be any different. Again, Mary Lovely. LOVELY: Here, the devil is very much in the details, and we don't have the details. ZARROLI: Some Democrats were quick to criticize the deal. Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer of New York says the administration has quote, \"sold out for a temporary and unreliable promise from China to purchase some soybeans,\" unquote. But administration officials pointed out that the U. S. was reducing tariffs, not eliminating them, and could easily reinstate them if China doesn't come through.

But White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow insisted to Fox News it was all worth it.

Boeing is this country's most important industrial company, so important that the decision to stop making the plane is expected to cut into U. S. economic growth on the whole. NPR's Jim Zarroli has the story. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: In October, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg appeared before a congressional committee to apologize for the 737 Max crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people. And he said government officials should keep the plane on the ground as long as necessary. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DENNIS MUILENBURG: Regulators around the world should rigorously scrutinize the Max and only approve its return to flight when they are completely satisfied with its safety. ZARROLI: And that's what regulators around the world have done, refusing to say when the 737 Max will fly again. Throughout this crisis, Boeing has continued to build the planes and parked them in giant facilities in Texas and Washington state. Now it's shutting down production. Boeing is just one company, but it's an enormously important one. It's the biggest U. S. exporter. And the 737 Max is by far its biggest selling plane, says Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics. GREGORY DACO: Boeing is a big company, and the 737 is the largest share of its production of aircraft. About 80% of the planes produced by Boeing are the 737s. ZARROLI: Daco says because of the decision to stop making the plane, U. S. economic growth will tumble over the next few months at an annual rate of half a percentage point. It's a view shared by other economists. The impact will be so great because Boeing has tentacles throughout the manufacturing sector, says aviation consultant Ross Aimer. ROSS AIMER: There are hundreds of subcontractors whom supply engines and other parts to Boeing. They're going to be affected. ZARROLI: That includes big companies like General Electric, which makes engines for the 737, and Spirit Aviation Services, which makes assorted aircraft parts. They and many smaller companies will now have to decide how long they can afford to keep their factories open and their workers working. As for Boeing, it says it won't lay off anyone. With the job market so tight, the company is reluctant to see skilled workers walk out the door. But the company has lost billions of dollars since the plane was grounded. And Gregory Daco says it could be forced to cut jobs as the months drag on. DACO: Some of these employees will be geared towards other parts of Boeing's production chain. But that being said, I wouldn't be surprised that as we move into 2020, there will be some layoffs announced. ZARROLI: Daco says that could lead to the loss of thousands of jobs next year alone. None of this includes the potential impact on Boeing's customers, the airlines. Both domestic and foreign carriers have had to reduce flights in recent months because they haven't been able to fly their 737 Maxs, and that's cut into the money they make. One of the worst hit has been Southwest, which operates more of the plane than any other carrier. Yesterday, Southwest said it would have to cancel more flights, at least through April.

It was supposed to be a gift-wrapped present for taxpayers and the economy, but in hindsight, it looks more like a budget-busting lump of coal. A Gallup poll this year showed that more than four out of 10 Americans aren't even sure if the tax cut saved them money. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The tax cut passed on a party line vote two years ago is these signature legislative accomplishment of President Trump's first term. Trump campaigned hard for the measure, telling supporters a vote to cut taxes is a vote to put America first. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our focus is on helping the folks who work in the mailrooms and the machine shops of America - the plumbers, the carpenters, the cops, the teachers, the truck drivers, the pipefitters, the people that like me best. HORSLEY: In fact, more than 60% of the tax savings went to people in the top 20% of the income ladder. Corporations also won big. Their tax rate was slashed by 40%. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: And it will be rocket fuel for our economy. HORSLEY: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin insisted the economy would grow so fast after the tax cut, it would more than make up for the revenue lost to lower rates. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)STEVEN MNUCHIN: The tax plan will pay for itself with economic growth. HORSLEY: It hasn't worked out that way. MAYA MACGUINEAS: It was unbelievable at the time, and it's proven to be absolutely untrue. The tax cuts were never going to, and have not, come anywhere close to paying for themselves. HORSLEY: Maya Macguineas of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget notes that tax revenues as a share of the economy fell in each of the two years since the tax cut took effect. MACGUINEAS: Not surprising - if you cut taxes, you get less than revenue. And what we've been doing at the same time is we've been increasing spending, and - no surprise - our deficit has exploded. HORSLEY: The deficit this year was nearly a trillion dollars, a level of red ink usually seen only when the government's fighting a recession or a widespread war. But at least the economy got a permanent boost from the tax cut, right? Here's what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell promised when the cut was passed. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MITCH MCCONNELL: After eight straight years of slow growth and underperformance, America is ready to take off. HORSLEY: In fact, GDP growth last year was exactly the same as in 2015. Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics says the tax cut did provide a short-term boost to the economy, but the rocket fuel burned off quickly. GREGORY DACO: There was an acceleration in terms of momentum for business investment, but it was rather short-lived. And a year further down the road, we're really not seeing much of any leftover of this fiscal stimulus package. HORSLEY: To be sure, the stock market is booming, and unemployment is at near-record lows. But the tax cut has not delivered the sustained bounce in economic growth that was promised. Hamstrung in part by the president's trade war, the economy is projected to grow only about 2% this coming year, slightly below the average growth rate since 2010. While most Americans give the economy high marks, that doesn't extend to the tax cut. A Gallup poll last tax season found just 40% of Americans approve of the cut, while 49% disapprove. Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon says the cut has become a political liability for the GOP. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RON WYDEN: The people who are celebrating are the high-fliers, corporate executives. But if you work for a living, this sure looks like a con job. HORSLEY: Now, most workers did enjoy some tax savings from the cut, but since it was spread throughout the year, that increase in take-home pay was invisible to many people. Just 14% of those surveyed by Gallup believe their taxes went down. Perhaps it's an acknowledgement of that sentiment that the president is now talking about another round of tax cuts after the 2020 election, a kind of make-up for some of those same workers in mailrooms and machine shops. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: We're going to be doing a major middle-income tax cut if we take back the House. HORSLEY: Trump made similar promises before last year's midterm election, but that follow-up to his 2017 tax cut never materialized. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington.

SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The tax cut passed on a party line vote two years ago is these signature legislative accomplishment of President Trump's first term. Trump campaigned hard for the measure, telling supporters a vote to cut taxes is a vote to put America first. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our focus is on helping the folks who work in the mailrooms and the machine shops of America - the plumbers, the carpenters, the cops, the teachers, the truck drivers, the pipefitters, the people that like me best. HORSLEY: In fact, more than 60% of the tax savings went to people in the top 20% of the income ladder. Corporations also won big. Their tax rate was slashed by 40%. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: And it will be rocket fuel for our economy. HORSLEY: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin insisted the economy would grow so fast after the tax cut, it would more than make up for the revenue lost to lower rates. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEVEN MNUCHIN: The tax plan will pay for itself with economic growth. HORSLEY: It hasn't worked out that way. MAYA MACGUINEAS: It was unbelievable at the time, and it's proven to be absolutely untrue. The tax cuts were never going to, and have not, come anywhere close to paying for themselves. HORSLEY: Maya Macguineas of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget notes that tax revenues as a share of the economy fell in each of the two years since the tax cut took effect. MACGUINEAS: Not surprising - if you cut taxes, you get less than revenue. And what we've been doing at the same time is we've been increasing spending, and - no surprise - our deficit has exploded. HORSLEY: The deficit this year was nearly a trillion dollars, a level of red ink usually seen only when the government's fighting a recession or a widespread war. But at least the economy got a permanent boost from the tax cut, right? Here's what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell promised when the cut was passed. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MITCH MCCONNELL: After eight straight years of slow growth and underperformance, America is ready to take off. HORSLEY: In fact, GDP growth last year was exactly the same as in 2015. Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics says the tax cut did provide a short-term boost to the economy, but the rocket fuel burned off quickly. GREGORY DACO: There was an acceleration in terms of momentum for business investment, but it was rather short-lived. And a year further down the road, we're really not seeing much of any leftover of this fiscal stimulus package. HORSLEY: To be sure, the stock market is booming, and unemployment is at near-record lows. But the tax cut has not delivered the sustained bounce in economic growth that was promised. Hamstrung in part by the president's trade war, the economy is projected to grow only about 2% this coming year, slightly below the average growth rate since 2010. While most Americans give the economy high marks, that doesn't extend to the tax cut. A Gallup poll last tax season found just 40% of Americans approve of the cut, while 49% disapprove. Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon says the cut has become a political liability for the GOP. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RON WYDEN: The people who are celebrating are the high-fliers, corporate executives. But if you work for a living, this sure looks like a con job. HORSLEY: Now, most workers did enjoy some tax savings from the cut, but since it was spread throughout the year, that increase in take-home pay was invisible to many people. Just 14% of those surveyed by Gallup believe their taxes went down. Perhaps it's an acknowledgement of that sentiment that the president is now talking about another round of tax cuts after the 2020 election, a kind of make-up for some of those same workers in mailrooms and machine shops. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: We're going to be doing a major middle-income tax cut if we take back the House. HORSLEY: Trump made similar promises before last year's midterm election, but that follow-up to his 2017 tax cut never materialized.

Many small farmers face rising debts and gut-wrenching decisions of whether to close businesses they've owned for generations. Stacey Vanek Smith reports for NPR's The Indicator from Planet Money. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE: 2019 was a hard year for farmers. Small farms have been hit incredibly hard by a combination of the trade war with China, extreme weather and an increasingly competitive and global industry. The government has stepped in with subsidies for some farmers. But in spite of that, the debt level of American farmers is at an all-time high, and the number of farmers who are delinquent on their loans is on the rise. Alana Semuels is an economics correspondent for Time magazine. She wrote a story recently about what's happening to the rural economy and to farming right now. ALANA SEMUELS: Think about the 2000s. People tell me that was kind of the golden age of modern farming in that commodity prices were going up. It was kind of this boom time. And then in 2013, they basically ended. Commodity prices went down. Two big reasons - one, farms are getting a lot more efficient every year. You can produce a lot more on the same land, and a lot more farms entered the kind of global marketplace. VANEK SMITH: Yeah. I mean - and you talk about the debt level for farmers. SEMUELS: Yeah. So right now, it's at an all-time high, which - I think it's at $416 billion. It was up really high in the '80s. A lot of people lost their farms. We're not seeing prices go up. So how are they going to pay that debt off? VANEK SMITH: In her story, Alana visited a particularly hard-hit area in Wisconsin, a town called Fremont, where she met with the Rieckmann family. I called Mary Rieckmann to ask her about her farm. MARY RIECKMANN: We have a small dairy farm. My husband is a fourth generation on this farm. I've been on here 60 years. VANEK SMITH: I imagine you've seen all kinds of cycles. The price of milk goes up and down. RIECKMANN: Oh, yeah. VANEK SMITH: What's the price right now? RIECKMANN: Right now, it's 18 something for 100 pounds of milk. VANEK SMITH: Enough to make a profit? RIECKMANN: No - maybe for the great big farmers but not for the small farmers. And, you know, it keeps on adding up and adding up, and it's just like, oh, my gosh. VANEK SMITH: Is part of this, like, some of the trade war stuff or no? RIECKMANN: Yes, it is. And other countries used to buy. VANEK SMITH: So now they're not buying it. RIECKMANN: No, they're not. VANEK SMITH: So prices have gone. . . RIECKMANN: Down the tubes (laughter). We're just going to keep on struggling and struggling until there is nothing left to struggle for anymore because this is our home. VANEK SMITH: How do you kind of get through moments like this? RIECKMANN: Well, you skimp and you scrape wherever you can make a penny mean a little bit. I mean, we don't do Christmas gifts or anything for the last three years. What we do on Christmas Eve is we all get together as a family, just visit and have a lunch together. Yeah, well, that's as much as what we can do. VANEK SMITH: Time magazine's Alana Semuels says the decline of small farms like the Rieckmann's is killing rural communities as businesses close and tax revenues decline. And Alana says, perhaps more seriously, the lack of diversity in production could also threaten our food supply. Stacey Vanek Smith, NPR News.

That system has been in place since 1995, and it's governed by the World Trade Organization. The Trump administration, though, has taken aim at the WTO. The president argues that he can get a better deal for Americans negotiating on his own. CHAD BOWN: This was what President Trump campaigned on. It was very clear that President Trump had his eyes set on destroying the WTO or severely weakening the WTO. GREENE: That's Chad Bown. He is an economist with the Peterson Institute for International Economics. He's also a veteran of the Obama administration. Now, President Trump has undermined the WTO in a few ways. Recently, he announced two major trade deals outside the WTO. His administration has also refused to approve judges to help settle disputes between countries. Chad Bown says this is not necessarily good for the U. S. BOWN: I think there is a number of different ways in which the United States is actually much, much weaker without a WTO out there. The first is, yes, we can do what we want unilaterally against other countries in certain instances, but they can basically then do the same thing to us as well. And the second is the way that the WTO works is it actually serves to help police and regulate the behavior of all these other countries in the world and how they're behaving toward each other. So the United States doesn't actually have to be a policeman or woman, you know, regulating trade between all the Japans and the Koreas out there of the world as well. And we're starting to see those types of countries and those types of fights crop up. And, yes, that, in and of itself, is going to have blowback against the United States. When two other countries start fighting between themselves, that makes it more challenging for everybody, makes it more difficult economically. So I think destroying the WTO is actually going to be very bad for the United States but probably in a number of unanticipated ways and with unintended consequences. GREENE: What, in your mind, is largely at stake here if the WTO is truly in a moment of crisis? BOWN: To me, the big question is what comes next and what system replaces it. So the WTO and its predecessor, this thing called the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, have basically established the rules-based trading system since the end of the Second World War. And it's been a very effective way of keeping the peace, for the most part, in trade relations until, essentially, President Trump came along. We've never seen a trade war in the scale of the U. S. -China conflict, for example, over the last 70 years during this period. And if we're going to get rid of this thing called the WTO, what is it that's going to replace it? That, I think, is the really, really big unknown. The United States doesn't have the power, I don't think, economically that we had back in the 1940s when we created this existing system, or in 1995 when we established the WTO itself. We're in a new state of the world. What comes next? GREENE: What if nothing comes next? What if the WTO goes away and there's nothing to replace it? BOWN: If the WTO goes away, I think then we are very much in kind of the law of the jungle. And, you know, I don't want to suggest that we're going to head back to the 1930s, but that was really the last period of time in which we lived in a lawless trading world where there weren't these agreements that kind of restrained governments from imposing lots of tariffs on one another. But I fear without broadly held, shared views on what the common rules that we should all abide by in international trade should be, lawlessness may be where we end up.

S. economy is heading into 2020 on a positive note. The stock market is near a record high. Unemployment is near a record low. And while trade tensions haven't been resolved completely, they have settled down for the moment. NPR's Scott Horsley recaps some of the ups and downs of the economy in 2019 and takes a look at what lies ahead next year. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: When CNN asked Americans this month how they're feeling about the economy, 3 out of 4 describe conditions as good or very good. That's the most positive rating pollsters have found since 2001. And no wonder - lots of people are working. Paychecks are growing faster than inflation. And while there were some storm clouds on the economic horizon this year, most of us didn't get soaked. I spoke to economist Sarah House at the busy office of Wells Fargo Securities. SARAH HOUSE: Confidence remains pretty darn high. So consumers still feel very good about the overall position of the economy, especially the jobs market. And that does suggest that consumer spending should remain pretty strong as we head into 2020. HORSLEY: U. S. employers added nearly 2 million jobs in the first 11 months of this year. And while that's down from the 2. 4 million in the same period last year, it's still pretty strong for the 11th year of an economic expansion. Average wages rose a little over 3% in the last year, slightly more for those at the bottom of the income ladder. And the stock market spent much of December setting new records. HOUSE: Even if a lot of consumers these days aren't directly invested in the stock market, you know, they see the headlines and see it as a good sign. HORSLEY: The market's performance looks even better because last December was so lousy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 22% for this year, but the gain would be only half that large if you count from the end of November 2018, before government shutdown and the threat of an all-out trade war triggered a stock market swoon last Christmas. This year, the government managed to keep the lights on. And economist Nariman Behravesh of IHS Markit says trade tensions with China and other countries have been turned down to a slow boil. NARIMAN BEHRAVESH: We're not out of the woods yet. And there's still a fair amount of uncertainty. Although the good news is it looks like we've sort of steped back from the precipice on a lot of these issues. HORSLEY: Still, some of the damage from the trade war has already been done. Manufacturing's been in a slump for the last four months. Factories are especially sensitive to global forces. And nervous business owners have been reluctant to invest. A year ago at this time, Federal Reserve officials thought they would be raising interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating. Instead, in an abrupt about-face, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues cut interest rates three times between July and October. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEROME POWELL: I don't think anybody saw coming the challenges that we face this year. They were a surprise. HORSLEY: Powell says he and his colleagues were forced to change course when confronted with the president's trade war and a slowdown in global growth. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)POWELL: I'm pleased that we moved to support the economy in the way that we did. I think our moves will prove appropriate. And again, I think both the economy and monetary policy right now I think are in a good place. HORSLEY: Lower interest rates have given a boost to the housing market, but there are still challenges out there. President Trump says a mini-deal with China will be signed in a couple of weeks, but most of the tariffs are still in place. And Boeing's announcement that it's temporarily halting production of the troubled 737 Max jet will put a noticeable dent in first quarter growth. Economic growth was already slowing to about 2. 3% this year and somewhat less than that next year. Still, Behravesh says the economy is not likely to grind to a halt. BEHRAVESH: It looks like we've dodged the recession. It looks like manufacturing activity may have hit a trough. We have lowered now the probability of a recession, both in the U. S. and the world, to about 20%. HORSLEY: That should give consumers the confidence they need to keep spending in the new year. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  The U. S. economy is heading into 2020 on a positive note. The stock market is near a record high. Unemployment is near a record low. And while trade tensions haven't been resolved completely, they have settled down for the moment. NPR's Scott Horsley recaps some of the ups and downs of the economy in 2019 and takes a look at what lies ahead next year. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: When CNN asked Americans this month how they're feeling about the economy, 3 out of 4 describe conditions as good or very good. That's the most positive rating pollsters have found since 2001. And no wonder - lots of people are working. Paychecks are growing faster than inflation. And while there were some storm clouds on the economic horizon this year, most of us didn't get soaked. I spoke to economist Sarah House at the busy office of Wells Fargo Securities. SARAH HOUSE: Confidence remains pretty darn high. So consumers still feel very good about the overall position of the economy, especially the jobs market. And that does suggest that consumer spending should remain pretty strong as we head into 2020. HORSLEY: U. S. employers added nearly 2 million jobs in the first 11 months of this year. And while that's down from the 2. 4 million in the same period last year, it's still pretty strong for the 11th year of an economic expansion. Average wages rose a little over 3% in the last year, slightly more for those at the bottom of the income ladder. And the stock market spent much of December setting new records. HOUSE: Even if a lot of consumers these days aren't directly invested in the stock market, you know, they see the headlines and see it as a good sign. HORSLEY: The market's performance looks even better because last December was so lousy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 22% for this year, but the gain would be only half that large if you count from the end of November 2018, before government shutdown and the threat of an all-out trade war triggered a stock market swoon last Christmas.

Other business stories came and went quickly, but some of them are worth remembering. NPR's chief economics correspondent Scott Horsley rounded a few up. Hey, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Noel. KING: So where do we start here? HORSLEY: We start on a hot summer day in Mississippi. That's where immigration officials raided more than half a dozen chicken processing plants last summer in what was described as one of the nation's largest worksite enforcement actions. Almost 700 people who were employed by companies there were arrested on suspicion of working in the country illegally. Mike Hurst is the local U. S. attorney. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE HURST: While we are a nation of immigrants, more than that, we are, first and foremost, a nation of laws. HORSLEY: And, Noel, those raids are emblematic of the Trump administration's get-tough policy towards illegal immigration. We've talked a lot about stepped-up enforcement along the border with Mexico, but since 2017, there's also been a significant increase in worksite investigations. And the Mississippi raids are one high-profile example. KING: There was also a big business story this year, Scott, that involved beef or at least a substitute beef. Tell us about that. HORSLEY: Yeah, beef substitutes were another big story. Plant-based foods that mimic beef were everywhere in 2019, including your local fast-food joint. (SOUNDBITE OF BURGER KING AD)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: One hundred percent Whopper and 0% beef. We know; it's impossible to believe - the Impossible Whopper. HORSLEY: Companies like Impossible Burger and Beyond Meat have been making a big splash with consumers who like the taste of meat but worry about the environmental costs or animal welfare. Beyond Meat had a sizzling debut in the stock market, although its shares have since fallen back to earth. Big players like Kellogg's introduced their own product. Kellogg's is called Incogmeato. KING: (Laughter). HORSLEY: And the traditional beef industry is taking this threat very seriously. They're pushing back hard against what they call fake meat. KING: Sizzling debut - I like that. Let me ask you about another stock sale. It made news because it didn't actually happen. This is the coworking company WeWork. HORSLEY: That's right. WeWork's charismatic founder, Adam Neumann, spun the story of shared office space as more than just office, but shared community. He generated a lot of buzz, made a lot of money for himself. What he didn't generate was profits. Lise Buyer of the advisory firm Class V Group says when investors took a closer look at Neumann's company this fall, they got cold feet. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)LISE BUYER: It took magic. It took a leap of faith greater than the Grand Canyon to see how that business could be profitable anytime soon. HORSLEY: Neumann was ousted as CEO. The stock sale was canceled. And even in this time of stock market exuberance, Noel, rational investors figured out WeWork was basically an office company that only thought it should be priced like a tech company. KING: Tech companies, though, also had their own problems this year, right? HORSLEY: Oh, they did. Silicon Valley has a big target on its back, and it's taking arrows from all sides. You know, Republicans have complained for years about left-leaning bias in the tech sector. Now you have Democrats, like Congresswoman Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, grilling Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg over his company's policy on political ads. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ: Do you see a potential problem here with a complete lack of fact-checking on political advertisements? MARK ZUCKERBERG: Well, Congresswoman, I think lying is bad. And I think if you were to run an ad that had a lie, that would be bad. HORSLEY: But Zuckerberg insists it's not his company's job to police that. You've also got state attorneys general investigating both Facebook and Google for possible antitrust violations. Apple and Amazon are under scrutiny, as well. You know, there's just growing concern over how these big tech companies are affecting competition, privacy, the information we all get on our phones. And look for that scrutiny to continue as we move into an election year in 2020. KING: Next - 2020, tomorrow. HORSLEY: (Laughter). KING: NPR's Scott Horsley, thanks so much. HORSLEY: You're welcome.
